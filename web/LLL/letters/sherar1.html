      <h1>Letters to LLLI</h1>
      <font size="5"><i>Circumcision and Breastfeeding</i></font> 

      <p>Dear LLLI,</p>

      <p>As the mother of two intact sons, I am aware of my bias on
      the issue of circumcision. I am careful not to discuss this
      and other "off-topic" items during LLL meetings. However, I
      would like to cite LLI sources when I am asked to provide
      information to mothers.</p>

      <p>I located a copy of L<font size="1">EAVEN</font> (<a
      href="/library/birth/leaven1/">Sept-Oct 1994, p. 78</a>)
      which indicates that we should "avoid a protracted
      discussion" of circumcision during a meeting but that we can
      mention the potential effects on breastfeeding. Although
      circumcision is discussed in the <a
      href="/library/birth/LLLI1/">1981 edition</a> of T<font
      size="1">HE</font> W<font size="1">OMANLY</font> A<font
      size="1">RT OF</font> B<font size="1">REASTFEEDING</font>,
      the section does not appear in any subsequent editions. Why?
      What other resources does LLLI have relating to circumcision?
      Do we have the <a href="/library/pain/howard/">latest
      research that addresses the effect on breastfeeding</a>? How
      can Leaders respond to questions on this issue? Does LLLI
      have a policy statement on circumcision?</p>

      <p>I am a very dedicated supporter of La Leche League
      International and have been extremely proud of my association
      with such a bold and accurate organization. Thank you for
      considering this issue.</p>
      <i>Sincerely,<br />
      Linda Frank<br />
       Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA</i>

      <p>Dear Linda,</p>

      <p>Thank you for your letter regarding infant circumcision.
      It is a topic that is of interest to many mothers&mdash;and one
      of many issues <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: The authors
      here euphemistically misuse the word <i>issue</i> to refer to
      an intentional permanent irreversible surgical injury to a
      newborn baby that causes pain, stress, and trauma to that
      baby.]</b></font> that can have an impact on the
      breastfeeding relationship.</p>

      <p>When a mother questions how anything might affect her
      ability to nurse, or might have the potential to change the
      course of her breastfeeding experience, it is logical she
      would bring it up at a meeting. The leader responds without
      giving medical advice. She is aware of the LLL resources she
      can share and how to respond to the mother in light of the
      cultural and religious perspectives that are present in an
      international organization such as LLLI. Finally, she knows
      how to facilitate the informal discussion that takes place at
      Series Meetings.</p>

      <p>Circumcision in and of itself, is not directly related to
      breastfeeding. However, like other elective surgeries, this
      procedure can effect the early days of breastfeeding. If a
      mother contacts LLL with questions, we can share general
      information from such La Leche League resources as the W<font
      size="1">OMANLY</font> A<font size="1">RT OF</font> B<font
      size="1">REASTFEEDING</font> (see "surgery") and the B<font
      size="1">REASTFEEDING</font> A<font size="1">NSWER</font>
      B<font size="1">OOK</font> which have information on how
      <i>any</i> surgical procedure can affect breastfeeding. The
      most recent LLLI publication on this subject are <i>Babies
      and Children in the Hospital</i> (No 527-24) and <i>The
      Hospitalized Nursing Baby&mdash;Meeting the Needs of Mothers,
      Babies and Families in Health Care Settings</i> (No. 388-19)
      With any question about studies related to breastfeeding, a
      Leader can check in for the Professional Liason Department.
      In addition, the <a
      href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/cbi/CBI.html">LLLI Center
      for Breastfeeding Information Database</a>, with an index of
      over 15,000 bibliographic entries, is now linked to the <a
      href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/">LLLI website</a> and can
      now be accessed by anyone wanting research information on
      breastfeeding.</p>

      <p>It would not be appropriate for the Leader to get into the
      pros and cons of an actual procedure because such a
      discussion is outside our roles as Leaders and can be
      construed as LLL endorsing or or criticizing a particular
      medical choice or procedure. Instead leaders refer mothers to
      their health care provider who can explain the possible risks
      and benefits of the procedure as well as answer questions
      relating to recovery time, pain medications and so on. We
      need to keep our focus on what we do best--sharing
      information about breastfeeding. We do that all the time
      whether the surgery is a circumcision or a tumor removal or
      broken clavicle (collarbone).</p>

      <p>The mother may have questions as to whether the separation
      such a procedure requires will interfere with establishing
      her milk supply. There can be the issue of trauma to the baby
      which may result in difficulty comforting the baby enough to
      get him to nurse. The mother may become anxious, resulting in
      problems with letdown or the baby picking up on her anxiety.
      But these are issues that may arise in many situations and
      <i>those</i> are what we as Leaders help the mother with, not
      the circumcision per se.</p>

      <p>As with so many parenting choices, there are good reasons
      to avoid sharing personal information because new mothers may
      take that as the definitive answer to their questions. In
      this situation, as with childbirth, an informed mother makes
      the best decision possible for herself and her family. These
      choices will be based on a mother's beliefs, religion, or
      customs.</p>

      <p>Although some people may not consider circumcision a
      religious issue, the fact remains that for some parents, it
      is. As a non-sectarian organization, La Leche League
      endeavors to avoid references, with or without disclaimers,
      that might make some parents feel unwelcome or uncomfortable.
      As stated in the American Academy of Pediatrics <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">Policy Statement on
      Circumcision</a>, "The percentage of male infants circumcised
      varies by geographic location, by religious affiliation, and
      to some extent by socioeconomic classification. Circumcision
      is uncommon in Asia, South America, Central America and most
      of Europe. In <a
      href="/library/statistics/Canada/">Canada</a>, 48% of infants
      are circumcised. Some groups such as followers of the Jewish
      and Islam faiths practice circumcision for religious and
      cultural reasons." Devorah Schesch-Wernick, a Leader in
      Israel writes, "Jewish circumcision is performed on the
      eighth day after birth, or later if there are medical
      complications. At this age, breastfeeding is normally well
      established. In my personal experience of breastfeeding two
      sons, and in the experience of other Israeli leaders, Jewish
      circumcision has no effect on breastfeeding."</p>

      <p>In the 1981 edition of T<font size="1">HE</font> W<font
      size="1">OMANLY</font> A<font size="1">RT OF</font> B<font
      size="1">REASTFEEDING</font> under a section called "<a
      href="/library/birth/LLLI1/">Elective Surgery for You or Your
      Baby</a>," there was mention of circumcision as well as tubal
      ligation. However, it was omitted in all subsequent editions
      because these issues were considered mixing causes. We
      consider circumcision to be outside the realm of expertise in
      La Leche League. Other organizations do a better job of
      educating parents about circumcision than LLL. (See
      references below.)</p>

      <p>Because it is not, in and of itself, a breastfeeding
      issue, LLLI does not take a position, on it nor does the
      board of directors plan to issue any sort of policy statement
      about it. We see a distinction between making published
      statements in LLLI publications distributed worldwide and
      responding to mother's concerns in the context of informal
      discussions at Series Meetings.</p>

      <p>This is an important point to bring out at Series Meetings
      if mothers voice strong opinions on the matter. There are no
      specific rules about what to say or avoid about circumcision
      at an LLL Series Meeting. It is natural that this topic might
      come up as part of a discussion about childbirth decisions
      and the early days after birth. La Leche League welcomes all
      mothers who want to breastfeed, regardless of decisions about
      circumcision&mdash;and we rely on Leaders to present material and
      facilitate discussions with this idea in their mind and
      hearts. We want parents to be able to hear our message
      without being sensitized by other issues. Each leader knows
      the sensitivities of the mothers in her group best. We rely
      on the leader to bring the discussion back to the issue of
      breastfeeding and helping the mother decide what is best for
      her family.</p>

      <p>Here are some questions that mothers might ask regarding
      circumcision and ideas about how Leaders might respond.
      Thanks to Leaders Ann Calandro, Waxhaw, North Carolina USA;
      Brandel Falk, Jerusalem, Israel; Devorah Schesch-Wernick,
      Efraim, Israel; and Karen Zeretzke, Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
      USA, for providing suggested responses.</p>
      1) <i>I feel really strongly that children should not be
      circumcised and I've brought some information with me tonight
      that think all of you should be aware of regarding this
      issue.</i><br />
      [Name], it's evident that this issue is very important to
      you. Since LLL has no policy on circumcision&mdash;we focus only
      on breastfeeding&mdash;perhaps those who would be interested in
      your information could see you after the meeting?<br />
       2) <i>Why doesn't LLL have more information on circumcision?
      When I look in</i> T<font size="1">HE</font> W<font
      size="1">OMANLY</font> A<font size="1">RT OF</font> B<font
      size="1">REASTFEEDING</font><i>, there isn't anything
      mentioned on this topic.</i><br />
       Because La Leche League focuses solely on breastfeeding,
      there are many issues on which there is little or no LLL
      information. There are organizations whose function it is to
      educate parents about circumcision.<br />
       3) <i>You are worried about offending mothers who choose to
      circumcise? Well, this is one mother who chose not to
      circumcise who is deeply offended! My fourth baby and I
      stopped attending meeting and I do not promote LLL the way I
      used to. Now you'll have to worrying about the women you are
      offending by your silence on this matter.</i><br />
       I am very sorry that you feel LLL let you down over the
      circumcision issue. We are a single purpose organization
      whose focus is on breastfeeding and don't feel that it is
      prudent for LLLI to take a position on this matter!<br />
      4) <i>What advice can you give me&mdash;we are planning to
      circumcise my son and I want to know how to minimize its
      effect on him?</i><br />
      The majority of babies are <a
      href="/library/birth/emde/">sleepy at least twenty-four hours
      after birth</a>. If they are already sleepy, and have not
      nursed well or often, <b>the circumcision being performed
      early in the hospitalization may cause <a
      href="/library/pain/howard/">breastfeeding problems</a></b>.
      As a mother and a patient, it is your choice to ask the
      physician to wait until the last hospital day to perform the
      surgery, or to ask that it be done later.<br />
       Also you may request that the baby be brought back to you
      immediately if there is no prolonged bleeding. He will feel
      safer and more comforted in your arms and at your breast than
      he would in a hospital nursery. You can assure the nurses
      that you will check his bandage frequently and <font
      color="red">let them know if you see bright red
      bleeding</font>. If you feel your baby is in pain, ask about
      <a href="/library/pain/howard/">pain medication</a> in the
      early hours after surgery.<br />
       5) <i>Who can you recommend to me? I need to find a doctor
      to perform my son's circumcision and want to find one who is
      supportive of breastfeeding.</i><br />
       This would fall into the same category as recommending a
      doctor for any reason, which LLL does not do.<br />
      &nbsp; 6) <i>I do not want my son circumcised and my husband
      does. My husband and all of his male family are circumcised.
      They insist that our son also be circumcised, but I do not
      want to give in to their pressure tactics. I just cannot do
      this to my precious baby. This is causing me a lot of stress.
      I'm wondering if other mothers have run into this and how
      they dealt with it?</i><br />
       Communications is the best tool to resolve differences. When
      strong opinions don't agree, sometimes a good place to begin
      is by reviewing what you both have in common: love for your
      son and desire to make a decision you both can
      tolerate!<br />
       You might also inquire on what basis the decision was made
      to circumcise those who are circumcised in your husband's
      family and discuss together if those reasons are still
      valid.<br />
      7) <i>My son was circumcised yesterday and now I cannot get
      him to nurse. Things were going just fine before this was
      done. What do I do to get him to take the breast?</i><br />
       It sounds as though your baby is <a
      href="/library/pain/howard/">hurting</a>. You might want to
      talk to your son's health care provider about pain relief
      while he is healing. Has he fed at all? It is very important
      that newborns are fed frequently and that you are maintaining
      your milk supply by hand expressing or pumping. Some mothers
      find that they can feed their babies who are unwilling to
      nurse their own expressed milk by using a cup or a spoon. You
      could spend lots of time snuggling with your baby up against
      your bare breast, reminding him what he is missing. Once his
      discomfort decreases, it is likely that he will again
      breastfeed well.<br />
       8) <i>Our son was not circumcised at birth, but now--at age
      four--his foreskin has still not retracted fully. He has not
      had an infection, but he does get sore occasionally. Our
      pediatrician say he will eventually get an infection, and
      then the surgery will be even harder on him. Is it really
      necessary to put him through this now?</i><br />
       La Leche League Leaders are trained and qualified
      breastfeeding counselors. This question is beyond the scope
      of the expertise of a Leader. If you are uncomfortable with
      information you have received from a medical practitioner,
      you may wish to suggest getting a second opinion.
