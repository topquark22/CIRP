        <h2>Protection of Infant Boys from Wrongful Circumcision in
        American Hospitals</h2>

        <p><b>Introduction.</b> Parents should carefully consider
        the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of both
        non-circumcision and circumcision for their son well before
        the due date. The <a
        href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
        Pediatrics</a> clearly states that circumcision is an
        elective non-essential procedure, which means it is neither
        necessary nor desirable for your son's health. Parents will
        be given little time at the hospital to make up their minds
        on a complex matter that will affect their son for all of
        his life. This file is addressed to the needs of parents
        who do not wish the surgical procedure of circumcision
        performed on their son.</p>

        <p>There are many and persistent reports of boys being
        circumcised in hospitals in the United States against their
        parents' wishes.</p>

        <p>For about 30 years <i>informed consent</i> by a parent
        has been required by law before a circumcision can be
        legally performed in most jurisdictions. A circumcision
        cannot lawfully be performed in most jurisdictions unless a
        consent form is executed by one of the parents. Performance
        of circumcision without a signed <a
        href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/">informed consent</a>
        is a <i>wrongful circumcision</i>. This is a tort for which
        money damages may be collected. For example, a jury in
        Montgomery, Alabama awarded $65,000 in money damages to a
        boy who was wrongfully circumcised. <a
        href="/library/legal/USA/llewellyn/">Click here
        for&nbsp;more legal information</a></p>
        It is almost certain you will be presented with such an
        informed consent form upon arrival at the hospital. It is
        not necessary to sign this form to be admitted to the
        hospital. 

        <p>Some unenlightened hospitals still regard circumcision
        as a routine procedure. In such a hospital, management and
        staff assume that a newborn boy will be circumcised. Such
        hospitals tend to put newborn boys on a circumcision
        assembly line automatically.</p>

        <p>Some other hospitals regard neonatal circumcision as a
        "profit center" and do everything possible to push parents
        into a circumcision. A 1995 study shows that the hospital
        stay for mother and baby is about six hours longer on
        average when the baby is to circumcised. This runs up
        hospital charges and results in more profit for the
        hospital. This study estimated additional charges of about
        234 to 527 million dollars per year from the longer stay in
        hospital and that was only for the United States. This is
        in addition to the estimated 200 to 250 million dollars per
        year in doctor's fees. Many hospitals still want their
        share of this bonanza. <a
        href="/library/procedure/mansfield/">Click here for more
        information</a>.</p>

        <p>Obstetricians usually get from $75 to as much as $400
        for a&nbsp;circumcision. Some are understandably eager to
        do as many circumcisions as possible regardless of the
        injurious effect. A busy OB can easily make the payments on
        his BMW with circumcisions. <a
        href="/library/procedure/garry/">Click here for more
        information on doctor's fees</a>.</p>

        <p>Typically, all neonate males are put on the uniquely
        American assembly line for circumcision. Your son
        inadvertently may wind up on the same circumcision assembly
        line unless you take extraordinary measures to protect
        him.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, extraordinary measures are sometimes
        necessary to protect an infant boy in hospital from
        unwanted and unnecessary circumcision by neglect,
        carelessness, greed, and/or malicious intent and to
        guarantee that your baby boy emerges from the hospital
        intact and uninjured. You will not truly know what sort of
        institution you have selected until after your birth
        experience is behind you.</p>

        <p>A number of means have been devised to accomplish this
        end. This file will discuss the various options available
        to parents to protect their newborn son from unwanted
        circumcision. If you take these precautions it is extremely
        unlikely that your son will suffer a wrongful circumcision.
        Moreover, a paper trail will be in place that would be
        beneficial to your case should a wrongful circumcision
        occur in spite of all precautions, and you elect to bring a
        suit on behalf of your son.</p>

        <p><b>Protective Tactics.</b> Parents who do not want their
        infant son subjected to unnecessary and unwanted
        circumcision should make plans well in advance of the
        delivery date to provide for his protection while in the
        hospital.</p>

        <p>Consider home birth with the assistance of a midwife. At
        home you will be in control of the situation and no
        circumcision will occur. Home birth is not an option for
        everyone and so many will elect to go to a hospital.</p>

        <p>If you elect to give birth in hospital, write a
        certified letter - return receipt requested to the
        attending obstetrician. Inform him/her of your opposition
        to circumcision, that you do not desire to have your son
        circumcised. Furthermore, inform him/her of your intention
        to bring legal action if your son should be wrongfully
        circumcised for damages resulting from the wrongful
        circumcision. Wrongful circumcision is a tort for which
        damages may be recovered. It is an act of battery with
        intent to maim since it disfigures the appearance of the
        body. A <a
        href="/pages/parents/protection/doclet.html">sample
        letter</a> has been prepared for your guidance.</p>

        <p>Write a similar letter to the hospital. Inform the
        hospital of your expected delivery date. Again, a <a
        href="/pages/parents/protection/hoslet.html">sample
        letter</a> has been prepared for your guidance.</p>

        <p>Purchase a set of NOCIRC T-shirts in newborn size for
        your son to wear in hospital. This should inform all
        hospital personnel of your desires. NOCIRC T-shirts are
        available from <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/2pam.pdf">NOCIRC</a>,
        P. O. Box 2512, San Anselmo, CA 94979-2512, USA; Fax:
        415-488-9660; Telephone: 415-488-9883.</p>

        <p>Take Post-its&reg; to the hospital, write NOCIRC on them
        and stick a few on your son's crib.</p>

        <p><b>Circumcision Consent Forms.</b> Circumcision consent
        forms are usually included with the admission forms. These
        forms are signed when the mother arrives at the hospital
        with labor contractions. Understandably, she is less likely
        to read each form carefully and may sign whatever is put in
        front of her. Mothers who are opposed to
        circumcision&nbsp;must be careful to NOT sign this consent
        form. This will usually (but not always) prevent the child
        from being circumcised. As an additional precaution you may
        write NO CIRCUMCISION on every form in bold letters. <a
        href="http://www.noharmm.org/">NOHARMM</a> has devised a <a
        href="http://www.noharmm.org/Noncircform.htm"><i>Non-Circumcision
        Notification Form</i></a> which you may download and print.
        You may also complete this form and take with you to the
        hospital as additional protection for your son. You may
        include this form with the other documents upon
        admission.</p>

        <p><b>Need for bodyguard.</b>Opt for "rooming-in" if it is
        available. Keep your son in the sight of one parent at all
        times. Mothers who expect to give birth by caesarean
        section may be incapacitated for some period of time. The
        father or some trusted relative or friend should be
        appointed to stay with the infant boy during this time. At
        least one boy was wrongfully circumcised while the mother
        was recovering from her C-section. There are reports of
        boys being taken away for some other reason and coming back
        circumcised.</p>

        <p><b>Coercive Tactics.</b> Many hospitals seem to instruct
        staff to push circumcision on parents. Hospitals in the
        United States have fired nurses who dare to tell the truth
        about circumcision to parents. Be prepared to have nurses
        and others make you feel like a freak from outer space if
        you refuse circumcision. They may tell you that "Everybody
        does it." This is part of their psychological ploy. Do not
        fall for it. Circumcision is falling into disfavor. In
        1996, 40 percent of boys were preserved intact in the US
        and that percentage increases every year.</p>

        <p>You may be asked many times, "Don't you want your baby
        circumcised?" Be prepared to say "No, I don't want my baby
        circumcised!" a thousand times,</p>

        <p><b>Circumcision Refusal Form</b> The <i>circumcision
        refusal form</i> is a recent innovation. This seems to be a
        device designed to intimidate and frighten parents into
        signing the circumcision consent form. There is no legal
        reason to sign a circumcision refusal form. No other
        surgical or hospital procedure requires a refusal form. Do
        not be surprised if you are presented with a circumcision
        refusal form. You may sign it if you so desire but you are
        not legally required to do so. Sadly, the American Academy
        of Pediatrics <a
        href="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9850.html">Task Force on
        Circumcision</a> finds it necessary to state that "parents
        should not be coerced by medical professionals to make this
        choice."</p>

        <p>You may think of additional precautions to protect your
        son.</p>

        <p><b>Newborn physical examination.</b> Typically, newborn
        infants receive an examination from a pediatrician or other
        physician while still in hospital. Many physicians
        improperly believe that the foreskin of a intact,
        non-circumcised male infants must be forcably retracted and
        the glans penis examined. Forcible retraction of the
        newborn prepuce is guaranteed to cause pain and possible
        injury to your son as the newborn prepuce is usually too
        narrow to permit retraction, and furthermore, is fused with
        the underlying glans penis. (See <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/">Normal
        Development</a> for more information on the newborn
        prepuce.) Premature retraction will cause the foreskin to
        be ripped from the glans and raw surfaces will be formed
        which when they heal will cause adhesions. In addition the
        raw surfaces are more prone to infection. Your son's
        bodyguard should be present at this examination. The
        physician should be advised that no retraction of the
        foreskin is to be done. Premature retraction of a newborn
        foreskin is medical malpractice and grounds for legal
        action.</p>

        <p><b>Freedom to leave.</b> Remember you are not a prisoner
        in the hospital. Hospital procedures, rules, regulations,
        discharge policies are made for the benefit and protection
        of the hospital and not for you or your baby. You may leave
        or take your son out of hospital at anytime, regardless of
        hospital "procedure," "rules," "regulations," or discharge
        policies, as soon as your physical condition and/or your
        son's physical condition permits. There is little doubt
        that you will be more comfortable in the security and
        safety of your home away from the many dangers that tend to
        lurk in hospitals.</p>

        <p><b>After leaving the hospital.</b>You may also need to
        protect your son's intact penis when he visits the
        pediatrician. Medical Doctors in the US are poorly trained
        in the care of the complete penis. There are many reports
        of forcible premature retraction of the foreskin. This is
        also a tort for which money damages apply. <a
        href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/">Mothers Against
        Circumcision</a> has webpublished an <a
        href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/care.htm"><i>Intact
        Care Agreement</i></a> written by Jennifer Gardner that you
        may consider using to protect your son during his office
        visits.</p>

        <p>An abbreviated <a

        of precautions for parents in the United States has been
