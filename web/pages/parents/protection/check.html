    <h2 align="center">Checklist for Protection of Newborn Boys in
    Hospital</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Get the facts about circumcision early. Your obstetrician
      is NOT a disinterested and objective source of information
      because he/she stands to profit from the performance of a
      circumcision (genital cutting) surgical procedure.</li>

      <li>Determine if your child is/is not to be circumcised.</li>

      <li>Determine location of birth.</li>

      <li>Send a letter to attending physician. <a
      href="/pages/parents/protection/doclet.html">Click here for
      sample letter</a>.</li>

      <li>Send a similar letter to the hospital administrator. <a
      href="/pages/parents/protection/hoslet.html">Click here for
      sample letter</a>.</li>

      <li>Order NOCIRC T-shirts from NOCIRC, P. O. Box 2512, San
      Anselmo, CA 94979-2512, USA; Telephone (415) 488-9883. <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/2pam.pdf"
      target="_blank">Order Form</a></li>

      <li>Print a copy of this checklist to take with you to the
      hospital. Print a copy of NOHARMM <a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/Noncircform.htm">Non-Circumcision
      Notification Form</a>. Obtain Post-its&reg; stickers and a
      marker or a suitable pen (such as felt tip) to make bold
      marks. Obtain Post-its&reg; from office supply store. Take
      printed material, Post-its&reg; stickers and marker or pen to
      the hospital with you.</li>

      <li>Be aware that circumcision consent forms are usually
      included with admission papers.</li>

      <li>Upon Admission write "NO CIRCUMCISION" across all forms
      in large block letters with marker or pen obtained for that
      purpose. Be careful to NOT execute <i>Consent for
      Circumcision</i> form. DO include completed NOHARMM
      Non-Circumcision Notification Form with papers.</li>

      <li>Exercise rooming in option, if available. Stick post-its
      marked "NO CIRCUMCISION" on your son's bassinet or crib. Keep
      your son in the sight of one parent or other trusted
      bodyguard at all times. Be aware that your newborn child is
      likely to be examined by a pediatrician or other physician
      while in hospital.</li>

      <li>Be prepared for the fact that you may be repeatedly
      pressured to sign a consent form by doctor and/or hospital
      staff. This is a psychological tactic designed to break down
      your resistance.</li>

      <li>If you and your son are healthy the best environment is
      that of your own home where you can fully enjoy the presence
      of your new intact baby son without concern for
      hospital-spread infections, errors, forcible foreskin
      retraction, or wrongful circumcision. If you have given birth
      in a hospital, try to return home as soon as possible.</li>

      <li>Consider using a Mothers Against Circumcision <a
      href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/care.htm"><i>Intact
      Care Agreement</i></a> after leaving hospital for protection
      of the infant during doctor visits.</li>
    </ol>
