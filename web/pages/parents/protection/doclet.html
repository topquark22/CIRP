<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Sample Letter to Attending Physician</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>

The following is a sample letter that may be used to advise the attending
physician of your intent. The letter may be signed by either parent or both
parents. However, it would be in your best interests to have both
parents and/or guardians sign the letter. The signature of both removes the legal argument that
they carried out the intent of one parent.

<p>This letter is a legal notification of your intent not to have
your baby circumcised. It should be sent certified mail - return
receipt requested. Go to the post office in advance and get a proof of mailing form. The nine
digit number on the proof of mailing form may then be incorporated into the letter as it is in the sample below. Keep a copy of the letter. Attach the proof of mailing receipt to the copy. When the green receipt card is returned. Attach the green card to your copy
of the letter and put it all in a file for safekeeping.

<p>In the unlikely event that your son should be wrongfully circumcised this letter with the receipts attached may be produced in court as proof of notification. This can only strengthen your case.

    <p>Re: <b>Protection of infant boy from circumcision</b>
    <p>Dear Dr. Smith:

    <p> Mrs. Doe is your obstetrical patient. As you know she is expected to give birth on
or about January 18, 1997. We are opposed to infant circumcision.

    <p>If the baby should be a boy, we do NOT wish him to be circumcised. Please advise all members of your group to respect our
wishes.

    <p>
Circumcision is a painful and damaging procedure. If a circumcision should be performed against our wishes, we would feel
obligated to bring a suit on our son's behalf to recover damages for the significant pain
and trauma suffered, the lifetime loss of protective, sexual, and erogenous function due to
the surgical ablation of a large portion of the skin and mucosa of the penis, and
including any other claims or actions which may arise either directly or indirectly from
genital altering procedures.</p>
