<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Sample Letter to Hospital</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>

The following is a sample letter that may be used to advise the hospital
of your intent. The letter may be signed by either parent or both parents. However, it would be in your best interest and that of your child to have both parents and/or guardians
sign the letter. The signature of both removes the legal argument that they carried out the
intent of one parent.

<p>This letter is a legal notification of your intent not to have your baby circumcised. It should be sent certified mail - return receipt requested. Go to the post office in advance and get a proof of mailing form. The nine digit number on the proof of mailing form may then be incorporated into the letter as it is in the sample below. Keep a copy of the letter. Attach the proof of mailing receipt to the copy. When the green receipt card is returned. Attach the green card to your copy of the letter and put it all in a file for
safekeeping.

<P>In the unlikely event that your son should be wrongfully  circumcised, and you elect to seek to recover money damages for your son, this letter with the receipts may be produced in court as proof of
    notification. This can only strengthen your case.<HR>

    <p>Re: <b>Protection of infant boy from circumcision</b></p>
    <p>Dear Sir:

   <p>Mrs. Doe is expecting a child
    with a due date on or about January 18, 1997. She intends to use your
institution's maternity services. We are opposed to infant circumcision.

    <p> If the baby should be a boy, we
do NOT wish him to be circumcised. Please advise all members of your
staff to respect our wishes.

    <p>Circumcision is a painful, traumatic, and damaging procedure. If a circumcision should be performed against our wishes, we would feel obligated to bring a suit on our son's behalf to recover damages for the significant pain and trauma suffered, the lifetime loss of protective, sexual, and erogenous function due to the surgical ablation of a large portion of the skin and mucosa of the penis, and including any other claims or actions which may arise either directly or indirectly from genital altering procedures.
