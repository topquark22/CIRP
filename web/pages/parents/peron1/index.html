      <p><big><b>I</b></big>n a society where routine circumcision
      has been common for many years, even parents who choose to
      protect their sons from routine circumcision may have
      questions regarding hygiene of the intact penis.</p>

      <p><i>Should the young child's foreskin be retracted for
      proper cleaning? At what age should the child's foreskin be
      retractable?</i></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Leave the foreskin alone; wash only what is external
        and readily visible.</li>

        <li>Never forcibly retract your son's foreskin and don't
        permit anyone else to do so.</li>

        <li>Make certain your son's medical attendants understand
        his foreskin is not to be retracted or tampered with.</li>

        <li>Always stay with your son during his doctor visits and
        exams.</li>

        <li>When teaching the child to bathe and care for himself,
        let the child retract his own foreskin if he wants to. He
        will not retract it beyond the point of discomfort.</li>

        <li>A child's foreskin does not need to be retracted
        regularly for cleaning until the end of puberty. It should
        not be retracted during early childhood.*</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i>What about "smegma" and hygiene?</i></p>

      <p>Parents are frequently told that the foreskin must be
      carefully cleaned to remove "smegma" from under the foreskin.
      Smegma is a natural oily, waxy lubricant formed between the
      foreskin and the glans. Rarely does it exist in the
      uncircumcised child whose foreskin has not been forcibly
      retracted; the substance we are warned to carefully wash away
      is rarely produced during childhood. During puberty, these
      natural secretions tend to increase, providing a natural
      lubricant between the foreskin and glans for protection and
      to permit the foreskin to slide easily over the glans as
      nature intended for this age. By mid-teenage, the foreskin is
      retractable and hygiene is a simple matter. Any accumulation
      of these natural lubricating substances can easily be
      cleansed during the boy's shower or bath.</p>

      <p><i>What about irritation or itching of the
      foreskin?</i></p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the infant boy has redness or irritation of the
        foreskin area and tip of his penis, simply apply a
        protective healing ointment such as A&amp;D ointment, Oil
        of Vitamin E, anti-biotic ointemnt, etc. Don't try to
        retract his foreskin. The irritation will usually clear up
        in a few days.</li>

        <li>Some baby boys develop little "pearls" under the
        foreskin between the glans and the foreskin. These are shed
        cells from the glans and foreskin gradually separating that
        will eventually work their way to the opening and be
        discarded. Rarely do they present a problem.</li>

        <li>An older uncircumcised child may complain of foreskin
        irritation or itching. Interestingly, this seems most
        common with those boys whose foreskin has been regularly
        retracted from early childhood.</li>

        <li>Active young boys playing outside may occasionally get
        dirt or sand in the foreskin opening. It may lodge between
        the inner foreskin and glans tip causing minor irritation.
        If the foreskin is partially or fully retractable, you may
        very gently retract his foreskin and rinse the area with
        warm water.</li>

        <li>If the foreskin will not retract or is swollen, do not
        force it. Wash the area and apply a soothing lubricant to
        the tip and exposed surfaces. Remember always return the
        foreskin to its normal resting position.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr align="left" color="black" size="1" width="25%" />
      <small>(*Improper retraction by force can cause small tears
      in the foreskin and the mucosal fold under the foreskin where
      it is normally adherent to the glans. This may cause bleeding
      and considerable pain, and open the route for potential
      infection and irritation. If this is a regular practice,
      restrictive scar tissue may form around the opening of the
      foreskin or between the foreskin and the
      glans.)</small><br />
