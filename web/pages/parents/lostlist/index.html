    <p align="center"><font size="4">When a baby boy's natural and
    intact penis is "circumcised," this is what is lost
    <i>forever</i>:</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <font color="red" size="3">*</font>1. The frenar band of
      soft ridges--the single most pleasure producing zone on the
      male body. Loss of this densely innervated and reactive belt
      of tissue reduces the sensitivity of the remaining penis to
      about that of ordinary skin.

      <p align="left">2. Approximately half of the temperature
      reactive smooth muscle sheath called the dartos fascia.</p>

      <p align="left">3. Specialized epithelial Langerhans cells, a
      component of the immune system.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>4. An
      estimated 240 feet of microscopic nerves, including branches
      of the dorsal nerve.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>5.
      Between 10,000 to 20,000 specialized erotogenic nerve endings
      of several types, which can discern slight motion, subtle
      changes in temperature, and fine gradations in texture. This
      loss includes thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors called
      the <i>Meissner's corpuscles</i> - the most important sensory
      component in the foreskin.</p>

      <p align="left">6. Estrogen receptors the purpose and value
      of which are not yet fully understood.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>7.
      More than 50% of the mobile penile skin, the multi-purpose
      covering of the glans, that shields all of the specialized
      penile skin from abrasion, drying, and callusing (by keratin
      cell layering), and protects it from dirt and other
      contaminants. The debilitating sexual consequences of
      keratinizing the glans have never been studied.</p>

      <p align="left">8. The immunological defense system of the
      soft mucosa, which may produce antibacterial and antiviral
      proteins such as lysozyme, also found in mothers milk, and
      plasma cells, which secrete immunoglobulin antibodies.</p>

      <p align="left">9. Lymphatic vessels, the loss of which
      interrupts the lymph flow within a part of the bodys immune
      system.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>10.
      <i>The frenulum,</i> the very sensitive "V" shaped web-like
      tethering structure on the underside of the glans; usually
      amputated along with the foreskin, or severed, which destroys
      its functionality.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>11.
      The apocrine glands of the inner foreskin, which produce
      <i>pheromones</i>&mdash;nature's powerful, silent, invisible
      behavioral signals to potential sexual partners. They
      contribute significantly to sexuality. Their loss is
      unstudied.</p>

      <p align="left">12. Ectopic sebaceous glands, which lubricate
      and moisturize.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="1">*</font>13.
      The essential "<i>gliding</i>" mechanism. If unfolded and
      spread out flat, the average adult foreskin measures about 15
      square inches, the size of a postcard. This abundance of
      specialized, self-lubricating mobile skin gives the natural
      penis its unique hallmark ability to smoothly "glide" in and
      out within itself&mdash;permitting natural non-abrasive
      masturbation and intercourse, <i>without drying out the
      vagina or requiring artificial lubricants</i>.</p>

      <p align="left">14. The pink to red to dark purple natural
      coloration of the glans, normally an internal organ, like
      the tongue.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>15. A
      significant amount of the penis circumference because its
      double layered wrapping of loose foreskin is now missing
      <i>making the circumcised penis defectively thinner than a
      full-sized intact penis</i>.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>16. As
      much as one inch of the erect penis length due to amputation
      when the connective tissue is torn apart during
      "circumcision." This shared membrane tightly fuses the
      foreskin and the glans together while the penis develops.
      Ripping it apart wounds the glans, leaving it raw and subject
      to infection, scarring, and shrinkage.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="3">*</font>17.
      Several feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery
      and branches of the dorsal artery. The loss of this dense
      vascularity interrupts normal blood flow to the shaft and
      glans of the penis, obviously damaging its natural function
      and possibly stunting its complete and healthy
      development.</p>

      <p align="left">18. Every year boys lose their penises
      altogether from botched "circumcisions" and infections
      accidents happen. They are then "sexually reassigned" by
      transgender surgery and must live their lives as females.</p>

      <p align="left">19. Every year <i>many boys lose their lives
      from the complications of medically unnecessary
      circumcisions.</i> The cause of these deaths are a fact the
      billion dollar per year circumcision industry willfully
      obscures and conceals.</p>

      <p align="left"><font color="red" size="4">*</font>20.
      Although not yet proved scientifically, there is considerable
      new evidence that an incomplete penis loses its capacity for
      the subtle electromagnetic "cross-communication" that occurs
      only during contact between two mucous membranes, and which
      contributes to the perception of sexual ecstasy. In other
      words, medically unjustified <i>foreskin amputation of boys
      ultimately diminishes the intensity of orgasms for both men
      and women!</i></p>
