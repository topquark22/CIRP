    <h2>The Foreskin</h2>

    <p>Our bodies are covered with skin. The skin on our noses goes
    to their tips and the skin on our fingers and toes goes to
    their tips. The penis, too, is covered with skin. The fold of
    skin that covers and protects the glans (head) of the penis is
    sometimes called the prepuce, but is more commonly known as the
    foreskin.</p>

    <p>The inside fold of the foreskin is mucous membrane and keeps
    the surface of the glans soft, moist and sensitive.</p>

    <p>The foreskin contains a concentrated number of blood vessels
    and nerve endings. The frenum which secures the foreskin in its
    forward position, is continous with the frenar band. This band
    of specialized tissue encircles the foreskin where the inside
    and outside folds meet (at the mucocutaneous junction) and is
    extremely sensitive.</p>

    <h2>Care</h2>

    <p>The intact penis of an infant or child needs no special
    care.</p>

    <p>A child's foreskin should never be retracted by force.</p>

    <p>During the first few years of life, the foreskin and glans
    are connected by a common membrane called the synechia (just as
    the fingernail is attached to the finger). This connective
    tissue dissolves naturally - a process that should never be
    hurried.</p>

    <p>The foreskin can be retracted when its inside surface
    separates from the glans and the opening widens. This usually
    happens by age 18. Even if the glans and foreskin separate
    naturally in infancy, the foreskin still may not be retractable
    because the opening in an infant's foreskin may be just large
    enough for the passage of urine.</p>

    <p>The first person to retract a child's foreskin should be the
    child himself. Once a boy discovers that his foreskin is
    retractable (a wondrous discovery for an intact child), he can
    easily learn to care for himself. A simple explanation of "how
    to" may be helpful:</p>

    <ul compact="compact">
      <li>Gently slip the foreskin back.</li>

      <li>Rinse the head of your penis and the inside fold of your
      foreskin with warm water.</li>

      <li>Slip your foreskin back in place over the glans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Answers to Your Questions:</h2>

    <dl compact="compact">
      <dt>What causes my son's foreskin to be red?<br />
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Sometimes the tip of the foreskin becomes reddened. This
        indicates the penis is irritated and the foreskin is doing
        its job of protecting the sensitive glans and urinary
        meatus (the opening for the passage of urine and semen).

        <p>When bacteria in the feces react with urine, they
        produce ammonia, which burns the skin and causes ammoniacal
        dermatitis, commonly known as diaper rash.</p>

        <p>Common reasons for a reddened foreskin are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Too much exposure to soiled diapers</li>

          <li>
            An inbalance of skin bacteria caused by: 

            <ul compact="compact">
              <li>-too many bubble baths</li>

              <li>-swimming in highly clorinated water</li>

              <li>-soap on the genitals</li>

              <li>-laundry soap or detergent on clothing</li>

              <li>-antibiotic therapy (microbial flora can be
              restored by eating yogurt with live culture.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Concentrated urine because the boy is not drinking
          enough water.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Drinking water, soaking in warm baths, and letting
        children run around with bare bottoms to air their genitals
        helps healing.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>What is the white lump under my son's foreskin?<br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The white lump is made up of the cells that once attached
      the foreskin to the glans. As new cells form on the glans and
      the foreskin's inside fold, old cells form pockets that
      eventually work their way to the tip of the foreskin, where
      they are discharged and can eventually be wiped away. The
      space they occupied becomes the preputial space between the
      foreskin and the glans. So, if you see a white lump under the
      foreskin you know that the separation of the glans is
      occurring naturally.</dd>

      <dt>What is phimosis?<br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The greek word phimosis means muzzled and refers to a
      foreskin that cannot be retracted because its opening is too
      small to expand over the head of the penis. This is normal
      during infancy and childhood. The foreskins of some males are
      not retractable until they are in their late teens.</dd>

      <dt>Why does my son's foreskin "balloon" when he
      urinates?<br />
      </dt>

      <dd>This is another indication that the natural separation of
      the glans is occurring. One elderly Irishman tells how, as a
      boy he and his friends would stand in a row, urinate, then
      squeeze the balloon to see who could "shoot the farthest. As
      the preputial opening widens, most boys decrease their
      chances of winning the game, but increase their ability to
      retract their foreskins.</dd>

      <dt>What happens if someone retracts my son's foreskin
      prematurely?<br />
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Forcing the foreskin back can cause pain, as well as
        problems. 

        <p>Tearing the foreskin from the glans leaves an open wound
        which can lead to infection.</p>

        <p>Raw surfaces touching each other can heal together and
        form adhesions between the foreskin and the glans.</p>

        <p>Small tears in the opening of the foreskin can heal to
        form non-elastic scar tissue, passibly causing acquired
        phimosis.</p>

        <p>The foreskin can get "stuck" behind the glans
        (paraphimosis). By squeezing the glans, the foreskin can be
        brought forward again, without circumcision.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How do I teach my son to wash?<br />
      </dt>

      <dd>
        When a boy is old enough to bathe himself, he can wash his
        penis just as he washes any other part of his body. 

        <p>When a young boy pulls at his foreskin, he usually pulls
        it outward. This is normal and natural and no cause for
        concern; he won't hurt himself. One day, he'll pull his
        foreskin back, and you can discuss retracting, washing, and
        returning the foreskin to its forward position over the
        glans. Telling your son about retractablility beforehand
        will keep him from becoming alarmed the first time his
        foreskin retracts.</p>

        <p>At puberty, you can let him know what with hormonal
        activity comes new responsibility, including genital
        hygiene.</p>

    <p>NOCIRC has information about hygiene written especially for
    intact boys.</p>

    <p>Many doctors don't know how to care for an intact penis and
    recommend circumcision for any and every problem. The National
    Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers,
    which is dedicated to preserving and protecting children's
    normal natural wholeness, will be happy to direct you to a
    doctor who understands the foreskin's functions and
    importance.</p>
