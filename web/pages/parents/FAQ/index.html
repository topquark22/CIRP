          <h3>What is circumcision?</h3>

          <p>Circumcision is the surgical removal of the sleeve of
          skin and mucosal tissue that normally covers the glans
          (head) of the penis. This double layer, sometimes called
          the prepuce, is more commonly known as the foreskin.</p>

          <p>Parents are encouraged to read as much as possible
          about circumcision. They should make themselves aware of
          the complexities of the circumcision procedure itself.
          Speak to your doctor about the step-by-step procedure. If
          possible, ask to observe a circumcision at your hospital,
          so that you will know fully what is involved.</p>

          <p>The International Coalition for Genital Integrity has
          <a
          href="http://www.icgi.org/fgm-mgm_classification.htm">classified</a>
          circumcision as a type I genital mutilation. <a
          href="/library/procedure/plastibell/">Pictures and video
          of a circumcision</a> are available on the Circumcision
          Information and Resource Pages (CIRP) website.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What is the foreskin there for?</h3>

          <p>The foreskin serves three functions: protective,
          sensory, and sexual.</p>

          <p>In most cases, the foreskin is still fused to the
          glans at birth and will separate over a variable period
          of time over the first few years. During the diaper
          period, the foreskin protects against abrasion from
          diapers and feces. Throughout life, the foreskin keeps
          the glans soft and moist and protects it from trauma and
          injury.</p>

          <p>Parts of the foreskin, such as the mucosa (inner
          foreskin) and frenulum, are particularly sensitive and
          contribute to sexual pleasure. Specialized nerve endings
          enhance sexual pleasure and control <a
          href="#taylor">[19]</a>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The inner foreskin (mucosa) is the skin directly
            against the glans. Like the lining of the mouth, this
            tissue is thinner and of a different texture and color
            than the remainder of the skin covering the penis
            (shaft skin).</li>

            <li>The frenulum is a particularly sensitive narrow
            membrane that runs down the ventral groove of the glans
            and attaches to the inner foreskin.</li>

            <li>The ridged band is the interface between the inner
            foreskin (mucosa) and the shaft skin. It often
            "puckers" past the tip of the glans. The band contains
            whorled smooth muscle fibers, giving it pronounced
            elastic properties that allow the foreskin to be
            retracted. The ridged band has a tactile sensitivity
            equivalent to that of the lips.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The foreskin provides ample loose skin for the penis
          to occupy when erect. It is a movable skin sheath for the
          penis during intercourse, reducing chafing and the need
          for artificial lubricants, and allowing the glans and
          foreskin to naturally stimulate each other. Warren and
          Bigelow described some of the physiological functions of
          the foreskin in sexual activity. <a
          href="#warren">[1]</a></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What are some reasons that circumcision is
          performed?</h3>

          <p>Circumcision is primarily performed for cultural or
          religious reasons.</p>

          <p>Because a large number of men in English-speaking
          Western countries are circumcised, many think of the
          foreskin as an unnecessary part of the penis. Many
          circumcisions are performed because a circumcised father
          often does not want to feel that he is different from his
          son.</p>

          <p><a href="#hygiene">It is often said that a circumcised
          penis is cleaner, or easier to keep clean, than an intact
          penis.</a> Smegma (a natural substance composed of dead
          skin cells, normal flora, and secretions containing the
          natural antibacterial agent lysozyme) is more likely to
          accumulate when the foreskin is present.</p>

          <p>Medical grounds for circumcision that are most
          commonly cited are: Reduced risk of urinary tract
          infections (UTI); reduced risk of penile cancer; reduced
          risk of cervical cancer in partners;
          reduced risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD).</p>

          <p>There is contradictory evidence in the research
          literature as to whether circumcision reduces UTI <a
          href="#altschul">[16,17]</a>, but this seems to be the
          strongest of all medical claims in favour of
          circumcision, because UTI can have serious consequences.
          These infections can, however, in most cases be treated
          by antibiotics. The frequency of UTI in US male infants
          is approximately 1%, but is higher for females. There is
          evidence that babies who are breastfed have a lower
          incidence of UTI. <a href="#bfeed">[8]</a></p>

          <p>Penile cancer is an extremely rare form of cancer. It
          occurs mostly in older men, and most doctors will not
          recommend infant circumcision as a preventative measure.
          Penile cancer can occur in both circumcised and intact
          men: The Maden study (an ongoing study of penile cancer
          at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle)
          observed that 37% of penile cancer cases occurred in
          circumcised men. <a href="#maden">[2]</a></p>

          <p>The theory that wives of men with intact foreskins are
          more prone to cervical cancer has been disproven <a
          href="#cerv">[12]</a>. The theory that the presence of a
          foreskin may cause an increased risk of sexually
          transmitted diseases was disproved by a new study <a
          href="#laumann22">[22]</a>. The question of HIV warrants
          further study <a href="#HIV20">[20]</a>, <a
          href="#STD18">[7]</a>. Although there is an <a
          href="/library/disease/HIV/">apparent geographical
          correlation</a> between male non-circumcision and HIV
          infection on the African continent, this is not true
          globally, and the pattern seen in Africa could easily be
          due to other factors.</p>

          <p>The only known effective means of preventing HIV
          infection are fidelity, condom use and abstinence.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3><a id="hygiene" name="hygiene">Hygiene</a></h3>

          <p><a href="/pages/parents/care/">The foreskin is easy to
          care for and the intact penis is easy to keep clean.</a>
          The foreskin usually does not fully retract for several
          years and should never be forced. When the foreskin is
          fully retractable, boys should be taught the importance
          of washing underneath the foreskin every day.</p>

          <p>Gently rinsing the genital area while bathing is
          sufficient. Harsh soap and excessive washing can irritate
          the penis, which can lead to inflammation of the glans
          (balanitis). <a href="#birley">[24]</a></p>

          <p>Smegma is a white waxy substance, consisting of natural
          secretions and shed skin cells, that may occur around
          the folds of the genitalia in both males and females. In the
          past it was feared that smegma might be carcinogenic
          (and this fear was used as a justification for circumcision),
          but this fear has been disproven. Good general hygiene and
          common sense are key to preventing infection.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>If my son isn't circumcised, won't it have to be done
          later?</h3>

          <p>Abnormalities or diseases of the foreskin can be
          treated conservatively, if and when they occur, on a
          case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Probably the most common abnormality of the penis is
          <a href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">"phimosis"</a>, or
          tight foreskin. (This is not the same as the natural
          attachment of the foreskin to the glans in very young
          children, which is completely normal.) The foreskin can
          normally be retracted by adolescence.</p>

          <p>If retraction is not possible, a number of newer
          treatments are available which do not involve
          circumcision: Steroid creams, stretching, and
          preputioplasty. <a href="#tight">[18]</a> Some of these
          treatments have only been published recently, and not all
          doctors are aware of them.</p>

          <p>If your son has a serious problem with his foreskin,
          such as a severe infection (balanitis xerotica
          obliterans) or gangrene, perhaps related to diabetes,
          removal of the affected area may be a medically advisable
          option.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>If my son isn't circumcised, won't he be teased?</h3>

          <p>Children can be cruel, and will find things to pick on
          another child about, whether it be his chubbiness,
          glasses, or freckles. Some parents think that their son
          should be circumcised so that he will "match" his father,
          brothers, or friends. As parents, we can help our
          children to feel good about their bodies and to respect
          individual differences.</p>

          <p>Parents often express a fear that their son will "feel
          different in the locker room" if he is intact. There is
          good evidence that proper education is the answer. Boys
          who are taught from an early age that they are normal,
          whole and healthy will have a lesser chance of suffering
          embarrassment in the locker room, especially if some of
          the other boys are also intact.</p>

          <p>Nonreligious infant circumcision is not an issue in
          European, Asian or South American countries. In Canada
          the average rate of infant circumcision for boys is
          roughly 25%, with large regional variations. The rate in
          the United States has dropped to less than 60%, and will
          drop below 50% in a few years if present trends continue.
          This is already true in the Western US (35% in 1993).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What are some reasons not to have my son
          circumcised?</h3>

          <p>Your son's foreskin is a healthy, natural part of his
          body. Any part of the body may develop problems. It is
          possible, though very unlikely, that the foreskin will
          develop problems. However, most foreskin problems are
          easily treatable.</p>

          <p>When your son becomes an adult, he may choose
          circumcision for himself. However, there is a good chance
          he will prefer not to be circumcised. Leaving your baby's
          foreskin alone preserves his right to a whole and intact
          body.</p>

          <p>Circumcision will be painful for the baby (see
          below).</p>

          <p>The medical evidence in favor of routine circumcision
          of healthy babies is not persuasive. If your son has a
          problem with his foreskin, such as a severe infection
          (balanitis xerotica obliterans) or gangrene, perhaps
          related to diabetes, your doctor may recommend partial or
          complete circumcision or removal of the affected area.
          Phimosis (nonretractable foreskin, if it persists much
          longer than normal) can usually be treated by gentle
          stretching and/or steroid creams. The vast majority of
          boys will never have any foreskin problems that
          necessitate surgery. <a href="#tight">[18]</a></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3><a id="pain" name="pain">Is circumcision
          painful?</a></h3>

          <p>The often repeated statement that babies can't feel
          pain is not true. It is documented in the medical
          literature that babies are as sensitive to pain as anyone
          else, and perhaps more so. <a
          href="#anand">[13,14]</a></p>

          <p>Most circumcisions are performed without anaesthetic,
          because there are risks involved with using anaesthetics
          on babies. Sometimes local injections are used, but this
          does not eliminate pain. Most babies will show signs of
          pain during the procedure and in the week or ten days
          following circumcision. Recent studies have shown that
          the pain is remembered long beyond the time of the
          procedure itself. <a href="#taddio23">[23]</a></p>

          <p>While pain may help parents decide against
          circumcision, parents should look at the long term
          effects of their decision first, not only during
          infanthood, but all the way to adulthood. Your decision
          will affect your son for the duration of his life.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Does infant circumcision have risks?</h3>

          <p><a href="/library/complications/">Circumcision is
          surgery, and like all surgery it has risks.</a> These
          include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Excessive bleeding</li>

            <li>Injury to the glans</li>

            <li>Infection (raw wound is exposed to feces and urine
            in diaper)</li>

            <li>Complications from anaesthesia, if used</li>

            <li>Surgical error, including removal of too much
            skin</li>

            <li>In rare cases, complications can be
            life-threatening.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Up to 20% of circumcised males will suffer from one or
          more of the following complications, to some degree:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Meatal stenosis (narrowing of the urethral opening
            due to infection and subsequent scarring, that occurs
            almost exclusively in circumcised boys) <a
            href="#kapila">[15]</a></li>

            <li>extensive scarring of the penile shaft</li>

            <li>skin tags and skin bridges</li>

            <li>bleeding of the circumcision scar</li>

            <li>curvature of the penis</li>

            <li>tight, painful erections</li>

            <li>psychological and psychosexual problems <a
            href="#psych21">[21]</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>The surface of the glans becomes dry if not protected
          by the foreskin. It is believed that dryness and abrasion
          may cause progressive loss of sensation in the glans,
          especially in later life. Circumcised men on the whole do
          enjoy sex and are able to orgasm.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What if we want to have our son circumcised?</h3>

          <p>Circumcision does not need to be done right away.
          There is no need to feel pressured by your doctor. Take
          your time.</p>

          <p>If you intend to ask your doctor to have your son
          circumcised, ensure that the procedure is carried out by
          an experienced surgeon. Sometimes circumcision is
          considered "minor surgery" and inexperienced residents
          are given the task of performing it. This leads to a
          higher rate of serious errors and complications.</p>

          <p>You may desire that your son will retain some inner
          foreskin, and especially the frenulum, to preserve as
          much sexual sensitivity and function as possible. Another
          method is the dorsal slit. This method does not involve
          the removal of tissue, but allows the glans to be
          exposed.</p>

          <p>Your doctor can help you decide how much skin will be
          removed and how much of the glans should remain covered
          if desired. However, in most cases, once your signature
          is on the consent form, the physician has absolute
          license to execute the circumcision as he/she sees fit.
          You must ensure that your intentions are in writing
          before the operation occurs.</p>

          <p>To lessen the pain, speak to your doctor about the use
          of an anaesthetic for your baby. Note that some doctors
          who use anesthetic may not allow sufficient time for the
          anesthetic to take effect: It is important to ensure that
          this does not happen.</p>

          <h3><a href="/pages/whycirc.html">When and why was
          routine neonatal circumcision introduced in
          English-speaking Western countries?</a></h3>

          <p>Doctors in the English-speaking countries started
          circumcising babies in the mid-1800s to prevent
          masturbation, which some doctors claimed caused many
          diseases, including epilepsy, tuberculosis and insanity.
          Of course, these arguments are not accepted today.</p>
