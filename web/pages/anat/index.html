      <div class="intro">
        <p>This page presents information that most parents are not
        aware of at the time they make the circumcision decision.
        Doctors usually do not provide this information.</p>

        <p>If you are under 18, we recommend that you share and
        discuss this information with your parents.</p>

        <p>For a further look at this anatomy, including
        photographs, visit <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/"
        target="_blank">Circumstitions</a> (Hugh Young). Hugh's
        site also includes an excellent <a
        href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Works.html"
        target="_blank">animation</a> to illustrate retraction.</p>

            <p>This illustration represents an average normal adult
            human penis. The head of the penis (glans) has a
            covering, called the foreskin (prepuce). This covering
            folds in on itself, forming a double layer. The
            foreskin is <i>not</i> a `flap' of skin on the end of
            the penis, and it is not `useless' or `redundant'
            skin.</p>

            <p>There is some natural variation in the length of the
            foreskin, which often covers a bit more or less of the
            glans than illustrated.</p>

            <p>In an average circumcised adult man, the area of
            skin that is missing because of penile reduction
            surgery would, when erect and unfolded, measure
            approximately three by five inches, or a little smaller
            than a postcard. That is about half the total skin of
            the penis.</p>

              "skin," but mucocutaneous tissue of a unique type
              found nowhere else on the body.</li>

              <li>The <i>ridged band</i> is the interface (join)
              between the outer and inner foreskin layers. When the
              penis is not erect, it tightens to narrow the
              foreskin opening. During erection, the ridged band
              forms ridges that go all the way around, about
              halfway down the shaft.</li>

              <li>The reddish or purplish <i>glans</i> or <i>glans
              penis</i> (head of the penis) is smooth, shiny, moist
              and extremely sensitive.</li>

              <li>The <i>frenulum,</i> or <i>frenum,</i> is a
              connecting membrane on the underside of the penis,
              similar to that beneath the tongue.</li>

            <h2>The foreskin has twelve known functions.</h2>
            They are:

            <ol>
              <li>to cover and bond with the synechia so as to
              permit the development of the mucosal surface of the
              glans and inner foreskin.</li>

              <li>to protect the infant's glans from feces and
              ammonia in diapers.</li>

              <li>to protect the glans penis from friction and
              abrasion throughout life.</li>

              <li>to keep the glans moisturized and soft with
              emollient oils.</li>

              <li>to lubricate the glans.</li>

              <li>to coat the glans with a waxy protective
              substance.</li>

              <li>to provide sufficient skin to cover an erection
              by unfolding.</li>

              <li>to provide an aid to masturbation and
              foreplay.</li>

              <li>to serve as an aid to penetration.</li>

              <li>to reduce friction and chafing during
              intercourse.</li>

              <li>to serve as erogenous tissue because of its rich
              supply of erogenous receptors.</li>

              <li>to contact and stimulate the G-spot of the female

            <p>When fully retracted, the foreskin is designed to
            cover essentially the entire penile shaft, yet is loose
            enough to "glide". The ridged bands are situated about
            halfway down the shaft, when the foreskin is retracted
            fully.</p>

            <p><i>Note:</i> In some cases, a man may have
            difficulty retracting the foreskin. This is not an
            indication for circumcision, because there are good
            alternative treatments available that preserve the
            structure and function of the foreskin. Scientific
            references for information on this topic can be found

      <h2>Penile stimulation</h2>

      <p>The most important components of the physical erogenous
      stimulation of the penis during foreplay and intercourse are
      the sensations from the foreskin, frenulum/frenar band, and
      glans. These structures each have their own feeling, and each
      contributes in its own way to the man's total experience of
      lovemaking. It must be emphasized that emotional excitement
      is an extremely important component of sexual enjoyment, and
      intensifies the man's perception of any physical sensations
      from his penis.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <i>foreskin</i> has an inner and outer layer. The
        outer foreskin layer contains nerve endings which respond
        to gentle touching during the early stages of sexual
        arousal. This helps to trigger an erection. The nerves of
        the inner and outer foreskin contribute to the experience
        of penile stimulation, up to and including orgasm. These
        receptors are stimulated by stretching, or when the
        foreskin rolls over the surface of the glans during
        intercourse or masturbation. <a href="#gliding">(see `the
        gliding mechanism,' below).</a></li>

        <li>The foreskin contains sensory receptors called
        <i>Meissner corpuscles.</i> We believe that these nerves,
        similar to nerve endings in the fingertips, are there to
        provide pleasure, as well as fine sensory perception. This
        seems to help a man to enjoy sex longer without ejaculating
        prematurely, because he can more easily tell when he is
        approaching the threshold of orgasm.</li>

        <li>
          Stimulation of the <i>frenulum</i> and <i>ridged band</i>
          results in intense pleasurable feelings during arousal.
          The ridged band consists of a number of "ridges",
          described by Dr. John Taylor in his recent <a
          href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/">article.</a>
          Sensations from these structures during intercourse or
          masturbation are thought to be the primary trigger of
          orgasm in the intact male. Dr. George Denniston writes:

          <blockquote>
            The ridged bands, which are like horseshoes only in
            that they curve forward underneath toward the point
            where the frenulum attaches, can be found in several
            pictures in John's paper. There are some 20 concentric
            ridged bands which rub over the corona. Each ridge has
            Meissner's corpuscles, which respond to pressure, and
            they produce the sexual pleasure which no individual
            has a right to take away from another individual.
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>We believe that stimulation of the <i>glans</i> is most
        significant in the later stages of sexual intercourse, when
        penetration is deepest and emotions are running at their
        highest. Sensations from the glans contribute to the
        quality of the sensual experience. They are also apparently
        capable of triggering orgasm on their own, as would be the
        case in a circumcised man.</li>

            <p>Following circumcision, the foreskin of the penis
            has been cut away. The surface of the glans has
            developed a thick, dry layer of keratin (toughened
            skin), which makes it less sensitive to unwanted
            stimulation, but also less sensitive to the more subtle
            qualities of lovemaking.</p>

            <p>All circumcised men have an annular scar on the
            shaft of the penis. The location of the scar varies,
            from near the head to far down the shaft. For some men,
            so much skin has been removed that erection becomes
            difficult and even painful. This was one of the most
            common complaints reported by circumcised men in a
            recent poll.<a href="#hammond">[11]</a></p>

            <h2>The gliding mechanism</h2>

            <p>During intercourse the loose skin of the intact
            penis slides up and down the shaft of the penis,
            stimulating the glans and the sensitive erogenous
            receptors of the foreskin itself. On the outstroke the
            glans is partially or completely engulfed by the
            foreskin. This is known as the `gliding mechanism.'</p>

            <p>The gliding mechanism is Nature's intended mechanism
            of intercourse. As such, it contributes greatly to
            sexual pleasure. Also, since more of the loose skin of
            the penis remains inside the vagina, the woman's
            natural lubrication is not drawn out to evaporate to a
            great extent, which makes sex easier without using
            artificial lubricants.</p>

            <blockquote>
              The prepuce is a highly innervated and vascularized
              genital structure. It is entirely lined with the
              peripenic muscle sheet. Specialized ecoptic sebaceous
              glans on the inner preputial surface produce natural
              emollients and lubricants necessary for normal sexual
              function. The primary orgasmic triggers are found in
              the preputial orifice and frenulum. When unfolded,
              the prepuce is large enough to cover the length and
              circumference of the erect penis and acts as a
              natural sheath through which the shaft glides during
              coitus. Only the presence and functions of the
              prepuce allow for physiologically normal coitus to
              occur as designed by nature.

      <h3>Effects of penile reduction surgery (circumcision) on
      sexual intercourse</h3>

      <p>Although still pleasurable for the man, intercourse
      without the participation of the prepuce lacks the gliding
      mechanism. The only source of stimulation is the glans
      rubbing against the wall of the vagina. The sensations from
      the specialised receptors of the frenar band, frenulum and
      inner foreskin layer are missing.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "With intravaginal containment of the normal penis, the
        male's mobile sheath is placed within the woman's vaginal
        sheath. It is impossible to imagine a better mechanical
        arrangement for non-abrasive stimulation of the male and
        female genitalia than this slick 'sheath within a sheath.'
        Circumcision destroys this one sheath within a sheath . . .
        I would hazard a guess, that dyspareunia [painful
        intercourse] is more common in the women whose husband is
        circumcised . . . one would be foolish to discount the
        circumcised male's immobile penile skin sheath as an
        ancillary item contributing to vaginal, abrasive discomfort
        . . . The male with a penis already moderately obtunded by
        circumcision may be less apt to use a condom, which he
        feels may further decrease his genital sensitivity . . .
        because most American males lack a facile prepuce, the
        period of foreplay and dalliance may be abbreviated in the
        rush to the intra-vaginal method of penile stimulation.
        Both these factors conceivably could be of significance in
        increasing the rate of venereal disease, including AIDS . .
        . "

      <p>If the surgery was performed on an infant, by adulthood a
      relatively thick keratin layer will have formed on the
      normally skinless mucosal surface of the glans, which further
      reduces the stimulation. If the circumcision was performed as
      an adult, the keratin layer will form, and the sensitivity of
      the glans will gradually be reduced over time.<br />
