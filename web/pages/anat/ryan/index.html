    <title>Circumcised as adults: Jim Ryan MD</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="white">
    <p>The positive reports of persons circumcised as adults must
    be qualified for a number of reasons:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Those circumcised as adults for religious reasons are
        likely to see this ritual as a very positive experience and
        be reluctant to report any negative results. This would be
        reinforced if their partner shared their common religious
        perspective, which is likely in most cases (e.g. male
        Jewish or Muslim converts).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Those circumcised for "medical reasons" will all have
        had some medical problem affecting their penises. The
        abnormal medical condition may have been painful in itself
        or made sex painful before treatment. Thus sex may truly be
        more pleasurable for them after treatment than it was
        before. In any case, their comparisons of "before vs.
        after" circumcision must be recognized for what they are,
        comparisons of a diseased state vs. a desensitized state.
        Unfortunately, many men circumcised for medical reasons may
        find the latter an improvement. Non-surgical treatment of
        the underlying condition, however, may well have been able
        to correct the problem, enhancing their sexual pleasure
        without the loss of sensitivity resulting from
        circumcision.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>No matter what the reports may be about the results of
        adult circumcision, it is incorrect to generalize this
        experience to infant circumcision. Routine Infant
        Circumcision (RIC) is different and may be more harmful to
        adult sensation for a number of reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>RIC is performed on a small infant penis, usually
            with tools that preclude precision. Frequently it
            results in excess tissue removal and other
            complications which are avoidable when adult
            circumcision is performed. Adult circumcision is
            performed on a much larger penis, usually using a
            scalpel and sutures, permitting the doctor to save more
            tissue if he so chooses.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>RIC requires that the foreskin be torn from the
            tissue of the glans to which it still adheres, further
            damaging this sensitive structure. When an adult is
            circumcised, the foreskin has already separated from
            the glans. The loss of sensitivity to an adult may
            therefore be less.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>RIC leave the glans and residual foreskin exposed to
            urine and feces during the diaper period, further
            reducing any remaining sensitivity. Even with
            equivalent tissue loss, a man subjected to RIC may have
            less sensitivity than one circumcised as an adult.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>RIC may result in decades of exposure of the glans
            and residual foreskin to clothing and other trauma
            before sexual intercourse begins. If an adult is
            circumcised, he is starting at least with a more
            sensitive penis, although this may diminish over the
            years after circumcision as the tissue toughens.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>RIC usually removes all of the sensitive frenulum
            and leaves only a small band of the sensitive inner
            foreskin above the glans. A man circumcised as an adult
            has the option of saving these tissues. Some of the
            satisfied respondents who were circumcised as adults
            may therefore have much more sensitive penises than
            their brothers subjected to RIC. [Unfortunately, a
            circumcision which leaves only a small band of inner
            foreskin above the glans is considered by many men to
            be cosmetically "more attractive" than one where an
            "ugly scar" is located half way up the shaft of the
            penis, although this would clearly result in less
            impairment of sensitivity. Urologists, who perform most
            non-infant circumcisions, therefore tend to leave
            minimal residual foreskin.]</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The only "unbiased" comparison of "before vs. after"
        adult circumcision would need to be made by healthy men who
        voluntarily chose to be circumcised for non-religious and
        non-medical reasons, were sexually active before the
        surgery, and continued comparable sex lives after the
        operation. I have heard no reports of such men preferring
        the circumcised condition. In fact, I have not personally
        encountered any men during my 23 years of medical practice
        who have had themselves circumcised other than for
        religious or "medical" reasons. Perhaps there are good
        reasons why so few healthy men elect to be circumcised! And
        I would guess that many men who choose circumcision for
        "medical" reasons would have chosen non-surgical treatment
        has they been advised by the surgeon that there were other
        alternatives.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Even if healthy men who chose circumcision as adults for
        non-religious and non-medical reasons could be found, their
        reports might still be suspect. Men who have chosen to be
        circumcised for whatever reason will be fully aware that
        they cannot go back and may be reluctant to admit to
        themselves (much less publicly) that they made a mistake,
        especially about such a sensitive (no pun intended)
        question. For the same reason, the reports of those who are
        willing to acknowledge a loss should be given additional
        credibility. Having undergone the pain of circumcision,
        they are now willing to take the painful choice of
        acknowledging their loss.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Basically, I don't think it is possible to find subjects who
    can make a valid positive evaluation of the effects of adult
    circumcision. On the other hand, there are no parallel reasons
    to dismiss the reports of men who report a loss after
    circumcision. I believe that all reports of "improved
    sensitivity" are suspect. We know that 50% or more of the skin
    of the penis is removed including most of the inner surface of
    the foreskin and most if not all of the frenulum. These are the
    tissues where most of the sexually sensitive nerve endings are
    found (See <a
    href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor's
    report in the February 1996 British Journal of Urology</a>). It
    makes no sense that removal of most of the highly sexually
    sensitive parts of the penis would enhance pleasure. All
    "before vs. after" c omparisons must be viewed in this light.
    Enhanced pleasure after circumcision makes about as much sense
    as claims of improved manual dexterity after the fingertips
    have been amputated.</p>

    <p>The fact that many circumcised men claim to be "satisfied"
    is irrelevant. Most have been subjected to RIC and have never
    known anything else. And the reports of those who may have been
    circumcised as adults are suspect for the reasons outlined
    above. It is useful to note that women in countries which
    practice Female Genital Mutilation (which often involves
    amputation of most of a woman's external genital organs) are
    reported to be "satisfied" with their status and to be the ones
    who are the strongest advocates of subjecting their daughters
    to this ritual.</p>
