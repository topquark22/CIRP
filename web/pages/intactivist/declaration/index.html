    <div class="corpus">
      <p>We recognize the inherent right of all human beings to an
      intact body. Without religious or racial prejudice, we affirm
      this basic human right.</p>

      <p>We recognize the foreskin, clitoris and labia are normal,
      functional body parts.</p>

      <p>Parents and/or guardians do not have the right to consent
      to the surgical removal or modification of their children's
      normal genitalia.</p>

      <p>Physicians and other health-care providers have a
      responsibility to refuse to remove or mutilate normal body
      parts.</p>

      <p>The only persons who may consent to medically unnecessary
      procedures upon themselves are the individuals who have
      reached the age of consent (adulthood), and then only after
      being fully informed about the risks and benefits of the
      procedure.</p>

      <p>We categorically state that circumcision has unrecognized
      victims.</p>

      <p>In view of the serious <a
      href="/library/complications/">physical</a> and <a
      href="/library/psych/">psychological</a> consequences that we
      have witnessed in victims of circumcision, we hereby oppose
      the performance of a single additional unnecessary foreskin,
      clitoral, or labial amputation procedure.</p>

      <p>We oppose any further studies which involve the
      performance of circumcision procedures upon unconsenting
      minors. We support any further studies which involve
      identification of the effects of circumcision.</p>

      <p>Physicians and other health-care providers do have a
      responsibility to teach hygiene and the care of normal body
      parts and explain <a href="/library/normal/">their normal
      anatomical and physiological development and function
      throughout life</a>.</p>

      <p>We place the medical community on notice that it is being
      held accountable for misconstruing the scientific database
      available on human circumcision in the world today.</p>

      <p>Physicians who practice routine circumcisions are
      violating the first maxim of medical practice, <i>Primum non
      nocere</i>, "First, Do No Harm", and anyone practicing
      genital mutilation is violating Article V of the United
      Nations <a href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights</a>: <em>"No one shall be
      subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment."</em></p>
