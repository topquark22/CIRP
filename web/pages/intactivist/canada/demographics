Hugh, antipodean amigo,

Your observation reminds me of something I learned several years ago in
Quebec.  I was changing to go swimming with an acquaintance, Michel,
and about the same time he noticed I was intact and I noticed that he
was circumcised.  Later that day the discussion turned to circumcision,
and he said he was extremely angry about it.  When I asked why he was
cut, he said "For religious reasons."  I said I didn't know he was
Jewish.  What he explained was particularly enlightening to me, and
I'll always think of Catholics and "circumcision for religious reasons"
because of it.

He said that his family, like most Quebeckers, is Roman Catholic and he
attended parochial school in Montreal.  During the early weeks of first
grade (this was around 1965) the nuns arranged for all the little boys
in the class to visit the school doctor.  One by one, he circumcised
them all in assembly-line fashion.  Apparently, permission had been
obtained from the parents when the nuns passionately explained the
health and moral virtues of removing the foreskin.  Michel supposed
that the nuns got this notion from Anglophone Canada, perhaps from nuns
in neighboring Ontario where in 1965 neonatal circumcision rates were
abysmally high.  Whatever the source of this mania, for several years
apparently the nuns in this (and other?) French-Canadian Catholic
schools herded all little first-grade boys to the circumciser.  I think
the practice died out rather quickly, but for this reason Michel
speculated that there is a fairly high circumcision rate for Quebec men
who today would be around the ages of 35-45.  Because they were cut as
little boys, these numbers do not even factor into the provincial
health statistics of infant circumcision rates; they're in addition to
those rates.

Ironically, other provinces like British Columbia and Alberta, which
had neonatal circumcision rates over 50% during the 1970s, plunged to
safely under 1% when their provincial health plans stopped routine
coverage for nontherapeutic infant circumcision.  Thus, their rates
flew right past Quebec's, which declined much more slowly, from 31.% in
1971 to 6.2% in 1985.  Compare these numbers from Health Canada and the
respective Ministries of Health:

Quebec neonatal circumcision rates:

1971    31.2%
1972    30.0
1973    29.5
1974    25.8
1975    22.1
1976    16.5
1977    13.0
1978      9.8
1979      7.9
1980      7.1
1981      5.7
1982      5.7
1983      5.8
1984      6.4
1985      6.2
1986      5.3
1987      2.7


British Columbia neonatal circumcision rates:

1971     n/a
1972     n/a
1973     n/a
1974     n/a
1975     54.1%
1976     58.0
1977     46.0
1978     44.5
1979     42.8
1980     39.8
1981     37.5
1982     36.5
1983     35.6

1st half of 1984     36.10%
2nd half of 1984     00.38%

1985     0.35
1986     0.43
1987     0.33

Note that on 7/1/84 BC stopped paying for RIC.  The rate plunged 99% in
24 hours.


You can see the powerful effect that economics played in changing the
circumcision landscape in British Columbia.  The same has happened in
Alberta, Yukon, and other Canadian provinces, as well.  It also has
happened in Australia, Britain (in 1949) and in selected communities in
the US.

This is why I am focusing nearly all of my attention on cutting the
economic legs out from under circumcision.  It exists and persists
**because it is reimbursed.**  It's easy money for the OB/GYNs -- what
I like to call "A bounty on foreskins."  Period.  Reimbursement for
circumcision is a relic from an antiquated health-care delivery system
left over from the era of the World Wars.  Everywhere that this system
has been overhauled, particularly where it has become a single-payer
system, infant circumcision has virtually disappeared.

Thus, where Steve's and Yves's families are concerned in Canada, Steve
is in fact the one (somewhat) LESS likely to be cut.  Something to
think about.

Relentlessly,

Martin
