    <h2>Rationalizing Circumcision: An Exercise in Alternate
    Reality</h2>

    <p><i>"Circumcision" is an age-old euphemism for penile
    reduction surgery. For the past hundred years or so, America
    has been a largely circumcised society. It is a peculiar
    cultural trend; but one which could easily have gone down a
    different path! What sort of society might the Americans have
    had?</i></p>

    <p><i>No flames please. This is just something to think
    about... an interesting comparison. Of course I'm not equating
    the two procedures, but the human rights issues that would be
    involved are identical in both cases. Boys and girls are equal
    under the Constitution, under God, under the Law and under the
    United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.</i></p>

    <h3>Rationalizing Circumcision: Contemporary America.</h3>

    <p>We have just had a beautiful baby boy, and are intending to
    have him circumcised.</p>

    <p>The main reason we made this decision is that in America
    they have been routinely removing newborn baby boys' foreskins
    for over 100 years, and it has become the norm in our culture.
    Boys want to look like their fathers! Besides, "little boys are
    circumcised".</p>

    <p>One other reason we decided to have the procedure done is
    the risk of penile cancer. We have heard that if circumcision
    is not done at birth, the man will have to undergo it later in
    life, which is a painful operation. It is much easier to do a
    little snip at birth when it is not a problem.</p>

    <p>Anyways, men do not need their foreskins. They can still
    have sex.</p>

    <p>It is the right of the parents to decide whether or not
    their son will grow up with a foreskin. Besides, I have yet to
    meet any man who says he has felt harmed by circumcision.
    Anybody who says so must be crazy.</p>

    <h3>Rationalizing Breastcision: Alternate Reality.</h3>

    <p>We have just had a beautiful baby daughter, and are
    intending to have her breastcised.</p>

    <p>The main reason we made this decision is that in America
    they have been routinely removing newborn baby girls' breast
    tissue for over 100 years, and it has become the norm in our
    culture. Women want to look like their mothers! Besides,
    "little girls are breastcised".</p>

    <p>One other reason we decided to have the procedure done is
    the risk of breast cancer. We have heard that if breastcision
    is not done at birth, the woman will have to undergo mastectomy
    later in life, which is a painful operation. It is much easier
    to remove the little bit of breast tissue at birth when it is
    not a problem.</p>

    <p>Anyways, women do not need their breasts. Babies are much
    better off drinking baby formula from a bottle, which has been
    scientifically formulated (by doctors!) to contain all of the
    nutrients that they could ever need. There are a gazillion
    studies to show this.</p>

    <p>It is the right of the parents to decide whether or not
    their daughter will grow up with breasts. Besides, I have yet
    to meet any woman who says she has felt harmed by breastcision.
    Anybody who says so must be crazy.</p>
