    <h2>Why cut your perfect little baby</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>I am writing this for parents in the hope that they will
    inform themselves fully about circumcision before having the
    procedure performed on their child. Doctors will often
    recommend the procedure without offering any information to the
    parent, contravening the principle of "informed consent". In
    most cases the doctors themselves are not aware of the basic
    facts about the male anatomy and the way it is meant to develop
    and function! My hope is that eventually America and other
    countries will stop circumcising little boys and leave them
    intact, just as is now accepted in Europe and most other parts
    of the world.</p>

    <p>Recently by good fortune I came across the book <a
    href="/pages/reviews/bigelow/">"The Joy of Uncircumcising"</a>
    by Dr. Jim Bigelow. This is not an advertisement for the
    book--you can try to find it in your local public library.
    Despite the title, it is not only a self-help manual for
    circumcised men. It contains much valuable information about
    the procedure of circumcision, its history, its consequences,
    and possible treatments. I would recommend it to all new and
    prospective parents. Citations to support all of my assertions
    here can be found in the medical literature, by looking at this
    book.</p>

    <p>The fact is that circumcision damages the penis and its
    sexual functioning, and severely impairs sexual pleasure for
    the man (and to some extent for the woman as well!) In addition
    it is excruciatingly painful for the infant, just as would be
    any other body damage without anaesthesia.</p>

    <p>The most frequently quoted reason for circumcision that I
    have heard is that `sometimes the foreskin will not retract and
    it has to be done later'. The truth is that only in extremely
    rare cases is this kind of abnormality truly present. The
    foreskin of a normal penis often naturally adheres to the glans
    (the `head' of the penis) for several years after birth,
    sometimes not until puberty or even later.</p>

    <p>This also means that under no circumstances should the
    parent of an uncircumcised child force back his foreskin in
    order to clean under it. It need only be pulled back as far as
    it wants to go and rinsed with water. The child can easily
    learn to do this for himself.</p>

    <p>As for cancer, urinary infections, and STDs, there is no
    scientific evidence that being uncircumcised increases the risk
    of any of these conditions. In Europe, where circumcision is
    not usually performed, the rates of penile cancer, urinary
    tract infections and cervical cancer are all comparable to or
    lower than the rates in the U.S., where approximately 85% of
    sexually active males have been circumcised. And certainly the
    levels of AIDS and other STDs are as high in America as in
    Europe. Of course I am not claiming any causal connection
    between circumcision and disease. This needs to be studied
    further.</p>

    <p>Although the number is declining, over 3000 circumcisions
    are still being performed in the US each and every day. Please,
    inform yourself! The facts about circumcision are not commonly
    available in North America. Unfortunately a great deal of
    ignorance still exists, both in the general population and the
    medical community. The truth must be told, however painful it
    may be.</p>
