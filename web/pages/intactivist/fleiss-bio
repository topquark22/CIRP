In response to Lawrence Ferretti's inquiry:

I am not personally familiar with the Townsend Letter.  From what is available
on the Web, it appears to be a journal which deals with issues related to diet,
the environment and alternative medical treatments.  While it is not a
"prestigeous medical journal," that does not detract from the value of the
article by Fleiss and Hodges.  What is unfortunate is that the mainstream
medical journals would be unlikely to ever print such an article.

Dr. Fleiss has written a number of letters on circumcision to "prestigeous
medical journals," successfully getting some published.  A list of his letters
appears below.  He is a 1962 graduate of the University of California Medical
School at Irvine who also holds a degee in public health.  He is Board
Certified by the American Board of Pediatrics.  As of 1994 (the date of my
reference book), he held the position of Assistant Clinical Professor at the
University of Southern California Medical School and was on the staff of the
Los Angeles Children's Hospital.  Also as of 1994, he was in private practice
at 1884 Hillhurst Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90027-4408.  Telephone (310) 664-1977.

As Dr. Fleiss' co-author does not appear to be a physician, I have no
information on him.  The article however, appears to be thoroughly researched
and of a quality that would qualify it for a "real" medical journal.  They
would likely reject it as "unbalanced" or overly "partisan."  But how can any
honest physician who has researched the facts not be partisan on this issue?
This contribution of Fleiss and Hodges deserve to be acknowledged and
applauded.
