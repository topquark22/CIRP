In 1989, the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision reversed
its earlier (1985) position on circumcision and stated that circumcision had
"potential benefits and advantages" (Pediatrics 1989;84:388-391). Newborn
circumcision unequivocally protects males against UTI (urinary tract
infections) in childhood and in adult life (Current Problems in Pediatrics
1992;22:424-431; Journal of the American Medical Association 1992;267:679-681).
HIV (AIDS virus) infection is more prevalent in the uncircumcised (New England
Journal of Medicine 1988;319:274-278;  Lancet 1989;2:403-407; Int J
Epidemiology 1990;19:693-697). The 1989 AAP task force also found that
newborn circumcision prevents sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood.
Urologists can't understand why ALL newborn males aren't circumcised (Journal
of Urology 1973;110:79-80).

Comments:
1. The AAP did not "reverse" its position in 1989, it merely
modified it. Backon omits "...as well as inherent disadvantages and
risks" (aap.txt).
2. "Newborn circumcision unequivocally protects males against UTI"
is false. There is controversy over these results (altschul.html).
3. The 1989 AAP task force did *not* find that newborn circumcision
prevents sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood. If this were true
then circumcision would be a universal panacea against STD! The AAP
merely recognized that some published studies had established *correlation*
between intact men and a 2 to 3-fold increase in STD infection. This can
be explained by other means, such as increased sexual activity in intact
males.
4. Urologists see advanced cases of penile disease (which could perhaps
have been prevented by circumcision). This is no reason to circumcise every
baby boy, because most will not have such problems.
5. Dr. Josh Backon is a cardiologist, not a pediatrician or urologist,
and from the above errors he is clearly unfamiliar with the literature on
circumcision. He is from Israel, where (as in the US) most boys are
circumcised, and it is virtually unknown how to treat problems of the foreskin
other than via circumcision.

Below are excerpts from two papers I've come across.

From "Report of the Task Force on Circumcision", PEDIATRICS Vol 84 No 4 August
1989 pages 388-391, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics:

        . . .  The overall annual incidence of cancer of the penis in US
        men has been estimated to be 0.7 to 0.9 per 100 000 men and the
        mortality rate is as high as 25%.  This condition occurs almost
        exclusively in uncircumcised men.  In five major reported series
        since 1932, not one man had been circumcised neonatally.  The
        predicted lifetime risk of cancer of the penis developing in an
        uncircumcised man has been estimated at 1 in 600 men in the United
        States; in Denmark, the estimate is 1 in 909 men.

	. . .  A 1982 series of infants with urinary tract infections noted
	that males preponderated, contrary to female preponderance later in
	life, and that 95% of the infected boys were uncircumcised.
	Beginning in 1985, studies conduced at US Army hospitals involving
	more than 200 000 men showed a greater than tenfold increase in
	urinary tract infections in uncircumcised compared with circumcised
	male infants;  moreover, as the rate of circumcision declined
	throughout the years, the incidence of urinary tract infection
	increased.  In another army hospital study, infants were examined
	in the first month of life and it was concluded that the high
	incidence of urinary tract infection in uncircumcised boys was
	accompanied by a similarly increased incidence of other significant
	infection, including bacteremia and meningitis . . .

	. . .  Infants undergoing circumcision without anesthesia
	demonstrate physiologic responses suggesting that they are
	experienceing pain.  . . .  Behavioral changes include a cry
	pattern indicating distress during the circumcision procedure and
	changes in activity (irritability, varying sleep patterns) and in
	infant-maternal interaction for the first few hours after
	circumcision.  These behavioral changes are transient and disappear
	within 24 hours after surgery.

From Wiswell, Thomas E, "Routine Neonatal Circumcision: A Reappraisal", Armed
Forces Physician, Volume 41, No 3, March 1990, pages 859-863. [Dr.  Thomas E.
Wiswell, Lieutenant Colonel, Medical Corps, United States Army, is chief of
the neonatology department at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington,
D.C.]

        . . .  The 1975 Report of the Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision
        reinforced (the author's) longstanding personal opposition to the
        procedure. (The author) actively participated in efforts to reduce
        the circumcision frequency rate.  Almost serendipitously, however,
        in the early 1980s uncircumcised boys were found to be at
        increased risk of urinary track infections during infancy.
        Despite these findings, (the author) did not recommend routine
        prepuce (foreskin) removal.  However, after careful reflection and
        objective review of the voluminous literature on circumcision,
        (the author) have come to a different conclusion, and (the author)
        now endorse routine neonatal circumcision.  Moreover, the American
        Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision has recently
        released a new report that differs substantially from the 1975
        statement.  The 1989 report delineates "potential medical benefits
        and advantages" of newborn circumcision.

        Several issues have convinced (the author) of the benefits of
        neonatal circumcision: (1) the prevention of urinary tract
        infections and their sequelae; (2) the prevention of penile
        cancer; (3) the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases; (4)
        the low risk of complications from the procedure; (5) the lower
        incidence of penile problems among circumcised boys; (6) the
        recent evidence that circumcision protects against human
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; (7) the cost-benefit from
        performing the procedure during the neonatal period rather than in
        childhood or adulthood, and (8) the lack of evidence for the
        hypothesis that "optimal" penile hygiene prevents adverse sequelae
        of noncircumcision.

	Circumcised boys are ten to 39 times less likely than
	noncircumcised boys to have urinary tract infections during
	infancy.  In a population of more than 400,000 male and female
	infants studied during a ten-year period, we found the early
	preponderance of urinary tract infections in males to be primarily
	due to infections among uncircumcised boys.  . . .

	It has been estimated that if no circumcisions were performed in
	the United States, at least 20,000 additional cases of
	pyelonephritis would occur each year.  . . .

	Urinary tract infections in newbornds are not benign.  We found
	that more than 36 percent of the 88 boys less than one month old
	with urinary tract infections had concomitant bacteremia with the
	same organism.  Furthermore, three of these infants had concurrent
	meningitis, two had reanal failure and two died.  According to
	Littlewood, as many as 11 percent of children with urinary tract
	infections during the first month of life may die.  Long-term
	sequelae of urinary tract infections in children can be serious;
	10 to 15 percent of infected infants subsequently demonstrate renal
	scarring.  Of those with parenchymal scarring, approximately 10
	percent develop hypertension and 2 to 3 percent progress to renal
	insufficiency requiring dialysis or transplantation.

	Penile cancer is the only malignancy that can be prevented by a
	prophylactic procedure--neonatal circumcision.  Of the more than
	60,000 cases of penile cancer that have occurred in the United
	States since 1930, fewer than ten have involved circumcised men.
	. . .  more than 1,000 men develop the carcinoma each year, and 225
	to 317 die from it annually.

	Virtually all sexually transmitted diseases occur more frequently
	among uncircumcised men than among circumcised men.  . . .

	. . .  Serious complications from routine prepuce (foreskin)
	removal are infrequent.  . . .  Atypical complications of the
	procedure (e.g., glans loss, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome)
	occur infrequently.

	Studies that reviewed histories from more than 2 million circumcised
	boys disclosed only a single death that could be attributed to
	circumcision.  . . .

	Herzog and Alvarez found that uncircumcised boys from four months
	to 12 years of age are more likely to have "penile problems" than
	circumcised boys.  . . .

	. . .  Simonsen and co-workers found uncircumcised men to be more
	than nine times as likely to become infected after HIV exposure as
	circumcised men.  . . .

	The 1975 Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision stated that "optimal
	hygiene" could confer as much protection as neonatal circumcision.
	This was pure speculation.  To date, no studies have supported the
	assertion that good hygiene averts the potential complications of
	the uncircumcised state.

While I personally do not need medical justification for the brit milah, I
find the medical evidence as presented in these two papers, and especially the
large sample sizes, to very compellingly support neonatal circumcision.  I
would be interested in seeing medical evidence that contradicts this.

flaws. It directly contradicts common medical knowledge about UTI and is
considered controversial within the medical community. gtf]
========================================================================
Have you ever done a circumcision ? Trust me: getting circumcised at  8 days
is a LOT less destructive and savage than a penile amputation for a tumor
that's quite common in uncircumcised males. You can read it in STEWART'S
OPERATIVE UROLOGY, 2nd ed. or Hashmat & Das' THE PENIS or Crawford & Das'
CURRENT GENITOURINARY CANCER SURGERY.

I'd recommend you read it on an empty stomach :-)

Urologists cannot understand why ALL newborns aren't circumcised (Journal
of Urology 1973;110:79-80).

[Urologists often see penile cancer, infections, etc. in their advanced
stages, which can be quite unpleasant ailments. I find it small wonder that
a number of them hold this opinion, despite the overwhelming evidence contraindicating circ. --gtf]

Newborn circumcision unequivocally protects against urinary tract infection
in childhood and adulthood (Current Problems in Pediatrics 1992;22:424-31;
Journal of the American Medical Association 1992;267:679-81). In 1989, the
American Academy of Pediatrics Taskforce on Circumcision reversed its earlier
decision and declared that circumcision has potential benefits and advantages
(Pediatrics 1989;84:388-91). HIV (AIDS virus) is more prevalent in
uncircumcised males (New England Journal of Medicine 1988;319:274-78;
Lancet 1989;2:403-407; Int J Epidemiology 1990;19:693-97). HIV is much more
common in females with uncircumcised partners (AIDS 1994;8:93-99). The role
of circumcision in HIV prevention was recently reviewed (AIDS 1994;8:153-160).

> The foreskin was created by G-d to give man protection

Following circumcision, the surface epithelia of the glans develops a
protective keratin layer and acts as a form of natural condom (New England J
of Medicine 1987;316:1546-47).

[There is no evidence that this `condom' (!) prevents against AIDS or any other
infection. The urethral meatus (opening) is not so keratinized and so
still leaves a means of entry of pathogens. The keratin layer also reduces
sensitivity of the glans dramatically. --gtf]
