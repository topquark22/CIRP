The First International Symposium on Circumcision (ISC) was 
organized in 1989 as a  forum for leading world authorities on the 
medical, cultural, psychological, religious, legal and sexual aspects of 
genital mutilation.  The Symposium specifically addressed the practice 
of routine medical neonatal male circumcision in North America.  It 
became apparent, however, that we could not isolate infant male 
circumcision in North America from what is done to children 
worldwide.  Genital mutilation is primarily directed at children  --  
male and female  --  and, with this mutilation, a very definite part 
of human sexuality is irretrievably lost.  On the final day of the 
conference, March 3, 1989, the General Assembly unanimously passed this 
comprehensive resolution:

     ------------------------------------------------------------
                DECLARATION OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL 
                     SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUMCISION
     ------------------------------------------------------------


     We recognize the inherent right of all human beings to an intact
     body.  Without religious or racial prejudice, we affirm this
     basic human right.

     We recognize the foreskin, clitoris and labia are normal,
     functional body parts.

     Parents and/or guardians do not have the right to consent to the
     surgical removal or modification of their children's normal
     genitalia.

     Physicians and other health-care providers have a responsibility
     to refuse to remove or mutilate normal body parts.

     The only persons who may consent to medically unnecessary
     procedures upon themselves are the individuals who have 
     reached the age of consent (adulthood), and then only after 
     being fully informed about the risks and benefits of the 
     procedure.

     We categorically state that circumcision has unrecognized
     victims.

     In view of the serious physical and psychological consequences
     that we have witnessed in victims of circumcision, we hereby
     oppose the performance of a single additional unnecessary
     foreskin, clitoral, or labial amputation procedure.

     We oppose any further studies which involve the performance of
     the circumcision procedure upon unconsenting minors.  We 
     support any further studies which involve identification of 
     the effects of circumcision.

     Physicians and other health-care providers do have a
     responsibility to teach hygiene and the care of normal body 
     parts and explain their normal anatomical and physiological 
     development and function throughout life.

     We place the medical community on notice that it is being held
     accountable for misconstruing the scientific database available
     on human circumcision in the world today.

     Physicians who practice routine circumcisions are violating the
     first maxim of medical practice, "PRIMUM NON NOCERE," 
     "First, Do No Harm," and anyone practicing genital mutilation is 
     violating Article V of the United Nations Universal Declaration 
     of Human Rights:  "NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECTED TO TORTURE OR TO CRUEL,
     INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT..."
     ------------------------------------------------------------


The content of the Second ISC was intentionally broadened.  Genital 
mutilation was considered from a global perspective, religious 
influences were addressed in greater depth, the structure and function 
of the foreskin were described in detail and foreskin restoration was 
considered for the first time.  As a result of the presentation, two 
books:  Say No To Circumcision! and the Joy of Uncircumcising!, were 
published.  To date, both books have been reviewed by the journal of 
the American Medical Association and the latter has also been reviewed 
by the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the Journal of 
Nurse-Midwifery.  The British Medical Journal and the British Journal 
of Urology have scheduled reviews of The Joy of Uncircumcising! in 
1994.

The scope and focus of the ISC has changed in response to the social 
and political environment in which it is held, e.g., the new Oregon 
Health Plan omitted coverage for routine neonatal circumcision and 
Congresswoman Pat Schroeder introduced a bill to prohibit female 
genital mutilation in the U.S.  The content and scope of the Third ISC 
will reflect this increased awareness.  Authorities from England, 
France, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Switzerland, Egypt, Africa and the 
United States will convene to consider the genital mutilation of 
children worldwide, regardless of its origin and intended purpose.  
Men and women have come forward to document the harm they have 
personally experienced.  Their collective voice has been heard.  
During the Symposium, Soraya Mire's documentary on female genital 
mutilation, Fire Eyes, will be featured, and a press conference will 
be held by Tim Hammond to announce the revealing results of his 
ground-breaking Harm Documentation Survey.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS
----------------------------------------


AUSTRALIA:      In the first case of its kind, a Children's Court 
                magistrate last December labeled female genital 
                mutilation a "surgical intrusion which really amounts 
                to an assault."  She said it was evident that two 
                young girls, on whom the procedure had been performed 
                overseas, had suffered "significant harm" and that 
                their parents had failed to protect them from the 
                injury.  The girls were placed under a protection 
                order until the case resumes this Spring.  (Herald Sun)

ENGLAND:        A private consultant who agreed to perform an illegal 
                female circumcision for 400 pounds cash was found 
                guilty on November 25 of serious professional 
                misconduct and barred from practice.  Professor Sir 
                Herbert Duthie, chairman of the General Medical 
                Council's professional conduct committee, told 
                Dr. Farooque Hayder Siddique:  "The committee is 
                appalled by your willingness to perform an abhorrent, 
                illegal and mutilating operation with no possible 
                medical benefit to a patient."  (The Guardian)

ISRAEL:         Commenting on post-mortem circumcision performed 
                without the permission of the family, Israel's 
                Ashkenazi chief rabbi Yisrael Lau said, "The chief 
                rabbinate sees circumcision as a privilege and not 
                something that should be forced on anyone."  Former 
                Shepardi chief rabbi Mordechai Eliahu says 
                circumcising a Jewish corpse would "allow the person 
                to enter the Garden of Eden," but added that family 
                consent should be obtained, and it should not be done 
                if the man had refused circumcision while alive.

                Israel's Ministry of Religions dismissed kidnapping 
                charges in October against a rabbi who mistakenly 
                circumcised a baby boy without the mother's consent.  
                The panel determined the rabbi circumcised the baby 
                in "good faith," even though the baby was not Jewish.  
                (Contra Costs Times)

UNITED STATES:  The Federal Prohibition of Female Genital 
                Mutilation Act of 1993 (H.R. 3247), introduced on 
                October 7 by Congresswomen Pat Schroeder and 
                Barbara Collins, has been referred to the Judiciary 
                and Energy and Commerce Committees.  Encourage 
                your representative to endorse this important human 
                rights bill.  Once this bill has passed, it will be 
                much easier to introduce a bill regarding routine 
                infant male circumcision.

South Carolina: State Representative John James (Bubber) Snow, 
                Jr., on January 12, introduced House Resolution 44-87, 
                which requests a reevaluation of existing policies 
                pertaining to circumcision and episiotomy and HR 47-10, 
                on February 9, which would outlaw FGM.  Anyone who 
                circumcises, excises or infibulates a woman younger than 
                18 could be sentenced to five years in prison.

Portland, Oregon:   A deportation hearing was held on February 7 
                    for Lydia Oluloro, 32, who is fighting to have her 
                    immigration regularized in order to protect her 
                    4 and 6 year-old daughters.  If forced to return 
                    to Nigeria, the girls, who are American citizens, 
                    will be subjected to genital mutilation, as was 
                    their mother.  The decision on Oluloro's case, 
                    which has received national attention on ABC's 
                    Nightline, in U.S. News and World Report (Feb 7) 
                    and Time Magazine (Feb 21), will be announced March 23.

Oregon:    After years of statewide debate and federal scrutiny, the 
           new Oregon Health Plan, which excludes coverage for routine 
           male infant circumcision, went into effect on February 1.

The World Health Organization:  

A Resolution of the Executive Board of the WHO recommended to the 
Forty-seventh World Health Assembly "2.(2) to establish national 
policies and programmes that will effectively, and with legal 
instruments, abolish female genital mutilation...and other harmful 
practices affecting the health of women and children" (24 January 1994).
