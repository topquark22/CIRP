From the Orange County Register, Tuesday, April 12, 1994:

*Circumcision causes prolonged, severe pain*

Circumcision causes severe and persistant pain that lasts for
at least two hours but most infants get no pain relievers for
the procedure, a study said Manday.
Researchers at Rochester General Hospital and the University of
Rochester said they based their findings on a study of 67
newborns before and after circumcision.  The study appears in
this month's issue of Pediatrics.
Infants in the study showed increases in crying and heart and
respiratory rates after the procedure.
