Mr. Russell Zangger

Larchwood, Iowa

Dear Mr. Zangger:

I am a 64 year old male who requested circumcision at the age of
22, believing the old wives tales about cancer, disease, etc. 
Now that I have the real facts at hand I regret that decision
every day of my life.  I would like to thank you and your
organization for helping to stop this outrage.

I recently became a grandfather, and thank God I had the
perseverance needed to convince my daughter and son-in-law of the
truth about circumcision in time:  that it is a senseless,
painful, abusive operation that has no place whatever in a
rational society.

Unfortunately, ignorance still has the upper hand.  I pray every
night that people will start taking heed of societies like yours
and work to abolish circumcision from the face of the earth.

Sincerely,
