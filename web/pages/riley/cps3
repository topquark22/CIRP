ROUTINE CIRCUMCISION


In 1975, the CPS Foetus and Newborn Committee carefully reviewed
the pros and cons of circumcision and published the conclusion
that routine circumcision was not necessary.

In 1982, the Committee saw no reason to modify the previous
statement.  However, they advocated that a completely balanced
view be available from the physician in order to make a decision
regarding the necessity for circumcision.

In 1988, a growing concern arose due to a report by T.E. Wiswell
(see 1 and 2 below) which showed a decreased incidence of urinary
tract infections in circumcised male infants.  Due to these
concerns the Board asked the Foetus and Newborn and the
Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committees to study the
report.

As the present information available concerning the risks of
urinary tract infections and transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases in relation to circumcision are not sufficiently
compelling to justify a change in policy, the Committees maintain
that no change should be made to the CPS recommendations
concerning routine circumcision.

We will continue to monitor the situation.
