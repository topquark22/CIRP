Got an interesting reply with lots of medical references to my comment
on circumcision that I sent to Gaynet. Here it is.  I'll also post my reply.
----------------------------Original message----------------------------

I apologize for uploading this very long list of medical journal
references on cicumcision and the risk of HIV transmission but
unlike much of the discussion on this subject, HIV transmission is
very much a Gay Issue.  Please note that I am ambivalent on the
issue of circumcision (my girlfriend, who is a medical practitioner
(PA), and I have discussed it and can't decide on what to do if
we should have a son).  I certainly don't recommend circumcision
simply for the sake of HIV prevention (safer sex is much easier and
much more effective).  The search for these references were done as
objectively as possible through MedLine, the top searching facility
for medical people.  I also severely edited the results and
headings to only include the relevant passages.  Edited sections
are indicated by "..."  If my objectivity in editing is in doubt,
you can 1) look up the references yourself in the cited journal, 2)
do the same search in MedLine (many universities have it), 3) ask
me to upload the unedited list to you.  I'd be very curious to read
references to the contrary as well (my mind is not made up on
this), so please upload them if you know of any.  Happy reading.

If possible, please provide a reference for this San Francisco
report.  I've never heard that uncut men were more desirable as sex
partners in the US, in the 70's or otherwise.  I encountered just
the opposite in a very informal and unscientific survey we did in
a grad course I took on sexuality (1987).  I'd be very interested
in reading this, and how they were able to reach their conclusions.
Thanks!  As for the inequality disappearing, please read the
following ...

Searches were done on "HIV and (CIRCUMCISION or CIRCUMCISED)"
through MEDLINE (1/87-2/94), HEALTH and the NYTIMES.  Only 1 study
concluded that that no correlation was found (it is listed last for
accessibility), while 13 disagreed with you, with 5 likely to
disagree (I will get the actual articles on Monday).  A search on
"FINK-A" yielded all kinds of studies on tumors, fertility,
geriatrics and healthcare policy, but nothing related to this.  The
study supposedly cited by Fink (someone who I've never heard of in
my years of working in AIDS), and discredited by you, was conducted
by Bwayo et al, but its verity hardly affects the positive
conclusions of the 12 other studies, which don't suffer from a
small sample size and are generally well-randomized.  Regardless,
despite your implication that there was only one study showing a a
positive relationship between having a foreskin and HIV
transmission, no one reputable I know of has used the Bwayo study
exclusively to support their case; I wasn't even aware of the study
when I did HIV counseling.  Many other much better studies exist.

13 of the following medical journal abstracts either directly
concluded that the lack of circumcision is a risk factor (most), or
otherwise mention it as a given risk factor.

5 search results had no abstracts although the titles suggest that
they too found a correlation.

1 study agreed with your assertion. (included at the end)

===========================

[This study is especially interesting because:  1) The sample is
English, which shares the same epidemiological pattern (Pattern I)
as the US (unlike most African countries which display Pattern II).
2) England has a large pool of uncircumcised men, making it ideal
to extrapolate to the US, which has relatively few.  3) "A
culmulative 43% of uncircumcised men who acquired an ulcer
seroconverted to HIV-1 after a single sexual exposure."]

AB: The relationship between HIV seroprevalence and the proportion
of uncircumcised males in African countries is examined to
determine whether circumcision practices play a role in explaining
the large existing variation in the sizes of African HIV epidemics.
A review of the anthropological literature yielded estimates of
circumcision practices for 409 African ethnic groups from which
corresponding national estimates were derived. HIV seroprevalence
rates in the capital cities were used as indicators of the relative
level of HIV infection of countries. The correlation between these
two variables in 37 African countries was high (R = 0.9; P less
than 0.001). This finding is consistent with existing clinic-based
studies that indicate a lower risk of HIV infection among
circumcised males.

seroprevalence in Africa, we investigated the association between
the practice of male in Africa, we investigated the association
between the practice of male circumcision at a societal level and
HIV seroprevalence. Male circumcision practices for over 700
African societies were identified, and HIV seroprevalence in
general adult populations from 140 distinct locations in 41
countries was obtained. In locations where male circumcision is
practised, HIV seroprevalence was considerably lower than in areas
where it is not practised. This study supports the hypothesis that
lack of circumcision in males is a risk factor for HIV
transmission. ...
