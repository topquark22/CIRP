    <p>In a new era of children's rights, this independently
    produced two-part social issue documentary compassionately
    explores genital mutilation of unconsenting children,

    responsibly addresses these vital issues long overdue for inner
    reflection and cultural self-examination:</p>

    <h2>What People Are Saying...</h2>

    <p>"<i>Whose Body, Whose Rights?</i> will compel every health
    care professional, especially doctors and nurses, in taking to
    heart their oath - Do No Harm."</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Norma Wilcox, RN, University of California at San
      Francisco Medical School</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"I had presumed that men upset by their circumcision had a
    mental disorder. That impression was dispelled by this video's
    wealth of factual data about truly natural male sexual
    functioning and its rational look at some of the very adverse
    outcomes caused by circumcision."</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Louanne Cole, PhD, Sex therapist and <b>San Francisco
      Examiner</b> "Sex Matters" columnist</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"I know that stopping genital mutilation is the single most
    important thing we can do to insure the physical and
    psychological health of men."</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Jed Diamond, LCSW, author, <b>The Warrior's Journey
      Home: Healing Men, Healing the Planet</b></i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"Teachers of male health and sexuality courses will find
    this to be a valuable tool that raises important questions
    concerning the right of males to make informed decisions about
    their own bodies."</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Jan Zlotnick, RN, Health Educator, City College of San
      Francisco</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"<i>Whose Body, Whose Rights?</i> reveals the painful human
    rights realization that reproductive integrity and sexual
    health are repeatedly violated through destructive sexual
    surgeries attacking the most vulnerable members of
    society."</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Professor Anastasios Zavales, Reporting Officer to the
      UN Working Group of International Experts on Violations of
      Genital Mutilation</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"This film focuses squarely and necessarily on the question:
    Does a child's body belong to his parents or to him?"</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Jim Senter, Executive Director, National Child Rights
      Alliance</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"A unique, eye-opening film that reveals an issue too often
    ignored - infant pain. It should be seen by all practitioners
    and students in the fields of psychology and psychiatry."</p>

      &amp; Perinatal Psychology and Health</i></li>
