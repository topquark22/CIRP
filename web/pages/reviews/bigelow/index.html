        "This book...adds a new dimension to the argument against
        routine circumcision...The evolution of elective
        circumcision from a method to control masturbation and
        other `immoral' sexual behaviours to an accepted, routine
        medical modality provides an interesting discussion...The
        psychological and sexual benefits of restoring the foreskin
        are expounded..."

      <blockquote>
        "[The book] is based on three premises: that infant
        circumcision is performed without consent; that
        circumcision diminishes penile sensation and therefore
        reduces sexual enjoyment; and that techniques of prepucial
        reconstruction can restore lost sensitivity to the glans
        penis...As Dr. Bigelow forcefully points out, there is
        little evidence that early circumcision confers any health
        gain to the individual in the longer term."

      <blockquote>
        "Bigelow's book is...an important statement on a theme
        about which little is usually said, and on which most of us
        are ignorant. Urologists should read this book, which
        should make them consider alternatives...before offering
        circumcision... and take seriously the wishes of the
        troubled patient who asks to have his mutilation
        corrected."

      <blockquote>
        "Jim Bigelow provides a profound service for the general
        public, for parents, physicians, and hopefully, most of
        all, for future generations of infant boys. In this
        multi-faceted, well-researched and clearly written book, he
        leaves no stone unturned...[It] provides abundant facts and
        information necessary to include circumcision in any
        discussion of child abuse."

      <blockquote>
        "In reading this book, one is forced to examine his/her own
        feelings about circumcision...[It] challenges us to think
        about new issues such as men's rights and foreskin
        restoration."

      <blockquote>
        "Most plastic surgeons will be surprised and many will be
        distressed at the information and arguments presented in
        this book...Particularly valuable are the insights on why
        some men feel so strongly about the desirability of the
        uncircumcised penis...It is an excellent introduction to a
        subject too long absent in plastic surgical literature."

      <h2>The joy of uncircumcising. (reconstructing a penile
      foreskin) (Personal View) (Column)</h2>

      <p>"Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a
      yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers
      nor we have been able to bear?" With these words St Peter,
      himself a circumised Jew, won the argument against compulsory
      circumcision of Gentile converts to Christianity nearly 2000
      years ago. Clearly he knew that that there was a penalty to
      be paid for being circumcised. This fact seems to have been
      forgotten by the medical profession during the past 100
      years, when circumcision has been widely practised on
      children as treatment and sometimes as prophylaxis for
      phimosis. It has even been used as a treatment for
      masturbation, once considered a dangerous disease. When you
      look up circumcision in modern surgical textbooks you find
      the anatomy of the foreskin well described but no mention of
      its function. You find the indications for circumcision and
      how to carry it out, but no mention of the consequences.</p>

      <p>Like many boys of my generation in Britain, I was
      circumcised in infancy by a doctor. I grew up knowing that
      something had been removed from my penis as my older brother
      was intact, but I was told that this did not matter. The
      glans was always uncomfortable when rubbed by clothing
      throughout childhood and on into adult life, so that I always
      looked for tight supportive underwear to minimise friction.
      The discomfort was poorly localised, and it is only recently
      that I have realised that my intolerance of boxer shorts was
      the direct result of circumcision.</p>

      <p>The shaft skin was tight during erection, though I never
      thought of this as abnormal as I had nothing to compare wiht.
      Masturbation was often accompanied by laceration of the skin,
      so that I learnt to masturbate wearing a condom. I married 25
      years ago and at first there were problems of dyspareunia
      from time to time which we attributed to vaginal dryness, as
      I considered myself normal. We overcame this by use of
      artificial lubricants. As time went on we explored ways of
      maximising our sexual enjoyment. I observed that there was
      remarkably little sensitivity in the glans, the skin of which
      seemed to thicken with advancing years. I remarked on this to
      my wife, who thought it strange. It was when I observed that
      the most sensitive part of my penis was the skin between the
      circumcision scar and the glans, that I began to realise for
      the first time how much I had been harmed by circumcision.
      This skin was the remnant of the inner lining of the
      foreskin, the remainder of which had of course been
      amputated. I assumed that there was nothing whatever to be
      done about this tragedy and I resolved to make the most of
      what was left.</p>

      <p>A few months ago I saw an article in a newspaper about
      foreskin restoration without surgery, using the method
      described by Jim Bigelow in The Joy of Uncircumcising.
      Restore Your Birthright and Maximise Sexual Pleasure
      (published by Hourglass Book Publishing, 1992). I started
      stretching the penile skin with surgical tape and weights,
      and sent for the book. The first few days were difficult and
      often uncomfortable, as I had little guidance from the
      newspaper article on how to apply the tape without
      discomfort. I persevered and every time something was painful
      I changed it until it was comfortable. As the first week went
      by it got easier, and by the end of one week I decided to
      continue my trial into the second week. Bigelow's book
      arrived from California on the Monday of the second week.
      This was most helpful.</p>

      <p>I carried on taping and at the end of the tenth day a most
      unexpected thing happened. I was moved to find that with my
      glans protected by skin held in place by tape I was more
      comfortable than I had ever been before in my life. All
      discomfort caused by contact with clothing had vanished; I no
      longer cared what sort of underwear I wore. In fact it was
      obvious that what I had been seeking all the time in the
      underwear department was a foreskin and now I had found it,
      and it was an incredible relief. It occurred to me that
      perhaps the human male's nervous system is wired in such a
      way that covering the glans causes release of a transmitter
      in some pleasure giving part of the brain, though I have no
      evidence for this. I knew that I would never go back to the
      barbaric practice of leaving the glans exposed. I had either
      to continue with the slow non-surgical method or submit to
      skin grafting. I decided to avoid surgery as I felt my penis
      had been cut enough already.</p>

      <p>Since then the benefits described by Bigelow have gradully
      unfolded. The glans became softer and steadily more
      sensitive, with great increase in sexual enjoyment.
      Furthermore after about ten weeks my wife and I both noticed
      that intercourse became much easier and almost frictionless,
      due to the expansion of the skin. The foreskin provides a
      reserve of skin so that on the natural penis there is plenty
      of slack and during intercourse the penile skin can cling to
      the vaginal wall while all movement occurs within the layers
      of the penis itself. When a man is tightly circumcised as I
      had been this is impossible, and all the movement occurs
      between the penis and the vagina. Undoubtedly this must often
      lead to complaints of vaginal dryness. I look forward to the
      day when I shall feel my foreskin slide over my glans during
      intercourse, and of course to the day when tape is no longer
      needed to keep the foreskin in place. I realise that a
      restored foreskin will never be quite the same as the natural
      one. How many nerve endings have been lost? The frenulum will
      not function to hold the foreskin in place. However it will
      be the best foreskin I can ever hope to have.</p>

      <p>It is clear to me that it is time that doctors and medical
      students were taught that the foreskin has functions. It is
      as important to the penis as the eyelid is to the eye. It
      maintains a soft, moist and sensitive glans, protecting it
      from abrasions. While the outer layer of the foreskin is
      composed of similar skin to that of the shaft, its inner
      layer is exquisitely sensitive. Finally it provides a reserve
      of skin essential for friction free intercourse. If doctors
      understood these functions they would be reluctant to
      amputate it and would develop conservative methods of
      managing phimosis, rather than mutilating children for
      life.</p>
