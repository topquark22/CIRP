     The joy of uncircumcising. (reconstructing a penile foreskin)
     (Personal View) (Column)

   therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck
   of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to
   bear?" With these words St Peter, himself a circumised Jew, won the
   argument against compulsory circumcision of Gentile converts to
   Christianity nearly 2000 years ago. Clearly he knew that that there
   was a penalty to be paid for being circumcised. This fact seems to
   have been forgotten by the medical profession during the past 100
   years, when circumcision has been widely practised on children as
   treatment and sometimes as prophylaxis for phimosis. It has even been
   used as a treatment for masturbation, once considered a dangerous
   disease. When you look up circumcision in modern surgical textbooks
   you find the anatomy of the foreskin well described but no mention of
   its function. You find the indications for circumcision and how to
   carry it out, but no mention of the consequences.

   Like many boys of my generation in Britain, I was circumcised in
   infancy by a doctor. I grew up knowing that something had been removed
   from my penis as my older brother was inact, but I was told that this
   did not matter. The glans was always uncomfortable when rubbed by
   clothing throughout childhood and on into adult life, so that I always
   looked for tight supportive underwear to minimise friction. The
   discomfort was poorly localised, and it is only recently that I have
   realised that my intolerance of boxer shorts was the direct result of
   circumcision.

   The shaft skin was tight during erection, though I never thought of
   this as abnormal as I had nothing to compare wiht. Masturbation was
   often accompanied by laceration of the skin, so that I learnt to
   masturbate wearing a condom. I married 25 years ago and at first there
   were problems of dyspareunia from time to time which we attributed to
   vaginal dryness, as I considered myself normal. We overcame this by
   use of artificial lubricants. As time went on we explored ways of
   maximising our sexual enjoyment. I observed that there was remarkably
   little sensitivity in the glans, the skin of which seemed to thicken
   with advancing years. I remarked on this to my wife, who thought it
   strange. It was when I observed that the most sensitive part of my
   penis was the skin between the circumcision scar and the glans, that I
   began to realise for the first time how much I had been harmed by
   circumcision. This skin was the remnant of the inner lining of the
   foreskin, the remainder of which had of course been amputated. I
   assumed that there was nothing whatever to be done about this tragedy
   and I resolved to make the most of what was left.

   A few months ago I saw an article in a newspaper about foreskin
   restoration without surgery, using the method described by Jim Bigelow
   in The Joy of Uncircumcising. Restore Your Birthright and Maximise
   Sexual Pleasure (published by Hourglass Book Publishing, 1992). I
   started stretching the penile skin with surgical tape and weights, and
   sent for the book. The first few days were difficult and often
   uncomfortable, as I had little guidance from the newspaper article on
   how to apply the tape without discomfort. I persevered and every time
   something was painful I changed it until it was comfortable. As the
   first week went by it got easier, and by the end of one week I decided
   to continue my trial into the second week. Bigelow's book arrived from
   California on the Monday of the second week. This was most helpful.

   I carried on taping and at the end of the tenth day a most unexpected
   thing happened. I was moved to find that with my glans protected by
   skin held in place by tape I was more comfortable than I had ever been
   before in my life. All discomfort caused by contact with clothing had
   vanished; I no longer cared what sort of underwear I wore. In fact it
   was obvious that what I had been seeking all the time in the underwear
   department was a foreskin and now I had found it, and it was an
   incredible relief. It occurred to me that perhaps the human male's
   nervous system is wired in such a way that covering the glans causes
   release of a transmitter in some pleasure giving part of the brain,
   though I have no evidence for this. I knew that I would never go back
   to the barbaric practice of leaving the glans exposed. I had either to
   continue with the slow non-surgical method or submit to skin grafting.
   I decided to avoid surgery as I felt my penis had been cut enough
   already.

   Since then the benefits described by Bigelow have gradully unfolded.
   The glans became softer and steadily more sensitive, with great
   increase in sexual enjoyment. Furthermore after about ten weeks my
   wife and I both noticed that intercourse became much easier and almost
   frictionless, due to the expansion of the skin. The foreskin provides
   a reserve of skin so that on the natural penis there is plenty of
   slack and during intercourse the penile skin can cling to the vaginal
   wall while all movement occurs within the layers of the penis itself.
   When a man is tightly circumcised as I had been this is impossible,
   and all the movement occurs between the penis and the vagina.
   Undoubtedly this must often lead to complaints of vaginal dryness. I
   look forward to the day when I shall feel my foreskin slide over my
   glans during intercourse, and of course to the day when tape is no
   longer needed to keep the foreskin in place. I realise that a restored
   foreskin will never be quite the same as the natural one. How many
   nerve endings have been lost? The frenulum will not function to hold
   the foreskin in place. However it will be the best foreskin I can ever
   hope to have.

   It is clear to me that it is time that doctors and medical students
   were taught that the foreskin has functions. It is as important to the
   penis as the eyelid is to the eye. It maintains a soft, moist and
   sensitive glans, protecting it from abrasions. While the outer layer
   of the foreskin is composed of similar skin to that of the shaft, its
   inner layer is exquisitely sensitive. Finally it provides a reserve of
   skin essential for friction free intercourse. If doctors understood
   these functions they would be reluctant to amputate it and would
   develop conservative methods of managing phimosis, rather than
   mutilating children for life.
