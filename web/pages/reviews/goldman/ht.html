<BLOCKQUOTE>I welcome Ronald Goldman's beautiful and powerful book
on circumcision. It is the most enlightening and dependable examination
of a most important aspect of human life. I hope it will be widely read.
<BR><I>--Ashley Montagu, PhD, anthropologist and author</I>

<P>I always knew that circumcision was a procedure with roots
at a level much deeper than that of a mere "medical" procedure. Finally,
Ronald Goldman has written a courageous book that makes the strongest
possible case for abandoning circumcision once and for all---for the health
of all of us, men and women alike.<BR><I>--Christiane Northrup,
MD, obstetrician, author of </I> Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom<I></I>

<P>This pioneering work is of riveting interest to all who have
ever wondered about circumcision or who are looking for clues to explain
certain male feelings, attitudes, and behaviors.<BR><I>--Myron
Sharaf, PhD, lecturer and author, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical
School</I>

<P>Impressive and moving.<BR><I>--Sheila Kitzinger,
social anthropologist and childbirth educator, author of </I> The Complete

<P>Goldman casts a wide, fine mesh net and hauls in all the fishy
arguments and speculations that disqualify circumcision as a health care
procedure.<BR><I>--John Money, PhD, Professor Emeritus of
Pediatrics and Medical Psychology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</I>

<P>This provocative analysis of circumcision's potential impact
on men and gender relations merits serious attention.
<BR><I>--Patricia Yancey Martin, PhD, Professor of Sociology, Florida

<P>A penetrating landmark study that raises disturbing questions
and yet offers a real message of hope for a more peaceful future.
<BR><I>--Lloyd DeMause, PhD, author, Director of the Institute for

<P>"I hope "Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma" will be read by men and 
women because it will force us to confront the unrecognized personal 
and social harm that results from this practice.<BR>

<h2>Review by J. Steven Svoboda</h2>

<P>Once in a very great while, a reader will have the great fortune of
coming across a truly remarkable book.  A book which may treat a
specialized subject but which is so beautifully written, so
meticulously reasoned, so broad in the compass of its grasp of its
subject as to transcend the specificity of its topic, and yet at
the same time so tightly focused on each specific aspect it
discusses, in short, so superb that it stands out head and
shoulders above the mass of books being published today.

<P>Ronald Goldman's book Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma is such a
book.  Opening with a compelling forward by famed anthropologist
Ashley Montagu, Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma leaps headfirst
into some controversial questions in the introduction and does not
let up until it ends more than 200 pages later with a stirring
series of closing meditations.  

<P>Any reader may expect to be struck in the early pages by Goldman's
effective blend of emotional insight and objective fact, the latter
documented throughout the book by hundreds of footnotes.  As
Goldman continues, he effortlessly distills and integrates decades
of research on infants and children.  I appreciated his excellent
summaries at the end of each chapter.  Particularly valuable was
the list on page 74 of the many similarities and the few
differences between circumcision and female genital mutilation.

<P>Have you ever wondered whether America's high rates of violence may
be related to our high circumcision rates?  Goldman has done more
than wonder; he has extensively researched the possibility,
although he is always careful to add cautionary statements that at
most, circumcision is one of several factors affecting American
men's (and women's) lives.  

<P>Goldman has an impressive ability to continue to generate and
synthesize new insights and questions throughout the book. 
Although circumcision is often done so that the child does not have
a different genital status from his father, is it actually the
PARENT'S fear of difference which is apparent here?  Is it possible
that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is actually infant
suicide?  Goldman relates circumcision to other problematic
American birth practices such as birth with the mother on her back,
use of drugs, forceps deliveries, routine episiotomy, and cesarian
births.  He includes an admirable short section addressing the
interrelationship of social problems and noting the possible
connection of circumcision trauma to the epidemic divorce rates. 
Equally unforgettable are sections in which men circumcised as
adults speak about their incalculable loss and in which Goldman
addresses the disruption of the infant/mother bond.

<P>Goldman concludes his masterful work with a truly stunning series
of innovative meditations, each three or four insight-filled pages
long.  These address 1) the American motivation to circumcise (our
lack of awareness is alarming; the use and exclusion of certain
words helps to maintain support for circumcision); 2) science and
medicine (flawed studies are the rule not the exception, and
doctors tend to MEASURE rather than to FEEL pain); 3) ethics and
medicine (isn't it the medical profession's responsibility to LEAD
rather than FOLLOW community health care standards?; since when
does a trained surgeon take the advice of laypeople as to whether
he or she should operate?); 4) cultural and social perspectives (we
can circumcise our sons because we are so alienated from each
other); 5) hope for healing (no matter how "bad" our feelings are,
expressing them feels good); 6) preventing future harm (taking
action to prevent others from being victimized aids one's own
recovery).  Goldman closes his book by reminding us that to think
that newborn infants can be subjected to circumcision without an
impact on them or others ignores the interconnnectedness of all
life.  When a baby's sexuality is not safe, no one's sexuality is
safe.

<P>As awe-inspiring an achievement as it is, Goldman's work is not
without flaws.  He sometimes forgets that not everyone reading his
book will be a heterosexual American.  Readers will wonder why
Goldman does not attempt to compare Americans with Europeans to
dispose of certain possibilities he raises--does circumcision
contribute to impotence? to sadomasochistic behavior?  

<P>Most sadly, Goldman unfortunately fails to extend his understanding
of male oppression beyond circumcision, and fails to transcend the
comfortably unnuanced views of "patriarchy" which are so popular
nowadays.  This leads him into inevitable contradictions; he claims
that men are primarily responsible for circumcision on page 197 and
then four short pages later acknowledges that "circumcision is a
social problem in which the whole society is complicit."  If, as
Goldman correctly notes at page 171, most circumcised and intact
men are not perpetrators of child abuse, how can it possibly be
true, as he somewhat wildly speculates two short pages earlier,
that "a <B>conservative</B> adjusted rate [of women who suffer child abuse
at the hands of men] would be about 60 percent?"  (emphasis added) 
Goldman also demonstrates his ignorance of the fact that roughly
equal levels of domestic violence are committed by women and men,
as well as his unawareness that women commit the majority of
parental violence against children.  Nevertheless, Goldman's
conclusions and speculations regarding the possible connection of
circumcision to high levels of American violence remain
compellingly plausible.

<P>Small publisher Vanguard Publications has done a beautiful job with
the physical layout of the book.  Wide margins, attractive
typeface, high quality paper, and readily usable supplementary
matter all combine in an extremely appealing package.

<P>Despite its imperfections, Ronald Goldman's book is certain to
become an instant classic in the growing field of books about male
circumcision.  By the very depth of its commitment to the truth
about this issue, and the logic and poetry of its presentation, it
should appeal to anyone with any interest in children, men, or
American society.
