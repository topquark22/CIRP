QUESTIONING CIRCUMCISION: A JEWISH PERSPECTIVE is the first critical
examination of the growing controversy of male infant circumcision
with special attention to contemporary concerns of the Jewish
community. Endorsed by five rabbis, this extraordinary book examines
the origins, assumed benefits, risks, and unrecognized consequences
of the Jewish practice with thorough documentation and moving
personal experiences.

Consider these facts:
*   Circumcision is not universal among Jews.
*   Jewish press articles have questioned circumcision.
*   A male child born of a Jewish mother is a Jew, whether he is
    circumcised or not.
*   Jewish circumcision has never had anything to do with health concerns.
*   Circumcision conflicts with significant Jewish laws and values.
*   An Israeli organization publicly opposes circumcision.

"Dr. Goldman has written a thoughtful, provocative book on a
difficult subject. He challenges us to reexamine long-held assumptions
and to reconsider the practice of milah (ritual circumcision) in
light of contemporary evidence. By giving us an insightful and
carefully documented exploration of a controversial perspective,
Dr. Goldman helps to foster a healthy and valuable dialogue within
the Jewish community."
---RABBI JONATHAN KRAUS, Beth El Temple Center

"I highly recommend Questioning Circumcision: A Jewish Perspective
particularly to expectant mothers and fathers early in their
pregnancy so that they may have ample time to ponder its contents.
I also recommend it to rabbis who counsel on the merits of
circumcision, so they can offer a more informed perspective on this
ritual."
---RABBI RAYMOND SINGER, PH.D., neuropsychologist

"If you are a liberal Jew, whether you see circumcision as the
sanctification of the covenant, as a ceremony marking you as a Jew,
or otherwise, this book stimulates deeper reflection about the
practice. As an aware, concerned, and introspective people, Jews
must examine whether our rites are right. We must determine if our
ceremonies, traditions, and practices reflect our innermost beliefs.
Asking ourselves and each other the question 'Why*' is one of the
most sacred tasks to which a modern Jew can dedicate himself or
herself."
---RABBI DONALD POLLOCK, pastoral psychotherapist, writer, and lecturer


Ronald Goldman, Ph.D., is a psychologist, educator, and executive

    circumcision

<h2>Review by J. Steven Svoboda</h2>

<P>Ronald Goldman's second book, Questioning Circumcision: A Jewish
Perspective, follows on the heels of his masterpiece <A HREF="ht.html">
<I>Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma</I></A>.  While the earlier book
provided a stunning, magisterial overview of the entire subject of
circumcision, this slimmer volume focuses on a more specialized
analysis of the procedure from a Jewish point of view.

<P>Goldman again succeeds at integrating emotional, psychological,
scientific, and humanistic considerations while surveying the great
diversity of attitudes held toward this procedure among Jews.  He
reveals and meticulously documents a number of surprising facts
which contravene widely held beliefs about the subject.  Far from
enjoying a consensus within the Jewish community, circumcision has
not always been practiced by all Jews.  As early as the 1840's,
leaders of the Reform movement tried to stop circumcision.  In the
1860's, a group of sixty-six Jewish physicians opposed the
practice.  The procedure as performed today in the United States is
much more extensive than the original circumcisions, which merely
removed the very tip of the foreskin.  These changes and conflicts
suggest that the supposed Jewish mandate for circumcision may be
suspect.

<P>Goldman discusses and questions a number of suggested benefits to
Jewish males of the procedure.  Although many believe circumcision
necessary for Jewish survival and identity, under Jewish law, any
child born of a Jewish mother is a Jew, whether circumcised or not. 
While the procedure is often suggested to promote connection with
other Jews, Goldman notes that the extreme discomfort and anxiety
often provoked by circumcision may actually inhibit connection. 
Crisply summarizing some of the highlights from his earlier book,
Goldman notes that health claims are highly speculative at best,
and pain research has proven the extreme trauma suffered by the
infant boy.  Behavioral changes have been documented to follow most
circumcisions, as boys become very irritable and interruption
occurs to parent-infant bonding and feeding schedules.

<P>Goldman writes that unrecognized consequences of the procedure may
include promotion of a negative attitude to male sexuality.  The
personal stories by circumcised men and by mothers and fathers are
quite moving.  Some parents came to deeply regret their decision to
circumcise while others feel gratified that they reached eleventh-
hour determinations not to carry out the procedure.

<P>Goldman takes the offensive later in the book, suggestion that the
Torah's commandment against assaulting another person actually
forbids circumcision.  He notes that blind conformance to authority
is antithetical to Jewish values, and many potential benefits of
foregoing circumcision exist.  An appendix contains Goldman's
response to traditionalist supporters of the procedure, which is
drawn entirely from passages in the Torah.

<P>In Goldman's discussion of Jewish men's views of Jewish women, I
was troubled by his inability to transcend standard views of
misogyny while failing to also consider possible misandry, as I was
by his repetition of the big lie that men commit most domestic
violence.  Nevertheless, future research needs to be carried out in
accordance with his insightful suggestion that many Jewish men may
harbor anger toward Jewish women due to their circumcisions, for
which they may subconsciously hold their mothers primarily
responsible.  From the infant's perspective, Goldman notes, he is
experiencing betrayal by his mother at a most vulnerable time in
his life.  

<P>Goldman includes several useful appendices including two mothers'
stories, a discussion of circumcision and anti-Semitism, and sample
alternative rituals in which the baby's foreskin is not touched. 
Ronald Goldman has gifted us with his second tightly reasoned,
impeccably documented, and heartfully written book about a
procedure which should be of concern to all men and women who care
about children or society, whatever your faith may be.
