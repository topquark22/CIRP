      <h2>What were the original motivations behind routine infant
      circumcision in the West?</h2>

      <p>Routine circumcision as a preventative or cure for
      masturbation was proposed in Victorian times in America.
      Masturbation was thought to be the cause of a number of
      diseases. The procedure of routine circumcision became
      commonplace between 1870 and 1920, and it consequently spread
      to all the English-speaking countries (England, Canada,
      Australia and New Zealand). None of these countries now
      circumcise the majority of their male children, a distinction
      reserved today for the United States (in the UK, in fact,
      nonreligious circumcision has virtually ceased). Yet, there
      are still those who promote this social surgery, long after
      the masturbation hysteria of the past century has
      subsided.</p>
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        "By about 1880 the individual... might wish[to]... tie,
        chain, or infibulate sexually active children... to adorn
        them with grotesque appliances, encase them in plaster,
        leather, or rubber, to frighten or even castrate them...
        masturbation insanity was now real enough--it was affecting
        the medical profession."
      </blockquote>
      <i>(B. Berkeley, quoted from _Circumcision: The Painful
      Dilemma_, by Rosemary Romberg, Bergin &amp; Garvey Publisher,
      Inc, S. Hadley MA, USA, 1985, ISBN 089789-073-6)</i><br />
       

      <p>Dr. E.J. Spratling, who promoted this surgery by telling
      his colleagues that "...circumcision is undoubtedly the
      physician's closest friend and ally..." prescribed in 1895
      the method of circumcision as it is practiced in hospitals
      today.</p>
      <br />
       

      <blockquote>
        "To obtain the best results one must cut away enough skin
        and mucous membrane to rather put it on the stretch when
        erections come later. There must be no play in the skin
        after the wound has thoroughly healed, but it must fit
        tightly over the penis, for should there be any play the
        patient will be found to readily resume his practice not
        begrudging the time and extra energy required to produce
        the orgasm... We may not be sure that we have done away
        with the possibility of masturbation, but we may feel
        confident that we have limited it to within the danger
        lines."
      </blockquote>
      <i>(E.J. Spratling, MD. Medical Record, Masturbation in the
      Adult, vol. 48, no. 13, September 28, 1895, pp.
      442-443.)</i><br />

      <p>Here is an example of what another sexaphobic American
      doctor had to say about masturbation in 1903:</p>
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        "It (self abuse) lays the foundation for consumption,
        paralysis and heart disease. It weakens the memory, makes a
        boy careless, negligent and listless. It even makes many
        lose their minds; others, when grown, commit suicide....
        Don't think it does no harm to your boy because he does not
        suffer now, for the effects of this vice come on so slowly
        that the victim is often very near death before you realize
        that he has done himself harm. It is worthy of note that
        many eminent physicians now advocate the custom of
        circumcision..."
      </blockquote>
      <i>(Mary R. Melendy, MD, The Ideal Woman - For Maidens, Wives
      and Mothers, 1903.)</i> 

      <p>(The above material is quoted from J. Bigelow, <a
      href="/pages/reviews/bigelow/">The Joy of Uncircumcising</a>,
      Hourglass Book Publishing, Aptos, CA, USA. Thanks to Robin
      Verner.)</p>

      <p>In America, foreskins were not rare at the time
      circumcision was introduced into widespread practice.
      Paradoxically, then, the understanding of the intact male
      organ at that time was somewhat <i>greater</i> than it is
      today. (In particular, it never would have been possible to
      promote circumcision on the basis that it was "necessary for
      hygienic reasons"---this came later, when doctors themselves
      were mostly circumcised men.)</p>

      <p>Further, in proposing circumcision as a preventative
      against self-abuse, physicians of the day understood very
      well that male masturbation involves stimulation of the
      foreskin. However they were incorrect in assuming that, by
      reducing the pleasure, masturbation itself could be reduced
      or eliminated.</p>

      <h3>Porn Flakes:</h3>
      Interestingly, Messrs. John Harvey Kellogg and Sylvester
      Graham (advocates of fibre, of both the moral and dietary
      varieties) were involved in this <i>movement.</i> Here's what
      Dr. Kellogg recommended: 

      <blockquote>
        A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful
        in small boys is circumcision. The operation should be
        performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic,
        as the brief pain attending the operation will have a
        salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be
        connected with the idea of punishment. In females, the
        author has found the application of pure carbolic acid to
        the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal
        excitement.
      </blockquote>

      and its Effects," Plain Fact for Old and Young. Burlington,

      that enough to put you off Corn Flakes for the rest of your
      life? <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/stayfree/10/graham.htm"

      <p>Circumcision in America, England and the other countries
      received a strong boost during each of the World Wars,
      because it was claimed that the procedure was necessary for
      soldiers for "hygienic reasons". <a
      href="/news/cin/1995.07.10/">Some soldiers who refused to be
      circumcised, were disciplined and/or received dishonourable
      discharges.</a></p>

      <p>In 1949, the important work of <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> appeared in
      Britain, which led to the virtual cessation of
      medically-motivated circumcision in that country. Australia
      and New Zealand now also have very low rates (5% or
      less).</p>

      <p>The largest problem remains in the United States, where
      the procedure has become culturally entrenched. The American
      public largely still believes circumcision to be a useful
      procedure, even though the rest of the world does perfectly
      well without it. It is worth noting that in 1996 the <a
      href="/library/statements/cps1996/" target="_blank">Canadian
      Paediatric Society</a> issued a statement depreciating the
      value of circumcision in rather strong terms. All Canadian
      provinces have dropped insurance coverage for
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Circumcision never became an issue in continental Europe
      and in most of Asia, where the vast majority of men are
      intact. Religious circumcision is popular in some African,
      Muslim and Middle Eastern countries.</p>

      <h2>How is this genital reduction surgery perpetuated in the
      West today?</h2>

      <p>From its original roots in anti-masturbation hysteria,
      circumcision continues in English-speaking western countries
      (the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand)
      because of mistaken beliefs and unfounded fears about
      hygiene, disease, appearance and sexuality, and denial of the
      pain of infant circumcision. Please see the article <a
      href="/library/ethics/milos-macris/"><i>Circumcision: A
      Medical or a Human Rights Issue?</i> by Marilyn Fayre Milos,
      RN, and Donna Macris, CNM, MSN, in the Journal of
      Nurse-Midwifery, Vol.37,No.2 (Suppl.), March/April
      1992.</a><br />
