      <h1>Foreskin restoration</h1>

      <h2>for circumcised men</h2>

      <p class="text">This page provides a basic introduction and
      FAQ about foreskin restoration. Links are provided to other
      documents within CIRP, as well as external sites, where more
      comprehensive information may be found.</p>

      <p class="disclaim">This page is intended as information
      only. It is not intended as medical advice. CIRP does not
      purport to make any specific health claims for foreskin
      restoration or reconstruction. Non-surgical restoration is
      not classified as a medical procedure. Restoration is a
      personal decision, and should only be undertaken following a
      full understanding of what is involved.</p>

      <h3>What is "foreskin restoration?"</h3>

      <p class="text">The term "foreskin restoration" can refer to
      any method of recreating a facsimile of a foreskin (prepuce)
      to cover the head of the penis (the glans), for men who have
      lost their original foreskin due to circumcision. This can be
      done either by surgical means, or non-surgically by gradual
      stretching (tissue expansion). A more accurate term for
      surgical restoration is "foreskin reconstruction." Most of
      the resources on the Internet are focused on non-surgical
      restoration.</p>

      <p class="text">Despite the name "restoration" or
      "reconstruction," it is not possible to actually restore a
      lost foreskin. A natural foreskin contains specialized nerve
      endings, muscles and blood vessels that are necessary for
      normal sexual function and sensation. While to some degree
      these functions can be recreated, once the original tissue is
      cut off and thrown away, it can never be fully recovered.</p>

      <p class="text">Nevertheless, foreskin restoration can
      greatly enhance the sexual experience, and will improve daily
      personal comfort. Restored men have reported feelings of
      wholeness, empowerment, and "taking back their bodies from
      the circumcisers."</p>

      <h3>History of foreskin restoration</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration has been known since
      ancient times, and is mentioned in the Bible. For more
      information on the history of foreskin restoration, see <a
      href="/library/restoration/schultheiss/">Uncircumcision: A
      Historical Review of Preputial Restoration</a>.</p>

      <p class="text">In the 20th century, doctors developed
      surgical procedures to reconstruct the foreskin, with varying
      degrees of success.</p>

      <p class="text">Non-surgical foreskin restoration was
      reinvented in the late 1970s by a movement of circumcised
      men, mostly from the United States, who were upset at having
      been mutilated against their will. The United States at that
      time had (and still has) a very high rate of neonatal
      circumcision. See <a
      href="/library/restoration/bigelow1/">Uncircumcising: Undoing
      the Effects of an Ancient Practice in a Modern World</a> for
      more information.</p>

      <h3>What is tissue expansion?</h3>

      <p class="text">Tissue expansion is an accepted technique,
      often used by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, to cause
      skin to expand and grow. The principle of tissue expansion is
      to maintain constant, safe, gentle tension on skin tissue,
      resulting in growth of new skin cells. This is often done in
      advance of restorative surgery by implanting balloons under
      the skin, which are inflated to stretch the skin and cause it
      to grow over a period of time. Because new cells are created,
      the increase in the quantity of skin is permanent. It does
      not shrink or snap back like a rubber band.</p>

      <h3>What is non-surgical foreskin restoration?</h3>

      <p class="text">Non-surgical foreskin restoration is the
      re-covering of the glans penis by tissue expansion. Tape and
      weights, elastic straps, a traction device, or even manual
      stretching can be used to exert a gentle outward tension on
      the shaft of the penis to induce the skin to grow, to make
      the most of what was left after the circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">Non-surgical restoration is inexpensive,
      relatively easy, and gives good results. It is not surgery,
      and it is not classified as a medical treatment.</p>

      <p class="text">"Tugging" is a common term for non-surgical
      foreskin restoration.</p>

      <h3>What is surgical foreskin reconstruction?</h3>

      <p class="text">Surgical restoration (or reconstruction) is
      the grafting of skin onto the penis, either from the penis
      itself or from elsewhere on the body, to reconstruct
      something that looks and functions like a foreskin. The
      grafted skin may be of dissimilar texture to the
      original.</p>

      <p class="text">Surgical foreskin reconstruction procedures
      have been developed by several surgeons. Surgical
      reconstruction can be expensive and painful. Numerous
      complications have been reported. However, some men have
      reported satisfaction with it. Non-surgical restoration is
      generally considered safer and to give superior results as
      compared to a surgical procedure. For more information on
      surgical reconstruction, see <a
      href="/library/restoration/">Circumcision Reversal</a>.</p>

      <h3>How does one accomplish non-surgical foreskin
      restoration?</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration expands the residual
      shaft skin of the circumcised penis distally to induce it to
      extend over the glans penis and form a fold similar to a
      natural foreskin. There are several manufacturers of devices
      to assist in this process, or one can manufacture one's own
      device.</p>

      <p class="text">There are a number of ingenious foreskin
      restoration devices available. The technology is constantly
      changing and improving. No attempt will be made to discuss
      the various devices on this page.</p>

      <h3>What are the disadvantages of non-surgical
      restoration?</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration tends to be slow and
      time-consuming. One must be patient and dedicated to achieve
      results. Motivation, commitment, and perseverance are
      required. Men who persevere are usually very satisfied with
      the results.</p>

      <p class="text">Tugging cannot restore the <a
      href="http://research.cirp.org/" target="_blank">ridged
      band</a> neurologic structure that is invariably excised by
      circumcision. It cannot restore the frenulum (the sensitive
      ligament that attaches the foreskin at the bottom).</p>

      <p class="text">Some men experience minor skin irritation
      where the restoration device is attached.</p>

      <h3>What are the advantages of non-surgical foreskin
      restoration?</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration returns the penis to a
      near-normal appearance. The circumcision scar gradually
      becomes hidden under the fold of the new foreskin. Cosmesis
      is dramatically improved. It is difficult to distinguish a
      restored foreskin from a natural foreskin by its
      appearance.</p>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration extends the shaft skin
      to recover the glans penis, to restore skin mobility, and to
      provide protection for the glans penis. Men who restore
      report greater comfort when wearing clothing, because the
      delicate mucosa of the glans penis is covered and protected
      from contact with clothing.</p>

      <p class="text">Men who restore report psychological and
      emotional benefits. One feels that one is back in control
      over one's body. Men who restore start to feel "whole" or
      "complete" and enjoy improved self-esteem as the restoration
      progresses. Feelings of anger, rage, and resentment may be
      reduced.</p>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration restores the "gliding
      action." Friction and chafing during sexual intercourse are
      reduced.</p>

      <p class="text">Sexual benefits have also been reported.
      Increases in sensitivity are usually reported. One <a
      href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">survey</a> found that women
      prefer a man with a foreskin by a ratio of 8.6 to one and
      reportedly are four times more likely to experience orgasm
      when the male partner has a foreskin.</p>

      <h3>How does foreskin restoration improve sensitivity?</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration is believed to work in
      several ways to improve sensitivity:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>After the glans penis is recovered, it stays moist.
        Moistness seems to improve sexual sensitivity. Some men
        report that the extra keratinization of the glans penis has
        peeled off as skin peels after a day at the beach.</li>

        <li>Foreskin restoration increases the skin mobility and
        gliding action. The increased mobility provides increased
        stimulation of the stretch receptors in the penile
        skin.</li>

        <li>Foreskin restoration may reduce premature ejaculation
        by protecting the corona of the glans penis from direct
        stimulation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Is non-surgical restoration painful?</h3>

      <p class="text">Restoration should not be painful. If it is,
      you are probably doing it wrong. Some men try to stretch too
      hard and/or quickly, or tape improperly, which results in
      pain. If it hurts, you should stop for a few days and then
      try again with a bit less enthusiasm.</p>

      <h3>Can I have sex while restoring?</h3>

      <p class="text">Yes. Just remove the device beforehand, and
      reattach it when you are done. Specialized, safe solvents are
      available to soften tape and remove tape residue from the
      penis.</p>

      <h3>Is foreskin restoration popular?</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration is a private and
      personal matter. No statistics are collected on the number of
      men who restore. Some men keep silent about their foreskin
      restoration. We can say, however, that a cottage industry has
      grown up to supply restoration devices, the available devices
      are increasing in number, variety, and quality, and this
      apparently indicates an ever-increasing market. It seems safe
      to say that tens of thousands of men either have restored in
      the past or presently are restoring, and the total number may
      be even larger. Since more and more men are learning of the
      advantages of foreskin restoration, the number of men
      undertaking foreskin restoration seems to be increasing.</p>

      <h3>How long does foreskin restoration take?</h3>

      <p class="text">No definite time can be stated. The time to
      restore varies widely. The time depends on the amount of skin
      available at the start, the amount of skin desired, the
      techniques employed, the device used, the diligence of the
      individual, and other factors.</p>

      <p class="text">The regrowth of a foreskin by tissue
      expansion is done very gradually and almost
      imperceptibly.</p>

      <p class="text">Circumcised men may underestimate the full
      extent of <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">tissue loss to
      circumcision</a> so they may not appreciate the amount of
      skin necessary to re-create a foreskin. A foreskin is a
      double layer, so for each inch of visible foreskin, two
      inches of new skin tissue are needed. Circumcision removes
      more than 50 percent of the skin and mucosa from the penis,
      so restoration requires that the amount of skin be at least
      doubled and perhaps tripled. Some time is required to grow
      this additional skin. One should count on at least one year
      and possibly much longer.</p>

      <p class="text">Techniques are improving and better devices
      are becoming available so the time to restore seems to be
      decreasing.</p>

      <h3>Should I consult a medical doctor before starting
      foreskin restoration?</h3>

      <p class="text">It seems prudent to suggest that one should
      consult with a physician before undertaking any such
      procedure. Consulting a physician about foreskin restoration
      is likely to be helpful, for instance, if your physician
      knows about and understands tissue expansion. However, most
      physicians receive no training about foreskin restoration,
      and many may never have heard of it. There is almost nothing
      published in the medical literature on the subject. It is
      likely that many physicians will be unable to help you, may
      discourage you, and may in fact give bad advice. Your mileage
      may vary.</p>

      <p class="text">Men with preexisting skin conditions, skin
      allergies, diabetes, open sores, etc. should definitely
      consult with a physician beforehand.</p>

      <h3>What kinds of devices are available?</h3>

      <p class="text">A wide variety of devices are available to
      apply tension to the skin of the penis. Devices that use
      weights or elastic straps (similar to a suspender strap) are
      most popular.</p>

      <p class="text">CIRP does not endorse or recommend any
      particular product or company. Readers may search the Web for
      "foreskin restoration products" and find a number of
      offerings that may help them. While most of these products
      may be safe and effective, readers should use common sense in
      evaluating any health claims made by these manufacturers.</p>

      <h3>How does one keep the new foreskin in place?</h3>

      <p class="text">When enough skin has been created by tissue
      expansion, the skin will fall into place over the glans penis
      naturally. The new foreskin lacks a frenulum to hold it in
      place, so the only way to keep the foreskin in place is to
      continue the process long enough. Before enough skin is
      produced, a tape retainer ring may help to keep the
      developing foreskin in place.</p>

      <h3>Will I experience an increase in penis length with
      stretching?</h3>

      <p class="text">It is possible. Some men do report growth in
      overall penis size as a side effect of the constant tension.
      However, this effect has not been scientifically studied, and
      it should not be considered a good reason for attempting
      restoration.</p>

      <h3>Is foreskin restoration a "gay thing?"</h3>

      <p class="text">Foreskin restoration is for anyone who does
      not like being circumcised. It does not matter if the person
      is homosexual or heterosexual.</p>

      <h3>I'm intact, but my foreskin is too short. Can intact
      males use foreskin stretching techniques?</h3>

      <p class="text">Yes, an intact male who is not satisfied with
      the length of his foreskin may use the same traction
      techniques to make his foreskin longer. Men who have trouble
      keeping their foreskin forward may benefit from foreskin
      restoration as the foreskin is retrained to stay in
      place.</p>

      <h3>Where can I obtain more information?</h3>

      <p class="text">More information may be obtained by visiting
      the <a href="http://www.norm.org/"
