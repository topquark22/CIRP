has just published a survey of male circumcision satisfaction in
its March 1996 issue. A copy may be obtained by sending $4US to:

The article has some results that are curious, and some that are disturbing.

Here are the raw numbers...

             Cut-in-Infancy   Intact   Cut-as-Adult
             --------------   ------   ------------
   Happy          23%           31%       ~ 33%
   Undecided      54%           68%       ~ 33%
   Unhappy        23%            1%       ~ 33%

Observations...

The lowest satisfaction rate was observed in those circumcised
in infancy. The highest disatisfaction rate was observed
in those cut in adulthood. The highest degree of uncertainty
was among intact men -- who've never really had to think about it.
The highest satisfaction rate was observed among men circumcised
in adulthood, who were only slightly happier than intact men.
However, these men are the only part of the studied population
who had an actual need or desire for the surgery. The lowest dis-
satisfaction rate, by a substantial margin was among the intact.

Circumcision improved the lives of only 33% of men circumcised
in adulthood, many of whom had had a physical defect or recurrent
infection. 66% percent reported no benefit or a significant loss.
This is a remarkably low satisfaction rate. Yet obviously these men
had some good reason to have had it done, which may explain why men
circumcised in adulthood had the highest satisfaction rate.

It is curious that those happy or sad at being cut in infancy
(without medical reason) were equal. However, less than 25% were
actually happy about it. Parents should know then that there is
less than one chance in four that their son would find any long term
value in being circumcised, and nearly one in four that he would be
visibly unhappy about it, some to the point of "active rage"
as the article comments(p10).

This is a survey of their readership, which is drawn from the public
at large by no obvious criteria other than that they seem interested
in their health and able to afford it. Nonetheless these results really
should be validated by the general population before relying upon them.
All this points out is that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
has been setting circumcision policy without obtaining the full
picture. Any rational system for health care policy would insist upon
a large scale study of outcomes before condoning wholesale surgery
on unconsenting minors. Someday it may be considered malpractice on the
part of the AAP not to have obtained these data a-priori.

Ratios within populations are more telling. The ratio of happy to
unhappy men cut in infancy was 50:50. Circumcised men are not
decided as a group, not that they have any choice about their status.
The ratio of men happy to be intact versus those who were unhappily
intact was a staggering 31:1. That clearly says that men who know what
foreskin is really like are overwhelmingly glad they still have it.
Parents should have little cause to fear that their sons will dislike
being intact.

The results for adult circumcision can't be extended to infant circumcision,
partly because the figures speak for themselves, and because in the adult the
foreskin and glans have separated by adulthood. For circumcision in infancy,
the head of the penis must usually be peeled (by synechiotomy) before the
foreskin can be amputated. This causes trauma to the glans. Men circumcised
as infants have had their glans essentially "skinned alive". The effects of
this scarification have never been fully studied either. Nevertheless its
effects, plus the severe pain accompanying the operation are good reasons
to delay circumcision, if it is necessary at all, until it is less damaging
and anaesthetic can be administered safely. Another reason for such a
delay would be to obtain informed consent instead of parental assent.

In toto, these results would indicate that a moratorium should be declared
against unnecessary neonatal circumcision until such time as the American
Medical Association has enough information on long term satisfaction and
sexual difficulties to make a rational well-informed assessment and
develop guidelines for when circumcision is a valid medical procedure,
as opposed to when it is simply parental whim. It is not clear that the
AAP has proven itself a responsible and effective and capable medical body
in this regard. It is time for the AMA to take over.

Physicians have sworn an oath to perform in the interests of the patient,
not to help parents avoid the duties of washing their son's genitalia,
or to enable them to force their boys to resemble other family members
for reasons of vanity, or unproven psychological conjecture
-- which is indeed soundly discredited by the present study.

Finally, there are several legal and Human Rights issues involved in the
practice of performing unnecessary, yet painful genital reduction surgery on
unconsenting minors, especially when the final results (above) indicate
that those human victims are not uniformly happy with their unnecessary
genital alteration. Currently there are about 100 million victims of male
genital modification (MGM) within the American population. Assuming the
validity of the study above, 23 million of them may be content;
but there are also 23 million who are not. This is what comes of amputating
from healthy children. About 10% of the population of the country may now
reasonably consider themselves to be victims of medical sexual abuse.
It is at least time to factor "patient satisfaction" into the circumcision
equations. At worst, the biggest malpractice class action law suit in history
may unfold someday soon.
