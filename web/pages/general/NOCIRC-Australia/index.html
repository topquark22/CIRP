                 FACT SHEET ON MALE CIRCUMCISION

o  The foreskin is the natural protective covering of the glans
and is the most erogenous tissue of the penis, containing over
240 feet of nerves and over 1,000 nerve endings.  The foreskin
provides a lubricated gliding sheath that enhances sexual pleasure.

o  Infant circumcision deprives the male of over one-third
(approximately 15 square inches) of the most erogenous tissue on
the penis.

o  The naturally adherent, non-retractile infant foreskin is torn
from the glans before circumcision.  We now know that infants
feel pain.  They rarely receive anaesthesia or or postoperative
pain relief.

o  85% of the world's males are intact with very few foreskin
problems.  Australia, "an advanced nation", still circumcise 20%
of its' newborn males for non-medical reasons.

o  Every year in Australia about 15,000 baby boys are
circumcised.

o  The medical profession has failed to prove unequivocally and
conclusively that circumcision carries any significant medical
advantage over the intact state for the majority of males or partners.

o  Long-term harm includes: skin tags, skin bridges, prominent
scars, tight/painful erections, bleeding during sex,
bowing/curvature, loss of sensitivity, excessive/painful
stimulation required to attain orgasm, sexual dysfunction, anger,
resentment, feelings of parental betrayal, mutilation/human
rights violation, not feeling whole or natural, inferiority to
intact males, low self esteem, addiction and or dependencies.

o  Worldwide, the medical community considers infant circumcision
unnecessary and unethical.

o  Painless circumcision won't mitigate human rights issues.

o  Children have no constitutional guarantee of safety, liberty
or protection.  No adult would be forcibly restrained and exposed
to the risks of circumcision surgery.

o  In Australia, no comprehensive medical records are kept of
infant circumcision practices or complications.

o  Obstetricians, specialists in female genitalia, practising out
of their field, perform most newborn circumcisions.

o  The longterm negative effects on men of infant circumcision
have never been investigated or acknowledged.

o  The Queensland Law Reform Commission in December 1993, in
their landmark document "Circumcision of Male Infants" calculated
that Medicare paid $3.2 million for circumcisions from 1988 to
1993 (5 year period).  The cost of infant circumcision was $1.76 million.

o  Some doctors charge $275 per circumcision.  The Medicare
Benefits Schedule fees for infants is $33.10, boys from 6 months
to 10 years is $76.95 and males from 10 years to adulthood is
$106.65.  In Scandinavian countries, circumcision is very rare
(0.001%) as nonsurgical treatments for the foreskin are used.

o  Boys are operated on in parents' homes, hospital corridors,
nurseries and nursing stations.  The operating theatre is the
appropriate and safest place for any operative procedures.

o  Lay persons perform infant circumcisions.

o  The consent cannot be informed and is illegal as the infant is
an unconsenting minor.
