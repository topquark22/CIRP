                           INFANT MALE CIRCUMCISION
                      IS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE
                         HEALTH & RIGHTS OF THE CHILD
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    FACT SHEET
   
      Scope of the Problem
     * Current national rates: Australia 15%(1), Canada 20%(2), the
       United States 60%(3).
     * In the U.S., over 1.25 million infants annually - more than 3,300
       babies each day - one child every 26 seconds.
     * The surgery wastes more than $250 million health care dollars
       annually(4) as well as untold personnel hours.
     * Globally, 20% of male children will be subjected to some form of
       non-medically indicated genital mutilation.(5)
   
      Early and Current Rationale
     * (U.S.) physicians thought it logical to perform genital surgery on
       both sexes to stop masturbation. This rationale was initiated in
       the English-speaking countries during the 19th Century.(6)
     * The current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the
       operation was in wide practice.(7) To make sons resemble their
       circumcised fathers, to conform socially with peers, to improve
       hygiene, to prevent phimosis, and as prophylaxis for infant
       urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, and
       cancer of the penis/cervix.(8)
   
      Decision Making
     * The circumcision decision in the U.S. is emerging as a cultural
       ritual rather than the result of medical misunderstanding among
       parents. It is more an emotional than a rational decision.(9)
     * Other factors affect parents' decisions, including esthetics,
       cultural attitudes, social pressures and tradition.(10)
     * Ultimate decision may hinge on non-medical considerations.(11)
       Circumcision has become cultural surgery.(12)
   
      Foreskin Function
     * When infant is incontinent, prepuce fulfills an essential
       function, to protect the glans.(13)
     * The foreskin is more than just penile skin necessary for a natural
       erection; it is specialized tissue, richly supplied with blood
       vessels, highly innervated, and uniquely endowed with stretch
       receptors. (T)he foreskin contribute(s) significantly to the
       sexual response of the intact male.(14)
     * This mucous-membrane contact [male foreskin and female labia]
       provides natural lubrication...and prevents dryness responsible
       for painful intercourse and chafing and abrasions that allow for
       entry of STDs, viral/bacterial.(15)
   
      Penile Development
     * Development of the prepuce is incomplete in the newborn male
       child, and separation from the glans, rendering it retractable,
       does not usually occur until some time between 9 months and 3
       years.(16)
     * (Infant) circumcision...traumatically interrupts the natural
       separation of the foreskin from the glans.(17)
     * Circumcision interferes with penile development, surgeon must tear
       skin from sensitive glans to permit removal.(18)
   
      Immediate Risks and Complications
     * Complications are often overlooked or un(der)reported.
       Lacerations, skin loss, skin bridges, chordee, meatitis, stenosis,
       urinary retention, glans necrosis, penile loss, hemorrhage,
       sepsis, gangrene, meningitis.(19)
     * Literature abounds with reports, morbidity and death from
       circumcision Realistic (complication) figure is 2-10%.(20)
   
      Long-Term Adverse Outcomes
     * Poor surgical result is not recognized until years later. Adverse
       consequences of infant circumcision on men's health must be
       recognized by physicians, parents & legislators.(21)
     * Circumcision is a subtraction, removing one-third or more of
       entire penile skin - tragic loss of erogenous tissue.(22)
     * When sexually functioning tissue is removed, sexual functioning is
       altered. Penile changes are documented.(23)
     * Of 313 circumcised male respondents, 49.5% cited a sense of
       parental violation, 62% expressed feelings of mutilation, and 84%
       reported some degree of sexual harm [progressive loss of glans
       sensitivity, excess stimulation needed to reach orgasm, painful
       coitus and impotence].(24)
     * Body image survey found 20% of circumcised respondents cited
       dissatisfaction with their circumcision.(25)
   
      Effects of Pain
     * Newborn infant responses to pain are similar to but greater than
       those in adult subjects. The persistence of specific behavioral
       changes after circumcision in neonates implies the presence of
       memory.(26)
     * Infant circumcision causes severe, persistent pain. Acetaminophen
       does not ameliorate pain of circumcision.(27)
     * Main structures for memory are functional in neonates and
       circumcision pain may have long-lasting effects.(28)
   
      Maternal Bonding / Breastfeeding
     * Circumcision affects mother-infant interaction.(29)
     * When an infant is subjected to intolerable, overwhelming pain, it
       conceptualizes mother as participatory and responsible regardless
       of mother's intent. Consequences for impaired bonding are
       significant.(30)
     * These are the first data suggesting a protective effect of
       breastfeeding against UTI.(31)
     * Breasts also produce large quantities of a hormone (GnRH) that may
       aid in development of a newborn's brain.(32)
     * Infants feed less frequently after circumcision; observed
       deterioration may contribute to breastfeeding failure.(33)
     * A stressful, painful event such as circumcision appears to affect
       the feeding patterns.(34)
   
      Questionable Benefits
     * Good hygiene can offer many advantages over circumcision.(35)
     * Circumcision has no significant effect on the incidence of common
       sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).(36)
     * Circumcision is not harmless and cannot be recommended without
       unequivocal proof of benefit.(37)
     * Not one confirmed UTI case in a normal male infant. All cases in
       infants with clear urinary birth defects.(38)
     * Antimicrobial management of UTI in infants is routine and outcome
       generally good. It is inappropriate at this time to recommend
       circumcision as a routine medically indicated procedure.(39)
     * Reported benefits in preventing cancer and infant UTIs are
       insignificant compared to surgical risks.(40)
     * Performing 100,000 mutilative procedures on newborns to possibly
       prevent cancer in one elderly man is absurd.(41)
   
      Medical Ethics
     * It must be recognized that the child is normal as born and that
       circumcision inflicts loss of a normal body part and leaves a
       scar. This is contrary to the motto of medicine, First Do No
       Harm.(42)
     * The unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of
       tradition, custom or any other non-disease related cause should
       never be acceptable to the health profession...and breaches
       fundamental medical ethics.(43)
     * Children too young to give consent must be treated as individuals.
       The child must live with the outcome of decision.(44)
   
      Obstetrical Involvement
     * Seventy-four percent (74%) of the Ob/Gyns surveyed perform
       circumcision. Ob-Gyn fees for circumcision range to $400,
       averaging $137 nationwide.(45)
     * Ob-Gyns not aware of preputial structure & function or growing
       numbers of men undergoing foreskin restoration.(46)
   
      Restoration Movement
     * In North America many circumcised men are now becoming aware of
       the mutilation and the harm this has done to them, and some are
       seeking methods of replacing the lost prepuce.(47)
     * At the root of this reaction lies an awareness that a perfectly
       normal, healthy -- indeed, the most sensually responsive -- part
       of their penis was surgically amputated when too young/helpless to
       consent, refuse or resist.(48)
   
      Children's Rights
     * All childhood circumcisions are violations of human rights. ...It
       is the moral duty of educated professionals to protect health and
       rights of those with little or no social power to protect
       themselves.(49)
     * Circumcision is an issue of self-determination and autonomy.(50)
     * Imperative that children have the right to own their reproductive
       organs and to preserve natural sexual function.(51)
     * Circumcisions for personal preference of the parent(s) deny the
       infant the basic right to respect and autonomy.(52)
     * Every circumcision...is an assault on a child's sexuality and a
       violation of his right to an intact body.(53)
   
      Why Does It Continue?
     * Americans culturally acclimated/regard foreskin as non-essential,
       pathologic.(54)
     * Cultural, social and historical perspectives around infant
       circumcision control physicians and parents.(55)
