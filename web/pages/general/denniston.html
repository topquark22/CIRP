      <h2>Why Obstetricians Should Stop Circumcising</h2>

    <p>Pediatricians need to ask themselves why they might want to
    persuade obstetricians to stop performing circumcisions. Now
    that is has been fully documented that circumcision causes harm
    to many individuals, pediatricians may want to stop others from
    harming their patients. (It is irrelevant whether or not this
    harm documentation appears in the American medical literature.
    Keeping such articles out is simply one of the ways that those
    who insist on perpetuating this bizarre practice do so.)</p>

    <p>Another reason that pediatricians should want to stop
    obstetricians from taking a knife to their patients is that the
    infant is not the patient of the obstetrician. He is the
    patient of the pediatrician. At the very least, the
    obstetrician should consult with the pediatrician before doing
    any procedure, and get his permission.</p>

    <p>But it goes beyond that. The obstetrician is not allowed, by
    the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists rules,
    to care for male patients, except with respect to infertility
    problems and in emergencies. If he does so, he risks his
    standing as a specialist in Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p>

    <p>If the obstetrician were to ask the pediatrician for
    permission, the latter should not be willing to grant it
    because performing circumcision violates the Golden Rule, the
    first tenet of medical practice, First, Do No Harm! and all
    seven Principles of the American Medical Association Code of
    Ethics.*</p>

    <p>But that is not all. Circumcision is not surgery. Welch has
    classified surgery as follows: Repair of wounds, extirpation of
    diseased organs or tissue, reconstructive surgery, and
    physiologic surgery (sympathectomy). Routine neonatal
    circumcision does not fit into this classification. A doctor's
    license does not cover cutting someone with a knife if it is
    not surgery.</p>

    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics convened a Task Force in
    1970, and reported in 1971 that there are no medical reasons
    for performing routine neonatal circumcision, to which most of
    the doctors, and most of the men, in the world will testify.
    The United States is the only country in the world that does
    this thing, for non-religious reasons, to a majority of their
    newborn sons.</p>
