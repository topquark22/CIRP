         False Prophets,<br />
         and Christian Parents</h1>

      <p class="cirp"><i>[CIRP note: Other commentaries on the same
      topic can be found at the websites of <a

      <p>Christians, depending upon their viewpoint and
      denomination, either consider the Holy Bible to be <i>an</i>
      authority, or the <i>sole</i> authority for faith and
      practice.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup></font> Christian parents who have
      male children, and live in the United States, are frequently
      asked by medical personnel if they "wish to have their
      newborn son circumcised." Consequently, Christian parents may
      seek guidance from the Bible in reference to circumcision.
      There is a need to draw together the scripture references
      that are scattered throughout the New Testament. This file
      compiles New Testament scripture about the act of
      circumcision, false prophets, and Christian parenting.</p>

      <p>The falseness of those who advocate circumcision is a
      recurrent theme in the New Testament. For example, the
      Apostle Paul says circumcision is a false teaching (Gal.
      2:4). To guide Christian parents who encounter false
      teachings, this file therefore contains references to false
      prophets, apostles and brothers.</p>

      <p>Christian parents may wish to test circumcision by the
      scriptural guidance on parenting, so these passages are also
      included here.</p>

      <p>This file does not contain scripture from the Hebrew Bible
      (Old Testament); nor does it include material from the New
      Testament that refers to circumcision merely in passing
      (<i>e.g.</i> referring to the Jews as "the circumcised"), as
      this is not relevant.</p>

      <p>Scripture is presented in the order in which it was
      written, rather than the order in which it customarily
      appears in the Bible.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font></p>

      <h2>SCRIPTURE ABOUT CIRCUMCISION</h2>

      <h3>THE GOSPELS</h3>
      <a id="LUK1" name="LUK1"></a> 

      <h4>Luke 1:59-60 Circumcision of John the Baptist.</h4>

      <blockquote>
        On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and
        they were going to name him after his father Zecheriah, but
        his mother spoke up and said,n "No! He is to be called
        John."
      </blockquote>
      <a id="LUK2" name="LUK2"></a> 

      <h4>Luke 2:21-39. Circumcision of Jesus.</h4>

      <blockquote>
        On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he
        was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he
        had been conceived.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>John 7:21-24 Jesus teaches at the feast.</h4>
      <a id="JOH7" name="JOH7"></a> 

      <blockquote>
        Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all
        astonished. Yet because Moses gave you circumcision (though
        actually it did not come from Moses but from the
        patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath. Now if
        a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law
        of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for
        healing the whole man on the Sabbath? Stop judging by mere
        appearances and make a right judgment."
      </blockquote>

      <h3>THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES</h3>
      <a id="ACTS15" name="ACTS15"></a> 

      <h4>Acts 15:1-21 The Council at Jerusalem</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were
        teaching the brothers: Unless you are circumcised according
        to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved. This
        brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate
        with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed along with
        some other believers to go up to Jerusalem to see the
        apostles and elders about this question. The church sent
        them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia
        and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted.
        This news made all the brothers very glad. When they came
        to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the
        apostles and elders, to whom they had reported every thing
        God had done through them.</p>

        <p>Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of
        the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be
        circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."</p>

        <p>The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
        After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them:
        "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made choice
        among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the
        message of the gospel and believe. God, who knows the
        heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy
        Spirit to them, just as he did to us. He made no
        distinction between us and them, for he purified their
        hearts by faith. Now then, why do you try to test God by
        putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither
        we nor our fathers have been able to bear? No! We believe
        it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are
        saved, just as they are."</p>

        <p>The whole assembly became silent as they listened to
        Barnabas and Paul telling them about the miraculous signs
        and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
        When they had finished, James spoke up: "Brothers, listen
        to me. Simon has described to us how God at first showed
        his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for
        himself. The words of the prophets are in agreement with
        this, as it is written:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <center>
            `After this I will return<br />
             and rebuild David's fallen tent.<br />
             Its ruins I will rebuild,<br />
             and I will restore it,<br />
             that the remnant of men may seek the Lord,<br />
             and all Gentiles who bear my name,<br />
             says the Lord, who does these things'<br />
             that have been known for ages.<br />
          </center>
        </blockquote>

        <p>It is my judgment, therefore that we should not make it
        difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead
        we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food
        polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of
        strangled animals and from blood. For Moses has been
        preached in every city from the earliest times and is read
        in the synagogues on every Sabbath."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Acts 15:22-35 The Council's Letter to Gentile
      Believers</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church,
        decided to choose some of their own men and send them to
        Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called
        Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the
        brothers. With them they sent the following letter:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The apostles and elders, your brothers,</p>

          <p>To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and
          Cilicia:</p>

          <p>Greetings:</p>

          <p>We have heard that some went out from us without our
          authorization and disturbed you, troubling you minds by
          what they said. So, we all agreed to choose some men and
          send them to you with our dear friends Barnabus and Paul
          -- men who have risked their lives for the name of our
          Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore we are sending Judas and
          Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. It
          seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden
          you with anything beyond the following requirements: You
          are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood,
          from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual
          immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. <font
          color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: Circumcision is not
          required.]</b></font></p>

          <p>Farewell.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where
        they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.
        The people read it and were glad for its encouraging
        message. Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets,
        said much to encourage and strengthen their brothers. After
        spending some time with them, they were sent off by the
        brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who
        had sent them. But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch,
        where they and many others preached the word of the
        Lord.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <a id="ACTS21" name="ACTS21"></a> 

      <h4>Acts 21:17-25 Paul's Arrival at Jerusalem</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p>When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us
        warmly. The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see
        James, and all the elders were present. Paul greeted them
        and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles
        through his ministry.</p>

        <p>When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said
        to Paul: "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have
        believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. They
        have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live
        among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them
        not to circumcise their children or live according to their
        customs. What shall we do? They will certainly hear that
        you have come, so do what we tell you. There are four men
        with us who have made a vow. Take these men, join in their
        purification rites and pay their expenses so they can have
        their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no
        truth in these reports about you, but you yourself are
        living in obedience to the law. As for the Gentile
        believers, we have written to them our decision that they
        should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood,
        and from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual
        immorality."</p>

      <h3>THE GENERAL LETTERS</h3>
      <a id="GAL2" name="GAL2"></a> 

      <h4>Galatians 2:1-5 Paul Accepted by Apostles</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Fourteen years later I went up to Jerusalem, this time with
        Barnabas. I took Titus along also. I went in response to a
        revelation and set before them the Gospel I preach among
        the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed
        to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my
        race in vain. Yet not even Titus, who was with me was
        required to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.
        This matter arose because some false brothers had
        infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in
        Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. We did not give in to
        them for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might
        remain in you.
      </blockquote>
      <a id="GAL5" name="GAL5"></a> 

      <h4>Galatians 5:1-12 Freedom in Christ</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand
        firm and do not let yourselves be burdened again by the
        yoke of slavery.</p>

        <p>Mark my words! I, Paul tell you that if you let yourself
        be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.
        Again I declare to every man who lets himself be
        circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. You
        who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated
        from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. But by faith
        we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for
        which we hope. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor
        uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is
        faith expressing itself through love.</p>

        <p>You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept
        you from obeying the truth? That kind of persuasion does
        not come from the one who calls you. "A little yeast works
        through the whole batch of dough." I am confident in the
        Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is
        throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever
        he may be. Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision,
        why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense
        of the cross has been abolished. As for those agitators, I
        wish they would go the whole way and emasculate
        themselves!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <a id="GAL6" name="GAL6"></a> 

      <h4>Galatians 6:12-15 Not Circumcision but a New
      Creation</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are
        trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason
        they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of
        Christ. Not even those who are circumcised obey the law,
        yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast
        about your flesh. May I never boast except in the cross of
        our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been
        crucified through to me, and I to the world. Neither
        circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; what
        counts is a new creation. Peace and mercy to all who follow
        this rule, even to the Israel of God.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>I Corinthians 7:17-20 Marriage</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Nevertheless, each one of you should retain the place in
        life that the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has
        called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the
        churches. Was a man already circumcised when he was called?
        He should not be uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised
        when he was called? He should not be circumcised.
        Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing.
        Keeping God's commandments is what counts. Each of you
        should remain in the situation which he was in when God
        called him.
      </blockquote>
      <a id="ROM2" name="ROM2"></a> 

      <h4>Romans 2:25-28 The Jews and the Law</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if
        you break the law you become as though you had not been
        circumcised. If those who are not circumcised keep the
        law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though
        they had been circumcised? The one who is not circumcised
        physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even
        though you have the written code and circumcision are a
        lawbreaker.</p>

        <p>A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly nor is
        circumcision merely outward and physical. No, a man is a
        Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision
        of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such
        a man's praise is not from men, but from God.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <a id="ROM3" name="ROM3"></a> 

      <h4>Romans 3:28-31 Righteousness through Faith</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Where then is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle?
        On that of observing the law. Is God the God of Jews only?
        Is he not the God of Gentiles too, since there is only one
        God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the
        uncircumcised through that same faith. Do we, then, nullify
        the law by this faith? not at all! Rather, we uphold the
        law.
      </blockquote>
      <a id="ROM4" name="ROM4"></a> 

      <h4>Romans 4:9-12</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for
        the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith
        was credited to him as righteousness. Under what
        circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was
        circumcised, or before? It was not afterward but before.
        And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
        righteousness that he had by faith while he was still
        uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe
        but have not been circumcised but who also walk in the
        footsteps of faith that our father Abraham had before he
        was circumcised.
      </blockquote>
      <a id="EPH2" name="EPH2"></a> 

      <h4>Ephesians 2:11-13 One in Christ</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by
        birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call
        themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the
        hands of men) - remember that at that time you were
        separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel
        and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, with hope
        and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you
        who one were far away have been brought near through the
        blood of Christ.

      <h4>Phillipians 3:1-11 No Confidence in the Flesh</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no
        trouble to write the same things to you again, and it is a
        safeguard for you.</p>

        <p>Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those
        mutilators of the flesh. For it is we who are of the
        circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who
        glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the
        flesh - though I myself have reasons for such
        confidence.</p>

        <p>If anyone else thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I
        have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of
        Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in
        regard to the law, a Pharisee; as for zeal, persecuting the
        church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.</p>

        <p>But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for
        the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a
        loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ
        Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I
        consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found
        in him, not having a righteousness that comes from the law,
        but that which is found through faith in Christ - the
        righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. I want
        to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the
        fellowship of sharing in those sufferings, becoming like
        him in death, an so somehow to attain to the resurrection
        from the dead.</p>

      <h4>Titus 1:10-16 Titus' Task on Crete</h4>

      <blockquote>
        For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and
        deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group. They
        must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households
        by teaching thing they ought not to teach - and that for
        the sake of dishonest gain. Even one of their own prophets
        has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy
        gluttons." This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them
        sharply, so that they will be strong in the faith and will
        pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of
        those who reject the truth. To the pure all things are
        pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe,
        nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences
        are corrupted. They claim to know God, but by their actions
        they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit
        for doing anything good.

      <h4>Mark 13:22-23 Signs of the End of the Age</h4>

      <blockquote>
        For false Christs and false prophets will appear and
        perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect if -- that
        were possible. So be on your guard. See I have told you
        everything ahead of time.

      <h4>Matthew 7:15-20 Signs of the End of the Age</h4>

      <blockquote>
        "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's
        clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their
        fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from
        thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise every good
        tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A
        good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear
        good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut
        down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you
        will recognize them."

      <h4>Matthew 24:10-11 Signs of the End of the Age</h4>

      <blockquote>
        At that time many false prophets will appear and deceive
        many people.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Matthew 24:24-25 Sign of the End of the Age</h4>

      <blockquote>
        For false Christs and false prophets will appear and
        perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect
        -- if that were possible. See, I have told you ahead of
        time.

      <h3>THE GENERAL LETTERS</h3>
      <a id="nt2COR11" name="nt2COR11"></a> 

      <h4>2 Corinthians 11:3-4 Paul and the False Apostles</h4>

      <blockquote>
        But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the
        serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray
        from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if
        someone comes to you and preaches a different gospel from
        the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>2 Corinthians 11:13-15</h4>

      <blockquote>
        For such men are false apostles, deceitful workman,
        masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for
        Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not
        surprising then that his servants masquerade as servants of
        righteousness. There end will be what their actions
        deserve.

      <a id="nt2PET2" name="nt2PET2"></a> 

      <h4>2 Peter 2:1-3</h4>

      <blockquote>
        But there were also false prophets among the people, just
        as their will be false teachers among you. They will
        secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the
        Sovereign Lord who brought them - bringing swift
        destruction on themselves. Many will follow their shameful
        ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In
        their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories
        they have made up.

      <a id="nt1JOH4" name="nt1JOH4"></a> 

      <h4>1 John 4:1-3 Test the Spirits</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Dear friends, do not believe every spirit but test the
        spirits to see whether they are from God, because many
        false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how
        you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that
        acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
        from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus
        is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist,
        which you have heard is coming and even now is coming into
        the world.

      <h2>SCRIPTURE ABOUT REARING OF CHILDREN</h2>

      <h3>THE GENERAL LETTERS</h3>
      <a id="EPH6" name="EPH6"></a> 

      <h4>Ephesians 6:4 Children and Parents</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Fathers, do not exasperate your children but bring them up
        in the training and instruction of the Lord.
      </blockquote>
      <a id="COL3" name="COL3"></a> 

      <h4>Colossians 3:21 Rules for Christian Households</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Fathers, do not embitter your children or they will become
        discouraged.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>THE PASTORAL LETTERS</h3>
      <a id="TIT2" name="TIT2"></a> 

      <h4>Titus 2:3-5 What must be Taught to Various Groups</h4>

      <blockquote>
        Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way
        they live, not be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
        to teach what is good. Then they can train the younger
        women to love their husbands and children, to be
        self-controlled and pure, and to be subject to their
        husbands so that no one will malign the word of God.
