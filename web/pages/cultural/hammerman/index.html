<h2>Birth Rite</h2>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<font size="4">
<P align="justify">
     "But the mohel (circumciser) with whom I had worked
countless times suddenly handed <B><I>me</I></B> the knife. He pointed
to my squirming son, whose hands and legs were tied to the
board. The foreskin had been pulled up over the glans of the
penis and was now protruding through a narrow slit of the
small, stainless steel clamp. . . . 'It's the greatest honor
a father can have,' he added. . . . There is no greater
primal anger than that caused by seeing another male in
carnal contact with your wife, in this case the physical
intimacy of mother and son. And there is no greater primal
envy than that caused by looking down at the person who was
brought into the world specifically to be your survivor. . .
. The breast provides, but the knife protects. It channels
the father's natural anger and jealousy into one controlled
cut. He takes off one small part in order to preserve -- and
love -- the whole. . . . No father should be denied this
experience, even vicariously, of inflicting upon his child a
ritualized blow so intense as to make him both shake and
recoil . . ."</font>
