      drives their knives?</span><br />
       by Michael Glass<br />
       October 14, 2000</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Circumcisers: What drives their
      knives?</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Unlike America, circumcision is not a big
      issue for most parents in Australia. Unlike 40 or 50 years
      ago, when most Australian boys were circumcised, only about
      10 per cent of boys are now circumcised as infants. However,
      it's an issue that doesn't go away. There are always people
      who push circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">Why?</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Fashion or Medicine?</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Everyone knows that Jews and Muslims
      circumcise their boys, but for the rest of us, it's largely a
      matter of time and geography. Americans usually do, while
      Continental Europeans generally don't. In Scandinavia it is
      rarely done at all for any reason, and the same is generally
      true for Russia, Latin America, India, China and Japan. In
      Egypt, virtually all the boys are circumcised, whether
      Christian or Muslim, and many African tribes also practice
      circumcision. In Korea, circumcision rates have risen, while
      in Britain Canada, New Zealand and Australia they have
      declined.</p>

      <p class="text1">This suggests medical fashion rather than
      medical necessity.</p>

      <p class="text1">Of course, there are fashions in medicine.
      Fifty years ago, tonsils were whipped out by the million.
      Then it fell out of fashion. Depending on fashion doctors
      either resisted caesarean births, or performed them more and
      more. Hospital birth rates are also affected by fashion and
      culture. In Australia and the United States, babies are most
      commonly born in hospital while in the Netherlands, home
      birth is common.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Reasons for Circumcisions:</b></p>

      <p class="text1">If circumcision rates vary wildly between
      countries, or even within countries, so do the medical
      reasons given for using the knife. In the Nineteenth Century,
      circumcision was promoted as a surefire cure for masturbation
      - because it dulled sexual sensation. Later, doctors promoted
      it as an aid to cleanliness, to prevent cancer of the penis,
      or of the cervix, and when it became unfashionable to say
      that circumcision dulled sexual sensation, doctors reassured
      us that it did not dull sexual sensation. Then, doctors said
      that circumcision prevented urinary tract infections or
      sexually transmitted disease, including AIDS.</p>

      <p class="text1">Over the same period, doctors also said that
      circumcision did not prevent masturbation, was no more
      effective than soap and water for cleanliness, made little or
      no difference to cancer rates, did not prevent sexually
      transmitted diseases and was more prevalent in the USA where
      AIDS was rife than in Western Europe.</p>

      <p class="text1">Occasionally, doctors and lawyers pointed
      out that circumcisions could cause sexual mutilations,
      infections, disfigurements and even deaths. It all depended
      who was pushing which barrow.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Infant Circumcision - agony of the
      newborn</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Australian practice has largely turned
      against circumcision. The Australian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons' view is that routine male circumcision
      should not be performed prior to the age of 6 months. It
      considers:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication. It
        is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to
        remove a normal and healthy prepuce."<sup>1</sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The reason is clear from a nurse's
      description of circumcision. It does not make pleasant
      reading:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"I have assisted with about 200 [circumcisions] and I
        have seen sleeping babies not wake up as I gently strapped
        them to the table. One even slept through the betadine and
        that is cold stuff. So it is not the restriction that is
        the problem.</p>

        <p>"They take a metal probe-- similar to the one the dental
        hygienist scales teeth with-- and separate the foreskin
        from the glans. Babies scream so hard that they end up with
        their faces red and mouths wide open with no sound coming
        out. I had to hold their heads to the side because some
        vomit from the pain. I always had to get close to their
        faces and stroke their cheeks because they would stop
        breathing.</p>

        <p>"The doc puts a bell over the foreskin and slides a
        sterile safety pin through a hole and then through the
        skin. He cuts with a blade for what seems like an eternity
        for this baby and deposits the skin on the sterile tray.
        The penis is RAW-- I often through [thought] it must feel
        like a 3rd degree burn with alcohol being poured over it.
        Consoling is impossible. They shake and their eyes are wide
        open with panic.</p>

        <p>"Yes, I felt horrible every time. I never got used to
        it. Each procedure looked as barbaric as the next. [With]
        many, too much skin was taken off or too little (not worth
        that torture). I have seen infections, too: the risk of any
        invasive procedure-- even with sterlie [sterile?]
        fields.</p>

        <p>"I get calls from moms who had no problems with
        breastfeeding and suddenly have trouble. If it is a baby
        boy, I try to remember to ask when and if he was
        circumcised. Many of my consults are a result of trauma
        from the circs. The babies' state of homeostasis is so
        messed up from the stress that they are no longer able to
        suck. Every (lactation consultant).. that I know will tell
        you how circumcision is a major source of feeding problems
        in the days following."<sup>2</sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">If this is a worry, and I believe that it is
      a scathing indictment of neonatal circumcision, the attitude
      of a nurse on a pro circumcision website is even more
      alarming.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"As a nurse in the maternity wing of a large hospital, I
        have assisted with several hundred circumcisions. I am 100%
        in favor of routine circumcision. The pain the baby
        experiences is no doubt considerable, but I think it's more
        than worth it. .... At the hospital where I practice, about
        60 percent of baby boys are circumcised, and I strongly
        encourage any expectant mother to do it. While the baby
        sometimes cries loudly during the procedure, most quiet
        right down after being released from the Circumstraint (the
        board to which the baby's arms and legs are strapped during
        the procedure). Assisting during circumcisions is the
        favorite part of my job, as I think it's a moment of magic
        when a baby boy's glans is permanently exposed for the
        first time in his young life. If a mother truly loves her
        son, she should definitely insist on circumcision."</p>

        <p>Sandra (US)<sup>3</sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">These magic moments only occur for Sandra
      with 60 per cent of the babies, but this isn't enough for
      her. She's 100% in favour of routine circumcision, and
      says.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "I strongly encourage any expectant mother to do it."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">This would give her more magic moments. She
      has a persuasive line:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "If a mother truly loves her son, she should definitely
        insist on circumcision."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">She admits:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The pain the baby experiences is no doubt considerable,
        but I think it's more than worth it."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The baby's pain is certainly worth it for
      her! What is revealed is her interest in the naked glans of
      baby boys, and her enthusiasm in getting more parents to
      agree to the procedure that gives her those `magic moments'.
      In her case, her interest in baby boys' penises prompts her
      to pressure young mothers to have their boys circumcised -
      for her gratification.</p>

      <p class="text1">If that is infant circumcision, and that is
      an example of those who are pushing it on the public, then
      there is something seriously wrong with this medical
      practice.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Religion</b></p>

      <p class="text1">It is at this point that someone is sure to
      say that it's part of people's religion. And so it is. Jews
      circumcise their infant boys. So do Muslims, though it
      doesn't have to be done on newborns, and the practice is not
      mentioned in the Koran.</p>

      <p class="text1">But most Americans and Australians are
      neither Jews nor Muslims. Most are either Christian or have
      no religious affiliation. So let us look at what Saint Paul
      said about those who tried to push circumcision on the early
      Christians:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"It is those who want to make a good showing in the
        flesh that would compel you to be
        circumcised..."<sup>4</sup></p>

        <p>"...they...desire to have you circumcised, that they may
        glory in your flesh." <sup>5</sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">It is amazing that almost 2000 years ago, a
      Christian leader, who himself circumcised a man<sup>6</sup>
      should be accusing circumcision enthusiasts of pushing it for
      sexual reasons. It wasn't just in one place either. Please
      note that Jews called male prostitutes dogs:<sup>7</sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        "Look out for the dogs, look out for the evil-workers, look
        out for those who mutilate the flesh. For we are the true
        circumcision, who worship God in spirit, and glory in
        Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the
        flesh."<sup>8</sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">You would almost think that St Paul had seen
      some of the things that pro-circumcision enthusiasts have put
      on the internet!</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Let us not give the last word to
      enthusiasts, either pro or anti-circumcision. One
      website<sup>9</sup> was able to amass an impressive array of
      quotations from medical bodies against the practice of
      routine neonatal circumcision from a range of
      English-speaking countries. The <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> (1999) said that evidence does not justify
      recommending routine circumcision. The <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
      target="_blank">Canadian Paediatric Society, Fetus and
      Newborn Committee</a> had already said something similar in
      1996. The <a href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian
      College of Paediatrics</a> and the Australasian Association
      of Paediatric Surgeons went further. They said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "...neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication.
        It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia
        to remove a normal functional and protective prepuce
        [foreskin]."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The <a
      href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons</a> added:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "We do not support the removal of a normal part of the
        body, unless there are definite indications to justify the
        complications and risks which may arise. In particular, we
        are opposed to male children being subjected to a
        procedure, which had they been old enough to consider the
        advantages and disadvantages, may well have opted to reject
        the operation and retain their prepuce [foreskin]."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The 1996 British Medical Association
      Guidelines, <a href="/library/statements/bma/">Circumcision
      of Male Infants: Guidance for Doctors</a>, would appear to
      rule out circumcision for therapeutic reasons, except as a
      last resort:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "To circumcise for therapeutic reasons where medical
        research has shown other techniques to be at least as
        effective and less invasive would be unethical and
        inappropriate."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Now we all know that doctors disagree on
      treatments. Even in different English-speaking countries,
      medical opinions on circumcision vary. Nevertheless, when
      national medical councils are equivocal at best about infant
      circumcision and some are actively opposed to it, parents
      should heed the warning of St Paul and question the motives
      of those who push for the circumcision of babies.</p>
