<P align="justify">
Although it was a little late by traditional religious standards, the entire
family and many friends gathered in our home three weeks after our son,
Zachary, was born. We had gathered for his <I>bris</I>, the moment when a young
Jewish boy is first brought into the family and the community, the moment of
his formal entrance into the world of Judaism. At such symbolic moments, one
feels keenly the sinews of connection to family and friends that sustain a
life, animate it, give it context and meaning.
<P  align="justify">
The mohel, of course, was running late. When he arrived, everyone gathered
in the living room, where we had set up a table on which we had placed the
various items we would use in the ceremony. A special chair had been
reserved for the "sandek," the honored family male elder, often the baby's
grandfather or great-grandfather, who would hold the baby during much of the
proceedings. (In our case, a godmother and godfather shared this role.)
<P  align="justify">
As family and friends drew closer together, glasses of wine and champagne in
their hands, the ritual began with prayers over the wine and bread. Our
first toast to this new creature who had entered all our lives. Then the
mohel began the naming ceremony, and some relatives and friends offered
their wishes for this young life.
<P  align="justify">
Amy, my wife, and I each offered a thought to the other and to Zachary as we
entered this new phase of our lives as parents together. For my part, I
quoted Adrienne Rich, who had written that "if I could have one wish for my
own sons, it is that they should have the courage of women." I wished
nothing more for Zachary than that he would have Amy's courage, her
integrity, and her passion.
<P  align="justify">
Then it was the moment for which we had all carefully prepared, about which
we had endlessly talked, debated, argued, discussed. We took a pitcher of
water and a bowl to the door of the house. Amy and I carried Zachary over to
the threshold. With one hand I held his little body and with the other held
his tiny legs over the bowl. Amy poured some water over his feet and rubbed
it in. Then she held him and I did the same. Throughout, the mohel chanted
in prayer. And in that way, we welcomed Zachary into our home and into our
lives.
<P  align="justify">
By now you are, of course, waiting for the "real" bris to begin, for the
mohel to stuff a wine-soaked handkerchief into our son's mouth to muffle his
cries and slightly anesthetize him, and then circumcise him, cutting off his
foreskin in fulfillment of God's commandment to Abraham that he mark his
son, Isaac, as a sign of obedience.
<P  align="justify">
Sorry to disappoint, but that's the end of our story. Or at least the end of
the story of Zachary's bris. There was no circumcision on that day. We had
decided not to circumcise our son. Although he enters a world filled with
violence, he would enter it without violence done to him. Although he will
no doubt suffer many cuts and scrapes during his life, he would not bleed by
our hand.
<P  align="justify">
This was not an easy decision, but we had plenty of time to prepare--nine
months to be exact. From the moment we saw the sonogram and read the results
of the amniocentesis, the debate had been joined. Would we or wouldn't we?
How would we decide? The remainder of this essay charts that process.
<P  align="justify" >
First, we talked. Constantly. Just when we thought the issue settled, we'd
open it again. Each time one of us would read something, think something,
pull something new off the Internet, we would reopen the discussion anew. We
talked with friends, family members, religious authorities, doctors, and
nurses. We asked our heterosexual women friends whether they had a
preference for cut or uncut men. We each sought counsel from the email
discussion groups to which we belonged, and we consulted organizations like
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association. We
ordered and read more than a dozen books and pamphlets.
<P  align="justify">
We contacted advocacy groups like National Organization of Circumcision
Information Resource Centers (<A HREF="http://www.nocirc.org/">nocirc</A>), National Organization to Halt the
Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males (<A HREF="http://www.noharmm.org/">noharmm</A>), and Doctors Opposing
Circumcision (<A HREF="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/">DOC</A>). But these organizations, while eager, were too
one-sided, and tended to minimize the difficulty of our decision.
<P  align="justify">
And we didn't even bother calling the organizations like Brothers United for
Future Foreskins (BUFF), National Organization of Restoring Men (<A HREF="http://www.norm.org/">NORM</A>), and
RECover a Penis (RECAP) that encourage men who might "feel victimized by the
unnecessary loss of their natural anatomical wholeness," as Joseph Zoske
<A HREF="http://www.noharmm.org/zoske.htm">writes</A> in Journal of Men's Studies (1998), to undergo penile reconstructive
surgery to "correct" the circumcised penis. Such procedures (involving
either attaching a new flap or pulling the remaining tissue down over the
glans to create a pseudo-foreskin) seem as unnecessary as circumcision, and
no doubt attend to psychological distress that has only the most tenuous
connection to a small flap of penile tissue.</font>
<P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
Pros and Cons</B></font></center><font face="arial" size="2">
<P  align="justify">
We heard a lot of arguments, for and against. To be sure, there is no
shortage of arguments in favor of circumcision. Some are aesthetic, and
offer a psychological theory based on that aesthetic. Without circumcision,
we heard, our son will look different from his father, and thus develop
shame about his body. Our son will look different from other Jewish boys,
especially in our heavily Jewish neighborhood, thus be subject to ridicule
and teasing, and develop a sense that he does not belong. As one man on an
email list to which I posed the question wrote, "I don't want my kid to be
an object of interest while taking public showers, such as in gym class or
in athletic clubs" (David Garnier, personal communication).
<P  align="justify">
Other arguments are medical. After all, male circumcision is the most common
surgical procedure in the United States and medical insurance carriers
routinely cover hospital circumcision (which raises the incentives of
medical practitioners to advocate the procedure). Our son's risks of penile
infection, STD, and especially penile cancer would be significantly lower if
he were to be circumcised. The likelihood of uterine cancer in his female
sexual partners would be higher if he were not.
<P  align="justify">
In addition, there were conflicting reports on the effects of circumcision
on sexual functioning. There is some evidence from sex surveys that
circumcised men are more sexually active and more sexually adventurous,
especially as regards oral and anal sex. Circumcised men masturbate more
often. And because circumcised men have less sexual sensitivity--after all,
the foreskin contains about 1,000 nerve endings, fully one-third of the
organ's pleasure receptors--there is some evidence that circumcision delays
ejaculation somewhat.
<P  align="justify">
And, of course, the weight of family, history, and culture do not rest
lightly on the shoulders of the new parent. As Jews we knew full well the
several-thousand-year-old tradition of following one of the most fundamental
of God's commandments to Abraham--that "every male among you shall be
circumcised...and that shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you."
<P  align="justify">
In the end, none of the arguments in favor of circumcision was fully
persuasive. Taken together, however, they raised issues that spoke to the
core of our identities as a man and a woman, as parents, as feminists, and
as Jews. Each of the points of contention seems worth discussing in a bit
more detail.</font>
<P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
The Psychological Aesthetics of Difference</B></font></center>
<P><font face="arial" size="2">
That our son would look different from his father was easily negotiated. We
decided that we will simply tell him that Daddy had no choice about his own
body and especially his penis, but that now, as parents, we loved him so
much that we decided we didn't want to hurt him like that--turning
something that could be a cause of embarrassment into a source of pride.
<P  align="justify">
And he will look more and more like the other boys rather than different.
Circumcision of newborns is decreasingly popular, performed routinely only
in the United States (as a medical procedure in the hospital) and in Israel,
where it remains a significant religious ceremony. (Adolescent circumcision
remains the norm in most Islamic nations.) After these two countries, only
Canada (25%) and Australia (10%) have rates of newborn circumcision in
double digits; in European nations it is virtually nonexistent among
non-Jews. Over four-fifths of all men in the world are uncircumcised.
<P  align="justify">
Here in the United States, rates have fallen from well over 85 percent in
1960 to about 66 percent in 2000, so there was every reason to believe that
more and more boys would look like Zachary and that he had little to fear by
way of social ostracism. In our own neighborhood in heavily Jewish Brooklyn,
about half the baby boys born in our local hospital are circumcised in the
hospital (though there is no information about those who have it performed
as a religious ceremony in their homes or elsewhere).
</font>
<P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
Medical Ambivalence</B></font></center>
<P  align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">

While it is true that the risk of penile cancer or infection is virtually
non-existent among circumcised men, rates among uncircumcised men, though
higher, are still minuscule. In 1991, the American Academy of Pediatrics
finally lifted its long-time advocacy of routine hospital circumcision for
health reasons, and now takes no position on the question, thus leaving the
decision entirely up to the parents' aesthetic or religious beliefs. They
concluded that there were no medical benefits to circumcision as long as the
boy was instructed in proper cleanliness.
<P  align="justify">
Even the redoubtable Benjamin Spock changed his mind over the years. Having
always stood for the conventional wisdom that parents know best, Spock told
<I>Redbook</I> in an <A HREF="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/spock.html">interview</A> in 1989 that his preference "if I had the good
fortune to have another son, would be to leave his little penis alone." In a
pamphlet, "Circumcision: A Medical or Human Rights Issue?" one doctor went
so far as to suggest that removing the foreskin for strictly hygienic
purposes was analogous to removing the eyelid for a cleaner eyeball.
<P  align="justify">
Future sexual functioning didn't weigh particularly heavily in our minds
either. For one thing, sexual functioning is so profoundly variable; we
expect that if we teach Zachary to develop respect for his and others'
bodies as well as their personal integrity, sexual pleasure will not be an
issue for him or his partners. Second, the evidence is inconsistent. While
circumcised men in the United States seem to have more sex, more varied sex,
and masturbate more often, this may be more of a function of race, class,
education, and religion than with whether or not the man is circumcised.
It's middle class white men--who tend to be the most secular and the most
sexual--who still compose the majority of circumcised men. Among blacks and
Hispanics, rates of oral sex and masturbation are significantly lower than
among white men, and middle class men are more sexually active and
adventurous than working class men. "People with graduate degrees are the
most likely to masturbate," noted Ed Laumann, a sociologist and one of the
principal researchers in the University of Chicago <A HREF="/library/general/laumann/">sex survey</A> in the early
1990s.
<P  align="justify">
Nor were we ultimately concerned about the eventual effect on potential
women partners. An informal poll among heterosexual women friends yielded a
mixed anecdotal response. Most said they preferred circumcised men, and one
or two indicated significant aesthetic discomfort with intact men. But an
<A HREF="/library/anatomy/ohara/">article</A> in the January 1999 <I>British Journal of Urology</I> reported that women
who had slept with both circumcised and intact men preferred sex with men
who were not circumcised. The article reported that the women achieved
orgasm faster, and were more likely to achieve multiple orgasms.</font>
<P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
The Burden of History</B></font></center>
<P  align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">
Actually, the historical record of medical opinion consistently pushed us
further into the anti-circumcision camp. The more we learned about the
medical history, the more we were convinced that concerns other than the
health of the baby led doctors to make circumcision a routine practice.
Before the 1870s, in the United States, routine medical circumcision was
quite rare, hovering around 5 to 6 percent of all newborn baby boys.
Subscribers to the new Victorian sexual morality sought to reduce what
critics perceived to be rampant sexual promiscuity, and especially
masturbation, which, they believed, resulted in all sorts of debilities and
even death. Masturbation was said to cause all manner of emotional,
psychological, and physiological problems, from bed-wetting to adolescent
insolence, acne to mental retardation, insanity, psychological exhaustion,
and neurasthenia.
<P  align="justify">
Circumcision's well-established ability to curb sexual appetite and pleasure
was prescribed as a potential cure for sexual profligacy. Lewis Sayre, a
prominent New York physician, hailed as "the Columbus of the prepuce" by his
colleagues, experimented with circumcision as a cure for paralysis and other
muscular ailments. Sayre's colleagues also noted that Jews had a lower rate
of STDs than non-Jews, and hypothesized that this had to do with
circumcision. (Actually this had to do with the fact that Jews had very
little sexual contact with non-Jews.)
<P  align="justify">
Another physician, <A HREF="http://sandiegohistory.org/bio/remondino/remondino.htm">Dr. Peter Remondino</A>, advocated universal male
circumcision since the foreskin, which he labeled "an unyielding tube," left
the intact male "a victim to all manner of ills, sufferings...and other
conditions calculated to weaken him physically, mentally, and morally; to
land him, perchance, in jail, or even in a lunatic asylum." And Robert
Tooke's popular <I>All About the Baby</I> (1896) recommended circumcision to
prevent "the vile habit of masturbation."
<P  align="justify">
J. H. Kellogg, pioneering health reformer, cereal inventor, and general
medical quack also sounded the alarm; his best-selling health advice book,
<A HREF="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgibin/toccer?id=KelPlai&tag=public&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/eng-parsed&part=0"><I>Plain Facts for Old and Young</I></A> (1888), included nearly 100 pages on the
dangers of masturbation. Circumcision is almost always successful in curbing
masturbation, he counseled, and he suggested that the operation be performed
"by a surgeon without administering anesthetic, as the brief pain attending
the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind...." (Though this
may have begun the tradition of not using anesthesia to perform
circumcision, Kellogg did not pretend that the baby feels no pain during the
procedure. Anyone who has ever witnessed a routine medical circumcision
performed without anesthesia knows only too well how much pain the infant
does feel.)
<P  align="justify">
Victorian morality was pervasive. And as waves of uncircumcised immigrants
entered the United States, circumcision of newborns was a way to stake a
claim for a truly "American" morality. Rates jumped to 25 percent by 1900.
After World War II, when the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>
reported that rates of STD were higher among blacks and uncircumcised white
men, circumcision rates continued to climb, and by 1980, nearly nine of
every ten American boys was circumcised.
<P  align="justify">
But it now appears that the rapid spread of circumcision as a routine
medical procedure had more to do with Victorian hysteria about sexuality
than it did with hygiene. And given the American Academy of Pediatrics'
recent backpedaling on the issue--from ritual endorsement to anxious
agnosticism to its most recent resigned disapproval--there seems to be no
medical argument--historical or hygienic--to compel the procedure.
</font><P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
The Weights of Tradition</B></font></center><P><font face="arial" size="2">

The combined weights of family and religious culture were not so easily
negotiated. As predicted, the future grandmothers were somewhat more
sanguine about the prospect of non-circumcision than were the future
grandfathers. It's ironic that it's always been women&mdash;even within
Judaism&mdash;who have opposed circumcision as a violence done to their babies,
and circumcised males who have supported it. Perhaps it is analogous to
fraternity or military initiation ceremonies, where the salutary outcome of
feeling a sense of belonging to the larger homosocial group is deemed worth
any price, including the removal of a third of one's potential sexual
pleasure.
<P  align="justify">
In our case, neither Amy nor I felt any strong compulsion towards
circumcision, but I was more strongly opposed on moral grounds. Amy's
opposition would come later, when she first held Zachary in her arms and she
felt a visceral rage that anyone would do anything that would ever hurt this
new creature. In very gender stereotyped terms, Amy's opposition grew from
her emotional, visceral connection to the baby; mine grew first from a
principled opposition grounded in a sense of justice and ethics.
<P  align="justify">
But equally gendered, I suppose, I felt that my Judaism had always given me
the ability to stand up against injustice, that the imperative of the
post-Holocaust generation of "Never Again!" impelled me to speak out against
injustices wherever I saw them.
<P  align="justify">
Ultimately, it came down to Judaism. Jewish law is unequivocal on the
subject--it has been a time-honored tradition since the celebrated Covenant
with Abraham, the founding moment of monotheism. In Genesis 17, God appears
before an aged Abraham--he's ninety-nine!--and commands that Abraham
circumcise himself, his son, and all male members of his household (slaves
and servants included).
<P  align="justify">
Today circumcision is seen as a mitzvah, linking the family to a 4000-year
history of a people. In his masterful compendium of Jewish law and lore,
<I>Essential Judaism</I>, George Robinson writes that it is a mitzvah "one performs
for its own sake as a subordination of oneself to a larger entity." What's a
tiny foreskin compared to 4,000 years of tradition? And so it appeared that
Jewish tradition might yet extract its pound of flesh--well, more likely
about a quarter of an ounce--from yet another innocent baby.
<P  align="justify">
Yet Judaism today is hardly as monolithic as we once thought. Even in
biblical times there seems to have been some dissent about the procedure. If
one follows the ritual as prescribed by Jewish law, the baby is held during
the circumcision on what is called the Chair of Elijah, named after the
prophet "who railed against the Jews for forsaking the ritual of
circumcision." What that says to me is that not long after circumcision was
instituted, there were a lot of people who were already resisting it. Then,
too, there is the law that the brit milah be performed on the eighth day
after the birth of the son, a law so ironclad that it is perhaps the only
Jewish ritual that may not be postponed for the Sabbath or even for Yom
Kippur. Those who were interested in enforcing circumcision were determined
that there be no excuses--no doubt because a lot of people were trying to
wiggle their way out.
<P  align="justify">
In her research, Amy found that even as recently as the mid-nineteenth
century, in Eastern Europe and Russia there was a widespread move to stop
the practice--ironically, just when it was becoming more widespread in the
United States. Led by women--what a surprise!--who thought the practice
barbaric and patriarchal, the movement eventually even convinced <A HREF="http://www.beth-elsa.org/be_s0314.htm">Theodore
Herzl</A>, the founder of modern Zionism, who refused to allow his own son to be
circumcised.
<P align="justify">
It is, after all, quite perplexing: why would God ask Abraham do such a
thing to himself and all the males of his household--especially his son?
For years, I had a little cartoon in my study that depicted Abraham,
standing alone on top of a mountain, looking up at the sky, forlorn and
exasperated. The caption read, "Let me see if I have this right: You want us
to cut the ends of our dicks off?!?!"</font>
<P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
Sublimating Pleasure for Torah</B></font></center>
<P><font face="arial" size="2">
The circumcision as ritual makes sense, however, in three ways--one sexual,
one political, and one symbolic. Throughout history, commentators on
circumcision have agreed that the goal was to transform men's (and women's)
sexual experience, and thus make men more eager to study Torah. The only
thing they disagreed on was how, exactly, circumcision would accomplish this
feat of sublimation.
<P  align="justify">
Most observers assumed it would make a man less sexually sensitive, reduce
his sexual ardor, and constrain his sexual impulses. In his fascinating
study, <I>Eros and the Jews</I>, David Biale finds two contradictory impulses
leading towards the same conclusion. Ancient Jews, such as <A HREF="http://www.hivolda.no/asf/kkf/philopag.html">Philo</A>, understood
circumcision as "the symbol of the excision of excessive and superfluous
pleasure." In <A HREF="/library/cultural/maimonides/"><I>Guide to the Perplexed</I></A>, the great medieval philosopher Moses
Maimonides prefigured J. H. Kellogg by nearly a millennium when he wrote
that the commandment to circumcise was "not prescribed with a view to
perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is
defective morally." A chief reason for the ritual was "the wish to bring
about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in
question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a
state as possible." After all, he continued, "the fact that circumcision
weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes
the pleasure is indubitable."
<P  align="justify">
While Maimonides argued that the physiological loss was "the real purpose"
of the ritual, others believed that the psychological impact far outweighed
the physical. Biale notes that an early medieval Midrash Tadshe suggests
that the "covenant of circumcision was therefore placed on the genitals so
that the fear of God would restrain them from sin." Later thinkers took the
physical to new extremes. The early-nineteenth-century scholar, Nahman of
Bratslav, great grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, argued that circumcision
symbolizes the complete excision of sexual pleasure so that the "true
zaddik" (holy man) experiences pain, not pleasure, during intercourse.
<P  align="justify">
On the one hand, writers were convinced that men would feel less--much
less, and therefore their frustration would lead inevitably towards holier
devotion to study. On the other hand, some writers were convinced that
circumcised men would experience far more sexual excitement--so much more,
in fact, that it would leave both him and his partner so frustrated that
they wouldn't want to have sex again. In an astonishing passage, <A HREF="/library/cultural/yedaiah1/">Isaac ben
Yedaiah</A>, a late thirteenth-century French follower of Maimonides described
the difference in such overheated prose that it borders on the salacious
(which alone makes it worth quoting at length):
<P><blockquote><blockquote><font size="1">
[A beautiful woman] will court a man who is uncircumcised in the flesh and
lie against his breast with great passion, for he thrusts inside her a long
time because of the foreskin, which is a barrier against ejaculation in
intercourse. Thus she feels pleasure and reaches an orgasm first. When an
uncircumcised man sleeps with her and then resolves to return to his home,
she brazenly grasps him, holding on to his genitals and says to him, 'Come
back, make love to me.' This is because of the pleasure that she finds in
intercourse with him, from the sinews of his testicles--sinews of
iron--and from his ejaculation--that of a horse--which he shoots like an
arrow into her womb. They are united without separating and he makes love
twice and three times in one night, yet the appetite is not filled. And so
he acts with her night after night. The sexual activity emaciates him of his
bodily fat and afflicts his flesh and he devotes his brain entirely to
women, an evil thing.
<P  align="justify">
But when a circumcised man desires the beauty of a woman...he will find
himself performing his task quickly, emitting his seed as soon as he inserts
the crown.... He has an orgasm first; he does not hold back his strength. As
soon as he begins intercourse with her, he immediately comes to a climax.
She has no pleasure from him when she lies down or when she arises and it
would be better for her if he had not known her ... for he arouses her
passion to no avail and she remains in a state of desire ... (cited in
Biale).</font>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<P  align="justify">
So more excitement means less pleasure--for both him and his female
partner. Ancient rabbis, like Philo, had argued that not only did
circumcision restrain male sexual ardor, but diminished women's pleasure.
"It is hard for a woman to separate herself from an uncircumcised man with
whom she has had intercourse." Everyone now seemed to agree that
circumcision reduces the pleasure of the woman, which is precisely why it
seems to have been prescribed. And precisely why Amy and I were growing
increasingly suspicious.
<P  align="justify">
There were political issues involved as well. It's interesting to observe
the expansion of the ritual in terms of the relationship between Jews and
their neighbors. Originally, apparently, the ritual consisted of only the
<I>brit milah</I>--which is the excision of a small part of the foreskin. This
enabled some Jewish men to continue to "pass" as gentiles in the ancient
edition of those locker room showers that my friends continually discussed.
Disgruntled rabbis then added the <I>brit periah</I> which removed the entire
foreskin, making it impossible to pass as gentile. (It's an ironic twist of
history that it is the <I>brit periah</I> that was adopted by modern medicine when
it still prescribed routine neonatal circumcision.)
<P  align="justify">
But this expansion also raised, for us, the thorniest political and moral
dilemma. A close friend, a child of Holocaust survivors, told me the story
of his uncle, who was not so lucky. His was the now-classic story of the
young man, sneaking his way onto a train leaving Germany, under the watchful
eyes of the Nazis. When caught, he was forced to strip in the station, and
when it was discovered that he was circumcised, he was shot on the spot.
<P  align="justify">
Here was a political reason to circumcise, a slap in the face of
anti-Semitism, a way to connect my son to a history of resistance against
anti-Semitism, and to recognize the ways in which physical difference
(whether congenitally or culturally derived) is grounds for discrimination.
In fact, some historians claim that the <I>brit periah</I>, the more extensive
circumcision, was first used by the Egyptians to mark their Hebrew slaves,
so that they would be readily and permanently identifiable. Ironic then,
that once free, these same Hebrews made the more dramatic statement a matter
of their own <I>inclusion</I>.</font>
<P><center><font face="times new roman" size="4"><B>
Penile Patriarchy</B></font></center><font face="arial" size="2">
<P  align="justify">
But what was ultimately decisive for us was the larger symbolic meaning of
circumcision, and particularly the gendered politics of the ritual. After
all, it is not circumcision that makes a man Jewish; one can certainly be
Jewish without it. Religious membership is passed on through the mother: if
the mother is Jewish then the baby is Jewish and nothing that the baby
does--or that is done to him or her--can change that basic fact. A rabbi
is trained to counsel parents of mixed religious backgrounds (in which the
man is Jewish and the woman is not) that circumcision does not make their
son Jewish, but that only the mother's conversion will make it so.
<P  align="justify">
No, circumcision means something else: the reproduction of patriarchy.
Abraham cements his relationship to God by a symbolic genital mutilation of
his son. It is on the body of his son that Abraham writes his own beliefs.
In a religion marked by the ritual exclusion of women, such a marking not
only enables Isaac to be included within the community of men--he can be
part of a minyan, can pray in the temple, can study Torah--but he can also
lay claim to all the privileges to which being a Jewish male now entitles
him. Monotheistic religions invariably worship male Gods, and exhibit
patriarchal political arrangements between the sexes. (Looked at this way,
since both Judaism and Islam practice circumcision, it is really
Christianity that is the deviant case, and it would be worth exploring how
Christianity justified its evasion of the practice since it is certain that
Jesus was circumcised.)
<P  align="justify">
Circumcision, it became clear, is the single moment of the reproduction of
patriarchy. It's when patriarchy happens, the single crystalline moment when
the rule of the fathers is reproduced, the moment when male privilege and
entitlement is passed from one generation to the next, when the power of the
fathers is enacted upon the sons, a power which the sons will someday then
enact on the bodies of their own sons. To circumcise our son, then, would
be, unwittingly or not, to accept as legitimate 4000 years not of Jewish
tradition, but of patriarchal domination of women.
<P>
Our choice was clear.
<P  align="justify">
We welcomed Zachary into our family on that morning without a circumcision.
We decided that we want him to live in a world without violence, so we
welcomed him without violence. We decided that we want him to live in a
world in which he is free to experience the fullness of the pleasures of his
body, so we welcomed him with all his fleshy nerves intact. And we decided
that we want him to live in a world in which male entitlement is a waning
memory, and in which women and men are seen--in both ritual and in
reality--as full equals and partners. So we welcomed him equally, his
mother and I, in the time-honored way that desert cultures have always
