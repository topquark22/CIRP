        <i><font color="navy">[Jenny Goodman, doctor,
        psychotherapist and Jewish feminist, appeared in Victor
        Schonfeld's ground-breaking documentary, "It's A Boy!",
        shown on British television in September 1995. Since then,
        she has been challenging circumcision both within the
        Jewish community and in the wider world. She has appeared
        twice on BBC national television, spoken on several radio
        programs, and has had articles published in national
        newspapers. She has also participated in panel discussions
        on circumcision, and led workshop-sessions on it at Jewish
        women's conferences. Far more hours than all of the above
        have been spent in deep discussion with pregnant friends
        and acquaintances who are going through "the Decision" (to
        circumcise or not). Jenny increasingly tried not to say,
        "I'll support you, whatever you decide." She is more likely
        to say, "I think you shouldn't hurt your baby, whatever the
        pressures from family, community and tradition. And I'll
        support you in taking the courage to make the only ethical
        decision there is -- to leave your son intact."]</font></i>

      <h2>OPEN LETTER FROM DR. JENNY GOODMAN</h2>
      <font color="navy"><i>[to friends who will be in attendance
      at the Fourth International Symposium on Sexual Mutilations,
      Lausanne, Switzerland, August, 1996, as published in the
      Syllabus of Abstracts of the Symposium].</i></font> 

      <p>Dear Friends,</p>

      <p>I am writing to you from London, England, since it is very
      unlikely I will be able to be with you in person. It is now
      June, and I am joyfully expecting my first baby at the end of
      this month. I do not know the sex of the baby, and I believe
      I may be one of the first Jewish women of my generation who
      does not need to whisper the silent prayer, "Please God, let
      it be a girl." I am calm and comfortable in the knowledge
      that no one will ever take a knife to this baby's flesh in
      the name of religion, and that my child will be every bit as
      Jewish as I am, or as Jewish as s/he chooses to be, with no
      mutilating mark upon the body. I am confident that my people
      have such an abundance of life-enhancing, life-affirming and
      mind-opening traditions, that our identity and sense of
      cultural self-heed will happily survive our outgrowing of
      circumcision, a cruel relic which has always felt to me like
      an aberration at the heart of my religion.</p>

      <p>What can I say, I wonder, to all of you gathered in
      Lausanne, who already agree with me that circumcision of
      healthy, nonconsenting infants is an abuse of human rights? I
      am used to arguing here with those who take circumcision for
      granted, who believe it is healthy, harmless, hygienic and
      divinely commanded. With those who believe it is a "little
      snip" that does not hurt, leaves no trace in the memory,
      causes no scars in the soul of mother or child. With those
      Jews and Muslims who really believe that their cultural
      identity, their sense of belonging, will crumble if they stop
      cutting pieces off their babies' bodies.</p>

      <p>Perhaps I shall share with you a little of what I have
      learned through public and private debate with such people. I
      talk about the facts: the intense pain, the risks of
      hemorrhage, infection and severe mutilation. I explain that,
      contrary to popular opinion, there are no medical benefits,
      and considerable complications, and that the best form of
      hygiene is simply to wash. I present the ethical arguments
      against injuring a defenseless person. I talk about the
      disempowerment of mothers, the breaking of the mother-infant
      bond, the effects on sexual experience. And I describe
      gentle, celebratory ways we could instead welcome newborn
      babies into our culture and our world.</p>

      <p>The response to all these points, from Jewish and Muslim
      people, is remarkably consistent. It consists of no logical
      argument at all, and very little actual response to what I
      have said. It consists, in a word, of fear. Religious
      fundamentalists say, "We are commanded by God, we have to do
      it, and that's the end of the story." They feel profoundly
      threatened. Secular and liberal people among these ethnic
      communities feel equally terrified, but cannot fall back on
      God. So they say, "But we've always done it, we've been doing
      it for thousands of years. You can't ask us to just stop now,
      it's an integral part of our identity." And so on.</p>

      <p>I reply by emphasizing that all spiritual traditions
      evolve and change, indeed they only survive by changing. And
      that a thousand years does not justify hurting a child. At
      this point, people very often say to me: 'You're right, I
      can't argue with you. What you say is unanswerable, but I
      know I'd still have my son circumcised - I just couldn't not.
      It's not a rational thing. I just feel I have to."</p>

      <p>I have found only one argument effective against this
      culturally conditioned terror, this admittedly compulsive
      behavior on the part of people who at some level do want to
      stop. It is simply to tell them that the change is already
      happening, that people like themselves have chosen a new,
      non-violent path. That others -- few in number but growing --
      have faced the apparent conflict between loyalty to tribe and
      loyalty to child, and have decided to leave their children
      whole and uninjured. And that these people are still part of
      their respective communities. In the end, I think this is the
      way to plant the seeds of a revolution: to point to where it
      has already begun, and then people who might not have the
      courage to lead will find the courage to follow.</p>

      <p>Let me tell you about some of the arguments I refrain from
      using in public at the moment, and the reasons why. I don't
      talk much about the psychological trauma, the unconscious
      scars that undoubtedly remain in the adult man. This is
      because the concept of unconscious memory still does not have
      wide currency in Britain outside of particular intellectual
      circles. Unlike on the East and West Coasts of the USA, the
      culture of psychotherapy has not yet permeated the culture at
      large, as one is open to ridicule, and to demands for
      scientific proof, which are as inappropriate in the realm of
      the psyche (soul) as mathematical equations are in the
      understanding of poetry. However, I find that the ethical
      argument is easily strong enough to stand alone; the
      infliction of pain and damage on a helpless child is
      absolutely wrong even if there were no memory, no residue, no
      consequences. So, to people who tell me that "the pain is
      momentary, it's over in a flash," I say, "I disagree with
      you, but even if you were right, is it acceptable to hurt
      your fellow human beings even for a second, on the basis that
      they'll probably forget about it?"</p>

      <p>Another argument I don't use is to say that circumcision
      is a form of child sex abuse. Of course it is, and clearly
      perpetuated down the generations by the classic mechanisms of
      child abuse: denial, repression, numbness and compulsive
      repetition. In other words, "It did me no harm, it'll do him
      no harm." To confront this denial head-on is rarely useful;
      nobody likes you to comment on their unconscious processes.
      It is a rare man who has the courage to acknowledge his own
      loss, to say, in the face of tribal history, universal peer
      pressure and his parents, "Yes, I have been damaged. I won't
      pass this damage on down the line. The wounding stops with
      me."</p>

      <p>So, let us not require everyone to have such courage.
      Let's simply encourage them to stop, on the basis that times
      have changed, that we now have new information about babies'
      sensitivity and experience that we didn't have a generation
      ago (except silently in every mother's heart, of course).
      Most of all, we need to reassure people that their child will
      not be alone, will not be the only one, will not be exiled.
      It is the parents' own fear of differentness that we are
      really dealing with here, expressed as a fear for their
      child.</p>

      <p>When I began speaking out publicly on this issue, I was
      afraid I would be attacked, and called a traitor to my
      people. Well, yes, this has certainly happened. But I have
      also had an amazing amount of support, sometimes from
      unexpected quarters. Many Jewish grandmothers, in their
      seventies and older, have told me: "You know, I always
      thought it was a dreadful thing to do, but I never said a
      word, because I thought I was the only one. I thought it was
      my problem that it worried me. In may day," they continue,
      "we didn't question circumcision, we didn't question
      anything, but if you young people want to challenge it --
      well, go ahead and good luck to you!" Since Victor
      Schonfeld's film was shown in September '95, some of these
      older Jewish women have taken the pressure off their adult
      sons and daughters; they are no longer insisting on
      circumcised grandchildren.</p>

      <p>A woman sat in my living room a few weeks after the film
      and sobbed. She was recalling how her son, now aged thirteen,
      had nearly bled to death after his ritual circumcision at
      eight days. She was so traumatized that she never had a
      second child -- she couldn't face the dilemma, had she had
      another boy, of whether to do the deed or not. Yes, despite
      the fact that her son had almost died, it remained a dilemma
      for her. She could neither circumcise another son nor face
      having an uncircumcised son. So, she had no more children.
      She was very sad. Such is the power of the tribe.</p>

      <p>She is Jewish, but I have met Muslim mothers and
      (non-Muslim) African mothers with equally harrowing stories.
      This is an issue that unites women across all ethnic divides.
      All of us are injured when we allow a man to take a knife to
      our child, to claim him as one of the men. We betray
      ourselves and our babies.</p>

      <p>A long time ago, we are told, Abraham heard the voice of
      God, commanding him to circumcise his sons. OK, I'll buy
      that. Whatever voice he heard was true and profound for him,
      and he was conscience-bound to follow it. Well, I hear a
      different voice, and I am conscience-bound to follow it. Call
      it the voice of the Goddess, of Nature, of humanity, of the
      innocent child; whatever voice it is, it rises from the womb
      and from the heart, and it speaks words very similar to those
      God commanded Abraham as Abraham was about to sacrifice
      Isaac: "Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do anything to
      him." I want to conclude by explaining how I see the
      circumcision issue in a wider context.</p>

      <p>People are only able to circumcise little children because
      ultimately, at some hidden level, they still do not see them
      as fully human. They permit themselves to do to an infant
      what they would not dream of doing to another adult -- the
      forcible restraint, the exercise of sheer physical power to
      cause an injury. In law, they would be guilty of assault if
      they did this to an unconsenting grown-up person.</p>

      <p>In our legal and ethical systems, in our hearts, we --
      globally -- still do not recognize the full humanity of the
      human baby. But I am happy to say this situation is rapidly
      changing. Thanks largely to the pioneering work of Michel
      Odent, obstetrics -- that great bastion of the patriarchy --
      is having to change in the direction of acknowledging that
      the newborn baby -- indeed, the unborn baby, too -- is at
      least as aware, as alive, as exquisitely sensitive as you and
      I. In other words, is a fully human being. This change in
      obstetrics has, of course, not gone nearly far enough, but I
      believe it has gone further in Britain than in the USA, and
      is helping to change adults' perceptions and treatment of
      babies in the culture at large.</p>

      <p>The struggle around childbirth is intimately linked with
      our struggle to end circumcision. A young Jewish mother
      recently told me that if she had had a hospital birth with
      high-tech invasion and interference, she might well have
      consented to circumcision as just another medical violation
      in a seemingly inevitable chain of such violations. However,
      feeling strong and clear and empowered after a gentle,
      natural birth, underwater and in the sanctity of her own
      home, she felt fully able to refuse any potential attack upon
      herself, upon her baby or upon the bond between them.</p>

      <p>So, the fight against circumcision is not a "single issue"
      cause, it is about awakening the adult world to see even the
      tiniest baby as a full person, deserving of all human rights,
      respect and dignity. It is about challenging all of us to
      keep lowering the age threshold at which we recognize full
      humanness, a shift which is part of historical progress
      towards a truly civilized society. Our battle is part of a
      larger battle to humanize and rehumanize the world. Let's
      keep working.</p>

      <p>Love and Shalom,</p>
