<h1 class="head1">The New Testament and Circumcision</h1>

<h4>by Michael Glass</h4>
</div>

<div class="corpus">
<h3 class="head3">Introduction</h3>

<p class="norm">Sometimes people say that circumcision is Biblical
and is therefore to be recommended to Christians. It is true that
circumcision can be found in both Jewish and Christian scriptures.
However, it is not true that the procedure is recommended to
Christians.</p>

<p class="norm">In fact, the New Testament is clearly hostile to
those who encourage circumcision, and opposes rather than
encourages the procedure. The reasons for this are set out plainly
in the text and can be seen in the words of Jesus, Saint Peter and
Saint Paul. As a result, most Christians throughout history have
not practised circumcision.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">Nevertheless, it is not hard to give the impression
that the New Testament is pro-circumcision. Jesus was circumcised
(Luke 1:59) and so were his disciples. The Apostle Paul circumcised
Timothy, or had him circumcised, (Acts 16:3). Paul cautioned the
Corinthians against uncircumcising themselves. (1 Cor. 7:18). While
the New Testament does say this, it distorts its message on this
subject.</p>

<p class="norm">I have written this paper to show you, the reader,
that while circumcision is quite plainly in the Bible it is
definitely not recommended to Christians. This might strike some
readers as strange or paradoxical, because circumcision is so
important in the Old Testament. However, it is just one of a number
of Jewish laws that were abolished for Christians.</p>

<p class="norm">The message of the New Testament is for all,
whether circumcised or not, to bring them together in unity. The
debate on circumcision could obscure the universality of this
message. Also, attempts to use the Bible could muddy the waters in
this dispute. Nevertheless, what the New Testament says on
circumcision should be heeded, because it offers important insights
into people's motivations for pushing circumcision on others.</p>

<h3 class="head3">The background to the New Testament</h3>

<p class="norm">The New Testament comes from a multicultural
background. It is, of course, grounded in the Jewish religion. Jews
circumcised their boys on their eighth day of life, and regarded
this rite as essential (Gen. 17:9-14). However, it was written in
Greek, and was therefore immersed in the Greek culture, which was
dominant in that part of the Roman Empire at the time. These two
great cultures came together in the New Testament. There were, of
course, many points of convergence between them both, but there
were some notable clashes. One was over circumcision.</p>

<p class="norm">When the New Testament was written, the Greek
standard of beauty - and also male decency - was a foreskin that
completely concealed the head of the penis. For Greeks, a man could
appear naked in public games as long as the head of his penis was
covered.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> The Greek words for
circumcision (<cite>peritome</cite> - cutting round) and mutilation
(<cite>katatome</cite> - cutting down) were related,<sup><a
href="#n3">3</a></sup> so the Greek hostility to circumcision is
reflected in the language in which the New Testament was
written.</p>

<h3 class="head3">The Maccabean Revolt and its aftermath</h3>

<p class="norm">The greatest clash between these two cultures over
circumcision is not found in the New Testament or the Hebrew Bible,
but in the Septuagint, the famous translation of the Hebrew Bible
into Greek. This contained several books not found in the Hebrew
Bible (Deuterocanonical books for Catholics and the Apocrypha for
Protestants.) One of the books is 1 Maccabees.</p>

<p class="norm">This book gives a gruesome account of a clash
between the Jews and the Greek conquerors of Palestine. Between
about 175 <span class="ad">B</span>.<span class="ad">C</span>. and
134 <span class="ad">B</span>.<span class="ad">C</span>.<sup><a
href="#n4">4</a></sup> the Greeks insisted that all people they had
conquered follow their religious customs. In addition, they tried
to stop the Jews from circumcising their infants. The clash that
followed included the butchery of mothers who circumcised their
infants (1 Macc. 1:60-61, 2 Macc. 6:8-11). Reprisals of the Jewish
zealots included forcible circumcision of boys (1 Macc. 2:45), and
there were massacres on both sides (1 Macc. 1:29-38, 1 Macc.
5:22,28,35,49-51).</p>

<p class="norm">The Jewish Zealots were incredibly tough and
uncompromising. They forced the Greeks to allow them to practise
their religion, including circumcision. However, this was not just
a clash between those who wanted to adopt Greek customs, and those
who insisted on the old ways. The fight was dirty and bitter on
both sides. The Greek authorities directed the Jews to leave their
sons uncircumcised (1 Maccabees 1:48) and:</p>

<p class="quote">...put to death the women who had their children
circumcised, and their families and those who circumcised them; and
they hung the infants from their mothers' necks. (1 Maccabees
1:60-61, New Revised Standard Version)</p>

<p class="norm">Maccabees had revealed that many Jews wanted to
adopt Greek ways. They obtained permission to build</p>

<p class="quote">... a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to Gentile
custom, and removed the marks of circumcison, and abandoned the
holy covenant. (1 Macc. 1:14)</p>

<p class="norm">The holy covenant, of course, referred to infant
circumcision. Naturally, those who were removing the marks of their
own circumcision would not be chopping off the foreskins of their
sons. The zealots regarded these Jews as renegades, who had joined
with the Gentiles and sold themselves to do evil. (1 Maccabees
1:11, 15) The first counter-attack against the Greeks was to turn
against those they regarded as traitors in their own ranks:</p>

<p class="quote">They organized an army, and they struck down
sinners in their anger and renegades in their wrath; the survivors
fled to the Gentiles for safety. And Mattathias and his friends
went around and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all
the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of
Israel. They rescued the law out of the hands of the Gentiles and
kings, and they never let the sinner gain the upper hand. (1
Maccabees 2:44-48, NRSV)</p>

<p class="norm">As you can see from this, the zealots would regard
any Jews who turned against circumcision as a traitor, a sinner and
a renegade, a person to be struck down. Jesus and his disciples
lived less than 200 years after the time of Judas
Maccabaeus,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> and the circumcision
controversy was still intense. This continuing controversy is
reflected in the New Testament.</p>

<h3 class="head3">What Jesus said about Circumcision</h3>

<p class="norm">John's Gospel says that when people criticized
Jesus for healing a man on the Sabbath day, Jesus responded:</p>

<p class="quote">'Moses...gave unto you circumcision;<sup><a
href="#n6">6</a></sup> (not because it is of Moses, but of the
fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. If a man on
the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should
not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every
whit whole on the sabbath day? Judge not according to the
appearance, but judge righteous judgment.' (John 7:22-24,
<cite>King James Version</cite>)</p>

<p class="norm">Jesus contrasts the circumcision of Moses and the
fathers with his 'making men whole', as the Greeks put it. However,
this phrase is sharpened. It says, 'I have made a man 'every whit
whole'. (Whit means 'particle, least possible amount') In this
context the phrase could hardly be more pointed and the point would
not be lost on the largely Greek and uncircumcised readership. They
could not help but see it as hostile to both circumcisers and to
circumcision itself.</p>

<p class="norm">The Jerusalem Bible made this point clearly:</p>

<p class="quote">'why are you angry with me for making a man whole
and complete on a sabbath?'<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">This is a striking thing for Jesus to say. However,
a footnote argues that the Jews of that time saw circumcision as
healing the penis, and Jesus was arguing for his big healing on the
sabbath as well as their little healing.</p>

<p class="norm">Such an argument has problems. If you argue that
circumcision perfects the body, you argue against the perfection of
God's creation. Genesis 1:31 says that God pronounced his creation
'very good'. As man was created with a foreskin, then the foreskin
must also have been very good. The Jewish sage, Moses Maimonides,
explained the reason for circumcision as follows.</p>

<p class="quote">'It has been thought that circumcision perfects
what is defective congenitally. This gave the possibility to
everyone to raise an objection and to say: How can natural things
be defective so that they need to be perfected from outside, all
the more because we know how useful the foreskin is for that
member? In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a
view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to
perfecting what is defective morally.</p>

<p class="quote">'The bodily pain caused to that member is the real
purpose of circumcision. None of the activities necessary for the
preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is
procreation rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust
that goes beyond what is needed are diminished. The fact that
circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes
perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth
this member has been made to bleed and has had its covering taken
away from it, it must indubitably be weakened.'<sup><a
href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">Moses Maimonides, who stated that a penis is
indubitably weakened by circumcision, would have had little trouble
in seeing the ironic note in Jesus' statement. After all, Jesus
contrasted his healing (making a man every bit whole) with the
activities of the circumcisers (who chopped a bit off).</p>

<p class="norm">But even if Jesus did mean that his healing was big
whereas his critics' healing was small<sup><a
href="#n9">9</a></sup> this still does not account for two
important points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus said he made men '<cite>every whit</cite> (bit) whole'.
'To make men whole' in contrast to circumcision may have been an
unintended irony. However, to say he made the man <cite>every
bit</cite> whole is very pointed and an obvious dig at circumcision
in this context.</li>

<li>John's Gospel was written in Greek. For most Greek speakers,
circumcision was a mutilation, so a comment contrasting
circumcision with making a man 'every whit whole' would be seen as
an attack on circumcision.</li>
</ul>

<p class="norm">Some have said that when Jesus claimed he made a
man 'every whit whole', he restored his foreskin.<sup><a
href="#n10">10</a></sup> I do not see it this way. I see it as a
clever play on words, something that Jesus often did.<sup><a
href="#n11">11</a></sup> However, it is still a clear attack on
circumcision. At first, (John 5:2-16) we are simply told that a
paralysed man was 'made whole'.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
However, when Jesus said that he made that man 'every whit whole'
(John 7:23), the expression was much more pointed.</p>

<p class="norm">However, Jesus said something far more radical
about the origin of circumcision:</p>

<p class="quote">'Moses gave you circumcision (it is, of course,
not from Moses, but from the patriarchs)' (John 7:22a)</p>

<p class="norm">What Jesus said about circumcision - that it came
from the patriarchs - is true. However, the Torah claims far more
for this ancient custom. Both Genesis and Leviticus claim that
circumcision came from God (Gen. 17:9-14, Lev. 12).</p>

<p class="norm">When Jesus attributed circumcision to the
patriarchs he downgraded the importance of this ancient ritual from
a command that comes from God to a custom of the patriarchs.
Customs of the patriarchs may be overturned; a command from God is
not so easy to ignore. Describing circumcision as an ancient custom
undermines the belief that circumcision came from God. It was quite
a risky thing for Jesus to say (See John 7:25).</p>

<p class="norm">This paved the way for Peter to attack circumcision
and Paul to attack those who promote it.</p>

<p class="norm"><strong>Put simply:</strong></p>

<p class="norm">John's Gospel attacks circumcision in three
ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>It contrasts Jesus' healing, which makes a man every bit whole,
with circumcision, which chops a bit off.</li>

<li>It downgrades circumcision from a command of God to a practice
of the ancestors.</li>

<li>It does so in the Greek language and therefore in a cultural
setting that saw circumcision as an obscene mutilation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="norm">In this, John's Gospel is in harmony with what
Peter said about circumcision in the Acts of the Apostles and with
what Paul said about it in his letters.</p>

<h3 class="head3">The Commands to Circumcise in the Torah</h3>

<p class="norm">Some readers may be concerned that Jesus appears to
downgrade the Jewish law. Surely that can't be right! Jesus himself
said that he came not to overturn the law, but to fulfil it (Matt.
5:17).</p>

<p class="norm">However, Jesus' teaching on circumcision is
entirely consistent with Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount
and other places. He was against over-zealous Sabbath-keeping (John
7), but was stricter in his teaching on anger and murder (Matt.
5:20-22), on adultery and lust (Matt. 5:27-28), divorce (Matt.
5:31-32), the taking of oaths (Matt. 5:33-37), on revenge (Matt.
5:39-42) and loving even your enemies (Matt. 5:43-48). When he
referred to specific examples of the ancient law, Jesus only said:
'You have heard that it was said&hellip; (Matt. 5:21; 5:27, 5:33,
5:45)</p>

<p class="norm">Jesus' teaching on circumcision was also consistent
with the Acts of the Apostles, where the ancient food laws and the
restrictions on mixing with Gentiles were overthrown (Acts 10:9-16,
24-30, 11:1-14), and where contrary to the Torah (Deut. 23:1),
eunuchs were welcomed into the Church (Acts 8:26-39). Indeed, the
requirement for circumcision (Acts 15:7-10) was just one of a
number of the requirements of the Law that was abolished.</p>

<p class="norm">The commands to circumcise are often quoted as
proof texts. To assess them we have to examine them in context.
Take the passage in Genesis:</p>

<p class="quote">'God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep
my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their
generations.... Every male among you shall be circumcised. You
shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a
sign of the covenant between me and you. Throughout your
generations every male among you shall be circumcised when he is
eight days old, including the slave born in your house and the one
bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your
offspring. Both the slave born in your house and the one bought
with your money must be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in
your flesh an everlasting covenant. Any uncircumcised male who is
not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from
his people; he has broken my covenant."' (Genesis 17: 9-14),<sup><a
href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">No one follows this to the letter. Why? Slavery has
been abolished! Today, no Jew, no matter how pious, has the right
to hold slaves, and if a master should be so bold as to forcibly
circumcise his 'servant' there would be an outcry!</p>

<p class="norm">Even with the circumcision of infants, Jewish
scholars have tempered the rule. If a child is not completely well,
the mohel is forbidden to circumcise him<sup><a
href="#n14">14</a></sup> and if three children of a Jewish woman
have died because of circumcision, the fourth need not be
circumcised.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> None of this is
condoned by the text above. Tradition has added these requirements
to soften the impact of this text.</p>

<p class="norm">The second passage commanding circumcision comes
from Leviticus:</p>

<p class="quote">'The LORD said to Moses, "Say to the people of
Israel, If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she
shall be unclean seven days; as at the time of her menstruation,
she shall be unclean. And on the eighth day the flesh of his
foreskin shall be circumcised. Then she shall continue for
thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying; she shall not
touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the
days of her purifying are completed. But if she bears a female
child, then she shall be unclean two weeks as in her menstruation;
and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six
days.</p>

<p class="quote">And when the days of her purifying are completed,
whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest
at the door of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for burnt
offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
And he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her;
when she shall be clean from the flow of her blood&hellip;. And if
she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or
two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin
offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she
shall be clean." ' (Lev. 12:)</p>

<p class="norm">The Jewish rule of ceremonial uncleanliness, which
is doubled for giving birth to a girl rather than a boy, has become
an embarrassment in an age of equal rights for women. Blood taboos
such as those described in Leviticus 12 did not stop Jesus from
healing. (Mark 5:25-34, Luke 8:42-46) This and the example of Jesus
touching and healing lepers (Matt. 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45) helped to
break down the notion of ritual uncleanness in Christianity.</p>

<p class="norm">Animal sacrifices have also become obsolete for
Christian and Jew alike. It is curious that Leviticus 12 has become
largely obsolescent, except for the requirement for circumcision
itself.</p>

<p class="norm">How should we assess these apparently outmoded
passages from the Torah? Paul warned against following Jewish myths
(Titus 1:14). This came after a warning about</p>

<p class="quote">'&hellip;many rebellious people, idle talkers and
deceivers, especially those of the circumcision; they must be
silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for
sordid gain what is not right to teach. &hellip;For this reason
rebuke them sharply&hellip;not paying attention to Jewish myths or
to commandments of those who reject the truth&hellip;' (Titus
1:10-11, 13-14)</p>

<p class="norm">We cannot be sure what Paul was referring to or
what he considered mythical or which were the commandments of those
who rejected the truth. It was before the Talmud was written, so it
cannot refer to that. However, as Paul and other early Christians
had rejected other parts of the Jewish heritage of that time, he
may have considered parts of the Torah as mythical. The idea of
rejecting any of the Torah as mythical may strike us as radical,
but it certainly was firmly in Jewish tradition. Look at the words
of Jeremiah:</p>

<p class="quote">Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of
Israel:&hellip; [I]n the day that I brought your ancestors out of
the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them
concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave
them, "Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my
people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may
be well with you." (Jer. 7:22-26)</p>

<p class="norm">Even more pointedly he says:</p>

<p class="quote">How can you say, "We are wise, and the law of the
LORD is with us," when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has
made it into a lie? (Jer. 8:8)</p>

<p class="norm">We might think that Jesus was radical in saying
that circumcision came from 'the fathers' (John 7:22), or that Paul
may have been referring to Jewish myths outside the Hebrew
Scriptures. However, these passages from Jeremiah show that one of
the Bible's greatest prophets explicitly rejected animal sacrifices
and charged that the false pen of the scribes had made the law -
the Torah - into a lie!</p>

<p class="norm">Paul and other early Christians rejected parts of
the Torah and Paul referred to parts of the Torah as mythical. In
any case, he saw the Jewish law as being abolished, because of
Jesus (Eph. 2: 11-20)</p>

<h3 class="head3">Peter Attacks Circumcision and the Law of
Moses</h3>

<p class="norm">In Acts 15, there is an account of people coming
from Judea and pushing circumcision on non-Jewish Christians.
Imagine how much consternation this would cause, 1,800 years before
the invention of aseptic surgery! Even today circumcisions can
become infected. Imagine what it was like then!</p>

<p class="norm">This is what Peter said:</p>

<p class="quote">'"My brothers, you know that ... God made a choice
... that I should be the one through whom the Gentiles would hear
the message of the good news and become believers. And God, who
knows the human heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy
Spirit, just as he did to us; and in cleaning their hearts by faith
he has made no distinction between them and us. Now therefore why
are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the
disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able
to bear? On the contrary we believe that we will be saved through
the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will."' (Acts
15:7b-11)</p>

<p class="norm">He called circumcision and the Mosaic law an
'unbearable yoke'. Why? The Torah says that <cite>every</cite> male
shall be circumcised on the eighth day. As we have seen, later
developments of the law modified this somewhat.<sup><a
href="#n16">16</a></sup> This is evidence that circumcision before
aseptic surgery was a risky business. How could parents bring a
baby into the world only to risk losing him to circumcision? Peter,
as a married man (Mark 1:30). would be in a position to appreciate
this keenly, and it might help account for the emotional tone of
his comment.</p>

<p class="norm">It might be argued that allowing Christian converts
to remain uncircumcised was a strategic move to help gain converts
to the faith. While I am sure that it had that effect, I think it
would be over-cynical to say that this was the only motivation.
Peter was greatly impressed by the faith and piety of the gentile
converts, stating that God made no distinction between the
circumcised and the uncircumcised in matters of faith. (Acts
15:7-8)</p>

<p class="norm">This could have been a revelation to Peter, The Old
Testament says that Jews must circumcise the foreskins of their
hearts, (Jer. 4:4) and yet Peter found the uncircumcised were just
as fervent believers, as the circumcised! This could help to
explain why his attitude towards circumcision developed the way it
did.</p>

<p class="norm">Another reason for Peter's attitude must have been
the sheer burden of the Jewish law. In the case of circumcision,
Peter would have been aware that children died because of
circumcision. He would also have been aware of the hostility of
Greeks and also some Jews to circumcision. It is, therefore, little
wonder that he saw the law in general and the requirement for
circumcision in particular as a yoke around the neck!</p>

<p class="norm">So a changed attitude towards circumcision was not
the only difference between the older and the newer religions. As I
already pointed out, there were changes in attitudes towards
keeping the Sabbath, and observing the food laws. Christianity
dispensed with Jewish ceremonial law, including circumcision.
Indeed it was at the first church council that it was resolved not
to put any 'irksome restrictions' (Acts 15:19)<sup><a
href="#n17">17</a></sup> on the believers, and Paul, among others,
was given the job of spreading the news of their deliberations.</p>

<p class="norm">Some might find it surprising that Peter seems to
be so hostile to circumcision. He did not say that circumcision was
optional, or it was nothing. Peter said that it and the Jewish law
was an 'unbearable yoke'. This strong language suggests that Peter
himself was hostile to the practice. This might mean a change of
thinking on his part, or it could reflect the attitude of many Jews
of that time towards this ancient ritual.</p>

<h3 class="head3">The circumciser who became a scourge of
circumcisers</h3>

<p class="norm">Paul, who began by persecuting the early Church,
ended his life as a Christian apostle and martyr. Similarly, Paul
who circumcised Timothy, or at least had him circumcised<sup><a
href="#n18">18</a></sup>, was to become the fiercest critic and
opponent of circumcision and circumcisers in the New Testament. As
we trace what he said from letter to letter we can see that his
feelings about circumcisers and circumcision became more hostile as
time went on.</p>

<p class="norm">It should be pointed out that Paul changed his
approach to suit his target audience:</p>

<p class="quote">&hellip; I have made myself a slave to all, so
that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in
order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the
law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win
those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one
outside the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under
Christ's law) so that I might win those outside the law. To the
weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all
things to all people, that I might by all means save some. (1 Cor.
9:19-23),</p>

<p class="norm">However, we must ask ourselves whether this freedom
would stretch to the extent of circumcising one man on one occasion
but forbidding circumcision and arguing forcefully against it on
several other occasions. Was he acting inconsistently, or even
deceitfully?</p>

<p class="norm">Paul varied his message to appeal to different
audiences. This reveals a sensitivity to cultural differences, and
a man who shows this sensitivity would be more likely to be
influenced by the people he was reaching out to. I believe that
though Paul said he varied his message for different audiences (
see 1 Corinthians 9:19-23), his thinking about circumcision changed
and developed over time and this accounts for the apparent
inconsistencies in his words and actions.. Evidence for a
development in his thoughts can be traced in his letters when they
are examined in the approximate order in which they were
written.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="head3">Acts: when Paul appeased the circumcisers</h3>

<p class="norm">In Acts 15, when speaking at the first Church
Council at Jerusalem (<span class="ad">A</span>.<span
class="ad">D</span>. 50)<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>, we have
seen that Peter condemned circumcision and the law of Moses (Acts
15:10-11). The first Council was careful in the wording of its
resolution but it endorsed Peter's sentiments, refusing to put any
unnecessary burdens on the new converts.</p>

<p class="quote">'For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to
us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials: that
you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood
and from what is strangled and from fornication. If you keep
yourselves from these, you will do well.' (Acts 15:28-29)</p>

<p class="norm">Note that the strong condemnation of circumcision
in Peter's speech had been omitted from the final resolution. This
talked about Gentiles, not Jews, ad did not refer to circumcision
directly. This is evidence of the sensitivity of the question at
that time.</p>

<p class="norm">The very next chapter begins with Paul circumcising
a man! This action came straight after the Council.</p>

<p class="norm">There was a disciple:</p>

<p class="quote">'.. named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who
was a believer; but his father was a Greek. He was well spoken of
by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium. Paul wanted Timothy to
accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the
Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father
was a Greek.' (Acts 16 1-3)<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">The policy of the church council was clear: no
irksome restrictions were to be placed on converts. And yet,
because of the pressure from Jews, Timothy was circumcised! Paul
appears to be out of step with Peter, and even to be circumventing
the decision of the Council!</p>

<p class="norm">Later, there was another instance where Paul did
his best to conform to Jewish practices. When he got to Jerusalem
the local church expressed its concern:</p>

<p class="quote">'&hellip; it is said that you teach all the Jews
in the gentile world to turn their backs on Moses, telling them to
give up circumcising their children and following our way of life.
What is the position then?' (Acts 21: 21-22, <cite>New English
Bible)</cite></p>

<p class="norm">Christian leaders in Jerusalem, knew that this idea
was extremely controversial, and called on Paul for guidance.</p>

<p class="norm">Paul did not answer their question directly. He
affirmed that he instructed gentile converts to abstain from
fornication and a few other rules. He said that he followed the
law. However, nothing is recorded as directly refuting the charge
that he had been advising Jews to turn their backs on Moses and to
stop circumcising their children. In any case, the whole point was
lost in an enormous melee that resulted in Paul being arrested at
Jerusalem and finally sent to Rome.</p>

<p class="norm">Paul's actions about circumcision in Acts are
noticeably different from the thoughts he expressed in his letters.
Some of this may be due to the fact that he was dealing with Jews
in Acts whereas in his letters he was writing to Gentiles. Another
difference is that Acts writes about his actions whereas in his
letters, Paul is writing for himself. However, there does appear to
be a development of his thought on the subject. When his letters
are examined in the order in which they appear in the New
Testament, his attitude to circumcision becomes steadily more
hostile.</p>

<h3 class="head3">When Paul spoke against circumcising and
uncircumcising</h3>

<p class="norm">In 1 Corinthians, (dated about <span
class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 55)<sup><a
href="#n22">22</a></sup> Paul appears quite even-handed about
circumcision, telling people, whether circumcised or not, to remain
as they are and not to try to change their circumcision status. He
dismisses circumcision as nothing.</p>

<p class="quote">'This is my rule in all the churches. Was anyone
at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to
remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his
call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. Circumcision is
nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but obeying the
commandments of God is everything. Let each of you remain in the
condition in which you were called.' (1 Cor. 7:17b-20)</p>

<h3 class="head3">Does this passage prohibit both circumcision and
uncircumcision?</h3>

<p class="norm">Would this passage prohibit both circumcision and
foreskin restoration?</p>

<p class="norm">A key to the passage is the phrase: 'Let each of
you remain in the condition in which you were called.' As the
passage makes clear some were called as Jews, while others were
Gentiles. Some were slaves and some were free. Some were men and
some were women. Paul's message to all was the same: remain in the
condition in which you were called.</p>

<p class="norm">However, there were limits. For instance, he
preferred that people remain unmarried, but only if they could do
so without burning up with lust!</p>

<p class="quote">'To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is
well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not
practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to
marry than to be aflame with passion.' (1 Cor. 7:8-9)</p>

<p class="norm">Immediately after talking about circumcision, Paul
said this about slavery:</p>

<p class="quote">'Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned
about it. Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of your
present condition now more than ever. For whoever was called in the
Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as
whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ. You were bought
with a price; do not become slaves of human masters. In whatever
condition you were called, brothers and sisters, there remain with
God.' (1 Cor. 7:21-24)</p>

<p class="norm">The passage appears to rule out people selling
themselves into slavery: 'you were bought with a price; do not
become slaves of human masters'. However, Paul is not keen for
slaves to seek their freedom: 'Even if you can gain your freedom,
make use of your present condition now more than ever.' His
attitude is clear: let people remain as they have been called.</p>

<p class="norm">So the argument here against circumcising or
uncircumcising appears to have been an acceptance of things as they
are. This is quite different from his condemnation of those who
pushed circumcision, and those who received it.</p>

<p class="norm">How this passage would be applicable today is a
matter of conjecture. However, there is one thing we can be sure
of. His advice - and it appears to be no more than advice - neither
to circumcise or to try to remove the 'marks of circumcision' is
confined to this passage. In contrast, his condemnations of those
who push circumcision are made repeatedly and always with passion
and anger. Also, his statement that circumcision was 'nothing' was
not repeated.</p>

<h3 class="head3">Romans: Circumcision is of value only if you keep
the law</h3>

<p class="norm">Romans is dated somewhere between <span
class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 56 and 59,<sup><a
href="#n23">23</a></sup> between one and four years after 1
Corinthians, and it shows that Paul's thinking on circumcision had
developed further. He argues that all are sinners, first the
Gentiles, and then the Jews, who fail to keep the Mosaic law. Of
Jews he said:</p>

<p class="quote">'Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the
law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become
uncircumcision.' (Rom. 2:25)</p>

<p class="norm">Of the value of circumcision he said:</p>

<p class="quote">'Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the
value of circumcision? Much in every way. For in the first place
the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.' (Rom. 3:1-2)</p>

<p class="norm">Paul saw the value of the law as a means of
pointing out sin (Romans 3:20). However, he had already said that
all have sinned, whether Jew or Greek (Romans 3:9) so all were in
the same boat.</p>

<p class="norm">He wrote that the blessing of God is not only for
the circumcised (Romans 4:9), pointing out that Abraham was
uncircumcised when he was called by God (Romans 4:10). This, he
argued, made Abraham the father of all who believed, whether
circumcised or not (Romans 4:11-12).</p>

<p class="norm">So Paul was at pains to stress the essential
equality and unity between Jewish and Greek Christians, whether
circumcised or not. This was necessary. Some Judaizing Christians
had claiming extra knowledge and insight because they knew the law
(Rom. 2:17-24). In contrast, Paul saw true circumcision as a
circumcision of the heart, where people actually kept the law,
whether they were circumcised or not (Rom. 2:25-29).</p>

<h3 class="head3">Galatians: Turning to a Different Gospel</h3>

<p class="norm">The Galatian church was troubled by people
preaching that Christians must be circumcised. In his letter to the
churches, Paul takes immediate issue with this idea:</p>

<p class="quote">'I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting
the one who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a
different gospel&hellip;' (Gal. 1:6)</p>

<p class="norm">Paul then vindicates his apostleship, pointing out
that he, who was zealous for the traditions of his ancestors and
who had persecuted the Church, had been called by God to proclaim
the gospel. (Gal. 1:11-24) He argues that it was he who took a
principled stand against circumcision.</p>

<p class="quote">'But even Titus, who was with me, was not
compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.' (Gal. 2:3)</p>

<p class="norm">Paul blames the concern about circumcision on</p>

<p class="quote">'&hellip;false believers secretly brought in, who
have slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus so
that they might enslave us - we did not submit to them even for a
moment.' (Gal. 2:4-5)</p>

<p class="norm">It sounds like a detailed rebuttal of any idea that
Paul was 'soft' on circumcision. Paul defends by attacking. He says
that it was he who was entrusted with the job of evangelizing the
Gentiles and it was he who corrected Cephas and Barnabas when they
withdrew from eating with the Gentiles.</p>

<p class="norm">Then Paul returns to the central point of his
message:</p>

<p class="quote">'We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile
sinners: yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of
the law but through faith in Jesus Christ&hellip;.no one will be
justified by the works of the law.' (Gal. 2:15-16)</p>

<p class="norm">He repeats it even more pointedly, referring to the
<cite>flesh</cite>:</p>

<p class="quote">'You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched
you?&hellip;Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the
law or by believing what you heard? Are you so foolish? Having
started with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?' (Gal.
3:1-3)</p>

<p class="norm">This reference to the <cite>flesh</cite> will be
expanded on later. It is a frequent theme of Paul, and when he uses
this word he refers to carnal desires - the lusts of the flesh -
and also to the organ of generation itself. When Paul wants to make
a point he does not shrink from such frankness.</p>

<p class="norm">Paul then explains why the law was important and
why it has been superseded:</p>

<p class="quote">'Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and
guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the
law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be
justified by faith. But now that faith is come, we are no longer
subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all
children of God through faith.' (Gal. 3:23-24)</p>

<p class="norm">He then explains the new Christian view:</p>

<p class="quote">'As many of you as were baptized into Christ have
clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek,
there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and
female: for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong
to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the
promise.' (Gal. 3:27-29)</p>

<p class="norm">Now he sees their old beliefs as slavery and is
distressed that the Galatians would turn to them again:</p>

<p class="quote">'Formerly, when you did not know God, you were
enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods. Now, however, that
you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can
you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits? How
can you want to be enslaved to them again? You are observing
special, days, and months, and seasons, and years. I am afraid that
my work for you may have been wasted.' (Gal. 4:8-11)</p>

<p class="norm">To illustrate the point he turns to the Book of
Genesis, and in allegorical form teaches the Galatians that they do
not have to return to the Torah, for they are already children of
promise. He also contrasts the <cite>flesh</cite> with the
<cite>promise</cite>.</p>

<p class="quote">'Tell me, you who desire to be subject to the law,
will you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had
two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman. One,
the child of the slave, was born according to the flesh; the other,
the child of the free woman, was born through the promise. Now this
is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One woman, in fact,
is Hagar, from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. Now Hagar
is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem,
for she is in slavery with her children. But the other woman
corresponds to the Jerusalem above; she is free, and she is our
mother.' (Gal. 4:21-26)</p>

<p class="norm">He sees the Judaizers as persecutors. Once again he
contrasts <cite>flesh</cite> with Spirit.</p>

<p class="quote">'Now you, my friends, are children of the promise,
like Isaac. But just as at that time the child who was born
according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according
to the Spirit, so it is now also. But what does the scripture say?
Drive out the slave and her child: for the child of the slave will
not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman. So
then, friends we are children, not of the slave but of the free
woman.' (Gal. 4:28-31)</p>

<p class="norm">This leads straight to the great passage that
explains what is at stake if Christians submitted to circumcision.
Paul does not shrink from sexually explicit reference.<sup><a
href="#n24">24</a></sup> They are also submitting to a yoke of
<cite>slavery</cite>. Note also the use of language and imagery,
which is taken from the original story of the covenant, where those
who were <cite>not</cite> circumcised were <cite>cut off</cite>
from the Children of Israel. (Gen. 17:14)</p>

<p class="quote">'For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm,
therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p>

<p class="quote">'Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you let
yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised
that he is obliged to obey the entire law. You who want to be
justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you have
fallen away from grace.' (Gal. 5:1-4)</p>

<p class="norm">Once again Paul teaches equality between believers,
circumcised or not, and reveals what the new covenant means -
inclusion, not exclusion:</p>

<p class="quote">'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor
uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that counts is
faith working through love.' (Gal. 5:6)</p>

<p class="norm">Paul's anger is directed towards those who led the
Galatians astray:</p>

<p class="quote">'You were running well; who prevented you from
obeying the truth? Such persuasion does not come from the one who
calls you&hellip;.</p>

<p class="quote">'I am confident about you&hellip;But whoever it is
that is confusing you will pay the penalty. But my friends, why am
I still being persecuted if I am still preaching circumcision? In
that case the offense of the cross has been removed. I wish those
who unsettle you would castrate themselves!' (Gal. 5:7-8,
10-12)</p>

<p class="norm">The last statement is the most extraordinary of
all. This statement, if nothing else, shows the depth of his anger
against those who push circumcision.</p>

<h3 class="head3">The works of the flesh contrasted with the works
of the Spirit</h3>

<p class="norm">Paul is concerned that the Galatians live by the
Spirit, not the flesh.</p>

<p class="quote">'Live by the Spirit, I say, and no not gratify the
desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the
Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the
flesh&hellip;</p>

<p class="quote">'Now the works of the flesh are obvious:
fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities,
strife, jealousy, anger quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy,
drunkenness, carousing, and things like these.' (Gal. 5: 16,
19-20)</p>

<p class="norm">Paul's final warning contained these words:</p>

<p class="quote">'It is those who want to make a good showing in
the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised- only that they
may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. Even the circumcised
do not themselves obey the law, but they want you to be circumcised
so that they may boast about your flesh.' (Gal. 6:12-13
<cite>NRSV</cite>)</p>

<p class="norm">An earlier translation, however, was more
frank:</p>

<p class="quote">'&hellip;they desire to have you circumcised that
they may glory in your flesh. But far be it from me to glory except
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been
crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision
counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.' (Gal.
6:13-15, <cite>Revised Standard Version</cite>)</p>

<p class="norm">Galatians shows a further development of Paul's
thinking, with a much stronger anti-circumcision and
anti-circumciser line than Romans or 1 Corinthians. The date given
in the <cite>New Bible Commentary</cite> is <span
class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 49,<sup><a
href="#n25">25</a></sup> which would put it before the Council in
Jerusalem (<span class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>.50)
and his circumcision of Timothy that immediately followed. I
suspect Galatians is later than the Council in Jerusalem because
Paul appears to be answering charges that he was 'soft' on
circumcision.</p>

<h3 class="head3">Those who 'want to make a good showing in the
<cite>flesh</cite>' and 'glory in your <cite>flesh</cite>'</h3>

<p class="norm">A modern reader may miss the sexual implications of
Paul's statements. In Hebrew, the word <cite>flesh</cite> was used
as a euphemism for the penis (e.g., in Genesis 17:13, Leviticus
15:2-3). When Paul wrote about the works of the flesh, he was
talking about carnal desires but some of the Hebrew meaning seemed
to carry over as well. It also appears to be particularly apt in
describing some of those who campaign for circumcision.</p>

<p class="norm">An interest in 'the flesh' can be noted in
circumcision enthusiasts. This is obvious in a sexually charged
website like Circlist,<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> but examples
of 'glorying in the flesh' can also be seen in medical and other
circles. Take a neonatal nurse, quoted in Circlist:</p>

<p class="quote">'Assisting during circumcisions is the favorite
part of my job, as I think it's a moment of magic when a baby boy's
glans is permanently exposed for the first time in his young life.'
Sandra (US)<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">Naturally, she took steps to ensure that she had
more moments of magic:</p>

<p class="quote">'As a nurse in the maternity wing of a large
hospital, I have assisted with several hundred circumcisions. I am
100% in favor of routine circumcision. The pain the baby
experiences is no doubt considerable, but I think it's more than
worth it. &hellip; I strongly encourage any expectant mother to do
it.'<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">Circumcision also made a good show for this
doctor:</p>

<p class="quote">'[C]ircumcision is a beautification comparable to
rhinoplasty, and a circumcised penis appears in its flaccid state
as an erect uncircumcised organ - a beautiful instrument of precise
intent.'<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">Doctor Brian Morris, a circumcision advocate, makes
the same point. After noting a survey of American women where 90
per cent of respondents said that the circumcised penis 'looked
sexier' he wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">'What then is sexier about a circumcised penis?
Quite likely it is that the glans is exposed in both the erect and
unerect state, and therefore the unerect state still suggests the
erect.'<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">So it seems that American women like the same show.
And so do some of the men. Marvel Williamson and Paul Williamson,
two medical researchers, said:</p>

<p class="quote">'While the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis can
be retracted, the circumcised penis exists in exposed beauty
whether flaccid or erect.'<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">Frankness is indeed a feature of their study. It
asked new mothers what kind of penis they preferred for certain
kinds of sexual activities. What they found was the sexual
involvement in the decisions of the mothers who had their sons
circumcised.</p>

<p class="quote">'While many mothers may not consciously view their
sons as sexual beings, many may opt for circumcision with the
belief that the son will be more sexually attractive to his future
sexual partners, based on how they themselves feel.'<sup><a
href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">When Saint Paul talked about circumcision
enthusiasts glorying in the flesh, he knew what he was talking
about! He knew that circumcision enthusiasts can take in
Christians, and this, too, can be seen today. Take Kalico.net, a
Christian website. It offers what it calls 'A Positive Scriptural
View' of circumcision and provides a link to the Williamson &amp;
Williamson article with this warning:</p>

<p class="quote">'<u>Women's Preferences for Penile Circumcision In
Sexual Partners</u> If you think you would be easily offended by a
frank discussion of this subject, DON'T CLICK HERE.'<sup><a
href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">The sexual content of the study was enough to ring
warning bells with Kalico.net, but the warning did not sound loudly
enough to stop them from providing a direct link to this article. I
wonder if St Paul would say to Kalico.net's operator, 'You foolish
Christian! Who has bewitched you?'</p>

<h3 class="head3">Paul calls circumcisers <cite>'dogs'</cite> and
<cite>'mutilators of the flesh</cite>'.</h3>

<p class="norm">In a later letter, dated between <span
class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span> 61 and 63,<sup><a
href="#n34">34</a></sup> Paul is even more scathing about those who
push circumcision. He called them dogs. This was a sexual insult.
In the Old Testament the term was applied to male prostitutes. Look
at Deuteronomy 23:18 beside Philippians 3:2.</p>

<p class="quote">'You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or
the wages of a male prostitute (Hebrew: <cite>a dog</cite>) into
the house of the LORD your God &hellip; for both of these are
abhorrent to the LORD your God.' (Deut. 23:18)</p>

<p class="quote">'Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,
beware of those who mutilate the flesh! For it is we who are the
circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God&hellip;' (Phil.
3:2)</p>

<p class="norm">Note Paul's comment about mutilating the flesh!
Previously, he said that circumcision is nothing. Now he talks of
circumcisers as <cite>mutilating</cite> the flesh. This is a
startling development.</p>

<p class="norm">In another late letter, one that has been dated as
late as <span class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 65 or
even <span class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>.
68,<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> Paul slams &lsquo;those of the
circumcision&rsquo;:</p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;There are also many rebellious people, idle
talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision; they
must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by
teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach.' (Titus
1:10-11)</p>

<p class="norm">Now the motivation is not fear of persecution or
'glorying in the flesh', but money. Paul also notes that this
teaching about circumcision upsets whole families. He says they
must be silenced. Obviously he saw them as a great threat.</p>

<h3 class="head3">How Paul became more hostile to circumcision</h3>

<p class="norm">Paul's position on circumcision became more hostile
to the practice and to the practitioners as time passed. In the
Acts of the Apostles, (<span class="ad">A</span>.<span
class="ad">D</span>. 50) he was comfortable in either circumcising
Timothy or getting him circumcised. By 1 Corinthians, (<span
class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 55) he took an
even-handed approach, counselling against both circumcision and
uncircumcising. In Romans (<span class="ad">A</span>.<span
class="ad">D</span>. 56-59) he stressed the similarity and equality
between Jew and Gentile regardless of circumcision. In Galatians
(<span class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 49), (but I
suspect it was later) he had a particular problem with circumcision
advocates, accusing them of undermining the Gospel and acting from
sexual motives, glorying in men's flesh. He wishes that those who
upset the church by promoting circumcision would castrate
themselves!</p>

<p class="norm">This was not the end of it. In a later letter
(<span class="ad">A</span>.<span class="ad">D</span>. 61-63) he
accused circumcisers of operating for sordid gain, sowing
dissension in families and churches. Most startling of all, Paul
called circumcisers mutilators (<span class="ad">A</span>.<span
class="ad">D</span>. 65-68). His attitudes had come a long way from
the time when he circumcised Timothy because of the Jews (Acts
16:3).</p>

<p class="norm">Note Paul's increasing hatred of circumcisers and
circumcision. As time went on, he found out more about the
motivation of circumcisers, and the more he found out about them
the less he liked them. Also I would suggest that as he associated
more and more with Gentiles he absorbed more of their abhorrence of
the practice, and this is also reflected in his writings.</p>

<h3 class="head3">Why Circumcision and the Law were abolished</h3>

<p class="norm">I don't want you to think that circumcision was a
special case, divorced from Paul's main message. It was not. In
fact, the issues surrounding circumcision were near the heart of
his message. Paul knew how revolutionary this message was. Look at
why he said circumcision and the law were abolished:</p>

<p class="quote">'So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles
by birth, called "the uncircumcision" by those who are called "the
circumcision" - a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human
hands - remember that you were at that time without Christ, being
aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought
near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; in his flesh he
has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing
wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the law
with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in
himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace,
and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the
cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. So he came
and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who
were near; for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to
the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you
are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of
God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with
Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.' (Eph. 2:11-20)</p>

<p class="norm">What a wonderful vision of peace and reconciliation
between Jew and Gentile! All that remained of circumcision was a
symbolic one, made without hands. Indeed the legal demand for
circumcision of the flesh was nailed to the cross.</p>

<p class="quote">'In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual
circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the
circumcision of Christ; when you were buried with him in baptism.
You were also raised with him through faith in the power of God,
who raised him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses
and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together
with him when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record
that stood against us with its legal demand. He set this aside,
nailing it to the cross.' (Col. 2:11-14)</p>

<p class="norm">If Paul's objections to circumcision were only
religious, as is the case in Romans, we could perhaps dismiss them
as a by-product of the development and growth of Christianity as it
separated from Judaism. In 1 Corinthians we could dismiss his
arguments as those of a conservative, who believed that people
should accept their lot in life. However, there was more to it than
that.</p>

<p class="norm">In Galatians, Paul was furious with circumcision
advocates for upsetting the congregation and leading them away from
Jesus and also Christianity but he also raised questions about the
sexual motivation of those who pushed circumcision. In Philippians
he accused circumcisers of being sexually deviant mutilators.
Finally, in Titus, he said they were in it for the money. As Paul
came from a circumcising culture, was himself circumcised on the
eighth day (Phil. 3:5), and was responsible for one man's
circumcision (Acts 16:3), his rejection of circumcision and his
condemnation of those who encouraged this practice is particularly
telling.</p>

<p class="norm">Why was Paul so incensed by the pro circumcision
advocates? Why did he call them mutilators, deceivers, teaching for
sordid gain and sowing dissension in families and churches? I
suggest that Paul, knew what they were like. And if you would like
evidence of what some modern-day circumcisers are like, I would
refer you to <a href="http://www.circlist.org/"
target="_blank">Circlist</a>, &lt;http://www.circlist.org&gt;, and
you will see that the Apostle was speaking the sober truth.</p>

<p class="norm">This is a message that we should take notice of,
because it has great relevance today.</p>

<h3 class="head3">Conclusion</h3>

<p class="norm">My motive in writing this has been to demonstrate
that the New Testament raises serious questions about the motives
of those who encourage circumcision. While welcoming all, whether
circumcised or not, the New Testament condemns those who push
circumcision. There no discrimination in the New Testament against
anyone for their being circumcised or not, but there is clear
opposition to receiving circumcision and furious condemnation of
those who encourage the practice.</p>

<p class="norm">However, two other things became clear to me as I
was writing. Paul said to the Galatians:</p>

<p class="quote">'&hellip;I, Paul, am telling you that if you let
yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised
that he is obliged to obey the entire law. You who want to be
justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you have
fallen away from grace.' (Gal. 5:2-4)</p>

<p class="norm">In this astonishing use of imagery, Paul says that
those who cut off their foreskins cut themselves off from Christ!
If this was not clear enough he said plainly that they have fallen
away from grace. Here the issue of circumcision has become a
powerful metaphor for the relationship between the believer and
Christ. Thus the question of circumcision in the New Testament went
to the heart of the message of Christianity.</p>

<p class="norm">It was also a powerful inversion of the original
command to circumcise, as recorded in Genesis. This said:</p>

<p class="quote">'Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in
the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has
broken my covenant.' (Genesis 17:14)</p>

<p class="norm">Paul's response, using the same imagery, was to
say:</p>

<p class="quote">'...every man who lets himself be
circumcised&hellip;is obliged to obey the entire law. You who want
to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you
have fallen away from grace.'</p>

<p class="norm">No other words he said could have made it clearer
that he had rejected the Law that demanded circumcision. It is a
point by point rebuttal of the first covenant, clothed in the
language and imagery of that covenant itself.</p>

<p class="norm">When Paul wrote about believers cutting themeselves
off from Christ he was of course referring to the converts turning
from Christianity to Judaism, with its requirement for
circumcision. However, his words have become prophetic in another
way. Galatia is now part of Turkey, a secular state whose majority
religion is Islam. So the Galatians did turn to the requirements of
Islam and thus to circumcision.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup></p>

<p class="norm">What is the lesson to us today? For many, the New
Testament would be the last word on the subject. Such people will
heed the plain words of Jesus, Peter, and Paul on circumcision.
Paul said (Gal. 2:4) that those pushing circumcision were 'false
believers' or 'false brothers'<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> and
that would be warning enough for them. Others will not feel so
bound. However, there is one thing that all people should take
notice of: the accusation from the Apostle Paul that those pushing
circumcision acted from sordid motives. He said they were:</p>

<p class="quote">&bull; pushing circumcision for 'sordid gain'
(Titus 1:10-11);<br />
&bull; had a sexual involvement in it - 'glorying in the flesh'
(Gal. 5:12-13 );<br />
&bull; were 'dogs' - 'sexual deviates' (Phil. 3:2); and<br />
&bull; were 'mutilators of the flesh.' (Phil. 3:2)</p>

<p class="norm">These claims may appear extreme. Some might think
that these comments might apply to the early church, but not to our
times. However, these two things should be noted. First, Paul was
no fool, and we must give him credit for knowing something about
human nature. Secondly, as I have shown, there is evidence that
some of today's circumcision enthusiasts reveal a clear sexual
motivation. This does not mean that everyone who argues for
circumcision is doing so for sordid motives. However, it is a
warning that we should take on board.</p>

<p class="norm">Those who believe that circumcision serves some
useful purpose should take particular notice of these warnings. Not
all have pure motives in pushing for circumcision. People should
ask themselves if they, like the Galatians, have been
bewitched.</p>
