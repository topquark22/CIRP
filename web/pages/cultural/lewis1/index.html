      <h1>CHRISTIANITY and CIRCUMCISION</h1>

      <p class="sub-head">A Call to Christian Action</p>
      <br />
       

      <p class="text"><font size="6">W</font>hen we ask, Jesus
      tells us, we will receive. When we seek, we will find. When
      we knock, the door will open. In the Name of the Father, and
      of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.</p>

      <p class="text">The history of the early Christian church is
      crystal clear on the subject of circumcision. Jesus' original
      Jewish apostles and disciples, at the Council in Jerusalem
      reported on in Acts 15, with the guidance, they said, of God
      the Holy Spirit, rejected circumcision of the body completely
      (Acts 15). Circumcision is not a Christian act and never has
      been. I believe Jesus himself said so in John 7.</p>

      <p class="text">Let's look carefully at these and other New
      Testament passages, in order to shine the holy, healing light
      of Christian scripture into the dense and damaging darkness
      that still today rules the majority of homes - including
      Christian homes - in America, the last country in the world
      to abandon the harmful, sinful practice of erroneously
      medicalized infant male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">Christian priests, ministers, and educators
      during the circumcision holocaust in America over the last
      130 years have been tragically ignorant and negligent of
      their responsibility to understand and preach the Good News
      on this important subject. Jesus, the Jew from Bethlehem and
      Nazareth, and his Jewish followers saw through the fraudulent
      sham of infant circumcision at the very beginning of
      Christianity. The Good News for all Christians is that God -
      through the Jewish Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus' Jewish
      apostles - freed Christians from this harmful "Jewish myth"
      (Titus 1:14) for all time.</p>

      <p class="text">There is now a worldwide movement, Christian
      and otherwise, in favor of genital integrity for minors,
      seeking to abolish involuntary, medically unnecessary genital
      mutilations of them. Now is the time to point out to everyone
      who will listen that Jesus and the early Christian church
      clearly perceived - and the New Testament clearly declares -
      God to be a loving opponent, not an evil perpetrator of
      infant circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">I am admonished by Jesus and the Holy Spirit
      to bring my prayerful concerns to His Church, and I do so
      now.</p>

      <p class="text">I ask Christians to pray about it, and to
      read the holy New Testament scriptures on this ancient
      subject, a subject that might be difficult for us were it not
      for the clear guidance provided to us in John 7, Acts 15, 1
      Corinthians, Galatians 2, 5, and 6, Philippians 3, Titus 1,
      and other New Testament passages. Please study and pray, for
      yourselves, for me, and for our sinful and sexually mutilated
      country and world.</p>

      <p class="text">The group with the largest number of sexually
      mutilated men in the world is the Muslims. Second in numbers
      come the Americans. And in a distant third place come the
      Jews. We all are in dire need of repentance and forgiveness
      for our sins against our brothers and sisters, stemming from
      our puzzling and sometimes deliberate blindness and ignorance
      on this matter, so important to the early church and to us as
      present-day Christians and human beings, God's children
      all.</p>

      <p class="text">This is especially true of us Christians who
      have the advantage of being taught in our own Holy Scriptures
      that circumcising is evil. We have not been paying attention.
      We do not want to know. But Jesus tells us we WILL know the
      truth and the truth WILL set us free.</p>

      <p class="text">"Father please forgive us, for we know not
      what we do."</p>

      <p class="text">But we do know that He will forgive us if we
      ask Him to. If we ask, we will receive the truth, if we seek,
      we will find the truth, if we knock, the door to the truth
      will be opened to us, whether we like it or not. When the
      door opens, God will let us slam it shut again if we want to,
      but the price of rejecting the truth is the loss of the
      freedom God intends for us, and the visiting of the sins of
      the fathers onto the sons to the third and fourth
      generation.</p>

      <p class="text">The early Christian church split with Judaism
      over mutilating the genitals of the Gentiles.</p>

      <p class="text">Listen to St. Paul's plain words in Titus:
      [My added words are the ones inserted in square brackets.
      After much painful experience, study, and prayer on the
      subject, this is how I hear St. Paul's meaning in this New
      Testament passage:]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Titus 1:10 For there are many rebellious people,
          idle-talkers, and deceivers, especially those of the
          circumcision, 1:11 who must be silenced because they
          mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain
          what ought not to be taught.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[The New International Version says they are
      "ruining whole households" merely for the "dishonest gain"
      sought; in fact, for money, the love of which - when it takes
      precedence over the love for our brothers, sisters, and God -
      is, as we know from the words of St. Paul, the root of evil
      (1 Timothy 6:10). Two thousand years later ignorant
      circumcisers are still ruining whole families, Christian and
      otherwise, for dishonest gain, for filthy lucre, for mere
      money. Beware of them! They "must be silenced", says St.
      Paul. Why? Because they are leading Christians astray from
      the word and will of God and harming God's children in the
      process. Paul continues:]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1:12 A certain one of them, in fact, one of their own
          prophets, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts,
          lazy gluttons." 1:13 Such testimony is true. For this
          reason rebuke them sharply that they may be healthy in
          the faith 1:14 and not pay attention to Jewish myths</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[including the "Jewish myth" that God requires genital
      mutilation of male babies]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>and commands of people who reject the truth.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[the circumcisers, who reject the truth that we are saved
      by the love of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, not by the
      absurdity of having our sex organs mutilated]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1:15 All is pure to those who are pure.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[including the whole body, including the penis and
      foreskin, designed and created good by God in the image of
      his own wise and loving choosing]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing
          is pure,</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[not even the magnificent human body, including the holy
      sexual handiwork of God Himself]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>but both their mind and conscience are corrupted.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[therefore they do not know to leave the body whole as God
      made it]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1:16 They profess to know God but with their deeds</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[of genital mutilation]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>they deny him, since they are detestable, disobedient,
          and unfit for any good deed.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">These quotations from Titus are the words of
      St. Paul in the New Testament. I did not make them up.
      Circumcising, according to St. Paul, is the deed of evil,
      clear evidence of not knowing God's will on this subject, of
      denying God and of being disobedient to His will. St. Paul
      tells us here that God's so-called requirement to circumcise
      the body is a "Jewish myth", not God's will, not a Christian
      belief, and that it is not a Christian practice. Never has
      been. Never will be.</p>

      <p class="text">Could it be any clearer?</p>

      <p class="text">Yes it could. Listen again to St. Paul in
      Galatians 5.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>5:1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.
          Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened
          again by a yoke of slavery. 5:2 Mark my words! I, Paul,
          tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised,
          Christ will be of no value to you at all. 5:3 Again I
          declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that
          he is obligated to obey the whole law. 5:4 You who are
          trying to be justified by law have been alienated from
          Christ; you have fallen away from grace.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[The idea that Christianity requires
      circumcision is completely wrong, says Paul. Quite the
      contrary. Christianity requires love and respect for God's
      creation, including the male and female sex organs. Do not
      backslide into ancient Jewish errors, he admonishes us. We
      are people of a NEW covenant of love, not the old one of fear
      and laws. For Christians there is ONE law: Christly Love. We
      are to love each other as Christ loved us. The love of Christ
      - and Christ-like love - cast out fear, including all the
      fears that drive circumcision.]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>5:12 As for those agitators, I wish they would go the
          whole way and emasculate themselves!</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[Here in the New Testament, St. Paul is so
      enraged at the circumcisionists of his day that he exclaims
      that he wishes they would cut off their OWN sex organs
      COMPLETELY, instead of trying to mutilate OTHER people's sex
      organs. Is there any more graphic way he could tell us that
      circumcision is wrong, that those who practice it and
      advocate it are mistaken about God's nature and God's will
      for our sex organs and our sex lives? Jesus has revealed to
      us a perfectly loving God, not a murderous, evil God of
      hatred, revenge, and sexual perversion and mutilation.]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>5:15 If you keep on biting and devouring each other,
          watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[Circumcision is biting and devouring. It is
      the first step to destruction. Don't take it, St. Paul warns
      us.]</p>

      <p class="text">Could it be any clearer?</p>

      <p class="text">Yes, it could. Listen to St. Peter's words at
      the Council in Jerusalem on circumcision and the rest of the
      Jewish law at which Christianity formally and officially
      rejected circumcision of the body forever. A long argument
      occurs on the subject amongst the apostles and disciples
      assembled for the specific purpose of settling this vexing
      question. Then Peter stands and speaks. After reminding them
      that God initially chose him to carry the Word to the
      gentiles, and that the gentiles heard and accepted the Word
      and their hearts were healed and purified by God just as the
      Jews' had been, God making no difference between Jew and
      gentile, between circumcised and genitally intact, Peter asks
      them this crucial question:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Acts 15:10 So now why are you putting God to the test
          by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that
          neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">Here is THE WAY, The Living Bible
      translation:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Acts 15:10 And now are you going to correct God by
          burdening the Gentiles with a yoke that neither we nor
          our fathers were able to bear?</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[St. Peter is talking to the
      circumcisionists, and he is calling circumcision a burden
      that "neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear."
      That is a far cry from the incorrect idea that circumcision
      is required, or merely unimportant and irrelevant. Peter says
      it is an unbearable burden. And he asks them why THEY want to
      impose this terrible, intolerable burden on the gentiles. It
      is recorded that the whole company became silent as they
      looked within their own hearts to answer Peter's very
      personal question.]</p>

      <p class="text">Listen to Jesus' brother, St. James's words,
      following St. Peter's:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Acts 15:13 After they stopped speaking, James replied,
          "Brothers, listen to me. 15:14 Simeon has explained how
          God first concerned himself to select from among the
          Gentiles a people for his name. 15:15 The words of the
          prophets agree with this, as it is written, 15:16 'After
          this I will return, and I will rebuild the fallen tent of
          David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it, 15:17 so
          that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, namely, all
          the Gentiles I have called to be my own, says the Lord,
          who makes these things 15:18 known from long ago.' 15:19
          Therefore I conclude that we should not cause extra
          difficulty for those among the Gentiles who are turning
          to God, ..."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[Listen to the whole Council at Jerusalem's
      written words, following James's speech, to the church at
      Antioch conveying the final decision of the Christian Church
      on this matter. Here are words from that very letter!]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Acts 15:28 "For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and
          to us not to place any greater burden on you than these
          necessary rules: 15:29 that you abstain from meat that
          has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what
          has been strangled and from sexual immorality. If you
          keep yourselves from doing these things, you will do
          well. Farewell."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[Circumcision is not on the list! God the
      Holy Spirit through Jesus' apostles assembled in Jerusalem
      for the purpose of deciding this fateful issue completely
      rejected for all time the evil of physical circumcision and
      liberated Christians and Christianity from it forever. The
      record is crystal clear in the New Testament itself. Don't
      take my word for it. Read the Word yourself. Read the Good
      News yourself in your own Bible. Pray about it. And then
      rejoice with the church at Antioch and join in their
      following Christian celebration!]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Acts 15:31 When they read it aloud, the people
          rejoiced at its encouragement.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[All Christians, I believe, guided by holy
      scripture and the Holy Spirit, should emulate this Christian
      celebration and will receive this Christian joy at our
      liberation by God the Holy Spirit from the ancient
      misunderstanding and evil of infant circumcision.]</p>

      <p class="text">Could it be any clearer?</p>

      <p class="text">Yes, it could. Listen especially carefully to
      Jesus' own words on circumcision in the Gospel of John:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>John 7:21 Jesus replied, "<span class="red">I
          performed one miracle and you are all amazed.</span>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[The complete healing on the Sabbath of the
      severely crippled man at the well, described in John
      5:1-18.]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>John 7:22 "<span class="red">However, because Moses
          gave you the practice of circumcision (not that it came
          from Moses, but from the forefathers), you circumcise a
          male child on the Sabbath</span>. 7:23 <span
          class="red">But if a male child is circumcised on the
          Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are
          you angry with me because I made a man completely well on
          the Sabbath?</span>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[The King James Version says "every whit
      whole".]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>John 7:23 "<span class="red">If a man on the sabbath
          day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should
          not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a
          man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">["Every whit whole" means every particle,
      down to the very last cell. Jesus here contrasts circumcision
      - which obviously destroys God-created wholeness - with His
      own holy ministry of making men "every whit whole" again by
      His complete healing of previously sick, unwhole,
      man-damaged, sexually mutilated Jewish men.]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>7:24 "<span class="red">Do not judge according to
          external appearance, but judge with proper
          judgment.</span>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[He instructs us to judge, not by the
      external appearance of things, not by the surface, not by the
      look of the penis, not hypocritically as the Jews have judged
      him in this matter, but in depth, with understanding and
      wisdom, correctly.]</p>

      <p class="text">We have failed to obey His clear instruction
      on this important matter.</p>

      <p class="text">Jesus told us He did not come to the healthy
      who had no need of him. He is the healer, the good physician
      who came to the sick, to the Jews, in fact, virtually the
      only people on Earth at the time mistaken enough - sick
      enough, lost enough from God - to mutilate the sex organs of
      their very own infant children and blame their evil actions
      on God.</p>

      <p class="text">I am not saying their intentions toward their
      children were evil, as I am not saying that today's parents
      who have mutilated the genitals of their children were evil.
      That is in every case for Jesus to judge, not me. I am saying
      that it has been proved scientifically now that the EFFECTS
      of circumcision are evil, no matter what the INTENTIONS of
      the mutilators are.</p>

      <p class="text">That being the fact, Jesus of course knew
      that fact.</p>

      <p class="text">The Jews were God's chosen people because
      they were in this way His sickest children on earth and had
      been for centuries, for millennia. The good shepherd leaves
      the whole flock to find and bring back and save the one lost
      sheep, Israel.</p>

      <p class="text">Circumcision destroys human wholeness - Jesus
      restores it.</p>

      <p class="text">What could be clearer?</p>

      <p class="text">Christians should follow Jesus, concluded the
      early church, guided by God the Holy Spirit, not ancient and
      mistaken Hebrew myths requiring sexual child sacrifice and
      blaming God for it. Jesus knew God better than that. So
      should we, His followers.</p>

      <p class="text">This story about Jesus is much like the story
      that took place the next morning on the Mount of Olives,
      reported in John 8:1-11. It is the more familiar story of the
      adulteress brought to Him by the Jews who asked Him if they
      should impose the death penalty on her for her sexual sin by
      stoning her to death, as required in Old Testament law. Jesus
      had brought up sex the day before when he taught in the
      Temple about circumcision and healing. Now here is sex
      rearing its "ugly" head again the very next day.</p>

      <p class="text">Jesus didn't say to them, "The Old Testament
      law on stoning unfaithful wives to death is wrong. Don't pay
      any attention to that ancient, evil Hebrew myth." They would
      have stoned Him AND her to death on the spot! His time had
      not yet come. Instead, He said, "Let he who is without sin
      among you cast the first stone.", thereby saving her life,
      and, for a short time, his own.</p>

      <p class="text">In the same way, and for the same reason, I
      think, Jesus appears not to have said the day before in the
      Jewish temple in Jerusalem, "The Old Testament law on
      circumcision is wrong. Don't pay any attention to that
      ancient, evil Hebrew myth." They would have killed Him
      instantly, and His time had not yet come. Instead, He said,
      at least as I hear His message across the intervening
      millennia, something like -</p>

      <p class="text">"In obedience to what you mistakenly believe
      that God commands - this so-called 'command' to mutilate
      babies' genitals comes not from God but from man, from your
      forefathers, not even from Moses - you sometimes circumcise a
      baby boy on the Sabbath. It appears that through me, God
      sometimes chooses to heal a man completely on the Sabbath,
      every last part, including his penis, and his God-created
      foreskin. Who are we to question how and when and who and
      through whom God chooses to heal, to make men every whit
      whole again? Shouldn't we just rejoice when He heals, with
      the faithful one who is healed? Can't we all just get
      along?"</p>

      <p class="text">The underlying message, though, the
      contradiction that Jesus showed the Jewish authorities in the
      Temple in Jerusalem - in the very heart of the inconceivably
      arrogant circumcisionist blasphemy and circumcisionist heresy
      - that absolute contradiction between God's healing love and
      power on the one hand, and their own infant circumcising on
      the other, was just too clear and too strong. We may not
      understand Jesus' clear words and meaning in John 7 today,
      but THEY sure got him loud and clear in person back then!
      They were incensed with Jesus' teaching - in the very temple
      itself! - against the ancient evil of infant circumcision.
      They said and believed that the circumcision madness came
      from God. Jesus knew better. He knew and said that it did
      not. What they idolized and many still do today - sexual
      sacrifice of infants, infant sexual child abuse and
      mutilation in the name of God - Jesus proclaimed as evil.
      Simply because it is evil. At least doubly so. It is not just
      mutilation. It is mutilation in God's name. It is blasphemy
      against God and his goodness.</p>

          about it that its deeds are evil.</span>"</p>

      <p class="text">Those committing this evil very soon demanded
      that the Romans crucify Him for telling them the truth. Jesus
      died for advocating and for bringing truth and human
      wholeness on every level, including the sexual.</p>

      <p class="text">Jesus preferred and brought human wholeness
      wherever He went, but we sinful humans prefer human
      brokenness, in ourselves and in others, so much so that we
      even break our brand new babies, and blame our blatantly
      obvious sexual sin and heinous sex crime on God, and when God
      tries to heal us of our brokenness and our breaking, we kill
      Him for it.</p>

      <p class="text">"Crucify him! Crucify him!"</p>

      <p class="text">Jesus was already aware that they wanted to
      kill Him even before he gave this important, radical teaching
      in the Temple. Here is the whole fateful, holy passage from
      the Gospel of John:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>John 7:1 After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee.
          He stayed out of Judea because the Jewish authorities
          wanted to kill him. 7:2 Now the Jewish feast of
          Tabernacles was near. 7:3 So Jesus' brothers advised him,
          "Leave here and go to Judea so your disciples may see
          your miracles that you are performing. 7:4 For no one who
          seeks to make a reputation for himself does anything in
          secret. If you are doing these things, show yourself to
          the world." 7:5 (For not even his own brothers believed
          in him.)</p>

          <p>7:6 So Jesus replied, "<span class="red">My time has
          not yet arrived, but you are ready at any
          opportunity.</span> 7:7 <span class="red">The world
          cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying
          about it that its deeds are evil.</span>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">[Can you imagine a young, untutored man
      testifying in the presence of the Jewish authorities - the
      oldest and wisest that Judaism had to offer at the time, in
      the very Temple in Jerusalem itself - that their "holy"
      circumcision genital mutilation rite, instituted by "God"
      through Father Abraham, is - EVIL? Get ready! Here it comes,
      from the very heart and mouth of Jesus! Jesus is calling
      infant circumcision evil. I hear it clearly. I believe it.
      The man was a Jewish revolutionary, primarily a revolutionary
      in his understanding of the goodness and love of God for us,
      just as Abraham was when he understood that God did not want
      him to kill Isaac. And Jesus met the fate of many
      revolutionaries who try to help us heal our brokenness. The
      list is very long and there are many familiar names on it,
      but the name above all others is Jesus.]</p>

          my time has not yet fully arrived.</span>" 7:9 When he
          had said this, he remained in Galilee. 7:10 But when his
          brothers had gone up to the feast, then Jesus himself
          also went up, not openly but in secret. 7:11 So the
          Jewish authorities were looking for him at the feast,
          asking, "Where is he?" 7:12 There was a lot of grumbling
          about him among the crowds. Some were saying, "He is a
          good man," but others, "He deceives the common people."
          7:13 However, no one spoke openly about him for fear of
          the Jewish authorities.</p>

      <p class="text">[Fear! Fear! Fear! Fear of the Jewish
      authorities! Is it any different today? Where is the
      Christian love to cast out this killing fear? Ask for it, and
      you will receive it! Pray for it and it will come! Love
      enough will come even for your enemies! Even for terrorists.
      Even for circumcisers who claim, falsely - against the
      testimony of Jesus, His apostles, and the Holy Spirit - that
      God requires this evil terror of genital mutilation. It is
      now wrecking and ruining not just whole individual
      households, but whole nations and our whole world. Look
      around.]</p>

          the temple and began to teach. 7:15 Then the Jewish
          authorities were astonished and said, "How does this man
          know so much when he has never had formal
          instruction?"</p>

      John 5:1-18.]</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>7:22 "<span class="red">However, because Moses gave
          you the practice of circumcision (not that it came from
          Moses, but from the forefathers), you circumcise a male
          child on the Sabbath.</span> 7:23 <span class="red">But
          if a male child is circumcised on the Sabbath so that the
          law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me

          Sabbath?</span> 7:24 <span class="red">Do not judge
          according to external appearance, but judge with proper
          judgment.</span>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">The fact that the healing occurred on the
      Sabbath was their technical, legalistic EXCUSE for their
      anger, the excuse with which they tried to dress up and
      disguise in religious terms and hide - from everyone,
      including themselves - and justify their evil, murderous
      feelings toward Jesus. Jesus showed them that His healing on
      the Sabbath is not the real reason for their anger at him.
      After all, they practiced circumcising on the Sabbath. What
      could possibly be wrong in God's eyes, then, with HEALING on
      the Sabbath. There is a deeper, more insidious reason for
      their anger, an evil reason, which they try to disguise with
      religious law.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="red">'...are ye angry at me, because I
          have made a man every whit whole...?</span>"</p>
          (King James version.)
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">THAT is the deep, penetrating question Jesus
      asks them. Jesus was healing people right and left, making
      them "every whit whole" again, restoring their whole bodies
      and minds - including their sexual bodies and minds - to
      health and happiness and God-intended human wholeness.
      (Practicing medicine without a license! How DARE He!) And
      those left out of his healing were furious! Enraged!
      MURDEROUSLY so! HATED being left out. And so they hated and
      blamed Christ the inclusive healer for their own
      sickness.</p>

      <p class="text">Miraculous healings! Stunning healings!
      Frightening, TERRIFYING healings, to those who didn't
      understand them and couldn't accept them as the miraculous
      will and work of God. Those left out of the real healing and
      love of God by their OWN choice, not by God's choice, were
      furious, MURDEROUSLY FURIOUS - with God. For this, Jesus was
      crucified and killed by the mistaken, fearful, circumcising,
      sick and sickening, sexually mutilating religious culture of
      the Jews of the day.</p>

      <p class="text">Judaism, I believe, is fundamentally about
      justice, mercy, and walking humbly with God, not about
      unjustly, unmercifully, arrogantly chopping up babies'
      penises, sexually butchering and mutilating men for life. I
      believe that Judaism is changing, too, now, going back at
      last to its fundamental foundations: Justice, Mercy, and
      Humility in the presence of a loving and merciful God.</p>

      <p class="text">If God does not want us chopping up our
      babies' sex organs, did Jesus know it 2000 years ago? For
      Christians, the answer is obvious: Jesus knew it from before
      the beginning of the world.</p>

      <p class="text">Would such knowledge of God have gotten Jesus
      into serious trouble with the proud and arrogant Jewish
      religious authorities of the day? For intactivists, the
      answer is obvious: Everyone who tries to keep parents from
      sexually abusing their children gets themselves into serious
      trouble with the sexually abusing parents. If the parents
      claim "God" as their co-abuser, and believe their claim,
      criticism of the abuse can be deadly for the critic.</p>

      <p class="text">Do God the Father, God the Son, and God the
      Holy Spirit want us to protect our children from this
      ancient, destructive, mutilative Jewish myth? For intactivist
      Christians, the answer couldn't be more obvious: Of
      course!</p>

      <p class="text">There have been Jews throughout history who
      have understood that circumcision is not the will of our
      loving parent God, who made us correctly in God's own image.
      Jesus was one of those enlightened Jews. They have not won
      yet. The majority of Jews, religious and secular, still
      circumcise their male babies, but Jewish intactivists are
      winning battles every day and they will win this war, just as
      they won the war against stoning unfaithful wives to death. I
      believe the final Jewish victory over mistaken Jewish
      circumcision will come soon.</p>

      <p class="text">And we confused U.S. Christians today - just
      as sick as the Jews of Jesus' day; sicker; we should know
      better; we should read our New Testament - we do the same as
      those Jews of long ago did, with far less excuse, to the
      loving babies and the loving Jesus. He told us if we do it to
      them we do it to him (Matthew 25:40). We circumcise them and
      we kill some of them in the process every year. Crucifixion -
      murder - by any other name is still just as evil. Calling it
      "circumcision" doesn't help.</p>

      <p class="text">Was the torture, crucifixion, and death of
      the innocent, powerful, healing, loving Jesus at the hands of
      crucifixionists the work of evil in the world? If not, there
      is no such thing as evil.</p>

      <p class="text">Is the torture, mutilation, and sometimes
      death of innocent, powerful, healing, loving little babies at
      the hands of circumcisionists also the work of the same evil?
      If not, there is no such thing as evil.</p>

      <p class="text">Jesus told us it would be better for us to
      have a millstone tied around our neck and be thrown into the
      sea than to offend even one of these little ones of His
      (Matthew 18:6). Circumcision offends them. You don't have to
      believe me. Witness one of these ancient, sick sex crimes for
      yourself. You will see a mortally offended - and properly so
      - child of God, being butchered alive like an animal.</p>

      <p class="text">Look at a "Circumstraint" board, to which
      babies are strapped down for mutilation, just as Jesus was
      nailed to the cross for crucifixion. The Circumstraint
      resembles nothing so much as a little cross for infants. All
      it needs to make its murderous, spirit-killing mission clear
      is a slight redesign to hold the arms straight out away from
      the body instead of slightly curved down at the sides.</p>

      <p class="text">As it is, perhaps the Circumstraint resembles
      more the injection tables used now to strap down and execute
      people on death row, some of whom have been proved, too late,
      as innocent of the crimes for which they were murdered as
      Jesus was innocent of any crime - the New Testament nowhere
      says that Jesus ever circumcised a baby, for example; can you
      even imagine him doing such a thing? - as innocent as the
      babies being brutally and ignorantly mutilated, being
      rendered sexually dysfunctional for life by primitive and
      very sick human genital mutilations at the rate of one every
      26 seconds in the U.S.A. today.</p>

      <p class="text">Some ignorant people even call these ancient
      sex crimes "Christian". Do not be fooled by them, St. Paul
      cautions us. Read the Good Book.</p>

      <p class="text">Christian history as reported faithfully in
      the New Testament makes clear that both the torture and
      crucifixion of Christ at the end of his life and the torture
      and circumcision of babies at the beginning of theirs are
      great evils and are not from God. God is liberating us from
      these ancient and godless evils, through Christ.</p>

      <p class="text">But will we arrogant, murderous, evil sinners
      EVER listen? People HATE Jesus - he said so himself - because
      he tells us the truth about ourselves, he testifies and shows
      us that our deeds ARE evil, including our deeds of
      circumcision. Better to kill Him and be done with Him.</p>

      <p class="text">Some Christians say, "Jesus was circumcised,
      so it must be right!" Jesus was also crucified. Should we
      crucify our children when they reach the tender age of
      thirty-three? Just because WE did it to Him - circumcision or
      crucifixion - that doesn't automatically make it right. We
      are sinful, remember? He came and suffered circumcision by
      our hands at the beginning of his life and crucifixion by our
      hands at the end of it to SHOW us our evil sin, to bring us
      to repentance, to save us, to heal us, to make us whole again
      in God's forgiveness and love.</p>

      <p class="text">These passages found in the New Testament
      were very clarifying for me about Jesus, Christian history,
      Christianity, and circumcision. Please read the whole
      passages. We need the whole. There is much more to be found
      in the New Testament on the subject of circumcision. To
      understand it we must understand clearly this early Christian
      history and the plain historical fact that Jesus and
      Christianity at its beginning, rejected circumcision of the
      penis completely and replaced it with "circumcision of the
      heart", spiritual circumcision - with baptism, a far gentler
      rite.</p>

      <p class="text">I hope Christians will pray together and
      study Holy scripture and modern science (which finally now
      agrees with Christianity that circumcision is backward,
      damaging, and evil in its effects even when not in its
      intent), and seek better understanding of all these important
      matters. They can be very fateful, "ruining whole
      households", as St. Paul says. Killing whole babies.
      Circumcision can and does kill babies in this country and
      around the world every year - many of them, Jewish,
      Christian, and otherwise - from shock, from bleeding to
      death, from infection, and all totally unnecessarily. How can
      Christians be doing this to our babies? How can we? To say
      the very least, this is not Christ-like love.</p>

      <p class="text">Would Jesus have us kill our children? Of
      course not! Absurd! We Christians are not subject to and
      slaves of the old Hebrew law, but freed by Jesus and the Holy
      Spirit into the holy love and eternal salvation of God.
      Freedom from the ancient evil of circumcision is one crystal
      clear teaching of Christianity. It is a vital and important
      part of the Good News and must be preached as such around the
      world, and especially in America today, the last country in
      the world still circumcising for non-religious reasons the
      majority of our infant males.</p>

      <p class="text">Part of the ever-lighter burden God has laid
      on my heart - people don't like me bringing up the subject
      any more than they liked Jesus bringing it up, but He didn't
      let people's anger at Him for doing so stop Him, not even in
      the Temple in Jerusalem! - is the opportunity and the
      privilege to try my best to be sure these unnecessary and
      torturous sexual mutilations and completely unnecessary baby
      killings stop happening in my families, including my
      biological families, my church families, and my human family
      around the world.</p>

      <p class="text">As Titus, Galatians, Acts of the Apostles,
      the Gospel of John, and many other passages in the New
      Testament make perfectly clear for all with eyes to see or
      ears to hear, circumcision is not a loving, Christian act.
      God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit want us - all of us - whole.
      That is the way God made us. Destroying God's exquisite,
      perfect handiwork without just cause is simply blasphemy and
      heresy against the obvious and miraculous work of God
      CREATING God's miracle of human wholeness, which reveals the
      clear will of God FOR God's miracle of human wholeness. We
      are made in the image of God's own choosing. Redesigning and
      mutilating the human body to our own perverted liking is
      clear sin.</p>

      <p class="text">Christians! Rejoice in the freedom and love
      of Jesus Christ and be forever free from the ancient evil of
      inhuman genital mutilation!</p>

      <p class="text">Praise and Glory be to the wise, holy, and
      loving God who designed and made us all.</p>

      <p class="text">Holy Lord God please help us. Holy Lord Jesus
      Christ please heal us. Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, Holy
      Comforter, please be with us, now and always.</p>

      <p class="text">In the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
      and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.</p>
