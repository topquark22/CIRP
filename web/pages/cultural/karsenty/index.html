                    Questioning Circumcision: 

          "<B>The Ultimate Taboo Among American Jews</B>"

     "When I began to question the practice of circumcision among
American Jews, to say that I had no idea of what a great taboo it
was would be an understatement. Coming from a European background
where routine circumcisions as practiced in most American
hospitals are nonexistent, and where many Jews reject brit milla
as an archaic and barbaric ritual, I simply assumed that the
Jewish community had divergent approaches on this issue just as
with every other aspect of Judaism. I was stunned to realize that
questioning this ritual is the ultimate taboo among American
Jews. . . . The extent of the repression surrounding this issue
is astounding. Anyone who dares to question the brit milla is
angrily silenced, laughed at, lightly dismissed, or labelled  a
traitor undermining Judaism."
