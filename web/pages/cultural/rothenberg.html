    <h1>Men's Oppression</h1>

    <h2>Being Rational About Circumcision and Jewish
    Observance</h2>

    <h3>by Moshe Rothenberg, Brooklyn, New York, USA</h3>
    <hr />
    Given the oppression in the world and how I have internalized
    it it is not easy but always worthwhile to remember that I am a
    complete human being committed to making my own decisions. 

    <p>One of the decisions I have made as an adult is to reaffirm
    the importance of my being a Jew. I am proud of us. Like other
    peoples we have internalized our oppression but we have a
    powerful religion and culture that speaks of the strength of
    our ancestors' ability to overcome the difficulties put in
    their way. Our victories are seen in our music, dance, voices,
    literature, and above all else the hearts and minds of the
    people who call themselves Jews.</p>

    <p>One of the central rites of Judaism is the emphasis on
    passing this rich cultural heritage on to our children,
    grandchildren and others whom we love. A central part of the
    Passover Seder is the youngest child asking questions about the
    story of liberation so s/he can make it her/his own. In Bar and
    Bat Mitzvah ceremonies boys and girls demonstrate their desire
    and ability to participate in the religious tradition and this
    marks their transition from childhood to adulthood. A bris
    (circumcision ritual) is part of this tradition of passing on
    our heritage.</p>

    <p>One effect of oppression is that people who have been
    imposed upon are conditioned to impose upon others. Jews have
    for centuries been conditioned to impose the rule of
    authorities onto other members of the working class. In the
    present day Middle East Israel has been forced to be the agent
    of the capitalist United States government policy towards
    Arabs. This has captured the attention of the world and rightly
    so.</p>

    <p>Another manifestation of this phenomenon, circumcision, has
    not yet gotten much attention. In general the needs wishes and
    cries of the young go unnoticed or unheeded. We're treated as
    silly and unimportant as young people. Young boys are
    especially conditioned to not feel or express our feelings.
    Circumcision is imposing upon infant boys without their
    consent.</p>

    <p>Circumcision has become an integral crucial rite in the
    Jewish culture. Exploring this as a client I have found
    absolutely no reason medical or otherwise to continue this
    custom except for its longstanding importance to the Jewish
    community, not a good reason in and of itself. I have been to a
    number of bris'. At none of them did a single person note the
    pain that every eightdayold boy was expressing despite the fact
    that a lot of alcohol had been given to the boy to numb him. In
    fact the child was not really given a lot of attention of any
    kind; the ritual was much more for the parents the father in
    particular and their usually numerous guests.</p>

    <p>The Jewish people are a good people; we have too long been
    stereotyped in many hurtful ways because of our cultural
    differences ant internalized oppression. At the same time we
    must examine our own attitudes and in the name of <i>havat
    Yisroel</i>&mdash;love of Jews, love of all people, love of
    God&mdash;we must not do anything hurtful to another human
    being including and especially our children.</p>

    <p>My son Sammy at this point is a healthy eight-monthold
    fetus. I am sure he eagerly awaits his birth and fully expects
    to be completely and warmly welcomed and well thought of. I
    will do nothing to contradict that picture of the universe.
    Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come; it
    is time to stop circumcision whatever have been the reasons
    and/or distresses that have perpetuated it.</p>
    <hr />
    <i>(The following is part of a statement Moshe made during the
    bris for his son which included members of his family, friends,
    and coworkers in the Orthodox Jewish community, some of whom
    were in disagreement with his decision not to circumcise his
    son. &mdash;B.E.)</i> 

    <p>"As part of our community Yehudit and I would like to
    welcome all of you today. We are deeply appreciative of all of
    you coming. We welcome your becoming part of our son's own
    community.</p>

    <p>I am going to start this short ceremony with a quote from
    Selma Fraiberg's <i>The Magic Years</i>, as quoted in Yehudit's
    sister Cheryl's new book <i>In Celebration of Babies:</i></p>

    <blockquote>
      The magician is seated in his high chair and looks upon the
      world with favor. He is at the height of his powers. If he
      closes his eyes he causes the world to disappear. If he opens
      his eyes he causes the world to come back. If there is
      Harmony within him the world is harmonious. If rage shatters
      his inner harmony, the unity of the world is shattered. If
      desire dies within him, he utters the magic syllables that
      cause the desired object to appear. His wishes, his thoughts,
      his gestures, his noises, command the universe.
    </blockquote>

    <p>We very much want Sammy to be in charge of his world and of
    his life as this quote describes. We want him to always be
    involved and to make his own decisions. As Emerson once said,
    "Infancy conforms to nobody; all conform to it." Sammy like the
    rest of us is part of Jewish heritage and tradition. At the
    same time this is a fresh moment and his future like ours, will
    be different than the past.</p>

    <p>`Bris' means covenant. On this day I am making the following
    commitment to Sammy, to Yehudit, to my family: I will never
    intentionally hurt either of you; I will not commit verbal
    violence toward you. Yehudit; I will do my very best and
    eventually succeed to never argue with you again. And to you,
    Sammy, I promise I will not hurt you physically or in any other
    way, come what may. Today as always we want to give you the
    very best start in life possible.</p>

    <p>Finally I want to speak about the community of Jews. We are
    a wonderfully diverse people and sometimes we forget that
    difference is a good thing. Each of us brings different
    thoughts, actions and beliefs into what is collectively called
    Judaism. Today the Jewish world is deeply involved in serious
    disputes with each other and this ceremony, what is and what is
    not being done, creates apparently another. I appeal to each of
    us to wrestle with our own beliefs inside ourselves and with
    each other respectfully. I appeal to each of us to learn to
    disagree rather than think that what we are doing is always
    right. Only then to me will our true sense of community thrive.
    Thank you again for coming. Yehudit will now conduct a water
    ceremony and we will officially name the baby.</p>
