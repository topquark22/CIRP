              Questions about Circumcision</h2>
            </center>

            <p>Circumcision is as controversial today as it was in
            New Testament times. Then, as now, it could tear
            marriages and families apart. Fortunately, insights we
            can gain from the Bible about circumcision can guide us
            today.</p>

            <h4>What is circumcision?</h4>

            <p>Circumcision cuts off the foreskin, the sexually
            sensitive sleeve of tissue that normally covers and
            protects the head of the penis.</p>

            <h4>Is circumcision today the same as circumcision in
            the Bible?</h4>

            <p>No. The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion
            traces the origin of <i>per'iah</i> (the baring of the
            glans) to the time of Hadrian (A.D.132-135):</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Many Hellenistic Jews, particularly those who
                participated in athletics at the gymnasium, had an
                operation performed to conceal the fact of their
                circumcision (1 Maccabees 1.15). Similar action was
                taken during the Hadrianic persecution, in which
                period a prohibition against circumcision was
                issued. It was probably in order to prevent the
                possibility of obliterating the traces of
                circumcision that the rabbis added to the
                requirement of cutting the foreskin that of
                <i>peri'ah</i> (laying bare the glans).<br />
                 (The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion, ed.
                R.J. Zwi Werblowsky and G. Wigoder. Oxford
                University Press, 1997, page 161.)</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The New Testament predates this development (see 1
            Corinthians 7:18). Medical circumcisions developed from
            the later, more radical rite, so today's infant
            circumcisions are more severe than circumcisions in the
            Bible.</p>

            <h4>Is the foreskin a mistake of nature?</h4>

            <p>No. The Bible says that God pronounced creation
            'very good' (Genesis 1:31) and that humans were made in
            the image of God (Genesis 1:27). The Apostle Paul also
            said that God made every part of the body as he wanted
            it. (1 Corinthians 12:18).</p>

            <h4>How did circumcision start in the Bible?</h4>

            <p>According to Genesis, God told Abraham to circumcise
            himself, his household and his slaves as an everlasting
            covenant in their flesh. Those who were not circumcised
            were to be 'cut off' from their people (Genesis
            17:10-14). Note the connection between circumcision and
            slavery. It is alluded to in the New Testament.</p>

            <h4>Who was to be circumcised?</h4>

            <p>Abraham, his descendants and those who were bought
            with their money (Genesis 17:12-13). Also, all the
            males of a household were to be circumcised if one of
            them wanted to join in the Passover celebrations
            (Exodus 12:43-49).</p>

            <p>However, there is a puzzle. Laws commanding
            circumcision are said to come through Moses (e.g.
            Leviticus 12), but the Children of Israel abandoned
            circumcision during Moses' leadership (Joshua 5: 4-7).
            Exodus 4: 24-26 tells us that Moses had not circumcised
            his own son.</p>

            <p>This suggests several scribal traditions. In the
            first, Moses did not practise circumcision, and the
            custom was abandoned under his leadership (Joshua 5:
            4-7). In the second his wife is made to conform to the
            practice (Exodus 4: 24-26). Finally, in the third
            tradition, he is given the command to circumcise from
            the LORD himself.</p>

            <h4>Did circumcision apply to anyone else?</h4>

            <p>Circumcision applied to the slaves of Jews. Apart
            from that, circumcision never applied to people outside
            the Jewish faith. The first covenant was not with other
            nations. All other people were described as
            uncircumcised, even those who practised circumcision
            (Jeremiah 9:25-26). Circumcision never applied to
            Christians (Acts 15:5-11). The Apostle Peter, who was
            circumcised, said:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                ... we believe that we will be saved through the
                grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.<br />
                 (Acts 15:11, New RSV)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Should Christians follow the Law of Moses?</h4>

            <p>No. Christians were freed from the Law, including
            circumcision (Acts 15:1-20). It was described as an
            almost unbearable yoke on the neck (Acts 15: 10). The
            yoke, of course, was a sign of slavery and Christians
            were told not to become entangled with 'a yoke of
            bondage' (Galatians 5:1-2).</p>

            <p>The Law as we read it contains things that appall
            us, such as forcing a rapist to marry his victim
            (Deuteronomy 22:28-29) or rejecting people born out of
            wedlock and their descendants (Deuteronomy 23:2).
            However, almost all of us read the Law in translation,
            which inevitably changes and distorts the text. Even
            fewer read it with a background of the checks, balances
            and insights of the Jewish oral and legal tradition.
            This has contributed to atrocities such as when
            Christians used Exodus 22:18 to justify the slaughter
            of 'witches' or other verses to justify slavery and the
            slave trade (e.g., Exodus 21:2-11, 20-21, Leviticus
            25:44-46 and Deuteronomy 20:10-15).</p>

            <h4>What does this mean for Christians?</h4>

            <p>Christians must be wary. Many of these laws,
            including the food laws, were repudiated in the New
            Testament (Acts 10:1-33). Jesus himself criticized the
            scribes and their traditions. (e.g., Matthew 15: 1-9,
            <i>also</i> Isaiah 29 :13). Jeremiah's assessment of
            the Law must also be pondered.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                How can you say, "We are wise,<br />
                and the law of the LORD is with us,"<br />
                when in fact, the false pen of the scribes<br />
                has made it into a lie?<br />
                (Jeremiah 8: 8, New RSV)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Why are Bible stories about circumcision so
            vicious?</h4>

            <p>There has always been a nasty underside to
            circumcision. Whether it was Greek authorities killing
            Jews for circumcising their infant boys (1 Maccabees 1:
            60-62), Jewish zealots forcibly circumcising
            uncircumcised Jewish boys (1 Maccabees 2: 46) or Muslim
            zealots forcibly circumcising Christian men, women and
            children in Ambon, Indonesia (<a
            href="/news/morningherald01-27-01/">Sydney Morning
            Herald January 27, 2001, page 25</a>), there has always
            been a powerful undercurrent of violence and sexual
            abuse associated with circumcision.</p>

            <p>The Bible tells us about circumcision as it is.
            Stories such as the circumcision and slaughter of the
            Shechemites (Genesis 34) or the 100 foreskin dowry (1
            Samuel 18: 25-27) carry an implicit warning that was
            made explicit by the Apostle Paul when he said:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                It is those who want to make a good showing in the
                flesh that would compel you to be
                circumcised...<br />
                ...they desire to have you circumcised that they
                may glory in your flesh.<br />
                (Galatians 6:11, 13, Revised Standard Version)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Jesus was circumcised. Does this make it
            right?</h4>

            <p>Jesus was also wrapped in swaddling clothes and put
            in a manger (Luke 2: 7). This doesn't mean we have to
            wrap babies tightly in cloth and put them in animal
            feeding troughs or circumcise them. Jesus also had a
            crown of thorns forced onto his head and was crucified.
            (John 19). We don't do that to our children,
            either.</p>

            <p>It is better to take to heart what Jesus taught
            about circumcision and circumcisers.</p>

            <h4>What did Jesus teach about circumcision and
            circumcisers?</h4>

            <p>Jesus spoke about circumcision in the Temple in
            Jerusalem (John 7:14).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not
                because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye
                on the sabbath day circumcise a man. If a man on
                the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law
                of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me,
                because I have made a man every whit whole on the
                sabbath day? Judge not according to the appearance,
                but judge righteous judgment.<br />
                (John 7:22-24, King James Version)</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Or, from a modern version:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                ...why are you angry with me for making a man whole
                and complete on a sabbath? (Jerusalem Bible, John
                7:23.)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Jesus contrasted circumcision (cutting off
            foreskins) with his own healing, which made a man
            'whole and complete.' Jesus' conclusion, not to judge
            by appearances, also hit the mark, for his critics
            rejected those who were not circumcised.</p>

            <h4>But didn't Jesus just mean that he made the man
            completely well?</h4>

            <p>That is what you will read in most modern English
            translations. However, the Greek expression for making
            a man completely well could also be translated as
            making him completely whole. This meaning, with its
            powerful contrast with circumcision, came over easily
            in the King James Version. The Jerusalem Bible got this
            meaning across with 'making a man whole and complete'.
            Moffatt did it slightly differently:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>...are you enraged at me for curing, not
                cutting, the entire body of a man upon the
                sabbath?<br />
                (from John 6:23, Moffatt's translation, 1935)</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>A note in the Jerusalem and New Jerusalem Bibles
            claims that the Rabbis argued that circumcision 'heals'
            the penis so they were doing a little healing while
            Jesus was doing a big healing. The great Jewish sage,
            Moses Maimondes, rejected this line of argument:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty
                of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps
                diminishes the pleasure is indubitable. For if at
                birth this member has been made to bleed and has
                had its covering taken away from it, it must
                indubitably be weakened. (<i>from Moses Maimonides,
                "<a href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">The Guide
                of the Perplexed</a>", Part III, ch. 49</i>)</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Moses Maimondes would have seen and understood the
            contrast that Jesus made between <i>circumcising</i> a
            man and making a man completely <i>whole</i>.</p>

            <h4>What did the early church decide about
            circumcision?</h4>

            <p>Some were saying that Christians must follow the Law
            of Moses and be circumcised. Peter replied:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                Now therefore why are you putting God to the test
                by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that
                neither our ancestors nor we have been able to
                bear?<br />
                (Acts 15:10, New RSV)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The early church followed Peter, and all were
            welcome, circumcised or not. The early church
            <i>rejected</i> the ideas that Christians had to be
            circumcised and follow the Law of Moses.</p>

            <h4>What did Paul teach about circumcision?</h4>

            <p>Genesis 17:14 says that an uncircumcised man shall
            be 'cut off from his people' but Paul taught that those
            who accept circumcision are obliged to keep the whole
            law, and those who want to be justified by the law have
            cut themselves off from Christ (Galatians 5: 2-4).</p>

            <p>Paul confirmed that circumcision was <i>nothing</i>
            (Galatians 6:15) and Christ was <i>all</i> and <i>in
            all</i> (Colossians 3:11). Jeremiah had already taught
            that circumcision in other nations was uncircumcision
            (Jeremiah 9: 25-26).</p>

            <p>Paul advised people to accept their lot in life and
            not seek circumcision or uncircumcision, or slavery or
            freedom (1 Corinthians 7:17-24).</p>

            <p>Paul condemned people he described as <i>false
            believers</i> (Galatians 2:4). These people were
            pressuring Christians to become circumcised. Paul was
            so incensed by this that he said:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                I wish those who unsettle you would castrate
                themselves!<br />
                (Galatians 5: 12, New RSV)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Paul taught that Jesus accepts people as they are
            and does not ask them to become circumcised or
            uncircumcised to become Christian (Galatians 5: 6).
            Paul said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be
            saved...' (Acts 16: 31).</p>

            <h4>If Paul was against circumcision, why did he say
            that circumcision was of much advantage in every
            way?</h4>

            <p>That is how most translations read Romans 3: 1-2.
            However, it is not the only reading. Young's Literal
            Translation (1898) says:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>What, then, is the superiority of the Jew? or
                what the profit of the circumcision? much in every
                way; for first, indeed, that they were intrusted
                with the oracles of God.</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>At that time, the Jews were called 'the
            circumcision'. It could simply have been another way of
            referring to Jews. Paul's words explain themselves best
            in context. In the verse immediately before the one
            quoted above, Paul said that true circumcision was
            spiritual, not literal (Romans 2: 29). As for the
            profit or advantage of 'the circumcision', this came
            from the <i>oracles of God</i> that Jews were entrusted
            with.</p>

            <h4>Paul circumcised a man, but later he called
            circumcisers mutilators. Why?</h4>

            <p>Paul turned against circumcision. At first he gave
            in to pressure to circumcise Timothy (Acts 16: 1-4).
            (Timothy's mother was Jewish, so Timothy was Jewish by
            Jewish law.) However, Paul absolutely refused to
            circumcise Titus (Galatians 2:3) and opposed those
            false believers with fury. He wished they would
            castrate themselves, accusing them of wanting to make
            'a good showing in the flesh' and 'glorying in the
            flesh' (Galatians 6: 12-15, RSV). In Philippians he
            warned believers to beware those who mutilate the flesh
            (Philippians 3: 2). Finally, in Titus he says that
            'those of the circumcision' (from Crete) were
            'upsetting' or 'ruining' whole families and were in it
            for the money (Titus 1: 10-12). What he had found out
            about circumcisers changed his mind.</p>

            <h4>Was circumcision ever a Christian tradition?</h4>

            <p>Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant churches never
            adopted circumcision. Circumcision was condemned in <a
            href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/FLORENCE.HTM#5"
             target="_blank">The Ecumenical Council of Florence</a>
            on 4 February 1442. One exception was the Coptic Church
            in Egypt, and the Council condemned this practice
            amongst them. Routine infant circumcision never took
            off in Europe but circumcision enthusiasts promoted it
            in English-speaking countries from the late Victorian
            era. As a result, some Christians have been misled into
            believing that Christianity recommends circumcision.
            This is simply not true.</p>

            <h4>Does the Bible ever say that circumcision has
            health benefits?</h4>

            <p>No. The Bible never makes such a claim. Jewish
            authorities hesitate to circumcise a baby if two
            previous sons had died from circumcision. Even today,
            circumcisions lead to haemorrhages, infections and
            sometimes even death.</p>

            <p>The Apostle Peter said that circumcision and the
            Jewish law were an unbearable burden. He was a married
            man and he lived before aseptic surgery, blood
            transfusions and antibiotics. Did he or someone close
            to him lose a child to circumcision? We don't know.
            What we know is that the first church council supported
            Peter, and not the circumcision enthusiasts. (Acts 15:
            10)</p>

            <h4>What does the Bible say to parents who are in
            conflict over circumcision?</h4>

            <p>In 2001, a young Kansas woman was convinced that God
            wanted her to have her son circumcised. Her husband was
            adamant that his son would remain intact and took legal
            action to protect the baby. The marriage fell apart in
            a blaze of publicity. (Wichita Eagle, <a
            href="/news/wichitaeagle07-13-01/">13</a> &amp; <a
            href="/news/wichitaeagle07-24-01/">25</a> July
            2001)</p>

            <p>The couple's pastor had tried to get the father to
            agree to circumcision.</p>

            <p>One wonders what the Apostle Paul would have said to
            this pastor! He described those pushing circumcision
            as:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>... rebellious people, idle talkers and
                deceivers, especially those of the circumcision;
                they must be silenced, since they are upsetting
                whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it
                is not right to teach. It was one of them, their
                very own prophet, who said,</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    "Cretans are always liars, vicious brutes, lazy
                    gluttons."
                  </blockquote>
                </blockquote>

                <p>That testimony is true. For this reason rebuke
                them sharply, so that they may become sound in the
                faith, not paying attention to Jewish myths or to
                commandments of those who reject the truth.<br />
                (Titus 1:10-14, New RSV)</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>What about those who urge others to circumcise
            their children?</h4>

            <p>Some believe in circumcision because of what they
            have been told. Christians should consider Paul's
            words:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                God put every different part of the body, just as
                he wanted it to be.<br />
                (Good News Bible, 1 Corinthians 12: 18)
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>

            <p>If Christians take this to heart they will have
            strength to resist the circumcision enthusiasts. As
            someone said to a knife-happy doctor, 'God knows best
            how to make little boys.'</p>
