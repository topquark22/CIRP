      <h1 class="head1">What the Bible Reveals About<br />
       Circumcision and Sexual Violence</h1>

      <h4>by Michael Glass</h4>

      <p class="norm">Some think that all the Bible says about
      circumcision is to order it to be done. Not so! The Bible
      makes it clear that circumcision only applied to Jews, to
      their slaves and to converts to Judaism (Gen. 17:10-14, Exod.
      12:48). All other peoples were described as uncircumcised,
      even those who practised circumcision (Jer. 9:25-26).
      Circumcision never applied to Christians (Acts 15:5-11), and
      anyone who doubts this should read Acts 15 and the letter of
      Paul to the Galatians carefully, noting how and why these
      passages say that circumcision is not needed.</p>

      <p class="norm">The New Testament is hostile to those who
      pushed circumcision on others. It insists that circumcision
      is not needed and questions the motives of those who were
      promoting it<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>. In the Hebrew
      Bible there is also an enormous difference between the
      commands to circumcise, and what the rest of the Hebrew Bible
      reveals about this practice.</p>

      <p class="norm">The difference between the law and other
      Hebrew Scriptures is not just confined to circumcision.
      Hebrew Law allows slavery, but the cry `Let my people go'
      (Exod. 5-14) gave courage and inspiration for slaves to seek
      freedom. The Law says nothing against polygamy, but the Bible
      vividly pictures the misery that flowed from such
      arrangements (Gen. 16:3-6, 30:1-22, 1 Sam. 1:1-11). The Law
      occasionally appears to render women almost powerless, as in
      the text that allows a man to sell his daughter into slavery
      (Exod. 21:7-11)<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>, but stories in
      the Bible give overwhelming evidence of how powerful ancient
      women could be<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>. Similarly,
      while Hebrew Law commands circumcision for Jews and their
      slaves, the circumcision stories in the Jewish scriptures
      confront us with darker aspects of the practice.</p>

      <p class="norm">There is a great gulf between Jewish ethics
      and the stories we shall examine. Jewish ethics prohibit `the
      torture or causing of pain to any living creature'<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup>. `It is a violation of Torah law to
      physically assault or harm another person' (Exod.
      21:18-27)<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>. Exodus 20:13
      prohibits stealing. Jews also have a moral obligation to help
      those who are helpless<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>. Jewish
      law says the human body must not be cut or marked (Lev.
      19:28)<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>. Indeed, as some Jewish
      critics of circumcision have commented, these rules would
      appear to be at odds with the requirement to circumcise. They
      are certainly at odds with the actions described in the
      stories that follow.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>The Hundred Foreskin Dowry</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">This is the most notorious circumcision story
      in the Bible. However, to understand it, we need some
      background information about the people involved. When David
      slew the giant Goliath, the captain of the army took him to
      King Saul. Immediately, Jonathan, Saul's son and heir, formed
      a relationship with David.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`When David had finished speaking to
          Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of
          David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Saul took
          him that day and would not let him return to his father's
          house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because
          he loved him as his own soul. Jonathan stripped himself
          of the robe that he was wearing, and gave it to David,
          and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his
          belt.'<br />
          (1 Sam. 18:1-4, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">David is described as the man after God's own
      heart (see 1 Sam. 13:14, Acts 13:22). It does not contradict
      this to point out that David's adversaries saw him in quite a
      different light. We do not have to agree with their
      assessment of David. Nevertheless, their comments show what
      they thought of him and help to explain the actions that
      followed.</p>

      <p class="norm">David's first great adversary, Goliath, said
      to him:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Am I a <i>dog</i>, that you come to me
          with <i>sticks</i>?'</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">and</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Come to me, and I will give your
          <i>flesh</i> to the birds of the air and to the wild
          animals of the field.' (<i>emphasis added</i>)<br />
           (1 Sam. 17:43-44, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm"><i>Dog</i> was the name given to male
      prostitutes. (Deut. 23:18) <i>Stick</i> or <i>staff</i> is a
      word that Strong's Concordance links with the meaning `to
      germinate' (word 4731). Flesh is also used as a euphemism for
      the penis (Lev. 15:2-3)<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>. If
      even some of these meanings carried over into Goliath's
      insult, they would give it even more bite.</p>

      <p class="norm">Michal, the bride whose dowry was those
      Philistine foreskins, commented about David's behaviour when
      he danced before the LORD wearing only an ephod (a short
      apron).</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`How the king of Israel honored himself
          today before the eyes of his servants' maids, as any
          vulgar fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!'<br />
           (2 Sam. 6:20, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The withering sarcasm of this attack helped
      to cause to a complete estrangement between the couple (2
      Sam. 6:21-23).</p>

      <p class="norm">We do not have to to agree with what Goliath
      or David's wife thought or said about David. However, to
      understand why Michal's dowry was set at a hundred Philistine
      foreskins, we need to understand what King Saul thought of
      the relationship between his son Jonathan and David. We know
      what he thought of their friendship because of his accusation
      to Jonathan:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Do I not know that you have chosen the
          son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your
          mother's nakedness?'<br />
          (1 Sam. 20:30, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Clearly, Saul saw the relationship between
      the two men as shameful. <i>Nakedness</i> is a word used in
      Leviticus to describe forbidden sexual relationships, (Lev.
      18:6-19 ). It sounds like a direct accusation of sexual
      misconduct. Certainly, Jonathan took it as a humiliating
      attack on both him and David.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Jonathan rose from the table in fierce
          anger and ate no food on the second day of the month, for
          he was grieved for David, and because his father had
          disgraced him.'<br />
          (1 Sam. 20:34, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">When Saul offered David his daughter's hand
      in marriage, he said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`The king desires no marriage present,
          except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines...'<br />
          (1 Sam. 18:25, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The text acknowledges one reason for this
      extraordinary request:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`...Saul planned to make David fall by
          the hand of the Philistines.'<br />
          <i>from</i> (1 Sam. 18:25, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Saul's desire for a dowry of foreskins was
      clearly sexual bait. Of course, there was the girl and the
      prospect of a good marriage. However, there is also the
      question whether Saul tempted David with slicing off
      foreskins because he thought it would appeal to David's
      sexual tastes.</p>

      <p class="norm">As it turned out, David turned the tables on
      Saul in a spectacular way.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`David arose and went, along with his
          men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines; and David
          brought their foreskins, which were given in full number
          to the king, that he might become the king's
          son-in-law.'<br />
          (1 Sam 18:27, RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">This double measure of foreskins, given in
      full number, both obeys and mocks the command of King Saul.
      It is macabre and grisly. It has as much to do with sex as
      with violence.</p>

      <p class="norm">This story has shocked and appalled
      generations of Bible readers but it is not without
      significance. The indecent interest in male genitals
      displayed in this story can be seen even in medical
      literature. One doctor was quoted as saying: `[C]ircumcision
      is a beautification comparable to rhinoplasty, and a
      circumcised penis appears in its flaccid state as an erect
      uncircumcised organ - a beautiful instrument of precise
      intent.'<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Two other medical
      writers said: `While the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis
      can be retracted, the circumcised penis exists in exposed
      beauty whether flaccid or erect.'<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> In 1942, a prominent New Zealand
      doctor commented that some itinerant nurses `appear to
      collect foreskins with the same enthusiasm as the Red Indians
      did scalps.' because of the way they persuaded parents to get
      their boys circumcised by the doctors.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup>. A Minister for Tourism in Malaysia
      wished to promote circumcision ceremonies to tourists as
      `something different'<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>. On the
      net, web sites appealing to those with that particular fetish
      even present stories of forced circumcision as a way to
      titillate readers<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="norm">Though we might find it appalling and
      indecent, circumcision raids do happen. The book of Maccabees
      tells us that Mattathias and his friends forcibly circumcised
      all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of
      Israel (1 Macc. 2:45). `At Srirangapatnam [Mysore, India] in
      the 1780s perhaps three hundred British troops, and probably
      more, were physically subdued, drugged, circumcised, fitted
      with silver earrings which they believed marked them out as
      slaves, and drawn into Mysore's service as soldiers and
      artisans.'<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Uncircumcised New
      Zealand born Samoan, Tongan and Niuean boys are at risk of
      being seized by `raiding parties' of relatives and forcibly
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>. On the Island
      of Ambon in Indonesia, Islamic fanatics forcibly circumcised
      men, women and children as recently as 2001<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="norm">Such actions demonstrate the hostility some
      feel towards those who still have their foreskins. This
      hostility was common amongst the early Hebrews (Genesis
      17:14, Judges 14:3, 2 Samuel 1:20). Saul certainly felt this
      way (1 Sam. 31:4) and Saul knew that this hatred was shared
      by David (1 Samuel 17: 26, 36). It is also reflected in the
      command to circumcise:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Any uncircumcised male who is not
          circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off
          from his people; he has broken my covenant.'<br />
          (Gen. 17:14, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Note how this punishment is directed towards
      the child with the foreskin rather than the parents who left
      him intact.</p>

      <p class="norm">Modern psychology explains the reaction.
      Circumcision involves the loss of sexually sensitive tissue
      <sup><a href="#n17">17, 18</a></sup>. The presence of men or
      boys with foreskins is a constant reminder to the circumcised
      that they have lost something, and this can generate an urge
      to deprive others of their foreskins, too<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup>. A similar explanation is as old as
      Aesop, in the story of the fox who lost his tail<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup>. The poor fox was teased so badly
      that he devised a scheme. He called a meeting of the foxes
      and advised them all to get rid of their tails, too. Life, he
      said, was better without the encumbrance of a tail! They, of
      course, saw through his ruse straight away.</p>

      <p class="norm">The story of the foreskin dowry points to a
      truth that the New Testament also alludes to: the sexual
      element in this mania to circumcise.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>Mass Circumcision before a
      Massacre</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">One of the Bible's best-known circumcision
      stories is the mass circumcision at Gilgal, the hill of the
      foreskins <sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup>. It says that
      Joshua revived the custom of circumcision, which had fallen
      into disuse under Moses' leadership (Josh. 5:2-9). The
      passage notes that the circumcised warriors who left Egypt
      had all died on the way (Josh. 5:4). The reference to
      circumcised <i>warriors</i> links this mass circumcision with
      the violence that followed.</p>

      <p class="norm">Jericho's walls came tumbling down (Josh.
      6:20) and this is trumpeted in story and song. The massacre
      that followed is not greatly publicized:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Then they devoted to destruction by the
          edge of the sword all in the city, both men and women,
          young and old, oxen, sheep and donkeys.'<br />
          (Josh. 6:21, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The past century has seen too many pogroms,
      too many slaughters, too many massacres, too many killing
      fields, too much `ethnic cleansing,' too much of the `final
      solution' not to know what to call this. Its name is
      <i>genocide</i><sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="norm">However, the prostitute who sheltered the
      Hebrew spies was spared (Josh. 6:25).</p>

      <p class="norm">Once again circumcision is linked with
      violence, and there is a disturbing sexual undertone to the
      story.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>The Slaughter of the
      Shechemites</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">This story is often called `The Rape of
      Dinah' though we cannot be completely sure that it was a
      rape. Dinah went out to see the women of the area:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`...when Shechem the son of Hamor the
          Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and
          lay with her, and defiled her.'<br />
          (Gen. 34:2, King James Version)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Yes he took her. Yes he lay with her. Yes he
      defiled her; that is, he took her virginity and so reduced
      her status. However, it is an open question whether she was
      raped or seduced.</p>

      <p class="norm">Nevertheless, one thing is clear, the anger
      of Dinah's brothers.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`When they heard of it, the men were
          indignant and very angry, because he had committed an
          outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for
          such a thing ought not to be done.'<br />
          (Gen. 34:7 New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The outrage for these men was that Shechem
      had intercourse with their sister. As the text says, such a
      thing ought not to be done. However, rape is not mentioned.
      The brothers were concerned about the loss of their sister's
      `honour'&mdash;and theirs<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="norm">Hamor, Shechem's father, admitted that his
      son was in the wrong in having deflowered Dinah. He offered
      to pay whatever price the sons of Jacob demanded for Dinah's
      marriage. This offer exceeded the requirements in the Torah
      for the seduction of a virgin (Exod. 22:16-17). It therefore
      suggests honour and good faith on the part of Hamor and his
      family, and respect for Dinah, herself. In addition, the sons
      of Jacob were offered an alliance and a merging of the two
      groups (Gen. 34:8-12). Significantly, it was Jacob's sons who
      replied to this offer, and not Jacob, the girl's father.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and
          his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled
          their sister Dinah.'<br />
          (Gen. 34:13, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The passage admits the deceit, but explains
      it as a reaction to the `defilement' of their sister. Their
      expressed concern about the foreskins of the townsmen was
      feigned. The show of good faith by the Shechemites registered
      with them as a weakness to exploit.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`They said to them, "We cannot do this
          thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised for
          that would be a disgrace to us. Only on this condition
          will we consent to you: that you will become as we are
          and every male among you be circumcised. Then we will
          give our daughters to you, and we will take your
          daughters for ourselves, and we will live among you and
          become one people. But if you will not listen to us and
          be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be
          gone."'<br />
          (Gen. 34:14-17, New RSV)</p>

      <p class="norm">The Shechemites were disarmed by this
      approach, agreed to it and were circumcised without delay.
      The sons of Jacob must also have had some regard for Shechem,
      for they said that he was more honourable than all the
      household of his father (Gen. 34:19). Not that this stopped
      what happened next:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`On the third day, when they were still
          in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi,
          Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the
          city unawares, and killed all the males. They killed
          Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah
          out of Shechem's house, and went away.'<br />
          (Gen. 34:25-26, New RSV)</p>

      <p class="norm">Having now slaughtered all the males in the

      <blockquote>

          <p class="quote">`And the other sons of Jacob came upon
          the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister
          had been defiled. They took their flocks and their herds,
          their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the
          field.'<br />

      <p class="norm">We cannot be sure if Dinah was seduced,
      coerced or raped. We do know that Shechem was conceded to be
      the most honourable of his group, that he fell in love with
      Dinah, and that she was valued by his family. We now discover
      that the women and the children of the city became prey to
      the vengeful brothers.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">If we suspect that Shechem was a rapist, then
      the same suspicion hangs over Jacob's sons.</p>

      <p class="norm">Jacob, who apparently played no part in the
      negotiations about his own daughter, was most perturbed by
      what happened. His reaction shows that his sons behaved
      appallingly by the standards of their time, let alone ours.
      He must have been aware that his passivity had contributed to
      this situation. Perhaps that explains why he expressed his
      concerns in pragmatic rather than moral terms.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`"You have brought trouble on me by

          household."'<br />
          (Gen. 34:30 New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The sons respond by going for the high moral
      ground:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`"Should our sister be treated like a

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">This stinging rebuke carries an implicit
      criticism of Jacob's negligence as a parent. Jacob's concern
      about his sons' violence was thus dismissed. It mattered as
      little to Jacob's sons as the good faith that Hamor and his
      clan showed to them, and which the sons so cynically
      exploited and betrayed. After destroying the household gods
      and hiding the booty, (Gen. 35:3-4) Jacob and his sons left
      Shechem. The account then says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`As they journeyed, a terror from God
          fell upon the cities all around them, so that no one
          pursued them.'<br />
          (Gen. 35:5, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">This unsavoury episode, with its deceit and
      betrayal, its mass circumcision and the massacre that
      followed, shows that the circumcisions were a preparation for
      and a foretaste of the violence that followed. The incident
      reflects badly on Jacob who was shown to be negligent in
      supervising and guiding both his daughter and his sons. As
      for the sons, it is a scathing inditement of both their
      behaviour and their mindset. There is also a sexual element
      in their violence that raises unsettling questions about
      their underlying motives in circumcising and then
      slaughtering all the men of this village and making a prey of
      the women and children who remained.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>Zipporah's Encounter with Yahweh (the
      LORD)</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">The story of Moses, Zipporah and Yahweh also
      shows a connection between circumcision, violence and sex.
      The violence is obvious:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`And it came to pass on the way in the
          lodging place, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill
          him. Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin
          of her son, and made it touch his feet, and said, Surely
          a bridegroom of blood art thou to me. So he let him
          alone: then she said, A bridegroom of blood <i>art
          thou</i>, because of the circumcision.'<br />
          (Exod. 4:24-26, RV, 1884, margin)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The text of the King James Version and the
      Revised Version read: `cast it at his feet.' The more literal
      `made it touch his feet' was relegated to the margin of the
      Revised Version, probably for reasons of decency. You see, in
      Hebrew, <i>feet</i> was used as a euphemism for the genitals.
      Hence this rendering:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Zipporah picked up a sharp flint, cut
          off her son's, foreskin, and touched Moses' genitals with
          it...'<br />
          (Exod. 4:25, Revised English Bible)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The Hebrew did not specify if it was Moses'
      or Yahweh's feet that were touched, and it did not specify
      how we should take the word <i>feet</i>. The Revised English
      Bible accepts that the word <i>feet</i> refers to the
      genitals. However, it interpolates Moses' name as the one
      whose genitals were touched with the newly severed foreskin.
      To say it was Yahweh or to leave it to the reader to decide
      was apparently not an option for them.</p>

      <p class="norm">There is another sexual reference in the
      passage. Zipporah calls Moses a `bridegroom of blood.' This
      expression is used in modern day tribal circumcisions in the
      Near East. Raphael Patai says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Zipporah's expression, `hatan damim'
          (bridegroom of blood), derived from the same Semitic root
          verb which in its Hebrew form means to perform marriage,
          while in its Arabic form it denotes to perform
          circumcision. More than that, in several localities in
          the Middle East, folk custom retained the older, more
          primitive, form of circumcision in which it was a part or
          a preliminary of the marriage ceremony.'<sup><a
          href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Once again, a circumcision story is full of
      violence and explicit sexual references. The passage, which
      stands apart from the rest of the story of the call of
      Moses<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>, presents Yahweh as a
      violent demonic figure. The connection with other Middle East
      customs shows that the sexual connection with circumcision
      was far more than coincidental.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>The First Circumcision and its
      aftermath</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">The connection between violence, sex and
      circumcision can also be seen in the account of the first
      circumcision and what followed.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and
          all the slaves born in his house or bought with his
          money, every male among the men of Abraham's house and he
          circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day,
          as God had said to him. Abraham was ninety-nine years old
          when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And
          his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was
          circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. That very day
          Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised; and all the
          men of his house, slaves born in the house and those
          bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with
          him.'<br />
          (Gen. 17:23-27, New RSV.)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The literal rendition, given above, with its
      repetitive references to circumcision and the pointed and
      repeated references to the <i>flesh</i> of the foreskin is
      too much for many modern speech versions. They contrive to
      limit or omit this feature of the text. <i>The Bible for
      Today</i>, (Contemporary English Version) reshapes it
      thus:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`On that same day Abraham obeyed God by
          circumcising Ishmael. Abraham was also circumcised, and
          so were all other men and boys in his household,
          including his servants and slaves. He was 99 years old at
          the time, and his son Ishmael was 13.' (Gen. 17:23-27,
          Contemporary English Version)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Repetitive references to circumcision, and
      all references to the <i>flesh</i> of the foreskin have been
      removed. What remains, however, is still significant. Readers
      may have noticed the emphasis on the fact that Ishmael was 13
      when he was circumcised, a sensitive age for any boy. Because
      it mentions the ages of both Abraham and Ishmael this passage
      has been used as an ideological tool to promote circumcision
      to young and old.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>Ishmael, after the circumcision</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">Ishmael is not only known for being
      circumcised at 13. There is another story about him that has
      troubled commentators ever since. It can put his circumcision
      in quite a different light.</p>

      <p class="norm">It is unusual for the Hebrew Scriptures to
      note the age of someone, except at their death. Ishmael is an
      exception. The fact that he was circumcised at 13 must have
      been of some importance. Part of this may have been connected
      with what followed.</p>

      <p class="norm">In this account, Ishmael is not referred to
      by name, and the Hebrew text bears the mark of censorship at
      a crucial point. Versions we read today sound innocent
      enough:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`The child [Isaac] grew, and was weaned;
          and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was
          weaned. But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom
          she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. So
          she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave woman with her
          son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit
          along with my son Isaac." The matter was very distressing
          to Abraham on account of his son.'<br />
          (Gen. 21:8-11, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">You may think that this is only a question of
      inheritance. Sarah didn't want a rival for her son and was
      determined to get rid of Ishmael, Abraham's firstborn. After
      all she said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">"Drive out this slavegirl and her son,
          for the slavegirl's son shall not inherit with my son,
          with Isaac."<br />
           (Gen. 21:10 in Robert Alter, <i>Genesis Translation and
          Commentary</i>, W.W Norton &amp; Company, New York, 1996,
          p. 99)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Also, when God reassured Abraham about
      sending the slavegirl and her son away he specifically
      said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`"...it is through Isaac that offspring
          shall be named for you"'<br />
          (Gen 21:12, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">However, there is another straw in the wind.
      An astute reader may wonder why the words `with her son
      Isaac' should be missing from the Hebrew<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup>. This is, in fact, an important
      clue, that we will return to later. However, God having
      reassured Abraham that all will be well with both of his
      sons, gives this command:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">"...whatever Sarah says to you, do as
          she tells you..."<br />
          (Gen. 21:12, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`And Abraham rose early in the morning
          and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar,
          placing them on her shoulder, and he gave her the child,
          and sent her away. And she went wandering through the
          wilderness of Beersheba.' (Gen. 21:14, Robert Alter's
          translation)<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">The consequences of this appeared to be
      grim:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`When the water in the skin was gone,
          she cast the child under one of the bushes.'<br />
           (Gen. 21:15, New RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">'Cast' means <i>throw</i>. You might think
      this is a mistake but Robert Alter says it is an
      understatement. His translation is that `she <i>flung</i> the
      child!.'</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="norm">`...she flung the child under one of the
          bushes and went off and sat down at a distance, a bowshot
          away, for she thought, "Let me not see when the child
          dies."'<br />
          (Gen. 21:15-16, Robert Alter's translation) <sup><a
          href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Here was a child whose stepmother had cast
      him out, whose father had sent him away, and whose own mother
      had flung him aside. Would anyone hear him and defend him?
      The Bible gives a very clear answer:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`And God heard the voice of the
          lad...'<br />
          (Gen. 21: 17, Robert Alter's translation) <sup><a
          href="#n29">29</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">Note what it says. God heard the voice of the
      <i>lad</i> . Not his mother, not his father, <i>God</i> heard
      the voice of the boy himself, the boy whose own mother had
      distanced herself from him with such force. This fact is
      crucial in the whole story. Ishmael means <i>God
      hears</i>.</p>

      <p class="norm">But why did his own mother treat him with
      such hostility? There is a clue in that innocent-sounding
      word, `play.' The word, as Alter explains, can refer to
      mocking or joking, but most often refers to sexual dalliance.
      He argues against a sexual interpretation, because it would
      be `homosexual.' I believe that this misses the point. I
      believe the passage alludes to sex play between an older and
      younger child, which is distasteful, but clearly
      credible.</p>

      <p class="norm">Of course, Sarah had a history of acting
      harshly towards Hagar, and had sent her away once before
      (Gen. 16:6). This time, however, God was on Sarah's side, and
      told Abraham to listen to his wife. If there was sex play
      between an older and much younger child it makes good sense
      to separate them. God's instruction, therefore, was not
      arbitrary or inexplicable, but exactly what we would
      recommend today in this situation.</p>

      <p class="norm">Hagar did treat her son harshly when she
      flung him away. However, if your older son had been caught
      playing sexually with a three-year-old, and you and your son
      had been thrown out into the desert as a result, your
      reaction might be the same.</p>

      <p class="norm">See how this detail clicks into place in the
      story. Ishmael was playing sexually with Isaac, and Sarah
      caught him at it. No wonder she was so furious! No wonder God
      supported her demand that the children be separated! No
      wonder Hagar acted with such harshness towards her own
      son!</p>

      <p class="norm">It also explains why the phrase `with his
      brother Isaac' was cut from the Masoretic text. In Hebrew
      there is no getting away from the sexual implications in the
      word <i>play</i>. The Masoretes, shocked at the thought that
      the patriarch Isaac was sexually abused, cut the words from
      the text. If Ishmael played like that, better that he play
      with himself rather than with the chosen one, Isaac! The only
      way we know that Ishmael was interfering with Isaac was
      because translations of the Hebrew Scriptures were made
      before the Masoretes did their work, and the missing words
      were preserved in them.</p>

      <p class="norm">However, this story tells us that though
      Sarah threw Ishmael out and his own mother thrust him aside,
      God did not abandon him. It says that God was with the lad
      and heard his cry and that the boy grew up to be a skilled
      bowman. His mother found him a wife from Egypt, her country,
      (Gen. 21:17-21) and he became the father of a nation. The
      last we hear of Ishmael in the Bible is that he was present
      at his father's burial (Gen. 25:9) that he had 12 sons who
      all did well, and that he died at the age of 137 (Gen.
      25:12-18).</p>

      <p class="norm">By tackling the most confronting implications
      of this story head on we can see that it contains a profound
      insight into the human condition. For believers, it gives
      even more, a powerful picture of how the love of God reaches
      out to protect both those who are abused but also to the
      abuser as well. It therefore contains a message of hope, that
      those involved in aberrant sexual behaviour can change.
      Perhaps this was an instance of `tough love' in action.</p>

      <p class="norm">And the circumcision connection? Ishmael was
      circumcised at the sensitive age of 13 and this could help
      account for his subsequent actions towards his younger
      brother. There are several accounts of the sexual stimulation
      of adolescents or young men undergoing circumcision even
      apart from plainly pornographic sources<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup>. There are also explicit warnings
      about a sexual involvement in circumcision in the New
      Testament <sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="norm">Once again, a Bible story shows us a
      connection between circumcision, aberrant sexuality and
      violence. This time, however, it comes with a message of hope
      for all concerned.</p>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>Insights from Modern Psychology</i></h3>

      <p class="norm">Modern psychology has something to say on the
      relationship between circumcision, violence and twisted
      sexual urges.</p>

      <p class="norm">Rhinehart<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
      recounted the traumatic effects of circumcision on some
      patients and argued that the trauma of circumcision can have
      profound and deleterious effects on the individual and even
      on society. B. A. van der Kolk<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> gave an extensive array of evidence
      to show that those who have suffered trauma are more likely
      to re-enact the trauma or to inflict the same trauma on
      others. Cansever<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> studied the
      effects of childhood circumcision on Turkish boys and
      reported many detrimental effects, including an increase in
      aggressive behaviour. Prescott <sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> showed evidence of a link between
      traumatic events at birth and an increased incidence of self
      destructive behaviour. He said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`<b>It is this developmental
          neuropsychologist's conviction that these early
          experiences of genital pain contribute to the encoding of
          the brain for sado-masochistic behaviors</b>, that men
          who experience genital pain and loss of pleasure as a
          result of circumcision are encoded for sado-masochistic
          disorders.' (author's emphasis)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="head3"><i>Conclusion</i></h3>

      <p class="norm"><i>Every one</i> of these accounts shows a
      connection between circumcision, violence and aberrant sexual
      behaviour. Psychologists and psychoanalysts have noted the
      same links between circumcision and violent or sexually
      deviant behaviour. Indeed some of their comments can read as
      if they were made in response to some of the Biblical
      stories. The Apostle Paul in the New Testament also noted the
      same connection between circumcision and the sexual
      involvement of those who pushed it on others. He said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`...they desire to have you circumcised
          that they may glory in your flesh.'<br />
          (Gal. 5:13, RSV)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil
          workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!'
          Philippians 3: 2, New RSV</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="norm">As noted before, the word <i>dog</i> was used
      in Hebrew to describe a male prostitute. (Deut. 23:18)</p>

      <p class="norm">Paul's opinion of circumcisers and their
      motivation would have been influenced by his reading of the
      Hebrew Scriptures as well as his own personal
      observation.</p>

      <p class="norm">What are we to do with the circumcision
      stories and accounts in the Hebrew Scriptures? We cannot use
      them as models of behaviour. Nor are they put forward as
      such. When the Bible shows us people, it shows them warts and
      all. This is how it reveals the psychology of those involved
      in circumcision so vividly, why Biblical insights are so
      applicable today and why the parallels between these Bible
      stories and the psychological literature are so striking.</p>

      <p class="norm">Both Jewish and Christian Scriptures show
      clear evidence of a link between circumcision and both
      violence and aberrant sexual behaviour. It is a warning that
      we should take to heart because it is still relevant
      today.</p>

      <p><small>I am indebted to George Hill for drawing attention
      to the parallels between these stories and modern
      psychological explanations for their actions and to Frederick
      Hodges and Van Lewis for other valuable input. I would like
      to thank them and others for all their valuable comments and
      suggestions.</small></p>

      <a id="n3" name="n3"></a> 3. Examples of strong women abound
      in the Bible. There is the perfect wife (Prov. 31:11-31), the
      heroine Esther (Esther 3-7), the forthrightness of
      Sarai/Sarah in family matters (Gen. 16:1-15, 21:1-13),
      Rebecca's scheming (Gene. 27:1-29, 27:41-28:5), Leah and
      Rachel's contest for their husband's love and for children
      (Gen. 29:31-30: 24), the ruthless determination of Lot's
      daughters to achieve parenthood (Gen. 19:30-38) and also that
      of Tamar (Gen. 38). There is the viciousness of Potiphar's
      wife (Gen. 39: 1-20) but also the wit and courage of the
      Hebrew midwives in Egypt (Exod. 1:8-22), the courage of
      Moses' sister (Exod. 2: 1-10) and the assertiveness of the
      daughters of Zelophehad in defence of their rights (Numbers
      27: 1-11), even though their rights were watered down because
      of tribal interests (Numbers 36: 1-12). There was Rahab's
      action to save both herself and her family (Josh. 2, &amp;
      6:20-25), the wise counsel of Deborah, the prophet and
      military leader (Jgs 4:1-16, 23) and the ruthlessness of Jael
      (Jgs 4:17-22). Delilah (Jgs 16:4-22) and Jezebel (1 Kgs.
      19:1-3, 21:1-29) were also powerful and ruthless operators,
      and Jezebel showed herself to be brave in facing death (2
      Kgs. 9:30-37).<br />

      especially likely to occur if an uncircumcised boy visits his
      ancestral homeland, but there have been instances of it in
      New Zealand. See Nick Smith, `Foreskin's Lament,

      <a id="n21" name="n21"></a> 21. For the Children of Israel,
      Gilgal was a historic site, but it became a place of
      notoriety rather than fame. It was here that the Gibeonites
      deceived the Israelites into making a binding treaty with
      them not to massacre the people (Josh. 9: 3-27). It was at
      Gilgal that Saul offered a burnt offering without the
      presence of the prophet, Samuel (1 Sam. 13:9). When Samuel
      found out, he told Saul that because of his rashness his
      kingdom would pass to another (1 Sam. 13:10-14). The later
      prophets condemned Gilgal as a place of wickedness (Hos.
      9:15, 12:11, Amos 4:4, 5:5)<br />
      <a id="n22" name="n22"></a> 22. The same fate awaited Ai
      (Josh. 8:21-26), Makkedah (Josh. 10:28), Libnah (Josh.
      10:29-30), Lachish (Josh. 10:32), Gezer (Josh. 10:33), Eglon
      (Josh. 10:34-35), Hebron (Josh. 10:36-37), Debir (Josh.
      10:38-39), Merom (Josh. 11:6-9) and Hazor (Josh.
      11:10-12).<br />
      <a id="n23" name="n23"></a> 23. A non-virginal sister would
      be `damaged goods' and therefore much harder to marry
      off.<br />
      <a id="n24" name="n24"></a> 24. Raphael Patai, <i>Family,

      <a id="n25" name="n25"></a> 25. The story of the call of
      Moses (Exod., Chapters 3 and 4) tells us that Moses had two
      sons (Exod. 4:20) and in it, Moses was told to tell Pharaoh
      that the LORD would slay Pharaoh's firstborn son (Exod.
      4:21-23). However, Exodus 4:24-26, mentions only one son, and
      in this passage the LORD threatens to slay Moses' son. This
      apparent inconsistency could suggest that Exodus 4:24-26 had
      a different origin from the rest of the story of the call of
      Moses.<br />
      <a id="n26" name="n26"></a> 26. A marginal note in many
      editions of the Bible would alert readers to the fact that
      `with his brother Isaac' was missing from the Hebrew.<br />

       <a id="n30" name="n30"></a> 30. There can be a sexual
      component in the circumcision of an adolescent or adult. One
      website has an account of the the stimulation to erection of
      a man undergoing a ritual circumcision. See JA's account
      in<br />
      &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/Davock/menspeak2.html"
      target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/Davock/menspeak2.html</a>&gt;.
      Another example is the cooing nurse whose manner stirred the
      sexual feelings of a 13 year old boy immediately before his
      circumcision , Jeremy Jusay panel 7<br />

      target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/ny/karassnyc/panel_09.html</a>&gt;.
      An involuntary erection can also happen during a forcible
      circumcision. An example of this is recorded in J. Bigelow,
      <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</i>, Hourglass Book Publishing,
      California, 1995, pages 11 and 13 [in `Men's Voices...']
      Circlist, a sexually charged website that promotes
      circumcision, has many stories of this.<br />
       <a id="n31" name="n31"></a> 31. When Paul found out that the
      Galatians were turning to the Jewish law (and to
      circumcision) he accused them of starting with the Spirit and
      then turning to the flesh (Gal. 3:3). Then, after warning the
      Galatians not to gratify the desires of the flesh (Gal. 5:16)
      Paul says `It is those who want to make a good showing in the
      flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised' (Gal. 6:12)
      and `They want you to be circumcised so that they may boast
      about your flesh' (Gal. 6:13). See also Phil. 3:2 where Paul
      warns the Philippians against `the mutilation,' and describes
      those who push it as dogs and evil workers.<br />
