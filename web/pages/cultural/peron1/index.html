        Parents in the United States must wrestle with the
        circumcision decision when blessed with the birth of a male
        child. In no other nation are parents pressured to make
        this decision. Let us review the subject of routine infant
        circumcision as it addresses Christian Parents.

      <h3><i>Circumcision in the Old Testament and New
      Testament:</i></h3>

      <p>Circumcision as defined in the Old Testament (Genesis 17)
      was a symbolic act of Covenant with God by which a Jewish
      male was entered into covenant with God. It required the
      participants in this covenant to accept and obediently follow
      sanctions and strict commandments. Circumcision became the
      "badge of membership" within the Covenant Community. It
      became the distinguishing mark of being a Jewish male.</p>

      <p>The picture changes in the New Testament. The covenant
      with God for Christians is through acceptance and belief in
      the redeeming grace of Jesus Christ. By this New Testament
      Covenant, Christians are enjoined not to submit to
      circumcision. Christian families are not bound to God through
      the mark of circumcision. As defined by the Apostle Paul,
      circumcision could be interpreted as contrary to the
      Christian faith and teachings. Although Paul speaks only with
      regard to religious ritual circumcision and could not have
      conceived of the practice of routine infant circumcision, it
      is uncanny how his statements in <a
      href="/pages/cultural/christian.html#TIT1">Titus Chapter 1,
      Verses 10-11</a> defines the situation today. Circumcision
      was not simply viewed as a sign of the Covenant Community,
      but was viewed as a sign of separation. It was the sine qua
      non of being a Son of Abraham in distinction to being a
      Christian.</p>

      <p>Everywhere circumcision is spoken of in the bible, it
      refers to religious or ritual circumcision. The bible does
      not address the issue of medical or routine circumcision as
      practiced in the United States. However, the rationale for
      much of Gentile circumcision in the United States is based on
      the belief that Jewish religious circumcision was adopted for
      health benefits. It is most important to point out that
      circumcision as a religious commitment of Covenant is not
      done for health benefit---a fact that is generally
      misunderstood by Jewish and non-Jewish people. This is not
      surprising since for years, the medical profession has been
      guilty of such misunderstanding and purposeful deception in
      attempting to find justification for this unnecessary and
      medically unjustified procedure. Thus, routine infant
      circumcision, from its very beginning, was postulated and
      fostered on the false premise that Jews enjoyed a variety of
      health benefits as a result of the practice of
      circumcision.</p>

      <h3><i>What does this mean for Christian parents?</i></h3>

      <p>For Christian parents, circumcision of newborn boys is not
      a religious issue. It is strictly a medical issue, which
      should not be routinely performed without very sound evidence
      of benefits. Any medical procedure performed on your child
      should be fully evaluated in light of your Christian
      obligation to love, protect, and nurture him. You need to be
      well informed.</p>

      <p>As Christian parents you need to be aware that no medical
      group in the world associated with child health supports the
      routine circumcision of male infants. In March 1999, the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> (AAP) made this quite clear stressing that
      they do not recommend the routine circumcision of male
      infants. They stated: "The purported medical benefits are not
      significant or compelling enough to make such a
      recommendation." Recently a large scale <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/1/S2/246"
       target="_blank">University of Washington study</a> concluded
      that routine infant circumcision provides no real health
      benefits. This is the second report in the past year that
      confirms circumcision is not medically warranted.</p>

      <p>You should not agree to circumcision of your newborn son
      unless and until you fully understand: (1) The nature of the
      operation; (2) the purpose of rationale of the operation; (3)
      the risks to your son [Editor's note: Not only the common
      risks but ALL of them. Press your doctor on this.]; (4) proof
      of benefits weighed against potential for physical,
      psychological, and sexual dysfunctional damage resulting from
      this unnecessary elective surgery.</p>

      <h3><i>The Social/Cultural Dimension:</i></h3>

      <p>Simply put, any practice that has been sanctioned for many
      years will eventually take on a social and cultural scope and
      rationale. Now that it has been clearly shown that routine
      circumcision is not a sound rational medical practice, we
      have those who would perpetuate the practice based on social
      and cultural arguments. Such arguments are numerous. Among
      them are; He should look like his father, his brother, or the
      neighbor boy. The desire to conform to social/cultural peer
      pressure. To perpetuate the "look" of a circumcised penis,
      arguing that it is more aesthetically pleasing. We just do it
      because it is the "American Way."</p>

      <p>We are no longer in the realm of sound medical
      consideration in our decision. These are not valid rational
      reasons to circumcise your newborn son. Rarely if ever, would
      there be a valid medical indication to perform a newborn
      circumcision. With rare exception, routine infant
      circumcision is "cosmetic surgery" in its truest sense.
      Christian parents, and especially those parents dedicated to
      natural birth, home birth, and a holistic approach to health
      and childcare, should have serious questions about any health
      care professional who would suggest routine infant
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The United States is the only country in the world that
      has practiced the routine circumcision of a large percentage
      of its male infants. No other developed country in the world
      routinely circumcises infants for non-religious reasons. No
      other developed country in the world routinely circumcises
      infants for non-religious reasons. Given this now confirmed
      lack of medical benefit and well documented evidence of
      potential damage, one has to wonder why hospitals in the
      United States continue to provide facilities for routine
      infant circumcision, solicit circumcision by presenting
      non-requested circumcision consent forms to every parent of a
      male newborn, and doctors - while agreeing to the lack of
      medical validity for infant circumcision will continue to
      circumcise newborns. If you were to suggest similar routine
      cosmetic genital surgery for a female child, you and the
      doctor who would consent to perform it would be in violation
      of state and federal statutes. Why then, is this routine
      cosmetic surgery even possible with regard to a male
      child?</p>

      <p>Christian parents should not buy into this "American
      custom." Circumcision is a surgical procedure performed on an
      hours-old infant who has minimal ability to ward off
      infection or loss of blood. It is very painful, and subjects
      the child to risks of complications associated with any
      surgical procedure. This include but are not limited to
      hemorrhage, overwhelming infection, excessive penile skin
      loss, painful erections, mutilation, and accidental injury.
      Damage from circumcision can be severe and has even resulted
      in the death of the child. Circumcision will have a life-long
      physical consequence to your son. Countless thousands of
      adult males have been caused physical, emotional, and sexual
      dysfunctional consequences as a direct result of routine
      infant circumcision.</p>

      <p>In the absence of valid medical reasons, it should be
      clear that there should be no such thing as a "routine"
      circumcision procedure. As Christians we are called upon to
      love, protect and nurture our children. The start of your
      son's physical well being is better assured by saying NO to
      the pain, trauma, loss of sensitivity, and loss of intended
      protection caused by submitting him to an unnecessary,
      medically unjustified, routine circumcision that is not
      recommended. It is unconscionable to subject a child to such
      risks simply as a cosmetic peer look alike procedure.</p>

      <p>Since routine circumcision is not supported by Christian
      teaching, and the medical community universally states,
      "There are no valid medical indications for the routine
      circumcision of baby boys", the choice of loving and
      compassionate Christian parents should be obvious. We are
      obligated to protect him from the risks, loss and damage from
      routine circumcision. Christian parents, alarms have been
      sounded and the "red flags" are clearly visible. It is time
      we heeded them to diligently endeavor to protect our male
      newborns.</p>
