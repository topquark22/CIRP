\begin{verse}
     Your children are not your children. \\
     They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for
        itself. \\
     They come through you but not from you. \\
     And though they are with you they belong not to you. \\
     You may give them your love but not your thoughts, \\
     For they have their own thoughts.\\
    You may house their bodies but not their souls, \\
     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you
        cannot visit, not even in your dreams. \\
    You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make
        them like you. \\
     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. \\ 
     You are the bow from which your children as living
        arrows are sent forth. \\
     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,
        and He bends you with His might that His arrow may
        go swift and far. \\ 
     Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; \\
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also
        the bow that is stable. \\

  \hskip 2in ---Khalil Gibran, from {\it The Prophet}

\end{document}

% ...  This poem comes from the pen of Jibran Khalil 
% Jibran...a born Maronite Chrisitan from the village of B'sharri in the 
% mountains of Lebanon. It is from his book "An-Nabi" the Prophet...about 
% a prophet (not THE prophet) who, like Jibran living in the US many 
% years before returning to Lebanon, is waiting for the ship to bear him 
% back to him homeland. He died c. 1926 but is very alive in the Lebanese 
% culture. I make this connection because through his biographer, a Mr. 
% Shaban, I met several members of the Jibran family in Lebanon and one 
% of whom is a physician. We discussed circumcision and the fact that 
% non-Muslim Arabs of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq don't practice 
% routine circumcision and their views are being accepted my some urbane 
% Moslems Arabs.  !!!  Sorry for the trivia.  ----Miles Witt
