               BABY'S CRY

               Movement...
               Exhilaration...
               My arrival is NOW!
               Swimming into the World of Air-
               The warmth of mother's body caressing me;
               a gentle hand to guide me;
               brightness surrounding me,
               but, wait...

               ...CUT!

               Now, separate and alone - lost in
               a void of unknown experience.
               Initiated into membership in humanity
               with promises of continuing nourishment:
               Love and Family,
               Community and Brotherhood,
               but, wait...

               ...CUT!

               Pain!!

               The touch of harsh metal upon my innocence;
               The betrayal of the gentle hands;
               An ooze of warm life blood.
               Why? Where is your hospitality?
               Is this how you welcome new guests?
               Or, am I now ordained?
               Another victim-to-be-survivor
               Knowing not what steps to take to recover.
               I...who can't even count to 12.
