    <h3>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISEASES IN CHILDREN, Volume 141: Page
    128,<br />
     February 1987.</h3>
    <br />

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Sir.-- Before the mid-1970s, the American standard of care
      included neonatal circumcision, a minor surgical procedure
      that promoted genital hygiene and prevented later penile
      cancer as well as cervical cancer in female sexual partners.
      More recently, evidence has suggested that adequate hygiene
      is all that is needed and that circumcision is an unnecessary
      and traumatic procedure. In 1983, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology jointly agreed that routine circumcision is not
      necessary,<font size="2"><sup>1</sup></font> and third-party
      payers are increasingly refusing to pay for the procedure.
      Whether recent evidence of a decreased incidence of urinary
      tract infections in circumcised male infants <font
      size="2"><sup>2</sup></font> can stem the anticircumcision
      tide is questionable.</p>

      <p>The purpose of this communication is to offer some solace
      to the generations of circumcised males who are now being
      told they have undergone an unnecessary and deforming
      procedure, which may also have been brutal and
      psychologically traumatic. To them I offer these lines:</p>

              <b>Ode to the Circumcised Male</b> 

              <p>We have a new topic to heat up our passions
              --<br />
               the foreskin is currently top of the fashions.<br />
               If you're the new son of a Berkeley professor,<br />
               your genital skin will be greater, not lesser.<br />
               For if you've been circ'ed or are Moslem or
              Jewish,<br />
               you're out side the mode; you are old-ish not
              new-ish.<br />
               You have broken the latest society rules;<br />
               you may never get into the finest of schools.<br />
               Noncircumcised males are the "genital chic"--<br />
               if your foreskin is gone, you are now up the
              creek.<br />
               It's a great work of art like the statue of
              Venus,<br />
               if you're wearing a hat on the head of your
              penis.<br />
               When you gaze through a looking glass, don't think
              of Alice;<br />
               don't rue that you suffered a rape of your
              phallus.<br />
               Just hope that one day you can say with a
              smile<br />
               that your glans ain't passe; it will rise up in
              style.<br />
