INTACT-L

MISSION

INTACT-L welcomes participation from all people that seek to end human
genital mutilation. By the use of English as a language, we have a natural
tendency to focus more on male genital mutilation, and especially routine
infant circumcision, than on other types of human genital mutilation,
because of our various experiences and cultures. As much as we are able,
we will address all forms of human genital mutilation, or assist those
that are able.

NOTE: You do NOT need to be INTACT to join this list and help us work
against all human genital mutilation! 

INTACT-L: "INTACT" [L. intactus; in-, not + tactus, pp. of tangere, to
touch] means untouched or uninjured; kept or left whole. "-L" designates
this as a mailing list. 

We will maintain a firm policy against racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia
and anti-Semitism. Instead, we assert that an intact body is a universal
human right.
