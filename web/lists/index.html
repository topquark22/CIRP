    <p>[2004-05-16] <b>A note regarding CIRP and the SPEWS
    anti-spam service</b></p>

    <p>It has come to our attention that mail from CIRP.org is
    being blocked by the <a href="http://www.spews.org/">SPEWS</a>
    blackhole list (anti-spam service). A minority of e-mail
    hosting ISPs subscribe to that service and, as a consequence,
    if your ISP is one of these, you will be unable to receive mail
    from us. We would like to explain the situation and assure you
    that CIRP is opposed to spam. We do not send spam or support it
    in any way.</p>

    <p>Our generous hosting provider, <a
    href="http://www.tilted.net/">Tilted Planet</a>, has a strict
    policy against spam on their network. In 2004, one of Tilted's
    former clients was accused of sending spam to advertise their
    site. This alleged spam did not come from Tilted's network; it
    was sent from somewhere else. Unfortunately, SPEWS unilaterally
    decided to blacklist the entire tilted.net network, which also
    hosts many diverse commercial, informational and non-profit
    sites.</p>

    <p>Even though Tilted reported the spammer, all sites hosted
    here are still blacklisted by SPEWS. This is obviously unfair
    to the many quality sites who share this network.</p>

    <p>If you are an e-mail hosting ISP, on behalf of your
    subscribers, we urge you to unblock e-mail from our legitimate
    site, cirp.org. If you use a blackhole list (DNSBL), there are
    many to choose from. You might consider choosing one that is
    less zealous and arbitrary than SPEWS.</p>

    <p>Please bear with us in the meantime as we work to get our
    quality site removed from the SPEWS blacklist as soon as
    possible. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
