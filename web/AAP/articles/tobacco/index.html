   Abstract:

OBJECTIVE:

           To study the role of tobacco in squamous cell
           carcinoma of the penis.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

          The use of tobacco in the form of cigarettes, chewing
   tobacco and snuff was studied in a total of 503 patients and
          age-matched controls.

RESULTS:

          By multivariate analysis, a significant association was
          found between smoking (P = 0.002) or chewing
          tobacco (P < 0.001) and the use of snuff (P = 0.004) in
          patients with penile carcinoma as compared with controls. A
          dose-response relationship was observed for both smoking and
          chewing.

CONCLUSIONS:

             The use of tobacco is a significant risk factor for
             penile carcinoma, and the use of more than one form
             of tobacco increases this risk.
