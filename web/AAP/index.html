    <h1>AAP RELEASES NEW POSITION STATEMENT ON CIRCUMCISION</h1>

    <h2>New policy "narrow," say children's advocates</h2>
    <i>(Released 22:00 UCT, March 1, 1999)</i> 

    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics today released its
    long-awaited Policy Statement on male circumcision, a procedure
    that removes erogenous skin from a child's penis.</p>

    <p>The statement finally concluded that the "potential medical
    benefits" of newborn male circumcision are not sufficient to
    recommend routine infant circumcision. This should mean more
    boys will be allowed to grow up intact and healthy.</p>

    <p>Other recommendations were that some pain relief be
    provided. Most circumcisions in the U.S. are still executed
    without any form of analgesia.</p>

    <p>The Policy Statement arose out of a two-year investigation
    conducted by the AAP's Task Force on Neonatal Circumcision. It
    had been hoped that the Task Force would address urgent issues
    such as penile anatomy and sexual function, protecting boys
    from forcible foreskin retraction, and the human rights of the
    child. Instead, the statement is a narrow legalistic policy
    with no real guidance in these areas.</p>

    <p>Male circumcision remains a common procedure in the U.S. It
    has been receiving increased attention in recent months,
    largely from men who say infant circumcision violated their
    basic rights.</p>
