    <h2>News Release for March 1, 1999 5 p.m. EST:</h2>

    <p><b>American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Affirms that Claimed
    Medical Benefits Do Not Justify Routine Infant Circumcision; At
    Last Recognizes the Pain and Stress of Circumcision; Tragically
    Omits Crucial Information Necessary for Parents to Make an
    Informed Decision</b></p>

    <p>Harry Meislahn, Illinois Director of a national organization
    providing circumcision information to parents, today released
    the following comment in response to the AAP's revised position
    on circumcision.</p>

    <p>With the new AAP policy in hand, no parent can honestly
    claim ``medical benefits'' as a legitimate reason to
    circumcise. Anyone making such a claim is out of step with the
    American Academy of Pediatrics, which says ``[Potential
    medical] benefits of circumcision are not compelling enough to
    warrant the AAP to recommend routine newborn circumcision.''
    The AAP's policy is consistent with those of national medical
    organizations in Canada, the UK, and Australia, none of which
    consider infant circumcision necessary.</p>

    <p>With its new statement, the AAP is finally acknowledging
    that circumcision causes pain and stress. For the first time,
    it also recognizes that the pain of circumcision may have a
    long-lasting impact. This is a major improvement over the AAP's
    1989 statement on circumcision, which erroneously claimed that
    ``These behavioral changes [i.e., those associated with
    circumcision] are transient and disappear within 24 hours after
    surgery.'' Meislahn commented ``Now that the AAP has officially
    recognized that circumcision hurts baby boys, I wish they would
    apologize to the tens of millions of American males who were
    profoundly hurt at birth by doctors who mistakenly claimed that
    circumcision is painless.''</p>

    <p>The AAP is also correct in carefully avoiding the false
    claim that analgesics eliminate circumcision pain. Analgesics
    can only reduce the pain of the procedure and they do nothing
    to relieve distress post-operatively. The head of the penis and
    the cornea of the eye are the two most pain sensitive parts of
    a male's body, and chafing of the head of the penis against the
    diaper is uncomfortable for the circumcised baby. Some
    circumcised men still experience significant discomfort more
    than 30 years later.</p>

    <p>The AAP statement provides useful statistics to demonstrate
    that routine circumcision is unjustified. By enumerating
    high-end statistics on penile cancer, sexually transmitted
    diseases, and urinary tract infections, the AAP shows just how
    insignificant these figures are. If a new surgical procedure
    were to be proposed today based on such shaky grounds, any
    medical body would find its professional credibility seriously
    compromised.</p>

    <p>The AAP is on less firm ground when it strays from its area
    of professional competence, which is the dispensing of medical
    advice, and asserts that ``it is legitimate for parents to take
    into account cultural, religious and ethnic traditions'' when
    making the circumcision decision. Non-medical rationales for
    circumcision undoubtedly influence some parents in making the
    circumcision decision, but destroying an important and
    irreplaceable part of a child's body without his consent and
    without medical justification can hardly be considered
    ``legitimate.'' Surveys suggest that about seven times as many
    circumcised men as intact men are unhappy about their
    circumcision status, and therefore parents who try to be guided
    by what their child would want if he could speak have a strong
    reason to say no to circumcision whatever pressure others may
    try to exert. Parents who decide against circumcision are
    preserving their son's right to decide for himself. Meislahn
    commented, ``After all, he will be living with the decision his
    parents make long after we are all gone. It should be his
    decision to make when he is a man.''</p>

    <p>The AAP statement also ignores vital information about
    circumcision. It is important for parents to know that the
    foreskin is important sexual tissue, not a simple flap of skin.
    Recent professional articles have proven the existence of
    specialized touch receptors in the foreskin, and the foreskin
    also protects the head of the penis, keeping it at peak
    sensitivity.</p>

    <p>The AAP statement is limited by the bounds of published
    data. The AAP did not commission special studies that might
    have closed major remaining gaps in understanding of
    circumcision. First, despite proof that circumcision destroys
    important sexual tissue, the American medical community has
    never systematically studied the physiological and
    psychological consequences of circumcision for adult males and
    for their sexual partners. Also, the circumcision wound is
    difficult to keep clean, and pathogens, particularly from
    feces, can enter the bloodstream through this wound causing
    septicemia, liver abscess, meningitis, and other potentially
    fatal medical disasters. But the root cause of these disasters
    is seldom recorded, and the true and total risk from
    circumcision therefore remains unknown. Clearly, the AAP's task
    force on circumcision failed to do some necessary homework.</p>

    <p>The National Organization of Circumcision Information
    Resource Centers is a decades-old group led by physicians,
    nurses, and other health-care professionals. It provides
    education, research, and advocacy on behalf of the right of
    every child to the integrity of his or her own body. For more
