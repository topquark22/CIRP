    <title>History of AAP's Position on Circumcision</title>

  <body bgcolor="white">
    <h1>History of Circumcision and the AAP</h1>

    <p>The AAP issued its first statement on circumcision in 1971
    when it said, "There are no valid medical indications for
    circumcision in the neonatal period."</p>

    <p>The AAP first convened a Task Force on circumcision in 1975.
    That Task Force issued a more lengthy statement which
    reaffirmed the 1971 statement and concluded, "There is no
    absolute medical indication for routine circumcision of the
    newborn."</p>

    <p>In the 1980's new medical studies about the pain, stress,
    and trauma of circumcision appeared. There were also some
    studies that appeared to show a slight reduction in <a
    href="/library/disease/UTI/">urinary tract infection rates</a>
    in circumcised boys as compared to intact boys. In 1988, the
    AAP convened a second Task Force to study these new
    developments. The chairperson of that Task Force was Edgar
    Schoen, MD, a California pediatrician.</p>

    <p>The new report appeared in 1989 as an addendum to the 1975
    statement, which was never revoked. However, a number of items
    in the 1989 report were very unclear. The AAP recognizes that
    its stance is now in need of clarification.</p>
