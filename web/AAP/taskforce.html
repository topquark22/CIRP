    <title>The 1999 AAP Task Force on Neonatal Circumcision</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="white">
    <h1>The Task Force</h1>

    <p>The members of the Task Force will have a very large job
    ahead of them. They must speak to men who are undergoing
    foreskin restoration in an attempt to regain a sense of genital
    normalcy. They must review a wealth of new and old material on
    the anatomy, histology, and physiology of the foreskin. They
    must visit a large volume of new and old material about pain,
    risks and complications, including psychological and emotional
    disturbance due to circumcision. Further, they must place
    circumcision in a newly emerging context of medical ethics and
    human rights, something that has never before been
    achieved.</p>

    <p>The members of the AAP Task Force on Circumcision are:</p>
