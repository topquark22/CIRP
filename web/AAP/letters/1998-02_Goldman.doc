\par Dear Dr. Lannon:
\par 
\par As the Task Force nears completion of its report on circumcision, I would like to share a few thoughts on the issue regarding recent literature and other pertinent matters.
\par 
\par The trend in the circumcision literature recently has been to test various approaches to reducing infant pain. Stang et al. report that a new type of restraint reduces the infants pain during circumcision as evidenced by the observation that the infants \ldblquote slept through\rdblquote  the procedure.}{\cs19\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s20\fi-432\li432\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f15\fs20\cgrid {\cs19\super \chftn }{ Stang, H., Snellman, L., Condon, L., Conroy, M., Liebo, R., Brodersen, L., & Gunnar, M., \ldblquote Beyond Dorsal Penile Nerve Block: A More Humane Circumcision,\rdblquote  }{\i Pediatrics}{ 100 (1997): 256-7.}}}{ This is a misinterpretation of the infants\rquote  behavior. Infants do not sleep through circumcision any more than adults would sleep through circumcision. Sometimes they withdraw into a semi-coma, shock state from the overwhelming pain. Regarding another misinterpretation, an infant sucking on a pacifier during circumcision cries less because he is seeking comfort with his sucking reflex. He cannot cry and suck at the same time. Investigators sometimes forget that behavioral response is the least reliable indicator of infant pain.}{\cs19\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s20\fi-432\li432\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f15\fs20\cgrid {\cs19\super \chftn }{ Gunnar, M., Fisch, R., & Malone, S., \ldblquote The Effects of a Pacifying Stimulus on Behavioral and Adrenocortical Responses to Circumcision in the Newborn,\rdblquote  }{\i Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry}{ 23 (1984): 34-8.}}}{ Even Stang et al. found that plasma cortisol, a more reliable indicator of pain response, was not significantly changed between test groups. 
\par 
\par The AAP Work Group on Breastfeeding\rquote s strong endorsement of breastfeeding as the optimum form of nourishment for infants because of numerous health benefits has relevance to circumcision.

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {
\par As you know, parents report that they choose to circumcise primarily for social reasons, not medical reasons. Accordingly, I hope that the Task Force report responds to the false beliefs about \ldblquote social circumcision.\rdblquote  My response to this argument is found on pages 64-70. Part of this discussion was included in my letter to Michael Copeland, April 7, 1997, and I sent you a copy. I also suggest that the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer use social reasons in reference to circumcision in its literature to parents (see AAP brochure }{\i Circumcision: Pros and Cons}{).
\par }\pard \qj\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {If the Task Force report is critical of circumcision, like reports of other English-speaking medical organizations, circumcision advocates still can make claims of benefits and refer to published literature that supports their view. In addition to pointing out the flaws in such studies and associated reasoning, an appropriate response could be that the burden of proof rests with those who advocate circumcision. They must show that it is both safe and effective. Neither has been clearly demonstrated.
\par 
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Furthermore, a common media perception is illustrated in the }{\i Boston Globe}{ article on circumcision (Jan. 26, 1998) in which the reporter refers to \ldblquote the flip-flopping of the American Academy of Pediatrics\rdblquote  in its last report on circumcision. Observers could interpret a critical report as just another shift of opinion or new wave of studies that could change once again when more studies and a new task force revisits the issue in the future. To satisfy opponents of a critical report, it may be useful to address this \ldblquote flip-flopping\rdblquote  directly and offer an explanation about the ambiguous conclusion of the 1989 report.

\par The results of some recent studies surprise both professionals and laypeople. As stated in the Introduction of my book,

\par }\pard \li360\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\fs22 New information about circumcision often conflicts with previous teachings and long-held beliefs. Many people, including doctors, are confused by what they learn. If our world makes sense, then there must be a coherent explanation for all the appa}{\fs22 r}{\fs22 ently contradictory information. The conflicting conclusions, beliefs, and opinions surrounding circumcision, together with the tenacity with which advocates and opponents of circumcision hold on to their viewpoints, suggest that deep psychological factors are involved. I believe that the heart of the circumcision issue lies beyond the field of medicine.}{\cs19\fs22\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s20\fi-432\li432\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \f15\fs20\cgrid {\cs19\super \chftn }{ Goldman, }{\i Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma}{, 3.}}}{\fs22

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {It may be helpful to explain the apparent contradictory evidence by at least referring to the contributing psychological and social factors (e.g., false beliefs, flawed logic, sexual anxieties, emotional repression, denial, conformity, see Chapters 2 and 3). Though science tries to be objective, it is not, and cultural bias affects research design, results, and conclusions (see pages 75-81). Mentioning these factors could provide an expanded understanding of circumcision and move us toward healing. 
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {
\par Finally, I am concerned that a report alone may not have much impact on actual practice. We learned this from the AAP statements of 1971 and 1975. Medical professionals simply ignored these statements and continued to circumcise. If the report is critical of circumcision, it is my hope that the Task Force report incorporates an effective plan of action to reach both professionals and parents with its message. In view of the fact that there is no proven medical benefit, that a growing number of men are reporting psychological and sexual problems which they attribute to circumcision, there is much that we do not know about the effects of circumcision, and there are serious legal and ethical issues connected with removing a normal, healthy, functioning body part of another person without his consent, a reasonable course of action would be to call for a suspension of the practice.
