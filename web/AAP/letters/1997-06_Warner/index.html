      <p>Carole M. Lannon, MD, MPH<br />
      Chair, Task Force on Circumcision<br />
      c/o Mr. Edward Zimmerman<br />
      Director, Physician Payment Systems<br />

      <p>Re: Inconsistencies with AAP policy in previous task force
      statement on circumcision.</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. Lannon:</p>

      <p>The previous AAP statement on neonatal circumcision, which
      was produced under the auspices of Edgar J. Schoen, MD,
      Chairman,[1] is inconsistent in several areas with other
      published policy statements by the AAP. I would like to point
      out these inconsistencies to you.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Pain</b></p>

      <p>The 1989 Task Force statement on neonatal pain:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Infants undergoing circumcision without anesthesia
        demonstrate physiologic responses suggesting they are
        experiencing pain. The observed responses include
        behavioral, cardiovascular, and hormonal changes. Pain
        pathways are well developed by the third trimester.
        Responses to painful stimuli have been documented in
        neonates of all viable gestational ages."[1]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The AAP position on neonatal pain:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"There is an increasing body of evidence that neonates,
        including those born preterm, demonstrate physiologic
        responses to surgical procedures that are similar to those
        demonstrated by adults and that these responses can be
        lessened with anesthetic agents."[2]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="center"><b>Pain Control</b></p>

      <p>The 1989 Task Force statement states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Local anesthesia adds an element of risk and data
        regarding its use have not been reported in large numbers
        of cases. Circumferential anesthesia may be hazardous. It
        would be prudent to obtain more data from large controlled
        studies before advocating local anesthesia as an integral
        part of newborn circumcision."[1]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>but the AAP position on neonatal pain control is:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"The Committee on Fetus and Newborn, the Committee on
        Drugs, the Section on Anesthesiology, and the Section on
        Surgery believe that local or systemic pharmacologic agents
        now available permit relatively safe administration of
        anesthesia to neonates undergoing surgical procedures and
        that such administration is indicated according to the
        usual guidelines for the administration of anesthesia to
        high-risk, potentially unstable patients."[2]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="center"><b>Child Rights</b></p>

      <p>1989 Task Force statement on child rights:</p>

      <p>The 1989 Task Force statement is silent on child
      rights.[1]</p>

      <p>However, the AAP position on child rights is:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"The Committee on Bioethics asserts that(1) the
        opportunity to grow and develop safe from physical harm
        with the protection of society is a basic right of every
        child; ..."[3]</p>

        <p>"The AAP asserts that every child should have the right
        to grow and develop free from preventable disease or
        injury."[4]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="center">Religious/cultural circumcision</p>

      <p>The 1989 Task Force statement:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"In addition to the medical aspects, other factors will
        affect the parents' decisions, including esthetics,
        religion, cultural attitudes, social pressures, and
        tradition."[1]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>but the AAP states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"However, the constitutional guarantees of freedom of
        religion do not sanction harming another person in the
        practice of one's religion, and they do not allow religion
        to be used as a defense when one harms another." [3]</p>

        <p>"Constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not
        permit a child to be harmed through religious practices,
        nor do they permit religion to be a valid legal defense
        when an individual harms or neglects a child."[4]</p>

        <p>"The basic moral principle of justice requires that
        children be protected uniformly by laws and regulations at
        the local, state, and federal level."[4]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="center"><b>Informed Consent</b></p>

      <p>1989 Task Force statement on informed consent is:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"When considering circumcision of their infant son,
        parents should be fully informed of the possible benefits
        and potential risks of newborn circumcision, both with and
        without anesthesia."[1]</p>

        <p>"When circumcision is being considered , the benefits
        and risks should be explained to the parents and informed
        consent obtained."[1]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>but the AAP position on informed consent is:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Parents and physicians should not exclude children and
        adolescents from decision making without persuasive
        reasons.[5]</p>

        <p>"Only patients who have appropriate decisional capacity
        and legal empowerment can give their informed consent to
        medical care. In all other situations, parents or other
        surrogates give informed permission for diagnosis and
        treatment of children with the assent of the child whenever
        appropriate."[5]</p>

        <p>"...`proxy consent' poses serious problems for pediatric
        health care providers. Such providers have legal and
        ethical duties to render competent care based on what the
        patient needs, not what someone else expresses."[5]</p>
        <br />
         

        <p>"A patient's reluctance or refusal to assent should also
        carry considerable weight when the proposed intervention is
        not essential to his or her welfare and/or can be deferred
        without substantial risk."[5]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The 1989 Task Force on Circumcision is a unique document
      that stands in opposition to many basic principles of proper
      medical care and ethics that have been enunciated or affirmed
      by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The replacement
      statement should reflect and be consistent with the values
      and principles that have been enunciated or affirmed by the
      AAP in the matters of pain, pain control, children's rights,
      protection of children from the religious beliefs of the
      parents, and limitation on the power of parents to
      consent.</p>
