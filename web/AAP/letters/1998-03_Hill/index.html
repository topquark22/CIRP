Re: AAP Leaflet: Circumcision Pros and Cons.

Dear Doctor Lannon:

    I am delighted to learn that the AAP leaflet for parents
"Circumcision: Pros and Cons" is to be rewritten.  This much
criticized document has many errors and is overdue for revision.

    I do hope that a new title will be found.  The old title is
unsuitable in light of today's medical, legal, and ethical knowledge.

    May I suggest: "Male Circumcision: Information for Parents" as a
suitable title since female circumcision is already unlawful.  The
suggestion that there are "pros" to circumcision is misleading and
inappropriate.

                                      Cordially yours,



                                      George Hill
