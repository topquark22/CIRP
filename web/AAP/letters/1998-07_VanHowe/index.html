    <p>Dear Doctor Lannon:</p>

    <p>Since contacting you last December, I have had a number of
    articles and letters that have been published or are in queue
    to be published. I thought I would share these with you. I have
    enclosed copies for your perusal.</p>

    </ol>

    <p>Having read the American Academy of Pediatrics' position
    statement on Female Genital Mutilation, I was struck by how
    incredibly similar it is to male circumcision in our country.
    The reasons given, the complications, and societal forces at
    work are nearly identical. One would fully expect the Academy
    to call for similar measures to protect boys from involuntary
    sexual alterations. I hope the Task Force have the courage and
    fortitude to do so. If you have any questions regarding the
    enclosed materials, please feel free to contact me.</p>
    <br />
     

    <p>Sincerely,<br />
