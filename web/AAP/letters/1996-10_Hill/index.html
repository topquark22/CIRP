Re: New Study on Conservative treatment of phimosis.

Dear Ed:

   A new study published in England today confirms previous
studies that prove phimosis in boys can be effectively and
conservatively treated with topical application of steroid cream.

   This study reports a success rate of 90 to 95 percent without
side effects.  This new treatment should eliminate the necessity
for circumcision as a treatment for phimosis in nearly all cases.

   Please publish a special bulletin to all practicing
pediatricians informing them of the availability of this new
effective conservative treatment.

   A text file containing the journal article is attached below
for your convenience.

                                 Sincerely yours,

                                 George Hill
