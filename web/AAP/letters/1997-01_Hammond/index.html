    <p>Dear Mr. Zimmermann,</p>

    <p>I'm aware that Marilyn Milos, R.N., has provided you with
    recently-published medical literature on neonatal circumcision
    intended for the newly-formed AAP Task Force on Circumcision.
    One important aspect that has been neglected by the medical
    community is the adverse outcomes to men later in life.
    Accordingly, I enclose a copy of <i>Awakenings</i>, a report of
    findings from a preliminary poll of 313 circumcised men
    regarding the long-term consequences of this practice.</p>

    <p>While the report profiles a self-selected population, each
    of the more than 500 forms collected to date reflects the
    experiences of a man affected by adverse physical, sexual or
    psychological consequences of circumcision. Most of these
    circumcisions were not ``botched jobs,'' but surgeries that met
    the ``standard of care.''</p>

    <p>Several men's studies consistently indicate that 20% or more
    of non-intact men are dissatisfied with their circumcision (see
    synopsis). <i>Awakenings</i> provides insight into why
    thousands of circumcised American men are dissatisfied, and
    their motivations for regaining their genital integrity through
    non-surgical skin expansion techniques. It also sheds light on
    why many circumcised men, until now, have hesitated to reveal
    their harm. The report is a long overdue but important
    foundation for further scientific investigation.</p>

    <p>Over one-third of survey respondents wish to give testimony
    about the consequences they suffer from circumcision. In
    addition to supplying the enclosed report, I request a meeting
    between the Task Force Committee and a small group of men who
    can articulately convey the adverse effects of this surgical
    genital alteration.</p>

    <p>I also encourage the AAP to address the following vital
    issues in order to produce a comprehensive report:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Anatomy, development and lifelong functions of the male
      prepuce</li>

      <li>Adverse outcomes to men of circumcision<a
      href="#note">(*)</a></li>

      <li>Impact of these adverse outcomes on female partners<a
      href="#note">(*)</a> (also addressed in
      <i>Awakenings</i>)</li>

      <li>Motivations for increased interest in foreskin
      restoration among circumcised men</li>

      <li>Non-surgical prophylaxis and treatment alternatives to
      circumcision</li>

      <li>Training of medical students, and continuing education
      for physicians, about care of intact boys</li>

      <li>Ethical/human rights issues of violating physical
      integrity/self-determination of healthy unconsenting
      children</li>
    </ul>
    <font size="2"><a id="note" name="note">(*)</a> These are not
    outside the purview of the Task Force, since the AAP has
    already demonstrated interest in <i>adult</i> health by
    considering neonatal circumcision as prophylaxis for penile
    cancer in older men and cervical cancer in their sexual
    partners.</font> 

    <p>I look forward to your response.</p>

    <p>In unity or the children, <i>(signed)</i><br />
    </p>
