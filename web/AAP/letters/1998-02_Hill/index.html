Re: UTI and Circumcision

Dear Dr. Lannon:

Further research has discovered a new abstract[1] in a supplement of
abstracts published by <i>Paediatrics &amp; Child Health</i>, the official
journal of the Canadian Paediatric Society.

This abstract reports a prospective study on the incidence of UTI in
circumcised and intact male children in Ontario.  This study reports
dramatically different results from those reported by Wiswell's
retrospective studies a decade ago.[2,3]  This report finds 625
circumcisions would be necessary to prevent one case of UTI.

Unfortunately this new study does not indicate any efforts to control
for confounding factors.  In addition, it must be remembered that
Mueller and colleagues found no significant difference in incidence of
UTI in circumcised and intact children.[4]

I am also enclosing the Pisacane study on the value of breastfeeding
in the reduction of the incidence of UTI.[5]

                                     Cordially yours,



                                     George Hill
