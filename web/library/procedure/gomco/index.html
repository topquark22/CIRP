      The following directions are provided for conduct of
      circumcision operations with the GOMCO clamp:</p>

      <h3 align="center">The Gomco Technique</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Stretch the preputial opening.</li>

        <li>Break preputial adhesions [synechial membrane] so that
        the foreskin is completely retractile. [Fig. A above.]</li>

        <li>Retract the foreskin until you can see the corona.
        Check the glans for any hidden adhesions.</li>

        <li>Apply a small amount of lubricant such as K-Y Jelly to
        the glans so it won't stick to the inside of the bell.</li>

        <li>Apply the bell-shaped plunger over the glans. [Fig. B
        above.] The bell should fit easily over the glans so they
        cover the corona. Too small a bell may injure the glans and
        fail to protect the corona. If stretching the preputial
        opening does not allow the bell to be inserted in the
        preputial space and entirely cover the glans, a dorsal slit
        may be necessary.</li>

        <li>Pull the prepuce over the bell. [Fig. C above.] The
        foreskin should not be stretched or pulled too snugly over
        the bell. If it's pulled up too tightly, it's possible to
        remove too much shaft skin or to pull the urethra up so you
        get a tangential cut through the urethra as well as the
        skin.</li>

        <li>Judge the amount of the shaft skin left below the
        corona; the skin should be relaxed and supple.</li>

        <li>After you're sure of the dimensions, apply the plate of
        the clamp at the level of the corona. [Fig. D above]</li>

        <li>With everything in proper alignment, tighten the clamp.
        This squeezes the prepuce between the bell and the clamp to
        make it blood-free. Be sure the weight of the clamp doesn't
        distort the anatomy so there isn't a proper amount of skin
        in the clamp.</li>

        <li>Make a circumferential incision with a cold knife, not
        an electrosurgical instrument. [Fig. E above]</li>

        <li>Leave the clamp in place at least five minutes to allow
        clotting and coagulation to occur.</li>

        <li>Remove the clamp and apply antiseptic ointment
        (Betadine) to the <span class="yellow">crush line</span>.
        Apply a light dressing or loin cloth arrangement to keep
        the ointment from rubbing off.</li>

        <li>If you remove the clamp prematurely, <span
        class="yellow">the crushed edges</span> may separate and
        bleeding will occur. When this occurs, suture the
        mucocutaneous margin, being careful to avoid deep sutures
        that might penetrate the urethra. If the whole edge
        separates, treat as a freehand circumcision, placing
        quadrant sutures and sewing between them with fine
        stitches.</li>

        <li>Have the baby watched overnight for any signs of
        bleeding.</li>

        <li>If late separation occurs, it's best to keep the wound
        clean and let it heal secondarily rather than try to suture
        it and risk development of stricture or fistula. Skin of
        this area tends to re-epethelialize rapidly.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This article was published at a
      time when most doctors still believed the myth that newborn
      babies could not feel pain. Consequently, it says nothing
      about the extreme pain, stress, and trauma produced by the
      above described crushing and cutting procedure.]</p>
