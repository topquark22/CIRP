      <p class="abstract"><span class="blue">Background:</span> It
      has been suggested that too many English boys undergo
      circumcision. This report describes how circumcision rates
      have changed in England between 1997 and 2003, including data
      on complication rates and on how age, medical indication and
      surgical specialty affect postoperative haemorrhage
      rates.<br />
       <span class="blue">Methods:</span> Data were extracted from
      the Hospital Episode Statistics database of admissions to
      National Health Service hospitals in England. Patients were
      included in the study if an Office of Population Censuses and
      Surveys version 4 code for circumcision was present in any of
      the operative procedure fields of the database; 75 868 boys
      below 15 years of age were included in the study.<br />
       <span class="blue">Results:</span> Circumcision rates
      declined by about 20 per cent, from 2&middot;6 per 1000 boys
      per year in 1997 to 2&middot;1 in 2003. Between 2000 and
      2003, circumcision rates remained static at 2&middot;1 per
      1000 boys per year. Circumcision rates fell by 31&middot;2
      per cent for boys aged 0&ndash;4 years, 9&middot;3 per cent
      for boys aged 5&ndash;9 years and increased by 7&middot;7 per
      cent in boys aged 10&ndash;14 years; 90&middot;2 per cent of
      circumcisions were done for phimosis and 1&middot;2 per cent
      of boys experienced a complication.<br />
       <span class="blue">Conclusion:</span> Circumcision rates in
      England continued to fall up until 2000, particularly in
      those aged under 5 years, in whom pathological phimosis is
      rare. The circumcision rate remains five times higher than
      the reported incidence of Phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span
      class="blue"><b>Introduction</b></span></p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision is a common paediatric surgical
      procedure. The proportion of boys circumcised during
      childhood varies markedly by country, by religion and, to
      some extent, by socioeconomic group<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. The proportion of men circumcised for
      religious reasons, in either the USA or Europe, remains
      largely unknown, but it has been estimated that about 80 per
      cent of men are circumcised in the USA for medical
      reasons<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>, compared with about 4
      per cent in English boys<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and
      less than 2 per cent in other parts of Europe<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup>. There are indications that the
      circumcision rate is still rising in the USA<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The only undisputed medical indications for
      circumcision are pathological phimosis and recurrent
      balanitis<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>. Pathological
      phimosis, by far the most common medical indication for
      circumcision, can be defined as a narrowing of the preputial
      orifice, leading to an inability to retract the foreskin, or
      prepuce, over the glans penis<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>.
      It should be distinguished from physiological phimosis, which
      is a normal part of penile development in which preputial
      adhesions, located between the glans penis and the foreskin,
      prevent the retraction of the foreskin in young boys. It has
      been argued that the circumcision rate of 4 per cent in
      England, although considerably lower than that in the USA,
      remains too high given that the incidence of phimosis has
      been reported to be only 0&middot;6 per cent<sup><a
      href="#n8">8,9</a></sup>. In addition, most boys circumcised
      in England are under 5 years of age, when pathological
      phimosis is rare<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision, like any surgical procedure,
      carries a risk of complications; the reported rate varies
      greatly from as low as 0&middot;06 per cent to as high as 55
      per cent<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup>. This variation
      is largely the result of the many different criteria used to
      define complications.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present report describes how the
      paediatric medical circumcision rate has changed in England
      between 1997 and 2003. In addition, data were analysed on the
      complications of circumcision using explicit definitions. The
      impact of age, medical indication and surgical specialty on
      the rate of postoperative haemorrhage was explored. This
      study was based on administrative data of all admissions to
      hospitals of the National Health Service (NHS) in
      England<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="blue"><b>Patients and
      methods</b></span></p>

      <p class="text1">Data were extracted from the Hospital
      Episode Statistics (HES) database. This database contains
      information about all admissions to NHS hospitals in England
      since 1989 and currently collects over 13 million records per
      year. Until 2002, the HES database contained seven diagnosis
      fields coded since 1995 according to the tenth revision of
      the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup>, and four operative procedure fields
      coded according to the UK Tabular List of the Classification
      of Surgical Operations and Procedures version 4 of the UK
      Office for Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS-4)<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup>. The number of diagnosis and
      procedure fields increased to 14 and 12 respectively after
      2002.</p>

      <p class="text2">HES records were considered that related to
      admissions between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2004. This time
      interval was chosen because a unique patient identifier was
      introduced in April 1997, so that it was possible to link HES
      records that belong to the same patient.</p>

      <h4>Identification of index record and subsequent
      readmission</h4>

      <p class="text1">A three-stage selection procedure was
      employed. First, all HES records with an OPCS-4 code
      indicating circumcision (N303) were identified in any of the
      operative procedure fields. This was labelled the index
      record. Second, these index records were linked with all HES
      records of subsequent readmissions using the unique patient
      identifier. Third, all HES records that related to
      circumcision in boys over 14 years of age were deleted.</p>

      <h4>Identification of indications</h4>

      <p class="text1">To identify the indication for circumcision,
      the diagnosis fields of all index records were examined. A
      wide range of ICD-10 codes were identi.ed to code the
      indications for circumcision, including phimosis (N47, N486),
      balanitis (N481, N512) and ritual circumcision (Z412). Over
      the study interval, 75 868 boys were documented to have
      undergone medical circumcision and 6122 boys were documented
      to have undergone ritual circumcision on the basis of
      diagnosis coding. Boys undergoing ritual circumcision were
      excluded from further analysis.</p>

      <h4>Identification of complications</h4>

      <p class="text1">The codes used to identify complications
      were not de.ned in advance. Instead, the diagnosis and
      operative fields of all hospital admissions for all boys who
      were likely to have had a complication of surgery were
      examined, that is index admissions of more than 1 day in
      hospital following circumcision and readmissions with 30 days
      after circumcision. On the basis of this examination, 19
      diagnosis codes and 13 operative procedure codes that were
      used to record complications following circumcision were
      identified. These codes were then grouped into haemorrhagic,
      infectious and other complications, and applied to the index
      and 30-day readmission records of all boys included in the
      study. In addition, readmissions for revision circumcision
      (OPCS-4 code N303 in a subsequent hospital admission after
      the index admission) and meatal stricture dilatation (OPCS-4
      code N79) within 6 months of circumcision were recorded.</p>

      <p class="text2">The analysis of the complication rate
      excluded boys who had an additional operative procedure at
      the time of circumcision, as the complicationmay have been
      influenced by the additional procedure; 9349 boys
      (12&middot;3 per cent) were excluded from analysis of
      complications for this reason.</p>

      <h4>Statistical analysis</h4>

      <p class="text1">The HES database is structured in reporting
      years running from 1 April to 31 March. This study reports
      results from 1997/1998 to 2003/2004 (subsequently referred to
      as 1997 to 2003). To calculate the circumcision rate in a
      reporting year, the number of boys who underwent circumcision
      in that year was divided by the mid-year estimate of the
      number of boys aged between zero and 14 years living in
      England according to the UK Office for National
      Statistics<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The proportion of boys who would undergo
      circumcision by their 15th birthday, if the circumcision rate
      in a specific reporting year remained unchanged, was
      estimated by multiplying the circumcision rate for boys
      between 0 and 14 years by 15.</p>

      <p class="text2">It was assumed that the circumcision rate
      estimates were Poisson-distributed counts, and Poisson
      regression was used to analyse trends over time. The
      complication rate was described as a percentage. Multivariate
      logistic regression was used to describe the risk of
      postoperative haemorrhage according to age, indication and
      surgical specialty. All P values were two sided, and P &lt;
      0&middot;050 was considered statistically significant. Stata.
      software (version 8) (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX,
      USA) was used for all statistical calculations.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="blue"><b>Results</b></span></p>

      <h4>Trends in the rate of circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text1">Between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2004, 75
      868 boys aged under 15 years were admitted to NHS hospitals
      in England and underwent a medically indicated circumcision
      (<i>Table 1</i>). This corresponds to a circumcision rate of
      2&middot;3 per 1000 boys per year over the whole study
      interval. Some 36&middot;1 per cent (27 426) of all
      paediatric circumcisions were performed in boys aged less
      than 5 years, 44&middot;7 per cent (33 922) in boys aged
      between 5 and 9 years, and 19&middot;1 per cent (14 520) in
      boys aged between 10 and 14 years.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text2">Over the 7-year interval, the circumcision
      rate declined by about 20 per cent, from 2&middot;6 per 1000
      boys per year in 1997 to 2&middot;1 per 1000 in 2003.
      Circumcision rates were similar in the interval between 2000
      and 2003. The proportion of boys who would undergo
      circumcision by their 15th birthday if the circumcision rates
      observed in a reporting year remained unchanged fell from
      3&middot;9 per cent in 1997 to 3&middot;1 per cent in
      2003.</p>

      <p class="text2">The indication for circumcision was
      documented in 98 per cent of the boys included in the study.
      In boys with a known indication, 90 per cent underwent
      circumcision for phimosis, 8 per cent for recurrent balanitis
      and 2 per cent for other reasons. Over the 7 years, the
      number of circumcisions performed for phimosis fell by 23 per
      cent from 11 501 in 1997 to 8866 in 2003, whereas the number
      of circumcisions performed for recurrent balanitis did not
      change.</p>

      <p class="text2">The circumcision rate in boys aged less than
      5 years declined over the study period by about 30 per cent,
      from 3&middot;2 to 2&middot;2 per 1000 boys per year. In boys
      aged between 5 and 9 years, the circumcision rate declined by
      nearly 10 per cent, from 3&middot;2 to 2&middot; 9 per 1000
      boys per year. For boys aged between 10 and 14 years, the
      circumcision rate increased slightly from 1&middot;3 to
      1&middot; 4 per 1000 boys per year (<i>Table 2</i>). The
      proportion of paediatric circumcisions performed by general
      surgeons decreased by about 40 per cent, from 51 to 31 per
      cent over the study interval.</p>

      haemorrhage, with 62&middot;8 per cent of these requiring a
      return to theatre. Seven hundred and ten boys (1&middot;1 per
      cent) stayed longer than 1 day in hospital after circumcision
      and 134 (0&middot;2 per cent) were readmitted within 30 days
      of the procedure. Three hundred and three boys (0&middot;5

      <p class="text2">Haemorrhage was the most common complication
      following circumcision. The extent to which age, indication
      and surgical specialty influenced the postoperative
      haemorrhage rate is shown in <i>Table 3</i>. The proportion
      of boys aged between 5 and 9 years who experienced
      haemorrhage (0&middot;7 per cent) was about 30 per cent lower
      than the rate of haemorrhage in younger and older boys
      (1&middot;0 and 0&middot;9 per cent respectively).
      Circumcisions carried out by general surgeons had slightly
      lower haemorrhage rates (0&middot;7 per cent) than those
      performed by paediatric (1&middot;1 per cent) or urological
      (0&middot;8 per cent) surgeons. These differences remained
      after adjustment for age and indication.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span
      class="blue"><b>Discussion</b></span></p>

      <p class="text1">Between 1997 and 2003, the circumcision rate
      in England declined by about 20 per cent, from 2&middot;6 to
      2&middot; 1 per 1000 boys per year. This decline was due to a
      drop in the frequency of circumcisions for phimosis in the
      period before 2000. A total of 1&middot;2 per cent of boys
      undergoing circumcision experienced a complication, most of
      which occurred soon after surgery. Circumcisions performed in
      boys aged between 5 and 9 years had lower rates of
      haemorrhage than circumcisions performed in younger or older
      boys. Moreover, circumcisions carried out by a general
      surgeon had lower rates of haemorrhage than those performed
      by a paediatric or urological surgeon.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are concerns over the accuracy of
      administrative data used to identify boys undergoing
      circumcision. However, it is unlikely that coding accuracy
      was a major source of error in this study, as circumcision is
      a common procedure that is coded with a single specific
      OPCS-4 code. Moreover, there was a high degree of consistency
      between the coding for diagnoses and operative procedure,
      with 98 per cent of the admissions for circumcision
      containing diagnosis codes of appropriate medical indications
      for circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are further concerns over the use of
      administrative data to capture and correctly code for
      complications of surgical procedures. Therefore, the
      diagnosis and operative procedure codes relating to
      complications of circumcision were not identi.ed in advance.
      Instead, diagnosis and operative codes within HES records
      were examined for admissions in which a complication was most
      likely to have occurred &ndash; that is, index admissions in
      which the duration of hospital stay was longer than 24 h and
      readmissions within 30 days. By this process, it was possible
      to account for inconsistencies in coding practice between
      hospitals. A further concern is that the study relied on
      readmissions to capture complications that became apparent
      after discharge. However, not all complications require
      readmission and so some minor complications will not have
      been included in the study.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is large geographic variation in
      circumcision rates around the world that reflects the
      different arguments used to justify medical circumcision. In
      the USA, most circumcisions are performed in newborn boys
      soon after birth<sup><a href="#n16">16,17</a></sup>.
      Arguments used to justify this practice include the
      prevention of urinary tract infection in infancy<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> as well as sexually transmitted
      disease in later life<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>. In
      contrast to the USA, the lower circumcision rates in Europe
      and Australia reflect that circumcision appears to be
      reserved for medical conditions affecting the foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">It was estimated that 3&middot;1 per cent of
      English boys would undergo circumcision by their 15th
      birthday if the circumcision rate found for 2003 remained
      unchanged. This circumcision rate is about five times higher
      than the reported incidence of phimosis, by far the most
      common indicator for circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>. In the interval between 1989 and
      1997, this estimated proportion was found to have fallen from
      6&middot;0 to 3&middot;8 per cent, but the circumcision rate
      in boys between 10 and 14 years remained constant<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup>. In the present study, however,
      circumcision rates began to increase in this older age
      group.</p>

      <p class="text2">A number of studies have reported
      complication rates after paediatric circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n19">19&ndash;23</a></sup>. These rates varied widely,
      which is mainly the result of different study types (for
      example survey, chart review, analysis of administrative
      data) and de.nitions used for complications. For this reason,
      the present results can only be compare validly with reported
      rates of return to theatre and readmission. A study of about
      136 000 boys, based on administrative discharge records in
      the USA<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>, found that about
      0&middot;03 per cent went back to theatre because of
      haemorrhagic complications after circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup>. The equivalent figure in the
      present study was 0&middot;5 per cent. An explanation for
      this large difference is that the American study only
      considered neonatal circumcisions, whereas the proportion of
      boys aged less than 1 year in the present study was very low
      (1&middot;4 per cent). Furthermore, the boys included in this
      study usually had foreskin pathology, whereas in the US study
      most newborn boys must have had foreskins that were perfectly
      healthy. Finally, the latter study only considered
      complications during the admission in which the circumcision
      was performed, whereas all complications that occurred up to
      30 days were examined in the present study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other smaller studies based on medical
      records have reported on rates of reoperation. A study from
      the USA observed that three (1&middot;3 per cent) of 240 boys
      returned to theatre with a haemorrhagic complication<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup>, and a Canadian study<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> observed this in one of 100 boys.
      These figures are slightly higher than the rate of return to
      theatre for bleeding of 0&middot;5 per cent in the present
      study.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is a prospective study reporting
      readmissions after circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup>, which found that four (2&middot;9
      per cent) of 140 boys who underwent circumcision as a day
      case required an emergency readmission for haemorrhage (two
      boys) or vomiting (two). The reported readmission rate of
      0&middot;2 per cent in the present study was considerably
      lower. However, the numbers in the Southampton study were
      small and boys were discharged immediately after
      circumcision, whereas 1&middot;1 per cent of boys in the
      present study remained in hospital overnight.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision was increasingly being
      performed by urological and paediatric surgeons, whereas at
      the same time circumcision performed by a general surgeon had
      the lowest rate of haemorrhagic complications. These
      observations seem conflicting, but care needs to be taken
      when interpreting complication rates because administrative
      data did not allow adjustment for disease severity.</p>
