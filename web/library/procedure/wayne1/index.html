       Not its destruction</font></h3>

      <p><b>To the Editor:</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a
      surgeon, it is no surprise that you are interested in
      circumcision surgery.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> As a
      human being, it is surprising that you have no interest in
      the mechanical gliding function and the erogenous sexual
      benefits of the foreskin. Dr. Taylor<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> beautifully describes the anatomy, sex
      nerves, and physiology of the foreskin.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      Health Care Financing Administration provides no room for
      debate about circumcision. According to HCFA, circumcision
      requires a patient-voiced complaint, physical abnormality,
      and a pathologist's report documenting the pathology. Failing
      HCFA necessity criteria, circumcision is fraud and abuse.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      treatment for infection is antibiotics, not amputation.
      Circumcision fails the Severity of Illness Intensity of
      Service criteria. The foreskin is not an
      "infection&ndash;facilitative factor." Van Howe<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> clearly elucidates the immunologic
      functions of the foreskin. Additionally, the neonatal
      foreskin is firmly adherent to the glans like a fingernail to
      its nail bed. It protects both mechanically and
      immunologically against infection.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
      scientific evidence, compare statistics with non-circumcising
      countries. Intact neonates, with a virgin foreskin never
      subjected to ripping retraction from the glans during their
      medical exams, fare better than either circumcised infants or
      uncircumcised infants subjected to ripping retraction.
      Parents need to know that the infant is born with the
      foreskin fused to the glans and must view ripping of the
      immature foreskin from the immature glans as a painful type
      of sexual abuse, an invitation to infection, and damage to
      the undeveloped erogenous sex nerves.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Heuristics mandates that the child keep his foreskin and
      learn its mechanical and erogenous sexual benefits. The child
      is the owner of his foreskin. The child is the patient.
      Circumcision a not a matter of family choice. The circumciser
      needs the signed legal informed consent of the patient
      himself. Once he has enjoyed his god-given foreskin, he will
      not consent to man taking it by circumcision.</p>
