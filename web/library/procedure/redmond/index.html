      natural, intact, healthy, small, sensitive and delicate

        <h3>CIRCUMCISION VARIATIONS</h3>

        <p><b>by Ron Redmond</b></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">A study of the medical literature on
      circumcision over the last hundred years reveals some odd
      facts about motives and lets us draw some conclusions about
      why there are so many variations in both methods and
      results.</p>

      <p class="text2">Originally doctors saw circumcision as both
      a preventative and a cure for masturbation. The beliefs of
      the Victorian era held masturbation in disrepute. It was
      sinful, therefore it must be harmful. We need not dwell on
      the variety of illnesses attributed to masturbation during
      the late 19th century.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since the instinctive way to masturbate is
      to fist the foreskin back and forth on the penis, one obvious
      way of stamping out masturbation was to remove the foreskin.
      Once this practice was started among people for whom
      circumcision was not a religious injunction, there were soon
      many other reasons found for it. A tight foreskin was the
      cause of venereal disease, of irritation leading to
      masturbation, bedwetting, nervousness, and a long list of
      other disorders. The practice of circumcision evolved until
      today we find a wide variety of motives among the doctors who
      perform it, which accounts for the differences in surgical
      techniques and amounts of tissue removed.</p>

      <p class="text2">We can put these motives - and doctors - in
      categories ranging from the altruistic to the sadistic. The
      pain inflicted by the operation varies, as does the nature of
      the ensuing complications. Lets look at these categories, in
      the awareness that some of them overlap and that the doctors
      often have more than one motive.</p>

      <h4>The Anti-sex Moralist</h4>

      <p class="text2">This type of doctor sees himself as a
      crusader against masturbation and immorality, and his purpose
      is to suppress the sensitivity of the penis. He not only
      tries to make masturbation as difficult as possible for his
      patient; he believes that a radical circumcision will prevent
      what he sees as excessive sexual sensitivity.</p>

      <p class="text2">He removes as much shaft skin as he can, and
      all of the sensitive inner lining, to attain a very tight
      cut. He also removes the frenulum, the sensitive band on the
      underside of the head, to suppress sensitivity further. The
      result is a glans that is totally bareheaded, exposed to
      urine from the diaper and to friction from clothing.</p>

      <p class="text2">Often this doctor cuts off so much that when
      the baby has an erection, the edges of the wound pull apart
      and bleed. There is also danger of bleeding from the frenular
      artery, which is cut when the frenulum is removed. In extreme
      cases, with too much shaft skin removed, the ring of the
      circumcision lies well back of the rim; since there is no
      inner lining, the space fills with granulation tissue and
      looks like the scarring that results from a bad burn.</p>

      <p class="text2">As the boy grows, there isnt enough skin
      left on his shaft to accommodate the increasing size of his
      penis, so the skin is pulled tightly all the time. Upon
      erection there isnt enough skin to move freely and the boy
      must resort to a lubricant to aid his masturbation. Some men
      have reported that the size of their erection has been
      slightly reduced by so tight a circumcision. [N. B. Happening
      in the very tightly cut man who has, during erection, a
      thinnish, tightly stretched remnant of penile skin, this
      shortened erect penis occurs since the main bulk of the erect
      penis has not enough outer skin envelope to attain the full
      length, so some of the length of the penis is kept back in
      the pelvis.]</p>

      <h4>The Hygienist</h4>

      <p class="text2">This doctor is concerned with retraction of
      the foreskin for cleaning, which is unnecessary for a baby.
      The foreskin and glans are still fused together, which often
      makes retraction impossible. The foreskin protects an infant
      from diaper ammonia and other irritations.</p>

      <p class="text2">The doctor doesnt remove the entire foreskin
      if he feels that removing only the forward part will allow
      sufficient room for retraction. He instructs the mother to be
      sure and wash the penis every day, for hygiene. If he is
      concerned about penile odor, he may excise the entire
      foreskin, paying special attention to the inner lining and
      removal of the Tysons glands, which produce one component of
      smegma. He doesnt necessarily remove the frenulum.</p>

      <p class="text2">Not removing the entire foreskin can cause
      one complication: adhesion of the cut edges to the glans;
      these may be cut apart later by the pediatrician, but with
      further pain to the baby.</p>

      <h4>The Sculptor</h4>

      <p class="text2">This doctor simply likes the look of the
      bareheaded penis and lovingly tailors the babys organ to suit
      his own idea of masculine beauty. He is probably circumcised
      himself and thinks that the bare look is normal and that a
      flaring corona is the symbol of such beauty. He may believe
      that the size of the glans and flare of the corona are
      determined not by heredity but by the tightness of the
      foreskin. Hence he removes enough foreskin to expose the
      glans to the corona, to allow unhampered growth. The frenulum
      being unimportant to this purpose, he may leave it on. He
      also will not cut too tightly, just enough to denude the
      glans, leaving enough slack for masturbatory efforts by the
      boy.</p>

      <p class="text2">The doctor does as esthetic a job as he can,
      and the result is usually a neat-looking circumcision ring,
      not the jagged line resulting from other types of
      operation.</p>

      <h4>The Cut-For-Profit Type</h4>

      <p class="text2">This doctor sees circumcision simply as a
      way to earn an extra fee and uses whatever method he has been
      taught in medical school. He wants to get the operation over
      with as soon as possible, to present the mother with her sons
      bandaged penis as proof that hes earned his fee. He may cut a
      lot, or only a little. The odds are overwhelming that he uses
      one of the clamp techniques, which are quick and dont result
      in the radical circumcision of the freehand method.</p>

      <p class="text2">This profiteer type runs a mass-production
      business and usually waits until he has several babies for a
      quick session of assembly-line circumcisions. He goes down
      the line hurriedly, with results that vary from one penis to
      another. Some babies escape with relatively minor mutilation;
      others are skinned back severely. This doctor is antagonistic
      to the use of anesthesia because it entails an extra step. He
      doesnt care about the babys screams, knowing that theyre an
      ineffective complaint.</p>

      <h4>The Compassionate Doctor</h4>

      <p class="text2">This doctor removes the foreskin reluctantly
      and only because the parents want it done. He takes care in
      cutting, doesnt remove too much- perhaps performing a minimal
      circumcision that leaves the head mostly covered- and almost
      always spares the frenulum. He is the type most deeply
      concerned about the baby's pain and most likely to use local
      anesthesia. Before operating, hell allow time for the
      anesthetic to take effect, injecting more [into the penis] as
      necessary to prevent any pain for the baby.</p>

      <h4>The Sadist</h4>

      <p class="text2">This type is rarely documented in medical
      literature, but unofficial reports by medical personnel
      opposed to circumcision reveal that some doctors enjoy
      performing this surgery, laughing and making lewd remarks
      while doing so.</p>

      <p class="text2">The sadistic doctor derives a clearly sexual
      pleasure from cutting a babys penis, sometimes getting an
      erection during the operation. He enjoys the babys pain and
      takes his time doing his job. He never uses any sort of
      anesthetic; that would spoil it for him. He may lie to the
      mother, telling her that the baby is too young to feel any
      pain. In some instances he will fondle the babys penis before
      operating, producing an erection. This helps the doctor
      determine how much skin to leave on, but he has an ulterior
      motive as well.</p>

      <p class="text2">The amount of skin he removes varies
      according to his personal whim. He proceeds slowly and
      carefully, prolonging the operation for as much time as
      possible. Sometimes the baby gets an erection during or after
      the surgery, as reflex reaction to the intense pain, which
      the doctor enjoys.</p>

      <p class="text2">We may note that there also exist sadistic
      nurses who enjoy assisting at circumcisions. Their job
      includes jabbing the baby with a syringe- injecting a dose of
      vitamin K to aid blood clotting- and strapping the baby down
      for the surgery. Such nurses enjoy watching the operation and
      bandaging the bloody penis afterward. When changing the
      bandage, they may rip it loose forcefully, causing more
      bleeding and pain.</p>

      <p class="text2">Following circumcision, the baby cries
      whenever he urinates, as the hot, acid urine contacts the raw
      tissue of the cut. The sadistic nurse may take her time
      changing the diaper or leave the baby crying in his wet
      diaper for many minutes while she busies herself with
      something else nearby. Some of these nurses are man haters
      who enjoy seeing a helpless male being sexually mutilated and
      suffering the pain of sexual surgery without anesthesia.</p>

      <h4>Instruments</h4>

      <p class="text2">The freehand method, involving scissors or
      scalpel, leads to wide variation in results. If the doctor
      uses the guillotine technique, pulling the foreskin forward
      and cutting off the part extending beyond the glans, the
      amount of skin removed depends on the tension he exerts. If
      he uses the dorsal-slit-and-side-cuts technique, the amount
      depends on his arbitrary choice of a line. The penis may be
      left totally bareheaded or partially covered. Working
      freehand, the doctor may or may not remove the frenulum and
      will leave a varying amount of the mucous inner lining.</p>

      <p class="text2">The GOMCO clamp is a bell-shaped metal
      device that fits over the head of the penis. Because the
      infants foreskin is tight, the doctor usually has to slit it
      along the top to work in the bell. The GOMCO has a ring that
      clamps down on the foreskin after the doctor pulls the latter
      over the bell. The amount of skin removed varies, but never
      totals the amount possible in a freehand operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Plastibell is a plastic bell that fits
      over the head of the penis. The doctor slits the foreskin to
      widen the opening, inserts the bell, and pulls the foreskin
      up over it. There is a groove in the Plastibell for a cord
      that cuts off circulation. Once the doctor has tied the cord
      in place, he removes the skin forward of the cord, leaving
      the bell on the penis. The bell falls off in about a week.
      Because of the approximately one-quarter-inch section of bell
      behind the cord groove, there is always slack when the bell
      falls off, leaving a cuff of skin behind the head.</p>

      <p class="text2">In cases where the doctor tries for a very
      tight cut, the bell exerts a lot of pressure on the glans and
      surrounding tissue, causing indentations which may be
      permanent or even loss of blood circulation in the glans.</p>

      <p class="text2">Whatever his method, the doctor has to tear
      loose the foreskin of some babies, those whose inner lining
      and glans have not yet separated. The tearing and the
      slitting are more painful- because they take more time- than
      the clamping and cutting. If the lining has to be torn loose,
      patches of the delicate mucous membrane of the glans often
      come with it. This is the cause of the pockmarks sometimes
      seen on the glans of an older male. Tearing patches from the
      surface of the glans further deadens sensitivity.</p>

      <h4>Summary</h4>

      <p class="text2">We have seen changes in techniques and
      results over the years. Forty or fifty years ago, when
      masturbation hysteria was still prevalent, the favored style
      of circumcision was the streamlines, clean-cut look, with
      very little shaft skin left. The skin was very tight, even in
      the immature penis, and the glans stood out prominently. The
      frenulum was often partly or totally cut away.</p>

      <p class="text2">With the advent of clamps and the
      accumulation of experience in their use- and the abatement of
      the masturbation phobia- we began to see circumcised penises
      with their glans denuded but a generous cuff of skin left in
      the groove behind the head. The streamlined look was out, and
      there was concern to leave enough skin to allow for erections
      and for growth. Today we see more partial circumcisions- with
      enough hood left to cover the head at least halfway- because
      most of the doctors who push circumcision recognize that
      radical mutilation is undesirable.</p>

      <p class="text2">The different motives and techniques account
      for the differences we see in circumcised penises. Even among
      circumcised boys in the same family, we can see differences
      if the boys were delivered by different obstetricians, or if
      one was circumcised by the obstetrician and another by the
      family doctor. One will be cut tightly, another loosely, and
      a third may have most of his foreskin left.</p>

      <p class="text2">Parental preference affect the results. Some
      mothers want their son to match their husband. If the latter
      was cut tightly, the mother may feel cheated if the boy isnt,
      and may complain or demand a re-circumcision. The same demand
      may be made by a mother who is an avid crotch-watcher and
      likes to view the compound curves of a glans unshrouded by
      any skin. Sometimes parents express their preferences to the
      doctor in advance.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is no standard method and no agreement
      on what constitutes a good circumcision. The result of all
      this is a greater range of differences among remodeled organs
      than among the natural, intact one.</p>
