          Device</b></big><br />
          <br />
           1 The penis is first cleansed with sterilizing fluids.
          Use surgical marking pen to mark the level on the skin of
          the prepuce where the circumcision is to be performed.
          This is the level where the clamp is to be applied. This
          prevents too much pulling of the prepuce and thus avoids
          removal of too much tissue.<br />
          <br />
           2 Gently retract the prepuce. Free any adhesions, if
          they are present. <span class="cirp">[CIRP note: Lysis of
          the synechia is definitely invasive and painful in the
          case of infant circumcision: See 'PlastiBell'
          method.]</span><br />
          <br />
           3 As shown, apply Vaseline:-to the inner and outer
          surfaces of the lower end of the tubular part and to the
          inner and upper part of the ring.This prevents the tissue
          from sticking to the device over the next few days.<br />
          <br />
           4 Place the tubular part of the clamp over the glans, so
          that the glans is covered by the tube.<br />
          <br />
           5 The prepuce is now pulled over the rim of the tube.
          Adjust the prepuce over the tube so that the level which
          has been marked earlier is just above the rim of the
          tube.<br />
          <br />
           6 After adjusting the level of the prepuce, hold the
          prepuce firmly with the fingers.<br />
          <br />
           7 A grip-like pressure is applied on the two arms. As
          this pressure is increased, the two arms are brought
          closer to the locking mechanisms on the tube.<br />
          <br />
           8 Resistance to further movement of the arms is felt
          when the arms come in contact with the locking mechanisms
          on the device. Apply further pressure on the arms until
          two clicks are heard and felt. This means that the arms
          are already locked and the necessary occlusion has been
          obtained.<br />
          <br />
           9 With the tissue cutter provided, the prepuce that is
          distal to the clamping ring is cut away at the angle
          between the tube and the clamping ring.<br />
          <br />
           10 Although there is no bleeding, the tube is cleaned
          with a clean gauze and ointment is applied at the cut
          edge. Apply the ointment a few times daily, during the
          next few days. The device is allowed to remain on the
          penis for the next few days. Urine is easily voided
          through the distal opening.</p>
