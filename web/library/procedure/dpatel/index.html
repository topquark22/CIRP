      <h1>Factors Affecting the Practice of Circumcision</h1>

      <p>Daksha A. Patel, MD; Emalee G. Flaherty, MD; Judith Dunn,
      PhD.</p>

      <p class="abs">&bull; In 1975, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics (AAP) stated that there is "no medical indication
      for routine circumcision of the newborn." A survey was
      conducted among Chicago-area pediatricians, obstetricians,
      and family practitioners to determine what impact this
      statement had on their approach to circumcision. Hospitals
      were also surveyed to determine whether the AAP's statement
      had caused a change in the frequency of circumcision in area
      hospitals. Only 49% of the physicians were aware of the AAP's
      position. Forty-one percent recommended routine circumcision;
      14% recommended against the practice. Age, medical specialty,
      religious customs, and concerns about hygiene and cancer all
      appeared to influence the physicians' approach to
      circumcision. The frequency of routine circumcision was 70 to
      90% and remained unchanged in the three years following the
      AAP's statement.<br />
       (<i>Arch J Dis Child</i> 1982;136:634-636)</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">I</span>n 1975 the
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated that "there is no
      medical indication for routine circumcision of the
      newborn."<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> This conclusion
      followed a review of the pros and cons of circumcision. The
      AAP also stressed that the final decision should be left to
      the parents, and that their decision should be based on "true
      informed consent."<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Grimes<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      estimated that more than 1 million circumcisions are
      performed each year in the United States; it is the second
      most common surgical procedure performed on American
      males.<sup><a href="#n2">3</a></sup> Kaplan<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> estimated that about $60 million are
      spent annually on routine circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">This procedure is not totally
      innocuous.<sup><a href="#n2">2,4-7</a></sup> Patel<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> reported that 55% of the children in
      his series had some complication, varying from slight oozing
      of blood to phimosis requiring recircumcision. Complications
      include hemorrhage, infection, and trauma, including loss of
      penile skin and mutilation. Meatal ulcers and meatal stenosis
      may occur as late complications.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6,9</a></sup> Horwitz et al<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> and Kirkpatrick and Eitzman<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> described infants with sepsis, and
      Berman<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> reported two cases of
      urinary retention secondary to ritual circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since physicians advise parents regarding
      circumcision, the purpose of this study was two fold: (1) to
      determine the physicians attitude toward circumcision and
      what factor's influence those attitudes, and (2) to determine
      what impact the AAP's recommendations had on these attitudes
      and on the practice of circumcision in the Chicago area.</p>

      <h3 align="center">METHODS</h3>

      <p class="text2">Questionnaires were sent to all
      pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practitioners who
      were listed in the <i>Directory of Medical
      Specialists</i>.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The survey was directed at those particular
      physicians because they are the groups most likely to give
      advice to the family about circumcision of the newborn.
      Another questionnnaire was sent to the head nurses of
      perinatal services in the Chicago region to determine whether
      there was any change in the rate of circumcision of area
      hospitals between 1976 and 1978. This survey was completed
      between January 1979 and June 1979. Two hundred seventy six
      physicians (69% of those solicited) and 18 hospitals (45%)
      participated in the survey.</p>

      <h3 align="center">RESULTS</h3>

      <h4 align="center">Demographic Data</h4>

      <p class="text2">Of the 276 physicians participating in the
      study, 30% were pediatricians, 21% were obstetricians, 47%
      were family practitioners, and 2% were "other". Twenty-seven
      percent of the physicians were aged 25 to 40 years; 49% were
      in the 41 to 55-year age group; and 24% were over the age of
      55. More of the pediatricians (38%) were under age 40 than
      were the other specialists.</p>

      <p class="text2">The physicians represented a variety of
      ethic and religious backgrounds. Eighty-seven percent were
      white, 4% were black, 2% were Hispanic, and 7% listed as
      "other", including Moslem and Hindu. The family practitioners
      were predominantly Protestant; however, the pediatricians and
      obstetricians were distributed more or less equally among the
      Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Physicians' Recommendations</h4>

      <p class="text2">When asked what recommendation they made to
      mothers, more physicians (41%) recommended that circumcisions
      be done routinely than recommend that it not be done (15%).
      However, 38% did not make any recommendation, and 5% did not
      answer the question. Thus, of 156 physicians who mad a
      recommendation about circumcision, 76% recommended routine
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Demographic Factors Affecting<br />
       the Physicians' Recommendation</h4>

      <p class="text2">Age, specialty, and religion appeared to
      influence the physicians' approach. Pediatricians (28.9%)
      were significantly mare likely than the obstetricians (13.0%)
      and family practitioners (10.2) to recommend against routine
      circumcision (P&lt;.001). The older physicians more commonly
      recommended routine circumcision, whereas younger physicians
      were more likely to recommend against it. Protestant
      physicians were in favor of routine circumcision more often
      than the other religious groups, and Jewish physicians were
      more likely to make no recommendation.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Physicians' Reasons<br />
       for Recommending Circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text2">The physicians gave as their major reason
      for recommending circumcision that "it was better for
      hygiene"; 90% offered this reason. Thirty percent said it was
      consistent with their religious or cultural traditions.
      Twenty-seven percent recommended routine circumcision because
      they believed it would prevent certain forms of cancer.</p>

      <p class="text2">The physicians' attitudes about a possible
      link between circumcision and cancer were specifically
      assessed. They were asked their opinion about any possible
      relationship between penile cancer and lack of circumcision.
      The largest percentage (38%) stated that, in their opinion,
      "the medical literature shows no relationship between the
      two." A sizeable number (32%) had either no opinion or no
      answer. The pediatricians (54%) were most likely to take a
      stand and say no such relationship exists.</p>

      <p class="text2">The physicians were also asked whether "in
      their opinion the medical literature shows a positive
      correlation between carcinoma of the cervix and the absence
      of circumcision in the male partner." Twenty-three percent
      responded "yes," while 48% said there was no correlation
      between the two. A large number (29%) either gave no answer
      or stated that they had no opinion. A greater number of
      pediatricians believed there was no correlation. However, 14%
      of the pediatricians, 25% of the family practitioners, and
      33% of the obstetricians believed there was an association
      between the two. The differences were significant at the
      P=.002 level.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Impact of Parents' Wishes<br />
       on Physician's Recommendation</h4>

      <p class="text2">When physicians who recommended against
      circumcision were asked, "if the parents wanted it done
      should it be done anyway," 80% replied "yes." Forty-three
      percent of the physicians said that, in their practice
      parents did have their newborns circumcised despite their
      recommendation.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Impact of the AAP's Statement<br />
       on Physicians' Attitudes</h4>

      <p class="text2">The influence of the AAP's position on
      routine circumcision was then assessed by first determining
      the level of the physicians' knowledge regarding the
      recommendations. Only 49% of the physicians were aware of the
      Academy's recommendations. Age did not influence the response
      to this question. Pediatricians and obstetricians were
      equally knowledgeable about the AAP's recommendation.
      Sixty-two percent of each group knew the AAP did not
      recommend routine circumcision, whereas only 39% of the
      family practitioners were aware of the AAP's current
      recommendations.</p>

      <p class="text2">Those 128 physicians who knew the AAP's
      recommendations regarding circumcision were asked if they
      explained those recommendations to the mothers. Sixty-two
      percent replied they did. Significantly more pediatricians
      (75%) discussed these recommendations with the parents, while
      only 53% of the obstetricians and family practitioners
      advised the families. Only 24% of these physicians said that
      they recommended against routine circumcision in their
      practice. A large number (31%) continued to recommend that
      circumcision be done, and 45% made no recommendation at
      all.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Educational Programs</h4>

      <p class="text2">Only 8% of the physicians reported that
      their hospitals have educational programs informing members
      of the current recommendations about circumcision. Eighty-two
      percent of the physicians stated that their hospital did not
      have such a program, while the other 10% did not answer the
      question.</p>

      <p class="text2">The physicians were asked if they had noted
      a change in the incidence of circumcision in their practice
      during the last three years (1975 to 1978). The majority of
      physicians said they had not seen any change. Another 21%
      reported that the number of circumcisions had decreased.</p>

      <p class="text2">The hospitals responding to the survey
      reported an incidence of circumcision varying from 70% to
      95%. Three of the hospitals in which more than 1,500 neonates
      were born per year mentioned that "they do not have
      information easily available; however, most male neonates are
      circumcised." Only two hospitals had educational programs
      about circumcision for mothers. Only three hospitals had seen
      a decline in the incidence of circumcision between 1976 and
      1978, and two hospitals were the hospitals that had
      educational programs. In all of the hospitals, the
      obstetricians performed the procedure.</p>

      <h3 align="center">COMMENT</h3>

      <p class="text2">Although this survey was conducted in the
      Chicago area, these results are likely to be representative
      of other large urban areas since the participating physicians
      and their patients represented diverse religious and ethnic
      backgrounds.</p>

      <p class="text2">The results of this survey emphasize that
      circumcision is an extremely complex issue influenced by many
      variables. Despite the AAP's recommendation that there is no
      medical indication for routine circumcision, a substantial
      number of physicians continue to recommend routine
      circumcision of the neonate.</p>

      <p class="text2">Age, ethnic background, and religion all
      appeared to have some effect on the physicians' attitudes.
      Interestingly, Protestant physicians were more likely to
      recommend routine circumcision, while Jewish physicians, for
      whom circumcision is a religious ritual, were more likely to
      make no recommendation.</p>

      <p class="text2">The most common reason given by the
      physician for recommending routine circumcision was "better
      hygiene". Good hygiene, however, can be maintained in the
      non-circumcised male if the parent and later the child are
      properly educated.</p>

      <p class="text2">There have been numerous studies in the
      literature attempting to prove or disprove that circumcision
      protects against various cancers. There is a growing body of
      evidence that circumcision does not protect against cancer of
      the cervix or cancer of the prostate. Handley<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup>in 1936 was the first to suggest a
      link between cervical cancer and non-circumcision. He found
      that cervical cancer was less common among women whose
      husbands were circumcised. Khanolkar,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> however, found just the opposite
      result in a different population. He showed that there was
      more cervical cancer in one group of women whose husbands
      were circumcised when compared with another whose husbands
      were not. Here, hygiene may have been an important factor.
      Herpesvirus type 2 has been more recently implicated as
      playing a major role in causing cervical cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> Women who have had multiple sex
      partners, who began having sexual intercourse at an early
      age, and who have had other venereal diseases are all at an
      increased risk for cervical cancer. Noncircumcision appears
      to play no primary role in the etiology of cervical cancer.
      <span class="cirp">[CIRP note: This article is from 1982. The
      American Cancer Society has advised the AAP by <a
      href="/library/statements/letters/1996-02_ACS/">letter
      dated February 16, 1996</a> that circumcision should not be
      promoted as a preventive measure for penile or cervical
      cancer.]</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Ravich<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> tried
      to link prostatic cancer to noncircumcision by showing a
      higher rate of cancer in his non-Jewish patients than in his
      Jewish patients. However, he failed to match these two groups
      for age. This is especially important since prostatic cancer
      becomes more common with advancing age. There are no other
      studies that convincingly show a relationship between
      noncircumcision and prostatic cancer.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is an association, however, between
      lack of circumcision and carcinoma of the penis. Penile
      cancer is rare in circumcised men. It is also rare in
      cultures where men practice good hygiene, for example in
      Sweden. Hygiene appears to offer as much protection against
      this cancer as circumcision does. <span class="cirp">[CIRP
      note: This article is from 1982. For a more recent view on
      the etiology of penile cancer see: <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">Cold CJ,
      Storms MR, Van Howe RS. Carcinoma in situ of the penis in a
      76-year-old circumcised man. J Fam Pract 1997;44(4)
      407-409</a>.]</span></p>

      <p>Despite this evidence, a substantial number of physicians
      in our survey recommended circumcision to "prevent cancer."
      There are several possible explanations: the physicians may
      be poorly informed; they may not have found the data
      convincing; or they were swayed by the beliefs of the
      population they serve.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Only half of the
      physicians were aware of the AAP's recommendation,</span>
      which may account for the position of some. Since this
      recommendation is more likely to appear in the pediatric and
      obstetric literature, it is not surprising that this group is
      more knowledgeable. However, knowledge of the AAP's
      recommendation did not appear to affect a large number of
      physicians. About one third of those who knew of the
      recommendation still recommended circumcision routinely.</p>

      <p class="text2">Also, a number of physicians did not discuss
      the AAP's recommendation with the parents. This raises the
      question as to how many of the physicians, in compliance with
      current practice, discussed the risks and possible
      complications of circumcision with the parents. Lovell and
      Cox<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> found that 80% of the
      mothers they surveyed had not had the risks of circumcision
      explained to them. Is, then, the AAP's intent of an
      educationally informed consent being fulfilled? In our study,
      certainly most of the hospitals had no educational programs.
      The two hospitals that did have such a program showed a
      decrease in the incidence of circumcision. These statistics
      are interesting, but represent two few hospitals to draw any
      real conclusions.</p>

      <p class="text2">It would appear from this study that if the
      AAP wishes to make an impact on the circumcision decision,
      they will have to organize educational programs aimed at
      pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practitioners.
      Educational material should be made available to pregnant
      women. Parents-to-be should have the opportunity to discuss
      their decision in advance of delivery. Only then can a
      properly informed decision be made by the family.</p>

      <h3 align="center">CONCLUSION</h3>

      <p class="text2">The AAP's 1975 statement that there is no
      medical indication for circumcision has had little impact on
      the practice of circumcision in the Chicago area. This is
      because many factors other than strict medical opinions
      govern pediatricians', obstetricians', and family
      practitioners' attitudes about circumcision. Educational
      programs aimed at primary care physicians, expectant parents,
      and the public at large should be established to allow for
      decisions based on informed consent.</p>
