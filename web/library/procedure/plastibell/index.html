      <h1>What Happens During Circumcision?</h1>
      <img src="/gif/hline.png" />

      <p><b>New</b> A video clip showing part of the
      circumcision<br />
      procedure (including audio) is now available.<br />
      (From the film "Nurses of St Vincent" by Barry
      Ellsworth)<br />

      <p>This is a Circumstraint. It has Velcro straps to restrain
      the baby's arms and legs so that he cannot move.</p>

      <p>The area is prepared with Betadine, an antiseptic.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="05drape.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>A surgical drape is placed over the baby. (In this
      illustration,<br />
      the normal infant penis can be seen, with its foreskin
      covering.)</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p>Some doctors will use local anaesthesia, but this is by no
      means common. Anaesthetic injections will cause the penis to
      swell, causing pain and making the surgery more difficult.
      Both injections and topical anaesthetic creams can be
      dangerous. General anaesthesia is never used on young babies
      because of the risk of breathing problems.</p>

      <p><img src="06stretch.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>The foreskin opening in a newborn is normally very small,
      to prevent the entry<br />
      of foreign matter (<i>eg.</i> fecal matter). The first stage
      of circumcision is to grasp<br />
      the foreskin with forceps, and widen the opening.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="07lysis.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>The foreskin is normally attached to the glans by a
      membrane called the synechia.<br />
      The glans and inner lining of the foreskin are still
      developing in the young child.<br />
      During circumcision, the synechia must be torn apart.
      Naturally, this is painful.</p>

      <p><img src="ouch.gif" width="480" height="257" /></p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="08clamping.jpg" width="320" height="240" /><img
      src="09cutting.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>The foreskin is clamped. A slit is made in the dorsal side
      of the foreskin.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="10retracted.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>The slit is separated and the foreskin is laid back,
      exposing the raw and bleeding glans.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="11plastibell.jpg" width="320"
      height="240" /><img src="12securing.jpg" width="320"
      height="240" /></p>

      <p>A PlastiBell of appropriate size is slipped over the
      glans, and the foreskin is laid over it.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="13tying.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>A ligature is tied in the ridge of the bell, as tightly as
      possible around the foreskin.<br />
      Oozing will occur if the ligature is loose.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="14slicing.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>After one or two minutes to allow for crush, the foreskin
      is sliced off at the distal edge of the ligature using a
      knife or scissors. The surgeon trims as much tissue as
      possible to reduce the amount of necrotic tissue and the
      possibility of infection. The handle of the bell is snapped
      off at this time.</p>

      <p><img src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <p><img src="15too-late.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></p>

      <p>The rim of tissue will become necrotic (dead) and separate
      with the bell in 5 to 10 days. Occasionally, edema (swelling)
      will trap the plastic ring on the shaft of the penis. In this
      case it's usually necessary to cut off the ring, using a
      guide and ring cutter, although application of ice will
      sometimes reduce edema enough to remove the ring.</p>

      <p>Circumcision removes (on average) one third of the penile
      skin system (sensitive inner and outer preputial layers),
      including the peripenic dartos muscle, the frenar band, and
      part of the frenulum. To understand more about these
      structures and what they are for, please visit <a

      <p>The Plastibell procedure, like the <a
      href="../gomco/">Gomco</a>, takes 10-12 minutes or more to
      completion.</p>
