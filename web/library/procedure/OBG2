       CIRCUMCISION: A SURVEY OF FEES AND PRACTICES

Who's more likely to use anesthetic for circumcision - male
or female Ob/Gyns?  Our poll answers that question and
reveals how fees differ by region and physician age.

Ob-Gyns' fees for circumcision range from $0 to $400,
averaging $137 nationwide, according to an OBG MANAGEMENT
survey of more than 200 physicians.  The survey found that
fees are highest in New Jersey ($237.50, on average), New
York, Maryland and other Atlantic seaboard states.  By
contrast, several physicians in the Midwest, Deep South and
Southwest changed $50 to 75.

How circumcision fees vary across America
----------------------------------------------------------
Average circumcision fees in each of ACOG's nine
geographical districts range from $204 in the
middle-Atlantic states to $98 in the West.

information is presented here as a table.]

New England                               $134
New York State                            $179
Mid Atlantic                              $204
Southeast                                 $138
Midwest                                   $89
Northern Plains                           $157
Southern Plains and Texas                 $113
West except California                    $98
California                                $143
----------------------------------------------------------
       The youngest Ob/Gyns tend to charge the most for
circumcision; the oldest, the least.  The average fee for
respondents age 34 and younger is $182, as opposed to $81
for physicians 65 and older.  Ob/Gyns in the 35-to-44 group
have the second highest average fee, $144, while the mean
fees for respondents age 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 are $125 and
$134 respectively.

       Seventy-four percent of the Ob/Gyns surveyed perform
circumcision.  Several of those who do not reported that
they used to do circs.  Many stopped when they dropped
obstetrics.  Others, while still doing deliveries, have
decided to let pediatricians handle the procedure.
----------------------------------------------------------
The highs and lows of circ fees.

While 4 percent of Ob/Gyns perform circumcision at no
charge, three times as many of their colleagues set their
fees for the procedure at $250 or more.

       $250 to $400                12%
       $140 to $249                27%
       $100 to $149                36%
       $1   to $99                 21%
       $0                           4%
----------------------------------------------------------
       A distinct minority - 14 percent - of those currently
performing circumcision use anesthetic.  Use of anesthetic
was more prevalent among female physicians, 20 percent of
whom reported utilizing it for the procedure.  The survey
found no other appreciable differences in male and female
Ob-Gyns' circumcision fees and practices.

WHO'S MOST LIKELY TO DO CIRCS

       Ob/Gyns aged 34 or younger are the physicians most
likely to perform circumcision and least likely to use
anesthetic.  Eighty-three percent of the respondents in that
age group said they do the procedure, but only 4 percent
reported that they use anesthetic.

       Despite the ongoing controversy about "intactness"
thats being played out on talk shows and in parenting
magazines, the Ob/Gyns said that the overwhelming majority
of male infants they deliver are circumcised in the first
month of life.  Most survey participants put that figure at
90% or more of the baby boys they delivered, while a handful
of lower responses pulled the average down to 82 percent.
