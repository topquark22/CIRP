      <p>Re: Mansfield CJ, Hueston WJ, Rudy M. Neonatal
      circumcision: associated factors and length of hospital stay.
      <cite>J Fam Pract</cite> 1995; 41: 370-6.</p>

      <p>To the Editor:</p>

      <p>Prolonged hospital stays resulting from infant male
      circumcision [<a href="#n1">1</a>] may only increase as
      perinatal hospitalizations continue to shorten. A recent case
      at our institution exemplifies this.</p>

      <p>A boy born vaginally at 37 weeks gestation to a 31 year
      old Gravida 3 Para 3 mother with Apgars of 8 and 9 and a
      birth weight of 2890 grams developed grunting, flaring, and
      intercostal retractions at 5 hours of age. A chest x-ray
      confirmed transient tachypnea of the newborn, and he was
      placed on oxygen. He was weaned to room air by 10 hours of
      age. At 20 hours of age he was circumcised by the
      obstetrician. Following the procedure the baby had difficulty
      nursing resulting in a weight loss to 2595 grams (89% of
      birth weight). By the fourth day the baby began to nurse well
      and was discharged. Newborn males respond to circumcision
      with a marked reduction in oxygenation during the
      procedure,[<a href="#n2">2</a>] and a cortisol surge,[<a
      href="#n3">3</a>] decreased wakefulness,[<a href="#n4">4</a>]
      increased vagal tone,[<a href="#n5">5</a>] and less
      interactions with their environment[<a href="#n6">6</a>]
      following the procedure. All of these hinder the
      maternal-infant bonding process that makes breastfeeding
      possible. With shortened perinatal hospitalizations, there is
      a rush to have boys circumcised within 24 hour hours of age
      to facilitate timely discharge. The health of the boy is
      often secondary as demonstrated by the short time from
      weaning to room air and the procedure being performed. The
      degree to which circumcision adversely affected this baby's
      ability to nurse is not clear, but it may be partially or
      completely responsible for the "prolonged" stay.</p>

      <p>Not too long ago, male infants were routinely circumcised
      in the delivery room. This practice was discontinued only
      after the adverse effects were published.[<a
      href="#n7">7</a>] With shortened perinatal hospitalizations,
      will we regress toward delivery room circumcisions? In 1989
      the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that, "Circumcision
      is contraindicated in an unstable or sick infant. . . .
      Infants who have demonstrated an uncomplicated transition to
      extrauterine life are considered stable. Signs of stability
      include normal feeding and elimination and maintenance of
      normal body temperature without an incubator or radiant
      warmer. A period of observation may allow for recognition of
      abnormalities or illnesses (e.g., hyperbilirubinemia,
      infection, or manifest bleeding disorder) that should he
      addressed before elective surgery."[<a href="#n8">8</a>] If
      one follows this standard in an era of 24 hour perinatal
      hospital stays, are inpatient neonatal circumcisions
      possible?</p>
