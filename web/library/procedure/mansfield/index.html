      <h2>Neonatal circumcision: associated factors and length of
      hospital stay</h2>

      <p><b>Christopher J. Mansfield, William J. Hueston, Mary
      Rudy</b><br />
       <i>Greenville, North Carolina; Eau Claire and Madison,
      Wisconsin; and Morehead, Kentucky</i></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><i>Background.</i> Controversy exists regarding the
        efficacy of routine neonatal circumcision of male infants.
        Little is known about parental or provider characteristics
        or the use of medical resources associated with this
        procedure.</p>

        <p><i>Methods.</i> Records of 3703 male infants born during
        1990 and 1991 at four US sites were analyzed to discern
        associations between circumcision and the above factors.
        Analyses were limited to healthy infants.</p>

        <p><i>Results.</i> Eighty-five percent of the infants in
        the study population were circumcised. White and
        African-American male infants were much more likely to be
        circumcised than those of other races (odds ratios [ORs],
        7.3 and 7.1, respectively, <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Compared with
        self-pay patients, those covered by private insurance were
        2.5 times more likely to be circumcised (<i>P</i>&lt;.001).
        Logistic regression showed that rates for obstetricians and
        family physicians were not significantly different.
        Increased odds of circumcision were found if the mother
        received an episiotomy (OR=1.9, <i>P</i>&lt;.001) or
        cesarean section (OR=2.1, <i>P</i>&lt;.001).</p>

        <p>Circumcised infants stayed in the hospital an average of
        one fourth of a day longer than did those who were not
        circumcised (mean difference, 0.26 days; 95% confidence
        interval, 0.16 to 0.36).</p>

        <p><i>Conclusions.</i> Mother's insurance status and race
        as well as surgical interventions during delivery are
        related to circumcision. Associations with episiotomy and
        cesarean section suggest physician and/or parental
        preference for interventional approaches to health care.
        Generalizing the difference in hospital length of stay to
        the United States suggests an annual cost between $234
        million and $527 million beyond charges for the procedure
        itself.</p>

        <p><i>Key words.</i> Circumcision; infant, newborn; male;
        socioeconomic factors; cesarean section; episiotomy;
        specialties, medical, length of stay; hospital costs. (<i>J
        Fam Pract</i> 1995; 41:370-376)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Although circumcision is the most commonly performed
      surgical procedure in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> there is no clear evidence of efficacy
      for routinely performing it on newborn male infants. The
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on the Fetus
      and Newborn stated in 1971 that "there are no valid medical
      indications for circumcision in the newborn period."<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> The AAP reiterated this position in
      1975<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and the American College
      of Obstetrics and Gynecology adopted it in 1983.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>Because of evidence suggesting that circumcision may have
      a protective effect on the occurrence of urinary tract
      infection (UTI),<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> sexually
      transmitted disease (STD), and cancer of the cervix
      (associated with the human papillomavirus), the AAP Task
      Force on Circumcision modified its position in 1989. It
      stated, however, that the evidence regarding UTI is tentative
      and that evidence relating to STDS is conflicting. Noting
      that pain and resultant behavior changes in the infant have
      been reported, the Task Force cited studies that allowed it
      to estimate a complication rate between 0.2% and 0.6%. It
      concluded that newborn circumcision has potential medical
      benefits and advantages, as well as disadvantages and risks.
      The Task Force recommended that parents be well informed and
      advised before making the decision.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p>The longstanding controversy surrounding the efficacy of
      routine neonatal circumcision in the United States
      continues.<sup><a href="#n8">8-14</a></sup> It currently
      centers principally on the claims of prophylactic efficacy
      with regard to prevention of UTI<sup><a
      href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> and the risk of contracting
      STDs.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Although they would be
      difficult to conduct, controlled prospective studies were
      recommended as early as 1966.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18,19</a></sup> Results of recent decision
      analyses and cost-efectiveness analyses do not support the
      procedure's efficacy. Lawler et al<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> reported a cost-efectiveness study
      that found virtually no difference in lifetime cost of
      circumcision vs no circumcision and a theoretic benefit of
      only 10 days of additional life afforded by circumcision. A
      cost-utility analysis by Ganiats <i>et al</i><sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> suggests that any medical advantage
      is canceled out by financial disadvantage and recommends, as
      did Lawler, that decisions should be made based on personal,
      cultural, or religious factors.</p>

      <p>Given the lack of consensus about the efficacy of routine
      neonatal male infant circumcision and increased concern about
      cost containment, an understanding of length of stay and
      other factors associated with choosing the procedure would be
      useful. There are no reported studies of the effect of
      circumcision on length of stay, and the literature on
      socioeconomic and other parental characteristics related to
      circumcision is spare. A few studies that have been published
      report international rates for circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> prevalence by race and income among
      US adults in the late 1960s,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
      incidence in Illinois hospitals in 1979,<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> and demographic data for infants
      born in New York State between 1980 and 1986,<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> but little has been reported about
      the association of circumcision with socioeconomic
      characteristics of the parents. Only two studies of the
      characteristics of physicians performing the procedure<sup><a
      href="#n25">25,26</a></sup> were found. They report a
      difference between pediatricians' and family physicians'
      attitudes about the procedure. No study comparing the
      frequency with which this procedure is performed by
      obstetricians and family physicians in the United States has
      been reported.</p>

      <p>There is, however, considerable literature describing
      variation in surgical rates and other health services related
      to provider characteristics.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27-33</a></sup> Training in obstetrics is more
      surgically oriented than that in family medicine, and
      midwives are noted for employing minimal intervention.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> Are healthy male infants more likely
      to be circumcised if delivered by obstetricians than by
      family physicians? By midwives? Is circumcision associated
      with other surgical interventions in the delivery process or
      with the use of high-cost, sophisticated anesthesia during
      labor and delivery?</p>

      <p>The association of neonatal male circumcision with
      sociodemographic characteristics of the mother, specialty of
      provider attending birth, and clinical procedures employed
      during labor and delivery were examined in this study. It was
      hypothesized that circumcision is performed more commonly on
      healthy infants born to mothers who: have insurance; are
      white; are married; obtained their care from an obstetrician
      vs a family physician or from a physician vs a nurse midwife;
      gave birth by cesarean section; had an episiotomy; or
      received epidural anesthesia in the delivery process. The
      association between circumcision and length of the newborn
      infant's stay in the hospital also was examined.</p>

      <p><b>Methods</b></p>

      <p>Medical records for 7138 labor and delivery admissions
      occurring at four hospitals during the period January 1, 1990
      to December 31, 1991 were abstracted by labor and delivery
      nurses or trained personnel. The hospitals, located in
      Michigan, South Dakota, Kentucky, and North Carolina, were
      selected for diversity. Two of the hospitals are nonprofit
      community hospitals, one is a church-operated community
      hospital, and one is a public hospital that serves as the
      primary teaching facility for a state-supported medical
      school. Two hospitals are in metropolitan statistical areas;
      the other two are in rural areas. Cases were selected using a
      computer-generated random number sequence to sample 80 births
      per month at each of the sites. When fewer than 80 deliveries
      occurred during a given month, all deliveries for that month
      were included in the sample. Infant records were matched with
      the mother's records, and data were abstracted from both. The
      main outcome measure was whether a circumcision was performed
      during the newborn infant's hospital stay.</p>

      <p>The study was conceptualized as an historical cohort
      analysis. Independent variables of interest in this report
      are maternal race and marital status, method of payment,
      infant's birthweight and length of hospital stay, provision
      of neonatal intensive care, specialty of attending physician,
      and whether the mother received epidural anesthesia or an
      episiotomy, or gave birth by cesarean section. Data measuring
      the variables of interest were unambiguous, uniformly
      available, and believed to be accurately reported in charts.
      Parents' religion was not consistently recorded at all sites
      and therefore was not reported. Method of payment was
      included to serve as a proxy measure of patient income
      status, for which data were not available. Method of payment
      was recorded as private insurance, health maintenance
      organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO),
      Medicaid or other public insurance, self-pay, or other. It
      was assumed that self-pay patients were poor. "Provider" was
      defined as the individual who initially cared for the patient
      in labor, regardless of who attended delivery or performed
      delivery procedures.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> "Healthy
      infants" were defined as those who did not have low
      birthweight, were not admitted to intensive care, and were
      discharged home.</p>

      <p>All variables except birthweight were categorical. The
      categorical variables were analyzed by table analysis to
      calculate rates and chi-square. Birthweight of &lt;2500 g was
      considered low. All statistics were calculated using SPSS
      (SPSS for Windows, Release 6.0. SPSS, Inc, Chicago, 111). A
      .05 level of statistical significance was established.
      Following bivariate analysis, multiple logistic regression
      was employed to compute odds ratios (ORs) and confidence
      intervals (CIs), controlling for each of the other
      significant independent variables, and to explore predictive
      models. Forward stepwise entry was employed on a predictive
      model using data from all sites, entering categorical
      variables with statistical significance of [less than or
      equal to] .05. Nurse midwives were not considered in the
      regression model because they were represented at only one
      site. Length of stay was examined using a t test for
      difference of means, chi-square for the association of
      circumcision with short vs long stays, and stepwise multiple
      regression to discern the independent effect of circumcision
      on length of hospital stay.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p>Of the 7138 births, 3702 (52%) were male infants.
      Eighty-four percent of the mothers were white; 13% were
      African American. American Indian, Hispanics, and Asians each
      constituted approximately 1% of the sample.</p>

      <p>Seventy-four percent of mothers were married; 23% were
      single; 3% were divorced. Fifty-eight percent had private
      insurance (including HMOs); 38% had Medicaid or other public
      insurance; and, 4% were self-pay patients. Only 8% were
      enrolled in HMOs, with the percentage varying between 26% at
      the Michigan site and 2% or less at the other three. There
      was no significant difference in circumcision rates between
      those covered by HMOs (91:5%) and other private insurance
      (89.7%).</p>

      <p>In 55% of the births, the attending physician was an
      obstetrician, while in 33% the physician's specialty was
      family medicine. Ten percent of births were attended by a
      nurse midwife, all at one site.</p>

      <p>Care at the four sites was provided by a total of 125
      obstetricians, 163 family physicians, and 11 midwives.
      Overall, the cesarean section rate was 21%, ranging between
      16% and 27% among the four sites. Sixty-three percent of
      deliveries involved an episiotomy (range, 39% to 79%).
      Epidural anesthesia to manage maternal pain in the labor and
      delivery period was used in 6.3% of all cases (range, 3.5% to
      11.0%).</p>

      <p>Overall, 85% of the male infants were circumcised. The
      circumcision rate ranged from 78% to 94% among the sites. An
      association between circumcision and infant health was
      evident overall and at three of the four sites.
      Low-birthweight infants and those admitted to a neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) were much less likely to be
      circumcised. Only 62% of infants admitted to NICU were
      circumcised, compared with 88% of those who were not
      (P&lt;.001).</p>

      <p>The following analyses involves only healthy infants
      (n=3258, 88% of all male infants). The overall circumcision
      rate for healthy infants was 88.4%. Table I shows the
      relationship between circumcision and maternal
      characteristics, type of provider, type of delivery,
      episiotomy, and use of epidural anesthesia. Statistically
      significant associations between circumcision and six of the
      variables were found. There was no significant difference
      according to marital status but there was for insurance
      status. Infants in the self-pay category were less likely to
      be circumcised than were those whose birth was covered by
      private insurance (80.0% vs 92.2%, P&lt;.001). There was also
      a difference in the proportion circumcised for those covered
      by Medicaid (83.0%) vs private insurance (92.2%,
      P&lt;.001).</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>There was no statistically significant difference in
      overall circumcision rates for white compared with
      African-American infants but there was for those of other
      racial/ethnic groups compared with whites. For those in the
      "other" category, ie, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American,
      the rate was 51.4% for all sites combined, compared with
      89.6% for whites (P&lt;.001). There was marked site-to-site
      variation in both the proportion of African-American births
      and circumcision rates for these infants. At the North
      Carolina site, 45% of the healthy male. infants were African
      American and the circumcision rate for these was 86%. At the
      South Dakota and Kentucky sites, less than 1% were African
      American and virtually all were circumcised. At the Michigan
      site, African Americans constituted only 3.5% of the male
      infants but 100% were circumcised.</p>

      <p>The difference in the percentage circumcised according to
      type of birth was small (3.1 percentage points) but
      significant (90.9% if cesarean vs 87.8% if vaginal,
      P&lt;.05). For those whose mothers received an episiotomy,
      90.9% were circumcised compared with 85.4% if not
      (P&lt;.001). Among healthy male infants born to women who had
      epidural anesthesia, 94.8% were circumcised, compared with
      87.9% whose mothers did not have an epidural (Plt;.01).</p>

      <p>The bivariate analysis also revealed significant
      associations according to provider type and physician
      specialty. Of those whose birth was attended by a midwife
      (all at one site), 81.0% were circumcised, compared with
      89.3% of those delivered by physicians (Plt;.001). If the
      attending physician was an obstetrician, 90.5% of the infants
      were circumcised, compared with 87.6% of those delivered by
      family practice physicians (P&lt;.05).</p>

      <p>The logistic regression model applied to data for healthy
      infants from all sites did not include midwives as a
      covariate but did include physician specialty. The model does
      not substantiate a difference associated with physician
      specialty. Neither does it show a difference associated with
      use of epidural anesthesia. It does, however, show cesarean
      section and episiotomy to be independently associated with
      substantially increased odds of circumcision (Table 2). The
      regression model fit the overall data well, correctly
      classifying 89.6% of the cases (model [[&chi;].sup.2] = 121;
      6 degrees of freedom [df]). The model also fit the data well
      when applied to three of the individual sites: 72.8 (6 df),
      33.2 (5 df), and 22.3 (4 df). In this model, each surgical
      intervention was independently associated with approximately
      double the likelihood of circumcision. This phenomenon was
      also evident and significant at two of the four sites.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>If the mother had a cesarean section, the odds ratio for
      all sites combined was 2.07 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.01). If the
      mother had an episiotomy, it was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.45 to 2.53).
      At one of the sites where cesarean section was associated
      with circumcision, the odds ratio for cesarean section was
      5.58 (95% CI, 1.86 to 17.28); at the other, it was 2.45 (95%
      CI., 1.26 to 4.75). For episiotomy, the odds ratio at one
      site was 2.20 (95% CI, 1.33 to 3.63); at another site, the
      odds ratio was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.13 to 4.05). Race other than
      white or African American was clearly a predictor of lower
      likelihood of circumcision. Compared with infants in the
      other race category, whites and African Americans were both
      about seven times more likely to be circumcised.</p>

      <p>Payment source was also a significant factor, predicting
      substantially lower likelihood of circumcision for those in
      the self-pay or Medicaid categories. The odds ratio if the
      mother had private insurance was 2.47, compared with a
      self-pay patient (95% CI, 1.42 to 4.28). The difference in
      odds between those in the Medicaid vs the self-pay category
      was not significant. Those covered by Medicaid were about
      half as likely to be circumcised as those covered by private
      insurance.</p>

      <p>We found shorter lengths of stay among healthy infants who
      were not circumcised (Table 3). The mean length of the
      infant's stay was 2.21 days if circumcised; 1.95 days if not.
      The difference, 0.26 days, was statistically significant (95%
      CI, 0.16 to 0.36). This relationship was noted across all
      payment groups except HMOs and PPOs, for both cesarean and
      vaginal deliveries, and regardless of whether the mother
      received an episiotomy. A large difference in the proportion
      circumcised was noted, particularly for the 2265 vaginally
      delivered, healthy infants staying 1 day, compared with those
      staving 2 days or more. Twenty-eight percent stayed only 1
      day. For these, the circumcision rate was 8 1.9% vs 90.1% for
      those staying 2 days or more. Conversely, 41.7% of those not
      circumcised went home in 1 day as compared with only 25.9% of
      those who were circumcised. This difference was statistically
      significant (&chi;<sup>2</sup>=35.4, 1 <i>df</i>,
      <i>P</i>&lt;. 001. The association of circumcision with
      length of stay, independent of the variables which were shown
      to predict circumcision itself, was determined by regressing
      the natural log of infant length of stay on circumcision and
      the variables from the logistic model. These independent
      variables, cesarean section, episiotomy, source of payment,
      race, and circumcision, were all retained in the multiple
      regression equation, which explained 35% of the variance

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p>The effect of lack of private insurance on utilization of
      hospital services is frequently reported, and others<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> have reported circumcision rates for
      Medicaid patients in a single state. However, the
      associations of insurance status categories with circumcision
      reported here are new findings. These relationships hold even
      after controlling for race/ethnic groups. Though there was no
      measure of economic status, Medicaid and self-pay payment
      sources may be a proxy measure for income status or wealth.
      If that assumption is accepted, one could conclude that the
      poor are only half as likely to be circumcised.</p>

      <p>The geographic variation in rates for African Americans is
      a new finding that should be further explored. It suggests
      caution in generalizing findings about the use of health
      services by African Americans based on limited geographic
      data. It also suggests further study of the reasons for
      variation in the rate of circumcision among African
      Americans.</p>

      <p>We did not find data to support a link between
      circumcision and the use of epidural anesthesia for managing
      maternal pain during labor and delivery. The hypothesis of an
      association with other surgical interventions in the delivery
      process, however, cannot be rejected. The independent
      associations of cesarean section and episiotomy with
      circumcision are substantiated by the aggregate data and by
      data from two of the individual sites. There was a
      statistical relationship between these three surgical
      procedures. If the mother received either an episiotomy or a
      cesarean section, both of which may be performed more
      frequently than clinically necessary, the infant was twice as
      likely to be circumcised. It would be useful to examine
      patterns of procedures performed by individual physicians to
      better understand interventionist practice styles.</p>

      <p>Because it is possible that some mothers or fathers are
      predisposed to more or less intervention in the birth and
      neonatal process as well, it is important to gain a better
      understanding of their expectations. It is quite likely that
      much of the variability in incidence of circumcision could be
      explained by customs of circumcision within families,
      religious beliefs, cultural attitudes, and beliefs of
      parents. Similar examination of the beliefs and attitudes of
      physicians, particularly with regard to perceived medical
      efficacy is warranted. A principal limitation of this study
      is that data to answer these questions are not available in
      the typical medical record. Another limitation is that we did
      not have access to data on the incidence of circumcision
      after the neonatal hospital stay. Both limitations are
      inherent in retrospective studies.</p>

      <p>The finding in this study of an association with increased
      length of stay is important and deserves further evaluation.
      These were randomly selected, healthy infants. The effect was
      noted for infants delivered both vaginally and by cesarean
      section, across sources of payment and regardless of whether
      an episiotomy was performed. We cannot say that circumcision
      is the only variable likely to systematically account for the
      longer stay, but it appears to have an impact independent of
      other factors that commonly affect length of stay. Using an
      estimate of $700 for the daily room charge for maternity care
      and $200 per day for newborn care, additional charges beyond
      the cost of the procedure itself at these four hospitals
      annually are calculated to be between $793,419 and $1,785,240
      (7115 male births x 88% healthy x 88% circumcised x [0.26
      days [+ or -]0.10] x $900/day). If this finding were
      generalized to the United States, the annual national impact
      would be somewhere between $234 million and $527 million
      (2,100,000 male births X 88% X 88% X [0.26 [+ or -] 0.10] X
      $900/day). We do not know why circumcised infants were kept
      in the hospital for a longer time. It may be due to
      complications, waiting for a physician to perform the
      procedure, or other reasons. A cost difference of the
      magnitude suggested here deserves further study and
      accentuates the question of whether this procedure, which has
      little medical justification, should be routinely paid for by
      health insurance.</p>

      <p>Additional study of physician practice styles and the
      roles of parents' culture, religion, personal preference, and
      expectations would also be useful. Considering the procedure
      as a health insurance benefit, how sensitive is the consumer
      to price? Would parents still consider the procedure
      important if they, rather than their insurers, had to pay for
      it? The rate of circumcision within the self-pay category in
      these data suggests substantial sensitivity to price.
      Regardless of whether routine circumcision should be included
      as a health insurance benefit, health service administrators
      and planners should consider whether staffing arrangements or
      other factors delay the procedure. Do complications produce
      delays in discharge? Should routine circumcision be an
      outpatient procedure? Should it be performed by nonphysician
      providers? Should it continue to be routinely performed?</p>
