      <h1>Decreased Circumcision Rate With Videotaped<br />
       Counseling*</h1>

      <h3>ROBERT W. ENZENAUER, MD, MPH, JOHN M. POWELL, MD, THOMAS
      E. WISWELL, MD,<br />
       and JAMES W. BASS, MD, Honolulu, Hawaii</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <small><b>ABSTRACT: Despite the lack of medical indication
        for routine circumcision in the newborn, neonatal
        circumcision continues to be done on the vast majority of
        male infants in the United States. A trial of videotaped
        "informed consent" counseling was undertaken to determine
        whether such counseling could affect the parental choice
        about circumcision. We studied the circumcision frequency
        rate (CFR) after videotape counseling. We compared it to
        the rates following standard oral counseling. Videotaped
        counseling, in contrast to the standard physician-parent
        oral counseling, significantly reduced the<br />
         incidence of parents' requests for routine neonatal
        circumcision.</b></small>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Since 1975, the American Academy of Pediatrics' position
      on circumcision is that "there is no absolute medical
      indication for routine circumcision of the newborn."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The decision to perform routine
      circumcision should be made after the parents have been
      properly counseled regarding the risks and benefits of the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n1">1-2</a></sup> Frequently,
      however, parent are either not properly counseled or not
      counseled at all.<sup><a href="#n2">2-5</a></sup></p>

      <p>The anti-circumcision movement is now supported by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      and the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Non professional
      groups such as INTACT are now lending support. Additionally,
      circumcision as an unnecessary position is gaining attention
      in the popular lay pres.<sup><a href="#n6">6,7-13</a></sup>
      Despite the abundance of of medical evidence and opinion
      against the procedure, most clinicians still recommend
      routine neonatal circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> and there has been no substantial
      decline in the percentage of male infants circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,14</a></sup> At our institution, the neonatal
      circumcision rate has remained essentially unchanged (at
      approximately %) during the last decade.</p>

      <p>Patient education using printed materials has only rarely
      resulted in the reduction of the neonatal circumcision
      rate,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> and most authors have
      concluded that detailed counseling makes no difference in the
      incidence of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16-20</a></sup></p>

      <p>Audiovisual counseling for certain routine, non-emergency
      surgical conditions is gaining popularity.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> A videotaped presentation ensures
      uniformity, especially in cooperative studies, and provides
      documentation of the degree of informed consent. In contrast
      to written and oral counseling, videotaped counseling is more
      applicable for various educational levels of parents.</p>

      <p>We hypothesized that circumcision counseling using
      videotaped presentations would be effective in reducing the
      frequency of routine neonatal circumcision. We designed a
      clinical trial to test this hypothesis.</p>

      <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>

      <p>A videotape summarizing factors relating to neonatal
      circumcision was prepared. The videotape included the major
      points of the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Circumcision
      Statement of 1975.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Specifically
      mentioned was the fact that there is no medical indication
      for routine neonatal circumcision. Complications of routine
      circumcision, absolute contraindications to neonatal
      circumcision, and a description of the circumcision using the
      Plastibell device (Hollister, Inc., Chicago, Ill) were also
      included. Additionally, official permission was obtained from
      NBC, Inc. to present Douglas Kiker's <i>NBC News Magazine</i>
      commentary, "Circumcision: The Casual Cut," which aired in
      November 1981.</p>

      <p>In the experimental group, all parents of male children
      born between Jan 1, 1982 and June 30, 1982 were required to
      view the two video tapes before deciding for or against
      routine circumcision. The counseling was usually done within
      36 hours after birth, in the evening of the first or second
      day of hospitalization. Both parents were required to attend.
      A house officer was present to answer questions.</p>

      <p>In the control group, parents of all male children born
      during the six months after the initial intervention were
      counseled about circumcision by the house officer on call,
      without the videotape presentations. The counseling included
      an explanation of the procedure and its risks and benefits,
      but no specific instructions were given to direct their
      "informed consent" circumcision counseling. These oral
      presentations represented the same method of counseling that
      had been practiced before untaking the study.</p>

      <p>The circumcision frequency rate (CFR) refers to the
      percentage of newborns circumcised during a given period. The
      circumcision frequency rate of the videotape-counseled group
      (the "experimental group") was compared with that of the
      control group. Additionally, the CFR of the experi--mental
      group was compared with that of the circumcision data from
      previous years at our institution, along with data from the
      year after completion of the study. Circumcision data
      obtained from a local civilian children's hospital were also
      evaluated. Data were tested for significance using chi-square
      analysis.</p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <p>The 70.5% circumcision rate in the experimental group was
      significantly less than the average rate of 90% which
      characterized the previous years at our institution (<i>P</i>
      &lt; .001) (Table 1). The CFR of the experimental group was
      also significantly less than the 75.9% rate of the control
      group (<i>P/</i> &lt; .05). The CFR has increased steadily
      after the cessation of videotaped counseling. During the
      six-month period after the completion of the study, the CFR
      further increased to 94.0% (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). During the
      12-month period after the first comparison group, the CFR has
      increased to levels that characterized the decade preceding
      the study.</p>

      <p>During the study period the CFR at Kapiolani Children's
      Medical Center was essentially unchanged from what it had
      been during the previous nine years (Table 2) (D. Seto, MD,
      writen communication, September 1983).</p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p>Our results indicate that a videotaped presentation can
      effectively reduce the rate at which parents request
      circumcision. Videotaped counseling can markedly reduce
      physician time required to ensure informed consent.
      Videotaped counseling may help to ensure the consistency of
      counseling offered, and additionally may serve to protect the
      physician in litigation by documenting the material presented
      for making the informed consent.</p>

      <p>The experience at our hospital, however, also suggests
      that "outspoken" pediatricians can affect the circumcision
      rate, though to a lesser extent and only after much physician
      time and effort. The decreased circumcision rate in the 1981
      prestudy period (Table 3), though not perceived at the time,
      is no doubt the result of the vocal leadership by two senior
      pediatric residents (R.W.E. and J.M.P.), who aggressively
      counseled against neonatal circumcision to a wide audience.
      Formal didactic lectures, including slide presentations, were
      given to the pediatric house staff, obstetrical house staff,
      and the pediatric and obstetric nursing services. All
      rotating interns and family practice house staff were
      similarly instructed before their rotation through the
      pediatric department. This conceivably could have resulted in
      more active counseling in favor of non-circumcision during
      this period, and also more suitable "support" of the
      noncircumcision choice by the staff. A similar reduction in
      the neonatal CFR occurred in 1978 when another outspoken
      senior resident in pediatrics at Tripler Army Medical Center
      personally counseled all parents of newborns over a
      four-month period. (Table 4) (M.E. Holton, DO), written
      communication, January 1979).</p>

      <p>The gradual increase in the CFR after the sysematic
      videotaped counseling was discontinued is intriguing. An
      apparent "residual" effect on the CFR is apparent at least 12
      months after termination of the intervention. Several
      explanations for these findings are plausible. The prolonged
      reduced rate of circumcision is no doubt in part a function
      of "contamination" of the poststudy comparison groups by the
      experimental group families. Particularly in the context of
      the rather close social organization of an army post,
      information and opinion gleaned from the videotaped
      presentation may have been sytematically shared among other
      families with pregancies in progress. This form of bias would
      have been served to underestimate the true effect of the
      intervention by disseminating its effects into "control"
      group families having an infant later in the year.</p>

      <p>During the period of videotaped counseling, there was a
      noticably increased interest in the subject of neonatal
      circumcision amongst the non-physician postpartum staff.
      However, military life is characterized by frequent moves
      (every two or three years). A "washout" effect will be
      evident among the supporting professional staff in the
      postpartum unit as departing nurses and aides leave, being
      replaced by by individuals who were not exposed to the
      videotaped presentations for six months. There was
      considerable support by the hospital staff for the
      non-circumcision choice during the time when the videotapes
      were being aired.</p>

      <p>Since the NBC documentary was aired publicly in November
      1981, the decrease in CFR may instead represent a general
      effect on the population at large. However, no similar trend
      was evident in the local civilian population. The
      particularly low rates during the six-month intervention
      period could be viewed as a kind of anamnestic response to
      the second viewing of the NBC tape.</p>

      <p>Consistent, informative videotaped counseling can affect
      parental choice about circumcision as late as after delivery,
      but we believe that all parents should be counseled about the
      risks of circumcision long before delivery to allow enough
      time to deliberate and reach a fair and knowledgeable
      decision.</p>

      <p>Pediatricians should be outspoken child advocates. <span
      class="yellow">We strongly agree with Gellis<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> that physicians should become much
      more vigorous than they have been in discouraging
      circumcision of the newborn.</span> Wallerstein's conclusion
      is that "routine infant circumcision is archaic, useless,
      potentially dangerous, and therefore should cease."<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Videotaped counseling is perhaps a
      means to that end.</p>
