      <h2>Many Pediatricians Performing Circumcisions</h2>

      <h3>Survey Tells Who Is Making the Cuts</h3>
      By Nathan D. Childs<br />
      Staff Writer 

      <p><b>Washington</b> -- Thirty-five percent of pediatricians
      in the United States are routinely performing circumcisions,
      compared with 60% of family physicians and 70% of
      obstetricians, a national survey found.</p>

      <p>When the survey was presented here at the annual meeting
      of the Pediatric Academic Societies, the investigators
      expressed surprise at the number of pediatricians whoa re
      routinely circumcising infants.</p>

      <p>"Our impression is that lately more pediatricians are
      performing circumcisions, although because our survey was the
      first to look at [circumcision practice patterns], we cannot
      be sure," said pediatrician Howard J. Stang.</p>

      <p>Dr. Stang and Dr. Leonard W. Snellman, of HealthPartners
      Health Maintenance Organization in White Bear Lake, Minn.,
      analyzed 1,778 returned questionnaires sent to a nationally
      representative cohort of 3,500 pediatricians, family
      physicians, and obstetricians at the beginning of this
      year.</p>

      <p>Considering that the American Academy of Pediatrics is
      reconvening its Task Force on Circumcision this summer to
      reformulate its 1989 neutral policy statement on the
      procedure, Dr. Stang thinks the survey could not have come at
      a better time.</p>

      <p>In pediatrics and family medicine, the survey results
      point to a generation gap between circumcisers and those who
      don't do the procedure.</p>

      <p>The highest percentage of pediatricians and family
      physicians who perform the minor surgery have been in
      practice for less than 10 years. However, obstetricians of
      all ages perform the procedure with only a small difference
      between those who have been in practice for 20 years versus
      those who are just out of residency.</p>

      <p>Although pediatricians are still the smallest contingent
      of specializes who perform circumcisions, Dr. Stang believes
      that the perceived increase in interest in circumcision among
      young pediatricians could harken a new era of circumcision
      pain control.</p>

      <p>"We did not expect to find so may pediatricians performing
      circumcisions, but we did expect that those who did would be
      using anesthesia," Dr. Stang said in an interview.
      "Strikingly, it is pediatricians who are most likely to
      administer some form of anesthesia to infants when we
      circumcise."</p>

      <p>Of the 35% of pediatricians who circumcise, 71% us
      anesthetics, while only 56% of family physician circumcisers
      and 25% of obstetrician circumcisers use anesthetic.</p>

      <p>The most commonly used anesthetic/analgesic agents were
      dorsal penile block with lidocaine (83%), oral sucrose (16%),
      acetaminophen (16%), and EMLA cream (9%).</p>

      <p>A study presented a the meeting (see story below) found
      that dorsal penile nerve block provided better circumcision
      pain control than EMLA cream. According to Dr. Stang's
      survey, 86% of pediatricians who use an anesthetic during
      circumcision routinely use dorsal penile nerve block.</p>

      <p>"Anesthesia was most likely to be used by a recently
      trained pediatrician practicing in the western United
      States," Dr. Stang said during the poster presentation at the
      meeting. "It was least likely to be used by an obstetrician
      in the Northeast."</p>

      <p>The most often cited (54%) reason physicians in the survey
      offered for not giving anesthetic was concern about adverse
      effects. The second most popular reason (44%) was that they
      didn't think circumcision warranted anesthesia of any
      kind.</p>

      <p>In an ironic twist, the survey found that female
      pediatricians and family physicians are more likely to
      administer anesthetics to circumcision patients than their
      male counterparts.</p>

      <p>"This was surprising," quipped Dr. Stang. "We expected
      male physicians to have a keen appreciation for penile
      discomfort."</p>

      <h3>Any Anesthetic Better Than None for Baby's Pain</h3>

      <h2>EMLA Not As Effective as Nerve Block</h2>
      By Nathan D. Childs<br />
      Staff Writer 

      <p><b>Washington</b> -- A dorsal penile nerve block is more
      effective than the off-label use of EMLA cream to prevent
      pain in premature infants undergoing circumcision, Dr. Ronnie
      Guillet reported at the annual meeting of the Pediatric
      Academic Societies.</p>

      <p>In a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded study
      of 44 premature newborns, those who had a dorsal penile nerve
      block (DPNB) displayed less signs of obvious pain and had a
      minimal increase in heart rate during the procedure, compared
      with infants anesthetized with EMLA cream.</p>

      <p>Dr. Guillet and her colleagues at Strong Children's
      Research Center at the University of Rochester (N.Y.) found
      that the 21 infants who received topical EMLA (2.5%
      lidocaine, 2.5% prilocaine) 1 hour before circumcision cried
      more, had more strained facial expressions, and were more
      fussy and restless during the procedure than those who
      underwent DPNB.</p>

      <p>A control group of 20 infants were circumcised with out
      any anesthesia; all had maximal scores for observable pain
      and discomfort.</p>

      <p>"We endorse the use of anesthesia for neonatal
      circumcision," Megan Butler-O'Hara, R.N., a coauthor of the
      study said in the poster presentation at the meeting. "DPNB
      is certainly better than EMLA, but EMLA may be better than no
      anesthetic at all.</p>

      <p>"Although some physicians have concluded that DPNB has too
      may potential risks, our studies and others have found it
      simple, safe, and the more effective method," she said during
      the presentation.</p>

      <p>In 1989 member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task
      Force on Circumcision agreed that DPNB helps to reduce
      circumcision-related pain and distress but did not believe
      there were enough safety data to recommend routine
      utilization of the procedure.</p>

      <p>The task force is convening to reconsider its circumcision
      policies this summer.</p>

      <p>The investigators observed three cases of erythema (14%)
      in the EMLA cream group and 10 cases of hematoma (43.5%) at
      24 hours post circumcision in the DPNB group. They considered
      both side effects minor.</p>

      <p>"Hematoma is a known side effect of DPNB," Ms.
      Butler-O'Hara said. "But I would not consider it a major
      adverse effect."</p>

      <p>DPNB consists of two subcutaneous injections of 1%
      lidocaine at the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions at the
      base of the penis. The needle should be inserted only about
      3-5 mm, and the lidocaine should be injected as the needle is
      withdrawn. Waiting 3 minutes should be sufficient to
      anesthetize the shaft of the penis.</p>

      <p>A group of Canadian investigators has studied
      anesthesizing [sic] with a stronger formulation of EMLA cream
      (5% lidocaine, 5% prilocaine).</p>

      <p>They found that it safely reduced the pain of circumcision
      in term infants in a controlled study (<i>N. Engl. J.
      Med.</i> 336:1197-1201, 1997).</p>
