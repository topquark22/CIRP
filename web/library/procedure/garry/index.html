      PRACTICES</h2>

      <p><b>Who's more likely to use anesthetic for circumcision -
      male or female Ob/Gyns? Our poll answers that question and
      reveals how fees differ by region and physician age.</b></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The reader is cautioned that
      these figures date from about 1994. The cost is likely to be
      much higher today.]</p>

      <p class="text2">Ob-Gyns' fees for circumcision range from $0
      to $400, averaging $137 nationwide, according to an <i>OBG
      Management</i> survey of more than 200 physicians. The survey
      found that fees are highest in New Jersey ($237.50, on
      average), New York, Maryland and other Atlantic seaboard
      states. By contrast, several physicians in the Midwest, Deep
      South and Southwest changed $50 to 75.</p>

      <p><b>How circumcision fees vary across America</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Average circumcision fees in each of ACOG's
      nine geographical districts range from $204 in the
      middle-Atlantic states to $98 in the West.</p>

      <p class="text2">The youngest Ob/Gyns tend to charge the most
      for circumcision; the oldest, the least. The average fee for
      respondents age 34 and younger is $182, as opposed to $81 for
      physicians 65 and older. Ob/Gyns in the 35-to-44 group have
      the second highest average fee, $144, while the mean fees for
      respondents age 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 are $125 and $134
      respectively. Seventy-four percent of the Ob/Gyns surveyed
      perform circumcision. Several of those who do not reported
      that they used to do circs. Many stopped when they dropped
      obstetrics. Others, while still doing deliveries, have
      decided to let pediatricians handle the procedure.</p>

      <p><b>The highs and lows of circ fees.</b></p>

      <p class="text2">While 4 percent of Ob/Gyns perform
      circumcision at no charge, three times as many of their
      colleagues set their fees for the procedure at $250 or
      more.</p>

      <p class="text2">A distinct minority - 14 percent - of those
      currently performing circumcision use anesthetic. Use of
      anesthetic was more prevalent among female physicians, 20
      percent of whom reported utilizing it for the procedure. The
      survey found no other appreciable differences in male and
      female Ob-Gyns' circumcision fees and practices.</p>

      <h4>Who's most likely to do circs</h4>

      <p class="text2">Ob/Gyns aged 34 or younger are the
      physicians most likely to perform circumcision and least
      likely to use anesthetic. Eighty-three percent of the
      respondents in that age group said they do the procedure, but
      only 4 percent reported that they use anesthetic.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the ongoing controversy about
      "intactness" thats being played out on talk shows and in
      parenting magazines, the Ob/Gyns said that the overwhelming
      majority of male infants they deliver are circumcised in the
      first month of life. Most survey participants put that figure
      at 90% or more of the baby boys they delivered, while a
      handful of lower responses pulled the average down to 82
      percent.</p>
