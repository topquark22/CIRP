      <blockquote>
        <b><i>Background:</i> Studies from more than 10 years ago
        have shown that most parents choose circumcision for their
        infant sons for non medical reasons. Since then a wealth of
        data has accumulated on the relative risks and benefits of
        the procedure, although the medical community remains
        divided on the appropriateness of the procedure. Whether
        the ongoing research effort and medical debate have had an
        effect on parental decision making is unknown.<br />
         <i>Methods:</i> a survey of parents of 55 male infants was
        conducted to determine when the parents made their decision
        regarding circumcision, whether discussions with providers
        affected their decisions, and what the results were for
        their decisions.<br />
         <i>Results:</i> Eighty percent of parents made the
        circumcision decision before provider discussions.
        Seventeen percent reported changing their mind based on the
        provider's discussion, although it did not significantly
        affect the circumcision rate. Eighty-three percent of
        parents reported their attitude as neutral, including 7 of
        8 patients who changed their mind based on the discussion
        only; only 1 patient was circumcised based on the
        provider's recommendation. Predominant reasons were ease of
        hygiene (67 percent), ease of infant circumcision compared
        with adult circumcision (63 percent), medical benefit (41
        percent), and father circumcised (37 percent). Reasons for
        no circumcision included unnecessary (73 percent), painful
        (36 percent), and father uncircumcised (18 percent).<br />
         <i>Conclusions:</i> Most parents have made a decision on
        circumcision before physicians discuss it, and physician
        discussions appear to have little impact on the decision.
        Ease of cleanliness is still the most common reason parents
        choose circumcision. (J Am Board Fam Pract
        1999;12:16-20)</b>

      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p>After decades of debate and study, the appropriateness of
      routine male circumcision remains uncertain. Potential
      benefits traditionally cited include reduced risks of penile
      cancer, sexually transmitted disease, and infant urinary
      tract infections.<sup><a href="#n1">1-13</a></sup> Some
      studies have challenged these potential benefits, however,
      and critics of routine circumcision have questioned the
      degree of risk involved for a strictly preventive
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n14">14-23</a></sup> Given these
      uncertainties, in 1989 the American Academy of Pediatrics
      (AAP) modified its earlier statements opposing routine
      circumcision<sup><a href="#n24">24-26</a></sup> and
      emphasized instead the importance of informing parents of
      both sides of the debate: "newborn circumcision has potential
      medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages and
      risks. When circumcision is being considered, the benefits
      and risks should be explained to the parents and informed
      consent obtained."<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p>Studies done before 1988 clearly have shown that few
      parents were aware of the medical debate regarding
      circumcision, and most based their choice on concerns
      relating to hygiene and appearance.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27,28</a></sup> From 1983 to 1987 four separate
      trials tested formal educational intervenions aimed at
      discouraging circumcision.<sup><a href="#n29">29-32</a></sup>
      Only one showed a small reduction in the circumcision rate
      (72 versus 94 percent), but none showed any improvements in
      parents understanding of the medical issues involved despite
      the wide range of education levels. In one study the
      educational intervention was not only ineffective but also
      increased parental dissatisfaction with care. Only one study
      specifically addressed the timing of the decision,<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> and found that 36 percent of women
      chose circumcision even before becoming pregnant. Since the
      AAP's 1989 statement emphasizing the informed consent
      process, no one has revisited the issue of how or when
      parents decide whether to have their sons circumcised.</p>

      <p>The goal of this study was to determine whether the
      medical debate has had an impact on parents' decision making.
      Rather than looking at the content of the consent process and
      decision from the provider's viewpoint, I chose to look at
      the discussion and decision from the parents' viewpoint by
      asking the following questions: (1) when do parents make the
      circumcision decision, (2) when do parents discuss
      circumcision with their physician, (3) does the decision have
      any impact on their decision, and (4) what are the reasons
      for their decision? The timing of the circumcision decision
      realtive to the discussion with the physician was of
      particular interest. If social concerns were more important,
      it would seem likely that the decision would be apparent well
      in advance of prenatal and neonatal health care encounters,
      as indeed, was the case 14 years ago. Conversely, if medical
      concerns were more important, then it would seem more likely
      that parents would be more open to physicians discussions and
      make the final</p>

      <p><b>Methods</b><br />
       A 13-item questionnaire was distributed at two family
      practice clinics during a 6-month period. Parents of all male
      infants younger than six months of age coming for well-child
      care on select days (determined by staff availability) were
      approached by a nurse of physican-researcher (not their own
      health care provider) and asked to complete the form. The
      completed form was collected when the parents left the
      waiting room for their infant's examination. Eight questions
      were directed at the decision making process and timing, with
      multiple choice or yes-no responses, and 3 questions asked
      about religion and location of prenatal care. The last 2
      questions offered a list of reasons for deciding for or
      against circumcision, and respondents were asked to check all
      that applied as well as indicate the most important reason.
      Analyses of the timing of the decision versus the timing of
      the discussion was performed by the chi-square test (3 X 3
      table: before, during, or after the pregnancy). Circumcision
      rates for parent</p>

      <p><b>Results</b><br />
       Fifty-five surveys were completed. No parent refused to
      participate, but 3 surveys were returned uncompleted.
      Forty-two parents (76 percent) were seen at site A and
      belonged to an health maintenance organization through an
      employer or university; of these 23 (42 percent of total)
      received prenatal care from a private obstetrician or mures
      midwife, and 19 (35 percent of total) received prenatal care
      from a family physician. The remaining 13 participants (24
      percent) were seen at site B, a community health center for
      patients without insurance or on public assistance; of these
      10 had received prenatal care from a nurse midwife, and 3
      listed other clinics. Respondents named 21 different
      physicians or nurse midwives as their providers, representing
      7 different clinics. The most frequently reported provider
      had 7 patients, and the next most frequent 4 patients; thus
      the sample was not skewed by the practice of any single
      provider. Forty-four (80 percent) infants had been
      circumcised.</p>

      <p align="left"><b>Figure 1. Decision timing versus
      discussion timing.</b></p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p><b><i>Timing of the Decision</i></b><br />
       Most parents appear to make the circumcision decision early.
      Twenty-four (44 percent) reported making the decision before
      getting pregnant, but only 4 (7 percent) had discussed
      circumcision with a provider prenatally. Of the 19 (35
      percent) who made the decision during pregnancy, 8 reported
      doing so in the first trimester. Consequently, most parents
      (37, 80 percent) reported making the decision before
      discussing circumcision with their provider. Figure 1
      graphically illustrates this significant discrepancy between
      the timing of the circumcision decision and the discussion
      with the physician (<i>P</i>&lt;0.005).</p>

      <p><b><i>The Provider's Role in the Decision</i></b><br />
       Regarding the character of the providers discussion, 38 of
      46 respondents (83 percent) described a neutral process, with
      6 (13 percent) having it recommended and 2 (4 percent) being
      advised against it. Not surprisingly, then, when asked
      whether the discussion had changed the parent's mind about
      circumcision, 38 (83 percent) said no. Of the 8 (17 percent
      who said yes, 5 (62 percent) chose circumcision, not a
      significant difference, 7 reported a neutral discussion, and
      only 1 reported a provider expressing an opinion (in that
      case favoring circumcision, and that infant was
      circumcised).</p>

      <p>Of the 6 infants whose providers recommended circumcision,
      all were circumcised, whereas of the 2 infants whose
      providers recommended against circumcision, whereas of the 2
      infants whose providers recommended against circumcision only
      1 was not. Seven of these 8 parents reported making their
      decision before the provider's discussion; only one chose
      circumcision postpartum after having it recommended.</p>

      <p><i><b>Reasons for the Decision</b></i><br />
       Table 1 illustrates the relative ranking of reasons for
      choosing circumcision. Patients were allowed to check all
      applicable reasons and then asked to choose the most
      important, if possible. Consistent with past studies, hygiene
      and preventing the procedure at a later age were the most
      important factors for parents, with other social concerns
      being less important. In contrast to past studies, however,
      medical benefits were reported more often as reasons for
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Religious requirement for circumcision was not a
      significant factor in this sample: only 2 patients (4
      percent) belonged to religious groups who require
      circumcision (although 3 Christians checked religion as a
      secondary reason). Most parents reported their religioun as
      Christian (42, 76 percent); 9 (16 percent) reported no
      religious affliation: and 1 each (total 4 percent) reported
      Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>

      <p>Reasons for avoiding circumcision are ranked in Table 2.
      No parents reported thinking the uncircumcised state was
      medically better: rather, most believed it was simply
      unnecessary. Parents did not report the father's status as
      important in the decision very often: however, of 8 infants
      with reportedly uncircumcised fathers, only 2 were
      circumcised.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b><br />
      Although this study is clearly limited by the small and
      heterogenous sample, the findings are consistent with those
      from studies from 15 years ago, which showed that (1) that
      the circumcision decision is most often made before parents
      discuss the issue with their care providers, (2) that social
      concerns are more important than medical ones, and (3) that
      providers' discussions have limited impact on the decision
      made. Medical benefits were cited more frequently in this
      study than in past studies, although medical issues remain
      secondary to hygience and convenience. Given the limitations
      of this study, the minor increase in parents citing medical
      issues might or might not be important. The study design
      could have contributed to this finding as well, because the
      mere presence of this item on the survey could have prompted
      parents to choose it.</p>

      <p>If this change is real, then advocates of circumcision
      might argue that parents are correctly interpreting the
      medical information given them. It is also possible, however,
      than parents are choosing the data that support their earlier
      decision, or than physicians' neutral discussions of
      circumcision might be subtly biased to support the parents'
      earlier decision. Two of the 8 physicians who offered a
      recommendation had more than 1 patient in the study, and both
      were reported by another patient to provide a neutral
      discussion. Thus, neutral discussions of circumcision can be
      influenced by parents' previous decisions, whether in the
      provider's content or presentation or the parent's
      perception.</p>

      <p>Parents choosing against circumcision did not display
      strong beliefs that being uncircumcised was in any way better
      or healthier; they simply saw circumcision as unnecessary. An
      uncircumcised father appeared to be a strong predictor of the
      choice, although it is unclear how this fact affected the
      parents' decision-making process. Because these parents did
      not rate the father's status as important, having a similar
      appearance is probably not the issue. This finding also
      raises the issue of whether parents are being provided with
      information about the potential medical benefits of not being
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>The multiple choice design used in this study could have
      introduced another bias in this study by forcing parents to
      make a decision. This format assumes that parents had some
      level of information, at least about the choices they
      indicated, when in fact parents might have had very little
      information to guide their decision. Thus while some
      conclusions can be made regarding the relative weight of
      social versus medical concerns, nothing can be inferred from
      this study regarding the depth of understanding of
      circumcision issues by the respondents.</p>

      <p>In summary, then, this study suggests that parents
      continue to have preformed decisions regarding circumcision
      based primarily on non-medical concerns, which are unlikely
      to be changed by attempting neutral discussion of the
      relative risks and benefits. Physicians should be aware that
      parents who have already made the circumcision decision might
      perceive a neutral discussion of circumcision differently
      from parents who are undecided. In the former case a
      supportive approach is unlikely to change most parents'
      decisions, while in the latter a more complete discussion
      would be appropriate. Given that most parents make the
      circumcision decision early, physicians who wish to affect
      the decision should consider discussing it at preconception
      visits or early in prenatal care. Regardless of the extent of
      the discussion informing the parents' choice, if circumcision
      is chosen, informed consent noting the specific immediate
      risks must still be obtained.</p>
