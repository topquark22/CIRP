      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p>Routine neonatal circumcision has long been controversial.
      Presented here is a cost-effectiveness analysis of the
      consequences of the treatment choices (circumcision versus no
      circumcision) using a decision tree model. For a simulated
      85-year life expectancy, routine neonatal circumcision had an
      expected lifetime cost of $164.61 per patient circumcised and
      a quality-adjusted survival of 84.999 years. Conversely, for
      the noncircumcision approach, the expected average lifetime
      cost was $139.26 per patient, and the quality-adjusted
      survival was 84.971 years. The net cost-effectiveness
      ($919.87 per quality-adjusted life year) is within the range
      usually considered worthwhile for public health policy.
      However, because of the minor differences in lifetime cost
      ($25) and benefit (10 days of life) for an individual and the
      tenuous values available for disease incidence and surgical
      risk, we conclude that there is no medical indication for or
      against circumcision. Additional analyses suggested that
      reported benefits in preventing penile cancer and infant
      urinary tract infections are insignificant compared to the
      surgical risks of post neonatal circumcision. The decision
      regarding circumcision may most reasonably be made on
      nonmedical factors such as parent preference or religious
      convictions. [References: 22]</p>
