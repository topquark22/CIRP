      <p><b>Summary</b></p>

      <p>One hundred and twenty boys were referred by GPs over a
      12-month period to a paediatric urologist for circumcision.
      The reasons for referral were: ballooning in 36,
      non-retraction in 28, balanoposthitis in 36 or a combination
      in 15. On examination 53% had a retractile, 21% a partially
      retractile and 21% a non-retractile foreskin. Six patients
      had obvious balanitis xerotica obliterans. Only one quarter
      of the patients required a circumcision. the penis was not
      examined by the referring doctor in 15 patients. <span
      class="yellow">The implications of this survey are that a
      large proportion of general practitioners have difficulty in
      discriminating between a true phimosis and a developmentally
      non-retractile foreskin.</span> This diagnostic inaccuracy
      was greatest when the referring doctor did not examine the
      patient.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p>Circumcision is one of the oldest of all surgical
      procedures dating back over 4000 years. Despite a fall in
      popularity during the latter half of this century, it remains
      one of the commonest operations performed on boys in this
      country. With the demise of religious circumcisions medical
      indications have become paramount. The commonest is phimosis,
      real or perceived. We felt that many patients were referred
      for an opinion regarding the presence of a phimosis
      unnecessarily and therefore decided to evaluate this with a
      prospective study at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick
      Children.</p>

      <p><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>

      <p>All patients referred to one paediatric urologist in a
      12-month period from May 1988 to May 1989 were studied. The
      only requirement for inclusion in the study was that the
      referring GP requested an opinion on whether a circumcision
      was indicated or not. A standard card was completed for each
      patient attending the clinic detailing the reason given by
      the GP for referral, whether the penis had been examined by
      the GP, the consultant's clinical findings, and recommended
      treatment. If it was not clear from the referral letter
      whether the GP had examined the patient, a discreet inquiry
      of the parents yielded the answer in most cases.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p>One hundred and twenty boys were referred in a 12-month
      period with an age range of 4 months to 13 years and a mean
      age of 5 years. The reasons given for referral were:
      ballooning, 36 (30%); non-retraction, 28 (23%); and
      balanoposthitis, 36 (30%). Fifteen patients had a combination
      of two or more of the above (12.5%). Five patients did not
      fall into any of these categories. Two were referred
      following school medical examinations with a presumed
      abnormal foreskin, one was referred with dysuria, and one
      because of the presence of smegma. There was only one
      referral for a religious circumcision.</p>

      <p>On examination, the paediatric urologist found 64 boys
      (53%) with a retractile foreskin, 25 boys (21%) with a
      partially retractile foreskin, 25 boys (21%) with a
      non-retractile foreskin and six boys (5%) with balanitis
      xerotica obliterans (BXO). Those with BXO had the diagnosis
      confirmed histologically after circumcision.</p>

      <p>All 30 patients (25%) with a true phimosis were
      circumcised. Eighty-four patients (70%) with a retractile
      foreskin were reassured and six patients (5%) with a
      partially retractile foreskin were either recommended no
      treatment or advised gentle self-retraction. A small number
      were recalled for review.</p>

      <p>We correlated whether the general practitioner had
      examined the penis or relied upon the history alone with the
      clinical findings and eventual outcome. Male and female
      general practitioners examined similar ratios of patients
      (male GPs: examined 75, unexamined 12; female GPs: examined
      19, unexamined 3).</p>

      <p>Fifteen patients (14%) referred for circumcision had not
      been examined by their GP: 12 had a retractile foreskin, two
      had a partially retractile foreskin and one had a true
      phimosis. Only one unexamined patient was felt to merit
      circumcision and only three (20%) had any abnormality.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p>Circumcision remains one of the commonest paediatric
      surgical procedures with over 20 000 boys under 15 years of
      age circumcised annually in this country.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>Leaving aside the financial implications, there are risks
      and benefits for the patient. There is a small but definite
      mortality and morbidity associated with circumcision when a
      general anaesthetic is used. The benefits of circumcision are
      a reduced incidence of penile cancer and, perhaps, a
      reduction in infantile urinary tract infections.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> However, carcinoma of the penis is
      rare in the UK and prophylactic circumcision could not be
      advocated solely as a protection against the disease.
      similarly, whilst the evidence that routine infantile
      circumcision reduces the frequency of early urinary tract
      infections is persuasive, <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/winberg-bollgren/">Winberg <i>et
      al</i></a>.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> propose a less
      radical alternative. <span class="yellow">At present, routine
      circumcision cannot be justified on the grounds of preventing
      diseases at a later date.</span></p>

      <p>The only absolute indication for circumcision is the
      presence of a true phimosis. What constitutes a phimosis has
      been extensively debated but it clearly does not equate with
      a non-retractile prepuce. <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a>, in 1949,
      described the development of the prepuce and pointed out that
      10% of boys have a non-retractable foreskin at the age of 3
      years.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Oster</a> showed that this
      persisted in only 1% by the age of 17 years<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup>, fewer than the number actually
      circumcised. Of the 120 boys referred for consideration of
      circumcision in our series, 25% came to operation. This
      figure accords closely with that of <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood2/">Rickwood and
      Walker</a> in their review of circumcisions in the Mersey
      region.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>Clearly one implication is that a large proportion of GPs
      have difficulty in discriminating between a true phimosis and
      a developmentally non-retractile foreskin. Not surprisingly,
      the diagnostic inaccuracy was greatest when the referring
      doctor did not examine the patient.</p>

      <p>In this series, there was at least one referral for
      circumcision per consultant clinic, a not inconsiderable
      workload. As 75% required only reassurance we feel that there
      is room for improvement in terms of educating doctors to
      distinguish between a physiologically non-retractile foreskin
      and a pathological phimosis. Perhaps if this is achieved, the
      `rape of the phallus'<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> will be
      increasingly recognized as an unnecessary and traumatic
      procedure for the majority of boys.</p>
