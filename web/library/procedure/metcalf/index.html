      <blockquote>
        <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the current
        incidence of circumcision, the reasons governing parental
        decisions regarding circumcision, the immediate and later
        complications from the procedure, as well as genital
        problems occurring in uncircumcised boys. The incidence of
        circumcision was found not to have changed over the past
        five years despite the recommendations of the American
        Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision. The
        reasons given for circumcision reflected mostly the
        strength of tradition, rather than a medical approach. Four
        per cent of newborns experienced early complications from
        the procedure, whereas 13 per cent experienced later, minor
        complications. Problems reported in uncircumcised infants
        were probably variants of normal. While the results of this
        study add evidence for discontinuing neonatal circumcision,
        we strongly recommend that, if physicians dissuade parents
        from having their infants circumcised, they must give
        adequate information concerning hygiene and the slow,
        natural separation of the foreskin from the glans.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">Ad Hoc Task Force on
      Circumcision</a> of the Committee on Fetus and Newborn
      stated, in 1975, that "there is no absolute medical
      indication for routine circumcision of the newborn." The
      Committee further recommended that physicians provide parents
      with information pertaining to the long-term medical effects
      of circumcision and non-circumcision, so that they can make a
      thoughtful decision," that the discussion be a prenatal one,
      and finally that "a program of education leading to
      continuing good personal hygiene offers all the advantages of
      routine circumcision without the attendant surgical
      risk."<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Review of the literature
      reveals little change in the 80 to 98 per cent incidence of
      circumcision in the United States before and after that
      statement.<sup><a href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> The incidence of
      neonatal circumcision for non-religious reasons in the United
      States is significantly higher than in other
      countries.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The controversy
      continues regarding the questions of need, risks, benefits,
      and cost.<sup><a href="#n7">7-9</a></sup> Gellis<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> has interpreted these data to
      indicate that physicians "have not been convinced that
      circumcision is of little benefit" and have, thus, been
      reluctant to discourage this practice. The purpose of this
      study was to examine medical and social issues which we felt
      to be related to our continuing high rate of circumcision.
      This included assessment of (1) the incidence of circumcision
      in Utah, (2) perceptions of circumcision by parents, (3) who
      counsels about and/or performs circumcisions, (4) immediate
      and later complications resulting from the procedure, and (5)
      genital problems occurring in circumcised and uncircumcised
      boys.</p>

      <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>

      <p>The study was divided into four parts:</p>

      <p>1. Hospital and Medical Records Survey. Telephone contacts
      were made with the Medical Records Departments of all 34
      hospitals in Utah. Sixteen of these had records which were
      adequate to determine the rate of circumcision in infants
      born during 1978. Additionally, since one hospital, Latter
      Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, accounts for
      approximately 12 per cent of Utah's births, the records of
      this hospital were reviewed for the period 1974 to 1979 to
      detect changes in circumcision rates.</p>

      <p>2. Newborn Study. A prospective study was conducted in the
      normal newborn nursery of the University of Utah Medical
      Center and in a community hospital in Salt Lake City. Nurses
      interviewed mothers of 131 consecutive, newly circumcised
      male infants. The mother was asked the reason for the
      circumcision, whether she had been counseled about the
      procedure, and by whom. The nurse then reviewed the child's
      chart for his race, who performed the circumcision, and
      whether a complication had occurred following the
      procedure.</p>

      <p>3. Telephone Study. A telephone survey of new mothers was
      conducted. Contacts were made by reviewing birth
      announcements of Salt Lake City's two newspapers. The sample
      consisted of 208 mothers of 6-month-old male infants. The
      first 108 women were questioned regarding their infants'
      circumcision status, resultant complications, and hygienic
      care. The second hundred were questioned regarding
      circumcision status and the reason for the circumcision.</p>

      <p>4. Office Survey. Nursing personnel conducted a survey of
      parents in the Pediatric Clinic of the University of Utah
      Medical Center and in a local prepaid office practice. One
      hundred forty-two boys were included from consecutive office
      visits, with ages ranging from 4 days to 12 years. Race,
      circumcision status, and neonatal and later complications of
      either circumcision or noncircumcision were determined each
      patient was then examined by a physician who confirmed
      circumcision status and noted problems such as balanitis or
      adhesions.</p>

      <p>Data were gathered in the four methods described above in
      order to collect as representative a sample as possible. For
      each variable of interest, information was garnered from the
      appropriate surveys and then combined.</p>

      <p>Table 1 lists the variables studied, the source of
      information and the total number of patients in the combined
      samples.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p><b>Incidence</b></p>

      <p>Statistics for 1977-79 demonstrated an average of 53 per
      cent males and 47 per cent females born in Utah (Bureau of
      Vital Statistics). In 1978, 21,355 males were born in the 34
      Utah hospitals. Circumcision status was determined for 15,905
      males born in 16 of these hospitals. Of these, 13,498 (84.9%)
      were circumcised. Differences in rates were found between
      various hospitals and within the surveyed populations. These
      differences generally reflected ethnic background, with
      black, Hispanic, Indian, oriental, and other nonwhite
      children being circumcised less often than Caucasians.
      Although, in breaking down the incidence of circumcision in
      the study population (office study), the prevalence of
      circumcision tended to be somewhat lower among younger
      children, the incidence of circumcision within Salt Lake City
      does not appear to have changed. A survey of the Latter-Day
      Saints' Hospital, which has approximately 5,000 deliveries a
      year, revealed that for the years 1974 to 1979 the incidence
      of circumcision remained constant, varying only between 92
      and 83 per cent.</p>

      <p><b>Reasons for Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Reasons given by mothers for having their sons circumcised
      are summarized in Table 2. Many parents gave more than one
      reason for having had their sons circumcised. Cleanliness and
      "health" were cited most frequently, while social custom was
      the second leading reason given by mothers. This category
      included those who stated it was routine, "normal," family
      tradition, recommended by grandparents, or that the father
      was circumcised. Physical appearance was frequently cited by
      mothers in the newborn period, while it was given much less
      in the telephone interviews of older infants' mothers. These
      data are quite similar to those obtain Lovell and Cox.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>Our results also support the observations of these
      investigators, who found that clearly medical reasons (e.g.,
      decreased infection or cancer) were given much less
      frequently than were socially related ones. Finally, while
      only 5 per cent of parents of newborns give no reason for
      having their child circumcised, 26 per cent of parents of
      6-month-olds gave none.</p>

      <p><b>Counseling of Parents</b></p>

      <p>Of parents participating in the newborn study, interviewed
      immediately after their infant's circumcision, 67 per cent
      stated they had been counseled regarding the procedure while
      only 7 per cent of the mothers of 6-month-olds interviewed
      during the telephone survey recalled such counseling. Those
      who had received advice were counseled more often by
      obstetricians (73%) than pediatricians (16%).</p>

      <p><b>Performance of Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Obstetricians performed 115 of 131 (87.7%) of the
      circumcisions at the two hospitals surveyed. Circumcisions
      were occasionally performed by family practitioners (3%), and
      rarely by pediatricians (2%) or rabbis (1%).</p>

      <p><b>Complications of Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Neonatal complications were determined (Table 3); only
      problems requiring treatment were considered to be
      significant. Complications were reported in 14 of 361 (4%)
      circumcisions, including six hemorrhages, three surgical
      problems requiring later revision of circumcisions, four
      infections, and one instance in which a Plastibell ring had
      been used which was too small. All complications were treated
      successfully, with resolution of symptoms. One child required
      overnight hospitalization for treatment of hemorrhage. The
      other 13 infants were treated either as outpatients or during
      their initial hospitalization without delay in discharge.</p>

      <p>Of 230 circumcised children, studied after the neonatal
      period (Table 3), 13 per cent (30 of 230 children) had
      experienced later complications. The most common complaint
      was foreskin adhesions (18) which generally occurred in
      infants less than one year of age. Other complaints were
      smegma accumulation, phimosis, meatitis (ranging from
      irritation to actual infection), and concerns about general
      cleanliness. Three children required circumcision revision.
      Only 17 (12%) of the 142 boys in the office study were
      uncircumcised. Of these, nine were less than 6 months of age,
      and four were between 6 and 12 months. Mothers of two
      children reported the complication of foreskin adhesions
      (11%). These adhesions were lysed in one child at 4.5 years
      of age, while the second was circumcised for this complaint
      when he was 3. No mothers complained of hygienic problems or
      infection in their children. One mother requested
      circumcision for her 1-year-old who had no apparent problems.
      No reason was given.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>The current incidence of circumcision in the United States
      is between 80 and 97 per cent and has remained unchanged
      since the Ad Hoc Task Force statement.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,10</a></sup> Circumcision ranks as the most
      common surgery in children.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      Our data confirm that the incidence of newborn circumcision
      has changed little in the past five years, indicating that,
      in Utah, the AAP statement has had no effect on circumcision
      rates. One reason for this may be that most circumcisions in
      our community are performed by obstetricians. The American
      College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has declined endorsement
      of the AAP statement.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Because
      the frequency of prenatal visits to pediatricians in Utah is
      still relatively low, pediatricians have little opportunity
      to advise parents concerning the procedure. Only seven per
      cent of the parents of 6-month-olds, interviewed during the
      telephone survey, recalled any counseling regarding
      circumcision. But 67 per cent of parents in the newborn study
      did, mostly by obstetricians. All parents received
      information prior to the procedure in order to give consent.
      During the telephone study, parents were specifically asked
      whether or not they had received advice about the necessity
      or advisability of circumcision. The information given in the
      newborn period may not have involved true "counseling" on the
      need or advisability, or it may have been so brief as to have
      been forgotten in six months. Reasons given for circumcision
      reflected the strength of tradition rather than a medical
      approach. Mothers stated circumcision was "healthier" or
      "cleaner," or favored it because family or social custom
      dictated it.</p>

      <p>Further, while only five per cent of mothers of newborns
      gave no reason for having their sons circumcised, full
      one-fourth of mothers of 6-month-olds could not recall the
      reason for having their sons circumcised. Perhaps by then,
      their original reasons were not significant enough to be
      remembered.</p>

      <p>This entrenched tradition of custom is probably the
      greatest obstacle faced by those who would decrease the
      number of circumcisions done in this country.</p>

      <p>The most recent surveys of complications of circumcision
      range from 0.2 to 28 per cent,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,11</a></sup> depending upon whether one includes
      all minor complications, only those requiring treatment, or
      simply those which are life threatening. The number of early
      complications requiring treatment in this study was four per
      cent of 361 circumcisions. None was life-threatening. Later
      complications were experienced by 13 per cent of 230
      children. Only three children suffered both early and late
      complications. Six children required circumcision revision,
      exposing them to repeated surgical and anesthetic risks.
      Foreskin adhesion was the most common complication, with the
      higher frequency in children less than one year of age. These
      were usually lysed in the pediatrician's office. These
      adhesions probably result from the apposition of the cut edge
      of the foreskin with the denuded glans surface and may lead
      to actual skin-bridging, as described by Klauber and
      Boyle.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Many parents do not
      recognize that the foreskin has been adherent to the glans
      until sufficient smegma has accumulated to make the penis
      appear infected because of the visible smegma under the
      adhesion.</p>

      <p>When later complications of uncircumcised infants were
      sought, two of 17 children were said to have had problems
      with foreskin adhesions. These "complications" actually may
      not have been complications but rather variants of
      normal.<sup><a href="#n13">13,14</a></sup> As we have
      reported previously, the majority of pediatricians do not
      know the natural history of the foreskin, and frequently, may
      give parents of uncircumcised infants and children
      inappropriate advice, as in the two cases described
      here.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p>The arguments concerning circumcision continue. <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a><sup><a
      href="#n">13</a></sup> and <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Oster</a><sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> made a strong case for leaving boys
      uncircumcised, allowing the natural separation of the
      foreskin from the glans to take place gradually, and
      instructing boys in proper hygiene. This obviates the need
      for "preventive" circumcision. <sup><a
      href="#n13">13,14</a></sup> St. John-Hunt et al.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> disagreed, stating that a large number
      of British school boys suffered balanitis secondary to poor
      hygiene of the uncircumcised penis. Their data, however, were
      much less rigorously collected than that of Gairdner and
      Oster. No study similar to Oster's has been done in the
      United States to investigate how well uncircumcised boys care
      for themselves. We found, in a previous study,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> that mothers of uncircumcised
      infants are given little information regarding the
      maintenance of good hygiene and that pediatricians' advice
      varied greatly. This is a crucial issue, since the AAP
      recommendations concerning the lack of medical need for
      circumcision are dependent upon lifelong personal
      hygiene.</p>

      <p>Finally, the amount of pain and the psychological
      implications for the infant undergoing circumcision are
      simply unknown.<sup><a href="#n7">7,16</a></sup> The use of
      the penile dorsal nerve block, while introducing a minimal
      anesthetic risk, seems a possible alternative for preventing
      the pain the infant may endure during the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> In summary, in the five years since
      the AAP statement, we have seen no change in the frequency of
      circumcision, possibly because those who most often perform
      circumcisions, the obstetricians, have not taken a similar
      stand. Parents are not adequately counseled concerning the
      necessity for the procedure, and for traditional reasons
      continue to ask that it be done. Complications of
      circumcision, while seldom serious, do occur. In our small
      series of uncircumcised boys, true complications were not
      encountered.</p>

      <p>While most of the results of this study give evidence for
      support of the AAP statement, we feel that the issue of
      adequate personal hygiene in uncircumcised children and
      adults needs further investigation.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">We strongly recommend that, if
      physicians dissuade parents from having their infants
      circumcised, they must give those parents the information
      concerning hygiene and the slow natural separation of the
      foreskin from the glans.</span></p>
