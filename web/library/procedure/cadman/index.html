      <p class="text1"><b>The purpose of this study was to analyse
      the hypothesis that prophylactic circumcision of male
      newborns is economically beneficial to the health care system
      of Canada. The minimal dollar benefits that would justify
      this conclusion were determined. The cost of the procedure
      was calculated in three Hamilton, Ont. hospitals and found to
      be an average of about $38. The health benefits of
      circumcision are uncertain, but a review of the literature
      suggested that penile carcinoma is the most serious (and
      costly) disease potentially prevented by circumcision.
      Published estimates of the incidence rates, age of onset and
      costs calculated of the per-case cost of prevention: $13.6
      million. The authors conclude that the monetary benefits of
      circumcising newborns will not exceed this cost. <span
      class="yellow">It is proposed that the procedure be regarded
      as cosmetic surgery and be paid for by parents who wish the
      procedure carried out rather than by taxpayer-funded health
      insurance plans.</span></b></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>On analyse ici question de savoir si la
      circoncision du nouveau-n&eacute;, consid&eacute;r&eacute;e
      comme mesure prophylactique, est &eacute;conomiquement
      rentable dans le r&eacute;gime sanitaire du Canada. On
      determine d&rsquo;abord le profit mon&eacute;taire minimum
      qui justifierait une r&eacute;ponse affirmative. On constate
      ensuite que dans trois h&ocirc;pitaux de Hamilton (Ont.) le
      co&ucirc;t moyen de l&rsquo;intervention est de quelque 38$.
      Malgr&eacute; l&rsquo;incertitude quant aux avantages
      sanitaire de la circoncision, une revue de la literature
      donne &agrave; penser que parmi les maladies susceptibles

      <p class="text1">Should a policy of newborn prophylactic
      circumcision be recommended for the newborn male population
      of Canada? Should taxpayers shoulder the costs of this
      procedure? In a review article Warner and Strashin<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> claimed that the procedure is good
      policy for both health and economic reasons. The Fetus and
      Newborn Committee of the Canadian Paediatric Society has
      commented on the inadequacy of the data presented by these
      authors regarding health benefits and risks.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Also, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics has stated that routine circumcision of the
      newborn lacks medical justification.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> The purpose of this paper is to
      examine the evidence for economic benefits resulting from
      this procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two steps are required before any medical
      therapy or surgical procedure can be recommended as
      &ldquo;good policy&rdquo;. First, the efficacy of the
      procedure must be established: Does it do more harm than good
      to those receiving it? The second step &mdash; economic
      evaluation &mdash; is usually indicated only for maneuvers of
      known efficacy.</p>

      <p class="text2">The economic evaluation involves comparative
      analysis of the costs and consequences of alternative courses
      of action. Methods for such evaluation can be found in the
      works of Weinstein and Stason,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>,
      Shepard and Thompson,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> and
      Drummond.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The reality is that, in the near future,
      scientists are unlikely to resolve the question of the health
      efficacy of newborn circumcision. However, because the
      procedure is both widespread and publicly funded in
      Ontario,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> we propose a modified
      economic analysis to assist in clarifying the conclusions
      reached by Warner and Strashin. Costs can indicated the
      minimal, threshold amount of health benefit, measured in
      dollars, that would justify the procedure on economic
      grounds. The magnitude of this amount can be compared with
      benefits of other programs as an estimate of the likelihood
      of a procedure&rsquo;s being cost-beneficial.</p>

      <p><b>Methods</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The first step in assessing the cost-benefit
      of prophylactic circumcision of male infants younger than 10
      days is to determine the dollar costs of the procedure to the
      health care system. We have conservatively assumed no medical
      or surgical complications in this analysis. We measured costs
      in all three Hamilton, Ont. hospitals where the procedure is
      performed (McMaster University Medical Centre, Henderson
      General Hospital and St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital).</p>

      <p class="text2">The cost of physician billings was taken
      from the 1983 Ontario Health Insurance Plan schedule of
      benefits for physicians services.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">To determine the cost of the nurse
      assistant, we first estimated the time contributed and then
      converted the time units into monetary values. Although the
      amount of time varied from doctor to doctor, each hospital
      unit agreed that 30 minutes per circumcision represented a
      reasonable estimate. For each hospital the mean yearly salary
      of nurses involved in circumcisions was estimated, and
      benefits (20% to 30%) for 1983 salaries were assessed by the
      personnel supervisor. An estimate of benefits per hour was
      then calculated and was added to the mean hourly wage; the
      sum was divided in half as the cost for 30 minutes.</p>

      <p class="text2">A list of objects on circumcision trays was
      obtained from the supplies department of the hospital. Each
      item was costed by a consultant from American Hospital
      Supplies, Ltd. The cost of processing, assembling,
      autoclaving and dispatching, also estimated by the supplies
      department of each hospital was added. The total cost for
      each tray was calculated in 1983 dollars.</p>

      <p class="text2">Costs of space and overhead dedicated to
      circumcision were calculated (Table 1). The floor space for
      each procedure room was obtained from either the neonatal
      unit or the hospital engineering department using data
      available from an extensive cost-analysis survey carried out
      in 1978.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> This survey supplied
      total area per hospital, cost of plant operation, cost of
      housekeeping, cost of building depreciation, and opportunity
      cost on building depreciation per hospital. The costs were
      summed for each hospital, and the total figure for the
      hospital was divided by the total number of circumcisions
      that actually took place in that procedure room in the fiscal
      year 1978-79. To convert the 1978 figure to 1983 figures, we
      employed a Statistics Canada price index.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Results and discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The average cost of performing neonatal
      circumcision varied from $36.55 to $41.82 in the three
      hospitals, with a mean of $38.32 (Table II).</p>

      <p class="text2">These cost data can be regarded as
      generalizable to the Province of Ontario: physician billing,
      which is more than 50% of the overall cost, is constant, and
      the costs of the circumcision tray and nursing time are not
      likely to vary dramatically. The only component that may vary
      dramatically is the cost of space and the cost of the
      circumcision procedure room. However, this cost is only 5% to
      12% of the total cost. Thus, even if this cost in another
      locale were twice the amount calculated in Table I, the total
      cost would be increased only by 5% to 12%. Discussion with
      hospital administrators suggests that, overall, their time
      represents no more than 1% of the total cost of the
      procedure. Because determining the exact cost of their time
      from hospital records is probably impossible, ad our
      conclusions would not be changed anyway, we omitted this
      figures.</p>

        alt="Table One" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Prophylactic procedures are an investment:
      the costs occur now and the benefits occur later. Warner and
      Strashin summarized the benefits of neonatal circumcision as
      facilitation of penile hygiene, prevention of carcinoma of
      the penis, decrease in the incidence of sexually transmitted
      disease, prevention of phimosis, paraphimosis, and balanitis,
      and prevention of pain, psychologic effects and anesthetic
      risks associated with later circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The most serious disease that neonatal
      circumcision is claimed to prevent is cancer of the penis.
      Almost all cases of the disease occur in men older than 50
      years.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Therefore, for our
      analysis we used 50 to 60 years as the average age of onset.
      The incidence of penile carcinoma in this age group is 2/100
      000 annually.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Using these
      figures and data on the cost of circumcision, one can easily
      calculate the minimal magnitude of benefits that would
      justify, on economic grounds, a recommendation to circumcise
      male newborns, assuming that the only benefit from
      circumcision is prevention of cancer of the penis.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="cadman-table2.gif" width="500" height="124"
        alt="table Two" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The cost of circumcising 100 000 newborns
      (without any complications) is just over $3.8 million.
      Invested at a 4% real interest rate (assuming no inflation),
      this amount would grow in 50 years to $27.2 million. If
      neonatal circumcision prevented both expected cases of cancer
      of the penis in this cohort, the real cost of treatment and
      foregone earnings for a case of cancer in a 50-year-old man
      is $103,000. In other words, the &ldquo;break-even&rdquo;
      amount is more than 100 times the cost of the disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other diseases possibly prevented by
      circumcision, such as balanitis, paraphimosis and phimosis,
      are much less serious than penile carcinoma, and the effect
      of circumcision in terms of cases prevented is
      unknown.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> It is not reasonable
      to expect that the dollar benefits generated by prevention in
      these cases would approach $13 million.</p>

      <p class="text2">By comparison, the costs per case detected,
      diagnosed and treated (prevented) in a phenylketonuria
      screening program in New York State have been reported to be
      $38,000. Torrance and Zipursky<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> have recently reported the total
      cost of preventing Rh diseae of newborns: antepartum
      treatment with anti-immunoglobulin was estimated to be $2300
      and $5900 for primiparous and multiparous mothers
      respectively.</p>

      <p class="text2">Warner and Strashin&rsquo;s second economic
      argument for performing neonatal circumcision is an annual
      saving of more than $5.3 million for Ontario and more than
      $18 million for all of Canada by prevention of later
      therapeutic circumcision for various health problems. (other
      than carcinoma of the penis). They estimated that the cost of
      circumcising all newborn boys in the province would be $2.1
      million and that the cost of 4627 therapeutic circumcisions
      performed was $7.4 million. They merely subtracted the former
      cost from the latter in reaching an estimate of the net
      benefits. However, they overlooked the fact that the costs of
      prophylactic surgery occur <i>now</i> and the costs of
      therapeutic circumcision occur <i>in the future</i>. Future
      dollar savings must be discounted before they can be compared
      with present costs. We conclude that the monetary benefits of
      a policy of circumcising newborns will never exceed the costs
      and that such a policy cannot be justified on economic
      grounds.</p>

      <p class="text2">A complete economic analysis would answer
      the following questions: Do the total economic benefits of
      the policy exceed the total costs? If they do is the policy
      of allocated limited health care resources to the procedure a
      wise choice. That is, could the resources be more
      beneficially used in another way. &mdash; for example, to
      promote immunization of children? Our analysis, suggests that
      such an extensive cost-benefit analysis of circumcision is
      not warranted and that this procedure is not economically
      beneficial to the Ontario health care system or the taxpayers
      who fund the system.</p>

      <p class="text2">If one considers only the strength of
      available evidence regarding health benefits and our economic
      analysis, then the public funding of neonatal circumcision
      through provincial health insurance programs is a policy of
      dubious merit. However, one must also consider the value that
      members of society place on having this service supplied as
      part of the health care system for reasons other than health
      or economic benefits.</p>

      <p class="text2">As health advisers, individual physicians
      can attempt to rationalize decisions by making new parents
      aware of the health and economic facts. Both physician and
      parents should explicitly recognize that their decision about
      circumcision of a newborn is almost exclusively a choice
      based on their values and preferences.</p>

      <p class="text2">The dilemmaa for the public policymaker is
      more difficult: Should the public pay out of limited
      resources for a procedure that is of unproved health benefit
      and almost certainly without economic benefit? Clearly, the
      answer once again depends on taxpayers&rsquo; values and
      preferences (once they are fully informed of health benefits
      and economic costs), which must be balanced against the cost
      of using resources another way.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Canadian health care system has goals of
      equity in access to preferred care, effectiveness in health
      terms and efficiency in economic terms. On the basis of
      current information, the &ldquo;equity&rdquo; component of
      these goals is the only possible justification of publicly
      funded prophylactic newborn circumcision. To our knowledge
      this element has not been scientifically measured. <span
      class="yellow">We submit that, until demonstrated otherwise,
      prophylactic neonatal circumcision should be regarded as
      cosmetic surgery, paid for directly by parents wishing it,
      and that public health care dollars should be expended on
      preventive and therapeutic benefits of more certain health or
      economic benefit.</span></p>
