        <h3>REIMBURSEMENT ADVISOR</h3>

        <h3>HOW TO GET PAID FOR CIRCUMCISION</h3>
      </div>

      <p class="text2">Q. For years I used the diagnosis code 605
      on claims for circumcision. Now those claims are being denied
      even after I submit documentation. What am I doing wrong?</p>

      <p class="text2">A. You're using the wrong code. "Redundant
      prepuce and phimosis is what code 605 describes. If the
      diagnosis wasn't phimosis, the claim will be denied.</p>

      <p class="text2">Instead use IDC-9-CM code V50.2 whenever you
      perform circumcision at the request of an infant's parents.
      But remember you still may not receive payment for insurer:
      Many simply do not reimburse for routine or ritual
      circumcision. (Also be aware that some payers don't accept V
      codes. If in doubt, ask.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another issue is whether the procedure
      should be billed under the mother's insurance identification
      number or the child's. Medicaid requires that claims for
      circumcision be filed under the child's number. Often this
      means holding the claim until the baby has been assigned his
      I.D. number (which hardly seems worthwhile).</p>

      <p class="text2">The reason for this requirement is that
      claims sent to Medicaid and some commercial payers are run
      through various computer "edits," among them a "sex edit" to
      verify the diagnoses or procedures specific to one gender
      match that of the patient. If the circumcision is reported
      under the mother's I.D. number, the male specific sex edit
      for the procedure will flag the claim for either manual
      review or automatic denial.</p>

      <p class="text2">What about procedure codes for circumcision?
      Again, practice varies from payer to payer. Some managed care
      plans have developed their own codes for this procedure.</p>

      <p>If the payer accepts the CPT codes, use one of the
      following:</p>
<pre>
       54150         Circumcision, using clamp or other
                     device; newborn

       54160         Circumcision, surgical excision
                     other than clamp, device or dorsal
                     slit; newborn
</pre>

      <p class="text2">The easier way to check a payer's preferred
      codes and reporting practices is to make a habit of asking
      when you telephone to verify a patient's maternity
      benefits.</p>
