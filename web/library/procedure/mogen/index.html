      accepted June 1984.</p>

      <p class="text1">The purpose of this study was to analyze the
      results of 313 circumcisions using the Mogen clamp. This
      procedure was done between 1 day and 2 years of age in all
      but four patients. The complication rate was low (1.6%). Two
      patients had local infection, one mild hemorrhage, one
      concealed penis, and one postcircumcision phimosis.
      Circumcision using the Mogen clamp is a simple quick, and
      safe procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1">Although the American Academy of Pediatrics
      stated in 1975 that "there is no absolute medical indication
      for routine circumcision of the newborn," this procedure is
      presently the most common surgical procedure performed in
      children today.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The percentage of infants circumcised in the
      United States currently is reputed to be between 77 and 97
      percent.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> This range of
      incidence has remained unchanged subsequent to the Academy's
      recommendation.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The Jewish people have practiced
      circumcision ritually during the last 4000 years. The removal
      of the foreskin was the sign of the covenant between God and
      Abraham (Genesis 17:10). The method to be used is not
      specified in the Bible. Rabbis, also known as mohels, who
      perform circumcisions have adopted the technique of using the
      Mogen clamp (Fig. 1 ).<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> This
      clamp was designed by North American Rabbi Harry Bronstein in
      1954. The most widely used methods for circumcision in the
      United States are the Gomco clamp and the plastic bell
      device.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The circumcision shield
      and Millers Messer (knife), the open surgical technique, and
      electrocautery circumcision also are employed, although much
      less frequently.<sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup> Results of
      313 circumcisions using the Mogen clamp are presented in this
      study.</p>

      <p><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Between September 1980 and December 1982,
      313 circumcisions were performed using the Mogen clamp at the
      Hospital Del Valle de Mexico. Informed consent was obtained
      for all patients.</p>

      <p class="text2">The patients were divided into four groups
      according to age.</p>

      <p class="text2">Group I consisted of 150 newborns between 24
      and 72 hours of life. All were healthy neonates weighing 2500
      g or more.</p>

      <p class="text2">Group II included 150 males between 8 days
      and 3 months of age. They were circumcised for religious
      reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">Group III consisted of 5 patients
      circumcised because of parental request and 4 for phimosis;
      all were between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. Four adult
      patients in Group IV had circumcision for medical or personal
      reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">The technique employed is as follows. The
      genital area is cleansed with soap, water, and
      povidone-iodine. Sterile drapes are placed. General
      anesthesia is used in patients who are older than 3 months.
      Some authors recommend the use of regional anesthesia by
      dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine in newborns.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> The mucosa is separated with a
      lubricated, blunt edged probe, taking care not to damage the
      frenulum (Fig. 2). Anesthesia (10% lidocaine spray) is
      applied to the mucosa. After the mucosa is separated and
      anesthetized, the glans is lubricated with an antiseptic
      ointment. A straight Kelly hemostat is placed in the midline
      of the dorsal side of the prepuce approximately 5 mm proximal
      to the corona (Fig. 3). The prepuce is carefully pulled with
      the hemostat in an up and outward direction. At this time,
      the glans retracts towards the scrotum, avoiding accidental
      amputation of the glans. The Mogen clamp then is placed
      obliquely in a 45 [degree] angle in the dorsal ventral
      direction pointing outwards (Fig. 4). The jaws of the Mogen
      clamp then are brought together for 2 minutes in infants
      under 6 months of age and for 5 minutes in older males.</p>

      <p class="text2">The prepuce then is excised (Fig. 5). The
      Mogen clamp is opened and slowly removed. The seal between
      the skin and the mucosa is separated, applying downward
      pressure until the glans is liberated (Figs. 6 and 7). All
      remaining adhesions are removed, and the penis is covered
      with a vaseline gauze (Fig. 8).</p>

      <p class="text2">In cases involving a small penis, the angle
      of the placement of the Mogen clamp was increased according
      to the size of the prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mothers and adult patients were instructed
      as to the postoperative care or the area. A new vaseline
      gauze was placed with each diaper change for 1 week. Good
      hygienic practices also were taught.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The penis was checked by the physician 72
      hours, 1 week, and 1 month after the circumcision was
      performed. Overall, the results were excellent: the incidence
      of complications was low, and almost all of the parents and
      all of the adult patients were pleased with the cosmetic
      outcome. Patients also were instructed to return to the
      hospital if problems occurred subsequent to being discharged
      from the care of the physician.</p>

      <p class="text1">In Group I, there were five complications:
      two local infections, one instance each of mild hemorrhage
      which responded to local pressure, concealed penis, and
      postcircumcision phimosis. Local infection was diagnosed by
      the presence of pus and erythema on the wound. These were
      treated by local Neosporin ointment application. No systemic
      antibiotics were needed. Hemorrhage was defined as bleeding
      from the glans for more than 4 hours after the procedure was
      done. In the other groups, no complications arose. The
      overall incidence of complications was 1.6%, none of which
      were life-threatening or serious. Discussion Circumcision
      dates back to 2400 B.C. The first known record of the
      procedure exists on a relic in the temple of Khan el Karnak
      in Egypt. The plaque depicts an actual operation.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Archeologists believe that the custom
      existed before this time. In addition to Jews and Arabs,
      ritual circumcision is practiced among African tribes,
      Christian Abyssinians, Australian blacks, dwarf tribes of
      Gabon, Malayans, Men of Borneo, North and South American
      Indians, Aztecs, Mayas, Caribs, Fijians, and Samoans.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the United States, most circumcisions are
      performed for reasons other than religious beliefs. Parent's
      reasons for wanting circumcisions are hygiene, social custom,
      circumcised father, physical appearance, decreased infection,
      doctor's advice, and decreased cancer; some give no
      reason.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The exact incidence of complications from
      circumcisions is unknown.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The
      range of incidence is re ported from 0.2 to 38%.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,10</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">Life-threatening complication include sepsis
      and hemorrhage. Serious complications include staphylococcal
      scalded skin syndrome, necrosis of the glans, necrosis of the
      corpus spongiosum, severe trauma or injury to the glans,
      necrotizing fasciitis, fistulas, urinary retention, and
      secondary hypospadias or epispadias.</span><sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> In one series, problems resulted from
      circumcision of patients with an unrecognized
      hypospadias.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Minor
      complications include mild hemorrhage, local infection,
      superficial laceration, concealed penis, removal of excess
      skin, phimosis, meatal stenosis, meatitis, and separation of
      the penile skin from the mucous membrane.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Contraindications of the use of the
      Mogen clamp are the following: a very small penis, a
      penoscrotal web, a severe glandular adhesion, coronal
      hypospadias, and chordee without hypospadias.</p>

      <p class="text2">Besides the low incidence of complications
      from using the Mogen clamp, there are other advantages to
      circumcision with this technique. One is the need for a
      minimum of surgical instruments for this procedure in
      comparison to other methods. The requirements are a blunt
      edged probe, a straight Kelly hemostat, a scalpel, and the
      Mogen clamp. The surgical time is short, usually 3 to 4
      minutes. There is good control of the amount of the prepuce
      removed, which allows the Mogen clamp to be used on a small
      penis. Finally, the inflammatory process usually starts to
      resolve by 72 hours.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision by use of the Mogen clamp is an
      easy, quick, and safe procedure to learn.</p>
