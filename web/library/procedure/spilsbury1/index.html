      <blockquote>
        <p class="abstract"><b>Background:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Routine
        neonatal circumcision has declined in most English-speaking
        countries. The purpose of the present study was to
        investigate the trends in incidence of routine circumcision
        in Western Australia and current patterns of the procedure
        according to sociodemographic factors.<br />
         <b>Methods:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital morbidity data were
        used to conduct a population-based study of all
        circumcisions performed in Western Australian hospitals
        during 1981-1999. Medicare insurance rebate statistics were
        used to estimate the numbers of circumcisions performed
        outside of hospital on boys &lt;6 months of age between
        1994 and 1999.<br />
         <b>Results:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994, 9.8% of boys were
        circumcised before reaching 6 months of age, falling to
        7.9% by 1999. Boys &lt;6 months of age were 3.3 times more
        likely to undergo a hospital-performed circumcision if they
        lived in country areas compared with metropolitan Perth.
        Middle socioeconomic class families were twice as likely to
        circumcise a son than those in the higher and lower
        socio-economic groups. The decreasing circumcision rate in
        boys &lt;6 months of age was partly offset by an increase
        in routine circumcisions in boys older than 6 months of age
        during 1981-1999.<br />
         <b>Conclusion:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision remains a
        relatively common procedure in Western Australia. Based on
        total routine circumcision rates in 1999, 10.2% of boys
        will be circumcised by the time they reach 15 years of age.
        The routine circumcision rate in boys &lt;6 months is
        falling in contrast to a rising routine circumcision rate
        in older boys. Risk factors for a circumcision before 6
        months of age include living in country areas and a middle
        socioeconomic status.</p>

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision of boys is widely practised
      throughout the world, with an estimated one-sixth of the
      world's men having undergone the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The practice of circumcision dates
      back many thousands of years and has been carried out for
      ritual, religious, cultural and medical reasons. Today,
      religious beliefs prescribe circumcision of Jewish and Muslim
      boys and some tribal cultures perform circumcision as a rite
      of passage in early adult life.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> Circumcision first became a routine
      medical procedure in English-speaking countries in the late
      19th century, supposedly to prevent masturbation and cure
      conditions such as alcoholism and rheumatism.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> The practice further proliferated
      during the World Wars I and II with the view that it could
      improve hygiene and prevent venereal disease. The result of
      its widespread practice was the acceptance of circumcision as
      a social norm for the majority of newborn boys in most
      English-speaking countries. A controversial study by Gairdner
      in 1949 questioned neonatal circumcision, a practice that had
      led to the death of 19 English boys under age 5 years in
      1946.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Neonatal circumcision has
      since declined in England, to &lt;1% by 1985.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Similarly, in New Zealand the practice
      of neonatal circumcision has fallen sharply. In 1979, one
      study reported that 25% of infants were circumcised, while
      62% of their fathers had been circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Based on hospital morbidity (New
      Zealand Health Information Service, unpubl. data,
      2001)<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> and population
      data,<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> in 1995 &lt;0.5% of boys
      &lt;5 years of age were circumcised in New Zealand hospitals.
      Circumcision remains more prevalent in Canada and the USA
      although declining rates have been reported. The proportion
      of newborns circumcised in Ontario, Canada, fell from 53% in
      1979<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> to 44% in 1994,<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> while in the USA it was estimated
      that approximately 80% of newborns were circumcised in
      1980<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> compared with 61% in
      1992.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Australia has also
      reported a decline in neonatal circumcision, from 50% to 24%
      during the period 1974-1983.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      No recent estimates of neonatal circumcision have been
      reported from Australia.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">In agreement with
      medical associations in Canada,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> England <sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> and the USA,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> the Australasian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons states that neonatal circumcision has no
      medical indication and does not support the routine
      circumcision of newborn boys in Australia.</span> It also
      recommends that elective circumcisions be carried out after 6
      months of age.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> These
      recommendations are based on evidence that weighs the
      advantage of potential health benefits against the
      disadvantage of potential health complications, health-care
      costs and the legal issues of performing an unnecessary
      procedure on a minor. Given this lack of endorsement and the
      falling trends observed in other countries, it was expected
      that the rate of routine circumcision in Western Australia
      would have fallen since the last published statistics of 1983
      and that the rate is continuing to decline.</p>

      <p class="text2">As part of the Western Australian Safety and
      Quality of Surgical Care Project<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> the objective of the present study
      was to conduct a population-based review of the current
      incidence rates, trends and factors associated with the
      circumcision of boys &lt;6 months of age and boys 6 months
      and older, but &lt;15 years in Western Australia between 1981
      and 1999. The Western Australian Health Services Research
      Data Linkage System (WA Data Linkage System) was used to
      access hospital separation data based on a population of 1.9
      million people spanning a 19 year period.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <p class="text1">The WA Data Linkage System was used to
      extract hospital morbidity data on all boys circumcised in
      1981-1999. Morbidity records were selected using the
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure
      codes for circumcision (ICPM 5-640,<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> ICD-9-CM 64.0<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> or ICD-10-CM 30653-00<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup>). Circumcisions performed during the
      birth admission were not recorded in the WA Data Linkage
      System prior to 1992, which restricted analysis of boys &lt;6
      months of age to 1993-1999. Medicare rebate data from the
      Health Insurance Commission (Canberra, Australian Capital
      Territory) was used to estimate the number of circumcisions
      performed out of hospital (private rooms and general
      practitioner (GP) surgeries) on boys &lt;6 months old. The
      total number of circumcisions on boys &lt;6 months old was
      estimated by summing the number of publicly insured hospital
      patients and the number of Medicare claims from 1994 to 1999.
      All analysis was performed on anonymous data current to 31
      December 1999.</p>

      <p class="text2">Statistical analysis was performed using
      SPSS<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> and incidence rates over
      the 19 year study period calculated using the RATES
      CALCULATOR program.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Hospital
      location was used to assign a metropolitan or country
      hospital identifier. Patient postcodes were used to assign
      one of eight health service zones: the Perth metropolitan
      area and seven country areas (two remote regions, Kimberley
      and Pilbara, and five rural regions: Midwest, Central,
      South-west, Great Southern and Goldfields). A Socio-Economic
      Index of Disadvantage level derived from characteristics such
      as income, educational attainment, unemployment, and
      occupation, as determined by the Australian Bureau of
      Statistics from the 1996 census,was also assigned using
      patient postcodes. The numbers of male births grouped by year
      and postcode were obtained from the Health Department of
      Western Australia and were used as the denominators in the
      socioeconomic analysis. Logistic regression was used to
      estimate the relative risk of circumcised boys 6 months and
      older but &lt;15 years being Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait
      Islander. Admissions with more than one ICD procedure code
      and circumcisions during the birth admission were excluded
      from length of stay analysis. Day surgery procedures were
      counted as 1 day hospital stays.</p>

      <p class="text2">The total number and length of stay in
      hospital were estimated using both routine and medically
      indicated circumcisions. All age-specific trends were
      confined to routine circumcisions only. A routine
      circumcision in the present study was defined as any
      circumcision with an ICD diagnosis code for a routine
      circumcision (ICD-9 V50.2, ICD-9-CM V50.2 or ICD-10-CM Z41.2)
      or any circumcision performed in the absence of a medically
      indicated diagnosis code for penile disorders including
      phimosis, balanoposthitis, balanitis xerotica obliterans,
      hypospadias, other congenital disorders, vascular disorders,
      atrophy, fibrosis, ulcer, hypertrophy, priapism, abscess,
      boil, carbuncle, cellulitis, penile cancer or other
      unspecified penile disorders. Trends in the rate of
      circumcision for medically indicated reasons in Western
      Australia have been published elsewhere.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="text1">There were 25 718 index admissions recorded
      for circumcision in Western Australian hospitals in
      1981-1999. After using Medicare rebate data to include those
      additional procedures performed outside of the hospital
      system, it was estimated that an average of 2370 (SD &plusmn;
      62) circumcisions was performed annually during 1994-1999
      with 1490 (SD &plusmn; 71) of those performed for routine
      reasons. Seventy-six per cent (1132 &plusmn; 80) of routine
      circumcisions were performed on boys &lt;6 months of age. The
      average length of stay in hospital for a circumcision fell
      from 2.7 days in 1981 to 1.0 days in 1999 (mean difference,
      1.7 days; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.3&ndash;2.1). The
      cumulative risk of routine circumcision, based on 1999 data,
      was 10.2% by 15 years of age.</p>

         <img src="spilsbury1-fig2.gif" alt="Figure two" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">For boys &lt;6 months of age, the routine
      circumcision rate decreased by a geometric average of 3.8%
      per calendar year (95%CI: 2.4&ndash;5.1%) from 9.8 per 100
      person-years in 1994 to 7.9 per 100 person-years in 1999
      (Fig.1). The decline was more marked for hospital-performed
      circumcisions, which fell by 8.1% per year
      (95%CI:5.5&ndash;10.6%). Of the 4109 circumcisions performed
      on boys &lt;6 months between 1993 and 1999 in Western
      Australian hospitals, only 20 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait
      Islander boys (0.5%) were identified. The number of
      circumcisions performed outside of a hospital remained stable
      over the time period (95%CI: &ndash;1.5&ndash;2.6%).</p>

      <center>
        <img src="spilsbury1-table2.gif" alt="Table two" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">In general, boys &lt;6 months of age living
      in country areas of Western Australia were 3.3 (95%CI:
      2.8&ndash;3.9) times more likely to have an in-hospital
      circumcision than boys in the Perth metropolitan area in
      1993-1999 (Fig.2; Table 1). Further breakdown of country
      Western Australia into seven health service zones showed a
      wide variation in routine circumcision rates between
      populations resident in different regions. The two northern
      and most remote health service zones, the Kimberley and
      Pilbara, had routine circumcision rates similar to the Perth
      metropolitan area. The other five more rural health service
      zones had hospital rates of routine circumcisions three to
      four times higher than in the Perth metropolitan area.</p>

      <p class="text2">The annual circumcision rate in boys &lt;6
      months of age was also calculated by socioeconomic level and
      compared with the circumcision rate in the most disadvantaged
      (Table 2). The two middle socioeconomic levels had higher
      rates of circumcision compared with the lowest socioeconomic
      ranking (rate ratio (RR)=2.2, 95%CI: 1.7&ndash;2.7; RR = 1.6,
      95%CI: 1.2&ndash;2.0). There was no difference between the
      most and least disadvantaged groups (RR = 1.1, 95%CI:
      0.9&ndash;1.5).</p>

      <p class="text2">As boys grew older than 6 months, the rate
      of routine circumcision decreased exponentially (Fig.3). In
      1993-1999 the rate of routine circumcision of 1-year-old boys
      was 0.5 per 100 person- years, declining to 0.03 per 100
      person-years by age 14 years compared with 9.3 per 100
      person-years in boys &lt;6 months of age. This declining
      trend by age was observed also in the earlier calendar
      periods 1981-1986 and 1987-1992. In contrast, the rate of
      routine circumcision increased with calendar period in boys
      at any individual age. The largest increase was observed in
      6-year-old boys with 0.01 circumcisions per 100 person-years
      in 1981-1986,increasing 12-fold (95%CI: 5.6&ndash;4.6) to
      0.12 per 100 person-years by 1993-1999.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="spilsbury1-table1.gif" alt="Table two" /><br />
        <br />
         <img src="spilsbury1-fig3.gif" alt="Figure three" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Based on hospital records, 15.8% of all
      routine circumcisions on boys 6 months and older but &lt;15
      years were performed on Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait
      Islander boys. Most of these boys (96.6%) were living in
      rural Western Australia at the time. The relative risk of
      boys older than 6 months but &lt;15 years being Aboriginal
      and/or Torres Strait Islander when circumcised decreased by
      27% (95%CI: 4.2&ndash;56.7) with each more recent calendar
      period, indicating that the increased circumcision rates in
      older boys was a result of more non-Aboriginal boys being
      circumcised. A boy circumcised when aged 10-14 years was 23.7
      (95% CI:16.8&ndash;33.5) times more likely to be Aboriginal
      and/or Torres Strait Islander compared to a boy circumcised
      between 6 months and 4 years of age, after adjusting for
      calendar period and location.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text1">There was a 20% decline in the rate of
      circumcision of Western Australian boys &lt;6 months of age
      from 1994 to 1999 with approximately 8% currently being
      circumcised. This trend continues the 50% decline reported in
      neonatal circumcisions from 1974 to 1983.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> The rate of circumcisions performed
      in hospitals fell faster than those performed out of the
      hospital system.</p>

      <p class="text2">A marked dichotomy exists between the rates
      at which boys &lt;6 months of age from country areas were
      circumcised compared with those from the Perth metropolitan
      area. Approximately 72% of the Western Australian population
      reside in metropolitan Perth. In 1993-1999, a boy &lt;6
      months of age and living outside of Perth was more than three
      times as likely to be circumcised in hospital than a
      metropolitan boy of the same age.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are several possible explanations for
      the difference in circumcision practice between country and
      metropolitan Western Australia. First, GPs in country Western
      Australia are more likely to be older and male,<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> and thus are more likely to be
      circumcised than Perth doctors and perhaps be more willing to
      perform the procedure. Second, multicultural variation
      between the metropolitan and country populations may explain
      some differences in circumcision practice. This hypothesis is
      supported by census data showing that 36% of Perth residents
      were born overseas, mostly from European countries that do
      not practice routine circumcision. Residents of country
      regions were more likely to have been born in Australia, with
      21% born elsewhere. Last, it may be easier for parents in
      Perth to access physicians who are willing to perform
      circumcisions outside of the hospital system compared to
      country areas, which would reduce the rate of circumcisions
      performed in Perth hospitals compared with country hospitals.
      A more detailed study would be needed to confirm this.</p>

      <p class="text2">Variation in the rate of circumcision of
      boys &lt;6 months of age was observed between different
      country regions of Western Australia. The remote northern
      regions had rates of routine circumcision comparable to
      metropolitan Perth, while circumcision was significantly more
      common in the central and southern rural areas. The lower
      rates in the north were most likely due to the different
      population distribution. Approximately 35% of the population
      living in the Kimberley are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait
      Islander, yet very few Aboriginal boys were circumcised at
      such a young age. Aboriginal boys were most likely to be
      circumcised between 10 and 14 years of age. Other regional
      variations may also be reflected in the circumcision rate;
      for example, the higher circumcision rate in the Great
      Southern region may be influenced by a strong Muslim presence
      in some local communities. However, &lt;1% of the Western
      Australian population was Jewish or Muslim according to 1996
      Census data (Australian Bureau of Statistics) and religious
      circumcisions were not considered to impact significantly on
      the high routine circumcision rates of boys &lt;6 months of
      age.</p>

      <p class="text2">This difference between country and
      metropolitan medical practice has also been observed with
      other medical procedures in Western Australia. Rates of
      appendectomy, for example, are higher in country areas
      compared with metropolitan Perth.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> Thus, the different rates of routine
      circumcision between country and metropolitan areas may be
      due to more pervasive reasons common to all medical practice
      in Western Australia. The sometimes marginal economic
      viability of country medical practice may provide a perverse
      financial incentive for elevated elective procedure rates.
      There could also be less peer pressure for country physicians
      to adopt changing medical practice guidelines compared with
      physicians in metropolitan areas. Such issues need to be
      identified and addressed to ensure that country regions are
      not being disadvantaged in the provision of health care.</p>

      <p class="text2">In contrast to boys &lt;6 months of age, the
      rate of circumcision in boys 6 months and older but &lt;15
      years significantly increased over the 19 year study period.
      This increase was observed in non-Aboriginal boys. This
      suggests that some parents, in line with medical
      recommendations, may have delayed routine circumcision until
      their sons were older than 6 months. However, the lower
      overall circumcision rates in these boys was likely to be
      susceptible to other subtle changes in the cultural and
      religious environment in Western Australia during the study
      period. Muslims, for example, commonly practice circumcision,
      although unlike Judaism there is variation in the age it is
      performed, ranging from at birth and when aged 3-7 years of
      age.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Thus, the increased rates
      of circumcision of boys aged 3-7 years of age may be a
      reflection of the Muslim population that increased from 0.25%
      in 1981 to 1.1% of the Western Australian population in 2001
      (Australian Bureau of Statistics).</p>

      <p class="text2">The cost of routine circumcision to the
      health-care system is considerable. Approximately 1500
      unnecessary circumcisions are performed each year in Western
      Australia. This equates to approximately 15 000 circumcisions
      per year Australia-wide. Costs are estimated to range from
      $100 to $1600 for each circumcision, depending on whether
      hospital admission and general anaesthesia are involved.
      <span class="yellow">Therefore, Medicare, the national
      insurance system, spends somewhere between $1.5 and $24
      million per year on a procedure deemed unnecessary by the
      Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons. The
      potential savings to the public purse would be considerable
      if elective and discretionary circumcision was removed from
      the Medicare schedule in line with other cosmetic surgeries,
      leaving rebates for the genuine medically indicated
      circumcision.</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Removing the rebate may
      also encourage parents to reconsider having their young sons
      circumcised.</span> The main reasons that parents gave for
      circumcising their sons 35 years ago was a desire to conform
      to the Australian norm, uniformity with father or siblings,
      and hygiene.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Given that the
      uncircumcised state has become the norm today, further
      research is required to establish whether it is for hygienic,
      prophylactic or aesthetic reasons that some parents continue
      to circumcise their newborn sons in Western Australia.
      Identifying the reasons will inform the best approach to
      educating parents about the current medical opinion, <span
      class="yellow">which does not support routine neonatal
      circumcision.</span> Education could be further targeted
      towards the parents of middle class socioeconomic status, who
      were found in the present study to be more likely to have
      their sons circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">In comparison with other countries the rate
      of routine circumcision of boys &lt;6 months of age in
      Western Australia is less than that reported in the USA and
      Canada, but higher than rates reported in New Zealand and
      England. The declining trends in Western Australia are
      consistent with the international and national medical
      practice guidelines that do not support routine circumcision,
      although there remains room for further reductions in the
      procedure, particularly in country areas. While circumcision
      will continue for reasons of religion or rite of passage in
      some cultures, these cases make up only a small number of
      routine circumcisions in Western Australia, particularly
      those performed on boys &lt;6 months of age.</p>
