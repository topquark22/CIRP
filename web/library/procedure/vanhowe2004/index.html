      <p class="text1"><span class="init">N</span>eonatal male
      circumcision is the most commonly performed procedureon
      children in theUnited States. Although the topic has been the
      subject of heated debate during the past 3 decades, past
      studies<sup><a href="#n1">1&ndash;4</a></sup> have failed to
      demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the procedure. Despite
      these findings, most private insurance and state Medicaid
      programs in the United States continue to reimburse
      physicians who perform the procedure. In an era of limited
      health care funding, close scrutiny of the cost-effectiveness
      of medical practices has become increasingly important.</p>

      <p class="text2">Advocates of the surgery claim that the
      benefits of neonatal circumcision justify its universal
      implementation<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>; however,
      currently not a single national medical organization endorses
      neonatal circumcision.<sup><a href="#n6">6&ndash;11</a></sup>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; most recent task
      force on circumcision concluded that &ldquo;existing
      scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits
      of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not
      sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
      circumcision.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> The
      recommendation of the task force and the near ubiquity of the
      practice in the United States appear to be in conflict. In an
      effort to sort out these differences, the best available tool
      to determine the financial and health impact of the benefits
      of neonatal circumcision is a cost-utility analysis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since publication of the previous
      cost-utility and cost-effectiveness studies,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1&ndash;4</a></sup> 3 studies have documented
      circumcised men to be at greater risk for sexually
      transmitted diseases,<sup><a
      href="#n12">12&ndash;14</a></sup> and males circumcised at
      birth have been shown to be at risk for penile cancer,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> contrary to the popular belief that
      circumcision eliminated the possibility of this
      malignancy.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> <i>Meatal
      stenosis</i> (italicized medical terms are defined in the
      appendix), which was not included in previously published
      calculations, has been discovered to frequently affect
      circumcised males.<sup><a href="#n17">17&ndash;23</a></sup>
      With the publication of these studies, the Canadian
      Paediatric Society has recommended that a new cost-utility
      analysis of neonatal circumcision be performed.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Using the data currently available in
      the medical literature, a cost-utility analysis of neonatal
      circumcision was undertaken.</p>

      <h4>METHOD</h4>

      <p class="text2">A cost-utility analysis, using the reference
      case standard developed by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in
      Health and Medicine convened by the US Public Health Service
      in 1993,<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> was performed. The
      analysis adopted a societal perspective and included the 72-
      year life span of an average male because circumcision status
      is believed to impact health throughout life. Utility was
      estimated using the Quality of Well-being Scale and values as
      previously described.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a>,<a
      href="#n25">25&ndash;27</a></sup> The Quality of Well-being
      Scale assigns values in 4 categories: symptom/problem
      complexes, mobility scale, physical activity scale, and
      social activity scale. For each condition, a value is
      assigned for each of the scales. The total of the scale
      values is the quality of well-being lost by having the
      condition. This total is multiplied by the duration of the
      condition to estimate the impact of the condition in
      quality-adjusted life years. Odds ratios, used as an estimate
      of relative risk, are expressed as the odds among
      noncircumcised males divided by the odds among circumcised
      males. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects
      model (DerSimonian and Laird method) by the Mantel-Haenszel
      method.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence values, financial costs,
      utility weights, and durations used in this analysis are
      listed in Table 1. The values used to calculate costs for
      urinary tract infection and the costs and well-years lost for
      immediate complications from neonatal circumcision are listed
      in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. All costs have been
      adjusted to 1999 US dollars using the Consumer Price
      Index.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> Incidence values
      listed in Table 1 are the lifetime, cumulative incidence
      values. In the analysis, if a condition could occur over a
      number of years, the yearly incidence was divided over these
      years, and age-related yearly incidence rates were applied
      where available.</p>

      <p class="text2">Costs and utility were discounted at rates
      of 0%, 3%, and 5%.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> Previously
      published age distributions of the onset of penile
      cancer,<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> HIV,<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup> <i>phimosis</i>,
      <i>balanoposthitis</i>,<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> and
      sexually transmitted diseases.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> were employed in this analysis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Time lost from work for treatment and
      physician visits were valued using the May 1999 average
      earning in the private sector of the United States (hourly =
      $13.19).<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> Duration of time
      lost from work is used as described in the reference case
      standard<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> and, with the
      exception of the hospitalization of normal newborns for which
      no time lost from work costs were assessed, equaled the
      length of hospitalization and/or the length of illness of
      severity enough to prevent return to day care. The time lost
      from work cost for a physician visit was assumed to be 4 h or
      a half-day of work.</p>

      <p class="text2">A Markov analysis model was chosen to
      accommodate varying ages of onset, chronic disease states,
      recurrences, and discounting. Calculations were performed
      using DATA 3.5 for Healthcare for Windows (TreeAge Software,
      Inc., Williamstown, MA). Cycle length was 1 year with 72
      cycles performed. Transition probabilities were determined by
      disease incidence, the odds ratios as an estimate of relative
      risk between the 2 groups, and the age-incidence data where
      available. Sensitivity analysis as well as calculations of
      the most favorable scenario (MFS; the least costly for
      circumcision and the most costly for noncircumcision) and the
      least favorable scenario (LFS; the most costly for
      circumcision and the least costly for noncircumcision) for
      neonatal circumcision were performed. A Monte Carlo
      simulation taking 1000 samples was performed employing the
      distributions of 24 of the most influential variables.</p>

      <p class="text2">Articles addressing the impact of neonatal
      circumcision on health were collected by searching MEDLINE
      using <i>circumcision</i> as a search word, reviewing the
      citations in pertinent articles, and querying experts in the
      field. Articles published since 1900 were considered.
      Preference was given to the most current information.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sensitivity analysis was performed on 47
      variables. The greatest obstacle in performing the analysis
      was the large number of variables in the decision tree and
      the wide variation in the medical literature for nearly all
      of these variables. This necessitated the establishment of
      the MFS and LFS. The MFS would reflect the opinions of
      circumcision advocates, who emphasize circumcision&rsquo;s
      benefits and downplay its risks while emphasizing the
      <i>prepuce&rsquo;s</i> propensity for disease. The LFS would
      alternatively place neonatal circumcision in the worst
      possible light. By establishing these scenarios, the most
      extreme views are accommodated in the analysis. The 95%
      confidence interval for the analysis would likely be within
      these extremes.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> In the
      absence of a professional consensus, a baseline analysis was
      developed based on review of the medical literature, taking
      study design and methods into account.</p>

      <h4>Cost of Neonatal Circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text2">A median physician reimbursement of $107,
      derived from a national survey of physicians, was used in the
      calculations and adjusted for 1999 US dollars.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> The cost of performing a neonatal
      circumcision consists of more than the reimbursement to the
      physician. The time of hospital personnel, use of hospital
      space, and sterilization and handling of hospital equipment
      have also to be considered and has been estimated previously
      to be 82%of the physician costs.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> The combination of the
      physician-related costs and hospital-related costs brings the
      total cost of an inpatient neonatal circumcision to $195. The
      duration of symptoms following neonatal circumcision was
      assumed to be 7 days.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Rate of Immediate Complications from Neonatal
      Circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text2">The rate of immediate complications from
      neonatal circumcision in the medical literature ranges from
      0.2%<sup><a href="#n38">38,39</a></sup> to 3.1%<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> to 6.4%.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup> The 0.2% value was derived in 2
      separate studies that relied on databases rather than chart
      reviews to collect information. Since a database is likely to
      miss a substantial number of complications, the 3.1% value,
      derived by investigators with the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention after thorough review of more than 1600
      charts,<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> was employed for the
      baseline analysis. The 0.2% value was used for the MFS,
      whereas the 6.4% value was used for the LFS.</p>

      <h4>Immediate Complications</h4>

      <p class="text2">Complication costs were estimated using the
      cost of each complication and its absolute frequency (Table
      3). The frequencies were determined by combining the data
      from 10 published series.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a>,<a
      href="#n40">40&ndash;48</a></sup> Because circumcision of an
      infant with <i>hypospadias</i> was not included in all of the
      published studies, the incidence reported by Gee and
      Ansell<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup> was used. Since one or
      both parents often take time off from work associated with
      the birth of a child, no cost for additional time of lost
      work was attributed to the immediate complications following
      neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <h4>Prolonged Hospitalization</h4>

      <p class="text2">A large, multicenter study determined that a
      circumcised boy stayed, on average, 0.26 days longer in the
      hospital regardless of the route of delivery. This translates
      into approximately one-fourth of circumcised boys staying in
      the hospital an extra day when compared to boys not
      circumcised. The increased length of stay was not attributed
      to complications from the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> The increase in hospitalization
      costs due to delayed hospital discharge of the mother and
      newborn was included for all circumcisions performed prior to
      perinatal discharge.</p>

      <h4>Death from Circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text2">Similar to children who die of heritable
      disorders,<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup> deaths resulting
      from complications of neonatal circumcision are often not
      reported as such on the death certificate. To determine the
      number of deaths due to circumcision by tabulating the number
      of cases reported in the medical literature is likewise
      folly.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> The most commonly
      quoted death rate for neonatal circumcision is 1 in
      500,000.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> This incidence was
      used for calculating both the MFS and the baseline analysis.
      Alternatively, Gairdner reported between 9 and 12 deaths out
      of 90,000 circumcisions performed each year in the United
      Kingdom.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> This incidence was
      used in the LFS.</p>

      <h4>Urinary Tract Infection</h4>

      <p class="text2">Until 1999, urinary tract infection rates
      have been reported as low as 0.01%<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> and as high as 0.31%<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup> in circumcised boys and as low as
      0.1%<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> and as high as
      4.12%<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> in noncircumcised boys.
      Larger studies from the US Army dependent population that
      yielded the 4.12% incidence have subsequently failed to
      replicate the 4.12% rate.<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup>
      Case-controlled prospective studies have documented odds
      ratios from 4.02<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> to
      4.87.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The assumptions for the baseline analysis
      rely heavily on a Canadian study published in <i>The
      Lancet</i> in 1999 by To and associates.<sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup> Although this study was based on a
      patient database, it avoids several of the flaws that
      characterized the US Army studies.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a>,<a href="#n56">56</a>,<a
      href="#n57">57</a>,<a href="#n61">61</a>,<a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup> The Canadian study documented that
      circumcised boys with urinary tract infection were more
      likely to be treated as outpatients than were noncircumcised
      boys with urinary tract infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of hospitalized urinary tract
      infections in the 1st year of life was estimated directly
      from the Canadian study. To and others also documented the
      number of outpatient billings for urinary tract infection.
      The incidence of outpatient urinary tract infections was
      estimated by taking the number of billings for outpatient
      urinary tract infection and dividing it by 2.5 (this assumed
      that each outpatient urinary tract infection had an average
      of 2.5 billings related to the urinary tract infection). When
      the number of inpatient and outpatient urinary tract
      infections are combined, the overall rate is similar or
      higher than what has been reported in other studies.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup> The costs of inpatient and
      outpatient treatment of urinary tract infection were adopted
      from Hoberman and associates<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup>
      as shown in Table2. The adjustments of the costs estimated by
      Hoberman and associates reflect that renal scans are
      currently not part of the standard workup for urinary tract
      infection 65 and that less expensive antibiotics are more
      commonly used than those employed in their study.</p>

      <p class="text2">For the LFS, the lower 95% confidence
      interval from the Canadian study was used. For the MFS, the
      urinary tract infection rate for noncircumcised boys was the
      upper 95% confidence interval value from the Canadian study.
      The urinary tract infection rate for circumcised boys was
      assumed to be one-tenth this value (consistent with the odds
      ratios reported in the US Army studies).</p>

      <p class="text2">Although weak, evidence in the literature
      suggests that noncircumcised boys who develop urinary tract
      infection are less likely to have renal disease than
      circumcised boys who develop urinary tract infection.<sup><a
      href="#n66">66&ndash;69</a></sup> The assumptions used
      reflect this.</p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of sepsis coinciding with
      urinary tract infection varies widely. The highest value
      (36.3%) was found in the study by Wiswell and Geschke, who
      also found 2 cases of meningitis.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> Recently, Hoberman and others found
      a bacteremia rate of between 3% and 5% in male and female
      infants with urinary tract infection.<sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup> Similarly, Craig and colleagues
      reported concomitant bacteremia in 4.86% of boys.<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> Many of the cases of bacteriuria
      seen by Wiswell and Geschke can be attributed to the young
      patient age (younger than 1 month) and boys who were
      &ldquo;too sick&rdquo; to circumcise in whom urinary tract
      infections and meningitis were sequelae of primary sepsis.
      The bacteremia rate of 4.86% in the Australian study was used
      in the baseline analysis.<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Hospital Admissions in the 1st Year of Life</h4>

      <p class="text2">In the Canadian database used to determine
      the rate of urinary tract infection based on circumcision
      status, it was discovered that circumcised boys were
      significantly more likely to require hospitalization
      (excluding hospitalizations for urinary tract infection)
      during the 1st year of life.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>
      The MFS and LFS were determined using the 95% confidence

      hospitalizations are accounted for elsewhere in the

      <h4>Phimosis</h4>

      with the topic of phimosis is determining what constitutes
      &ldquo;pathologic&rdquo; phimosis as opposed to developmental
      phimosis. The definition of phimosis has never been precise
      and is often applied to the normal foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> Prospective studies have
      demonstrated phimosis to be a rare finding in boys. Smith and
      others found 1 case of phimosis in 1000 boys.<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> In 213 Japanese boys younger than 2
      years, only 4 (1.88%) had a &ldquo;pinhole
      prepuce.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup> In France,
      the rate was 2.6%,<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> whereas in
      England, the incidence of true pathologic phimosis was
      calculated to be 0.9%.<sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup> The
      most recent study from Liverpool found that 0.6%of boys would
      develop phimosis by 15 years of age.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">When only prospective studies with a clear
      definition of phimosis are considered, the rate of pathologic
      phimosis, or <i>preputial stenosis</i>, is less than 2% in
      noncircumcised boys <sup><a href="#n72">72</a>,<a
      href="#n74">74&ndash;76</a></sup> and 0.32%<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> to 1%<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> in circumcised boys.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although most cases of preputial stenosis in
      noncircumcised males result from premature, forcible
      retraction of the prepuce and resolve with a program of
      stretching by hand,<sup><a href="#n76">76&ndash;78</a></sup>
      new studies have shown that topical therapy with
      corticosteroids is 75% to 95% effective.<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> Also, <i>preputial plasty</i> has
      superior results compared to circumcision, with half the
      morbidity and a significantly shorter recovery period.<sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup> For the MFS, all cases of preputial
      stenosis underwent circumcision. For the LFS, topical therapy
      was attempted first, followed by preputial plasty. For the
      baseline analysis, 25% were treated initially with topical
      therapy, whereas the remainder were circumcised.</p>

      <h4>Paraphimosis</h4>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of <i>paraphimosis</i>, which
      is nearly always iatrogenic, is unknown. Gairdner reported in
      1949 that 7 (0.88%) out of 800 hospital admissions for male
      children were for paraphimosis and 10 (0.20%) out of 5000
      adult male hospital admissions were for paraphimosis.<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> The incidence of paraphimosis for
      the population as a whole would be substantially less than
      these figures. Therapy involves initial decompression
      followed by treatment of the underlying preputial
      stenosis.</p>

      <h4>Balanitis</h4>

      <p class="text2"><i>Balanitis</i> refers to any inflammation
      of the penis, including conditions known as <i>posthitis</i>,
      balanitis, and balanoposthitis. The rate of balanitis is
      similar in both groups,<sup><a href="#n80">80,81</a></sup>
      but the rate of balanitis in noncircumcised boys aged 3 is
      very low (0.07%).<sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup> Studies
      have consistently found that at the ages at which boys are in
      diapers, the rate of balanitis is lower in noncircumcised
      boys.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a>,<a href="#n80">80</a></sup>
      The rate of balanitis may be lower in circumcised males after
      toilet training,<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup> but one
      study of adult men found balanitis more commonly in
      circumcised men (one-third of patients) than would be
      expected based on the circumcision rate in that community (5%
      to 10%).<sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup> The impact of
      circumcision on the incidence of balanitis in adult men is
      unknown.</p>

      <h4>Pyoderma</h4>

      <p class="text2">Studies by Enzenauer and others found that
      circumcised boys were more likely to have symptomatic topical
      skin infections, with an incidence of 2.7% in noncircumcised
      boys and 6.4% in circumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="#n85">84,85</a></sup> Several previous studies found
      that staphylococcal <i>pyoderma</i> in newborns affected
      predominantly boys, nearly all of whom were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n86">86&ndash;88</a></sup> This
      finding is consistent with the change in the periurethral
      bacterial flora following circumcision, which goes from
      predominantly gram-negative organisms to gram-positive
      organisms, predominantly staphylococcus.<sup><a
      href="#n89">89&ndash;91</a></sup> MFS and LFS were calculated
      using 95% confidence intervals from the data of Enzenauer and
      colleagues.</p>

      <h4>Coronal Adhesions</h4>

      <p class="text2">Preputial remnants will often adhere to the
      surface of the <i>glans</i> following circumcision. Rates of
      8%,<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> 12%, and 15%<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup> were used to make calculations,
      although rates as high as 29.7% have been reported in the
      literature.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Most of these
      <i>coronal adhesions</i> will dissolve spontaneously, but a
      rate of surgery to lyse the adhesions of 3.3% has been
      reported and was used in the present calculations.<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Subpreputial Debris</h4>

      <p class="text2">A substantial percentage (24.7%) of
      circumcised boys will have epithelial debris trapped between
      the glans and overlying skin while they are still in diapers.
      In older boys, this debris is rarely found.<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> This debris can cause irritation and
      may signal improper hygiene. In contrast, <i>smegma</i>, the
      epithelial debris found between the glans and foreskin, is a
      rare finding in noncircumcised infants (0.5%).<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> In the general population of
      noncircumcised adolescent boys and young men, the rate of
      substantial smegma accumulation is approximately 2%.<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Meatitis and Meatal Stenosis</h4>

      <p class="text2">Studies have found meatal ulcerations in
      8%to 31% of circumcised boys.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a>,<a
      href="#n53">53</a>,<a href="#n94">94</a></sup> Traumatic
      meatitis of the unprotected postcircumcision urethral meatus
      and/or meatal ischemia following damage to the frenular
      artery at circumcision may lead to <i>meatal
      stenosis</i>,<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> which is a
      major contributor to obstructive uropathy.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94,95</a></sup> The incidence of meatal stenosis
      following circumcision ranges between 2.9%<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> and 11.1%.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> The rates of developing meatal
      stenosis were assumed to be 3%, 5%,<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> and 8%<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> for making calculations. Half were
      estimated to require <i>meatotomy</i>. Boys aged 3 to 7 years
      were considered most likely to develop meatal stenosis.</p>

      <h4>Circumcision Revision</h4>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision revision rates of 1%,<sup><a
      href="#n43">43,47</a></sup> 2.8%,<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> and 9.5%<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> have been reported. These rates were
      used for the different scenarios.</p>

      <h4>HIV</h4>

      <p class="text2">Several studies conducted in Africa have
      shown HIV to be more common in noncircumcised men; other
      studies have shown the opposite, whereas most have shown
      little or no difference.<sup><a href="#n96">96,97</a></sup>
      The HIV pandemic in Africa demonstrates distinct
      epidemiological differences from the outbreaks in North
      America or Europe.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup> For
      example, most infections in Europe and North America are
      transmitted by nonheterosexual means. Based on World Health
      Organization 1998 data of First World countries, the United
      States has the highest rate of HIV as well as the highest
      rate of infant circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n97">97&ndash;100</a></sup> Consequently, what little
      evidence for a role of circumcision in preventing HIV
      infection in the United States is weak and inconclusive.</p>

      <p class="text2">For calculation purposes, the baseline
      analysis used an odds ratio of 1.78, with the extreme cases
      using the 95% confidence interval of 1.33 and 2.37 derived
      from performing a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed published
      studies,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a>,<a href="#n97">97</a>,<a
      href="#n101">101&ndash;109</a></sup> using a random effects
      model.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> The annual incidence
      of heterosexually transmitted HIV for men not identified as
      intravenous drug users in 1998 in the United States was 398
      per million.<sup><a href="#n100">100</a></sup> Using the 1.78
      odds ratio, the incidence of HIV infection would be 509 and
      287 per million in noncircumcised and circumcised men,
      respectively. The impact of circumcision status on HIV
      transmission in homosexual men has received little or no
      study with conflicting results.<sup><a
      href="#n110">110,111</a></sup> Likewise, the impact of
      circumcision status on the transmission of HIV in intravenous
      drug users would be difficult to explain. Consequently, only
      heterosexually transmitted HIV was considered in this
      model.</p>

      <h4>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</h4>

      <p class="text2">Although it has long been assumed that men
      with foreskins were at higher risk for sexually transmitted
      diseases, new studies have shown circumcised men to be at
      increased risk for developing gonorrhea, syphilis, genital
      warts, nongonococcal urethritis, chlamydial infections, and
      genital herpes. Many of the older studies failed to control
      for differences in sexual practices, socioeconomic status,
      and so forth, whereas several of the newer studies used study
      design elements to minimize the impact of these factors.
      Overall, circumcised men may have a greater number of
      sexually transmitted diseases.<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A random-effects model 28 of meta-analysis
      was applied to available data<sup><a href="#n107">107</a>,<a
      href="#n112">112&ndash;114</a></sup> to determine the impact
      of circumcision status on susceptibility to different
      sexually transmitted diseases. Summary effects were used in
      the best judgment calculation, whereas the 95% confidence
      intervals were used for the MFS and LFS. The incidences and
      age distributions of the various sexually transmitted
      diseases in American males were provided by the National
      Health and Social Life Survey conducted by a research team at
      the University of Chicago.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Penile Cancer</h4>

      <p class="text2">While keeping the incidence of penile cancer
      in noncircumcised men consistent with the rate reported in
      northern Europe (lifetime risk of 1 in 1149),<sup><a
      href="#n115">115&ndash;117</a></sup> the rate in circumcised
      men was reduced using the odds ratio and 95% confidence
      intervals determined by Maden and others.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> The cost of treating penile cancer
      was estimated at $25,000.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> For
      the 20% of men expected to die from penile cancer, an
      additional cost of $10,000 was added to reflect the cost
      associated with their greater morbidity. Age-of-onset
      data<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> were used to calculate
      well-years lost as previously described,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> with one alteration: Instead of an
      8-year delay in loss of life expectancy for all men with
      penile cancer, the 20% expected to die from the illness were
      tallied as mortalities, whereas loss of health for 3 years
      was tallied for the 80% who survived the cancer.</p>

      <h4>Foreskin Restoration</h4>

      <p class="text2">A growing number of men circumcised at birth
      have been pursuing foreskin restoration.<sup><a
      href="#n118">118&ndash;122</a></sup> Approximately 0.1% of
      men circumcised at birth could be expected to pursue foreskin
      restoration. Of these, only 2.5% would rely on surgical
      means, with the remainder relying on taping methods and
      devices that stretch skin over the glans. The average
      duration of foreskin stretching is about 4 years (Wayne
      Griffiths, personal communication, March 1997).<sup><a
      href="#n120">120,121</a></sup></p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <h4>Markov Analysis</h4>

      <p class="text2">Marginal costs for the different cost
      scenarios and discount rates are seen in Table 4. In every
      scenario, it was more costly to circumcise. Using the
      baseline analysis, neonatal circumcision and its sequelae
      cost $828.42 (3% discount) to $837.59 (5% discount) more than
      leaving the genitalia intact. Even for the MFS, circumcision
      was more costly. In all scenarios, the cost of neonatal
      circumcision is higher than noncircumcision, regardless of
      the discount rate.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">With one exception, each set of assumptions
      and discount rates results in neonatal circumcision having an
      overall lifetime negative impact on health (Table 5). The
      only exception was the MFS with no discount of costs or
      utility. When discounting is applied, the positive health
      effect of this extreme situation cannot be demonstrated. With
      neonatal circumcision having an overall negative impact on
      health and failing to save money, noncircumcision was clearly
      the dominant strategy.</p>

      <h4>Sensitivity Analysis</h4>

      <p class="text2">Forty-seven variables were subjected to
      sensitivity analysis. Individually, none of the variables
      altered the conclusion of the analysis. The impact of the 22
      most influential variables is depicted in a tornado diagram
      (Figure 1). The variables related to the initial circumcision
      had the most impact. The threshold incidences of various
      ailments in noncircumcised males necessary to make neonatal
      circumcision cost-neutral in the baseline analysis (3%
      discount) are listed in Table 6. For all ailments, the
      incidence to make neonatal circumcision cost-neutral is far
      outside the realm of what has been reported in the medical
      literature.</p>

      <p class="text2">To make neonatal circumcision cost-neutral,
      hospitalized urinary tract infections would need to cost
      $229,564. One-way sensitivity analysis was unable to reach a
      threshold for the physician fee, for the rate of immediate
      complications, the death rate, or for the duration of pain
      following the procedure. Using the baseline analysis (3%
      discount), if neonatal circumcision were cost-free, were
      immediate complication-free, had no additional days of
      hospitalization, and had no immediate negative impact on
      health, neonatal circumcision would still be more costly
      (marginal $400.03) and have a negative impact on health
      (marginal 3.34 well-years/ 1000).</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">This analysis
      demonstrates that regardless of the values placed on the
      variables in the model, neonatal circumcision is more costly
      and has more adverse health effects over the lifetime than
      foregoing the procedure does.</span> This is demonstrated
      using sensitivity analysis, analysis of extreme scenarios,
      and Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

      <p class="text2">The results of the present study are in step
      with those previously published. The studies by Lawler and
      colleagues.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and Ganiats and
      associates.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> found little
      difference in lifetime cost between those circumcised at
      birth and those left intact. Newer, less invasive treatments
      of preputial stenosis, as well as a better understanding of
      the penile problems seen in circumcised men (including penile
      cancer and meatal stenosis) and the cost of longer perinatal
      stays, have swung the pendulum away from a cost-neutral
      position. Consistent with the present study, Ganiats and
      associates found that neonatal circumcision impaired health
      to the degree that it would take a 28% rate of circumcision
      later in life to have the same negative impact on
      health.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Similar to the present
      analysis, Chessare found that the rate of urinary tract
      infection among infant boys with foreskins must equal or
      exceed 29% for neonatal circumcision to be
      cost-effective.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Similar to
      previous studies, penile cancer and urinary tract infections
      played only a small role in total financial analysis because
      more common penile problems had a much larger impact.</p>

      <p class="text2">The greatest handicap in the development of
      this analysis was the poor quality of the vast majority of
      the studies encountered. Although most studies provided raw
      data, very few identified, let alone controlled for,
      confounding factors or effect modifiers. No attempts were
      made to confirm the validity of ecological data or the
      accuracy of demographic information from databases. In some
      studies, subjects were arbitrarily excluded, whereas in
      others, including prospective studies, circumcision status
      was not recorded in substantial percentages. The wide range
      of study results likely reflects this lack of attention to
      solid methodology.</p>

      <p class="text2">Because of the large number of variables in
      the analysis and their additive effects, traditional 2-way
      and 3-way sensitivity analysis could not adequately address
      the diversity of available data and would underestimate the
      confidence interval of the model.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> By calculating the extreme scenarios
      favoring circumcision and favoring noncircumcision, knowing
      that the 95% confidence interval would be well within this
      range, sensitivity analysis of all variables is
      simultaneously accomplished. Since the extreme scenario
      favoring neonatal circumcision found the procedure to cost
      more in both money and health, it is therefore impossible to
      manipulate the variables to justify neonatal circumcision on
      a financial or health basis. Since it is unlikely that the
      MFS or the LFS reflect reality, the truth lies somewhere in
      between these 2 extremes. The baseline analysis, especially
      given the poor quality of the studies to chose from, is a
      rough estimate. The breadth of the confidence interval of the
      baseline analysis is more closely estimated using the Monte
      Carlo simulation. The limitation of this method is its
      inability to accommodate all of the variables in the model
      and tendency to center on the baseline result.</p>

      <p class="text2">Studies from the past century were reviewed
      to determine their role in this analysis. Although more
      weight was given to recent studies, in general results were
      more dependent on study design than on the decade in which
      the study was performed. The lack of definitive studies is in
      part due to the rarity of benefits from neonatal
      circumcision, if they exist at all, and poor study design. In
      nearly all of the studies consulted, it was impossible to
      differentiate the impact of circumcision from other
      characteristics that distinguish circumcised and
      noncircumcised populations. The 40-fold difference between
      the low and high value of immediate complication rates is
      indicative of the difficulty in studying this issue. The low
      value was compiled by using a database of 136,086 boys born
      in US Army hospitals worldwide from 1980 to 1985.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> The charts of these individuals were
      not reviewed, nor was a sample reviewed to determine whether
      the database accurately reflected what could be abstracted
      directly from the charts. Undocumented complications of
      circumcision are not unusual. As a result, a database would
      seriously underestimate the complication rate of neonatal
      circumcision. Despite these methodological flaws, the results
      from the Wiswell and Geschke study, which were confirmed in a
      recent study sharing the identical methodology,<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> were used in calculating the
      MFS.</p>

      <p class="text2">Likewise, there are a number of obstacles in
      studying the impact of the presence of a foreskin on urinary
      tract infections. The most notable is the difficulty in
      accurately documenting differences regarding rare
      occurrences. The other major obstacle is the number of
      confounding risk factors for developing a urinary tract
      infection that have yet to be controlled for in most of the
      studies published to date. These include rooming in,<sup><a
      href="#n122">122</a></sup> breastfeeding,<sup><a
      href="#n123">123&ndash;127</a></sup> parental education and
      social status,<sup><a href="#n128">128</a></sup> prenatal
      maternal urinary tract infections,<sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup> history of urinary tract infection
      in a 1st-degree relative,<sup><a href="#n127">127</a></sup>
      maternal fever at the time of delivery, perinatal
      anoxia,<sup><a href="#n130">130</a></sup> low birth
      weight,<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> prematurity,<sup><a
      href="#n132">132&ndash;134</a></sup> hygienic
      practices,<sup><a href="#n135">135&ndash;138</a></sup>
      previous bacterial or viral infection, previous course of
      antibiotics,<sup><a href="#n127">127</a></sup> race,<sup><a
      href="#n139">139&ndash;143</a></sup> urine collection
      method,<sup><a href="#n144">144&ndash;147</a></sup> and
      diagnostic criteria.<sup><a href="#n148">148,149</a></sup>
      Any one of these factors might explain the small (less than 1
      per 100) absolute difference in the incidence of urinary
      tract infection documented in previous studies. To date, only
      1 study has adjusted for perinatal complication and
      socioeconomic status.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>
      Otherwise, none of the other factors have been addressed.</p>

      <p class="text2">The reasons for using the recent Canadian
      study by To and associates<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> in
      estimating urinary tract infection risk are 4-fold. First, To
      and associates studied the entire population of Ontario,
      which should be fairly representative of the general
      population, as opposed to dependents of a volunteer army,
      which may not be representative of the population as a whole.
      Second, the Canadian study eliminated from consideration
      newborns with complicated neonatal courses and controlled for
      socioeconomic status. In the US Army studies, one-third of
      the boys not circumcised at birth were too sick to undergo
      the procedure neonatally.<sup><a href="#n150">150</a></sup>
      Third, the Canadian study had a nearly even proportion of
      boys circumcised and not circumcised, whereas the US Army
      studies had a very high circumcision rate. Thus, the impact
      of a unidirectional misclassification error, to which
      database studies are prone and reported to be as high as 15%
      to 30%,<sup><a href="#n40">40</a>,<a
      href="#n151">151</a></sup> would be less in the Canadian
      study. Finally, the Canadian study tabulated urinary tract
      infections treated as both outpatients and in- patients,
      whereas the US Army study considered only urinary tract
      infections treated as inpatients.</p>

      <p class="text2">A mathematical model has been developed to
      assess the potential impact of the confounding variables
      listed above insofar as they can be differentially attributed
      to circumcision status. Even when no underlying difference in
      the incidence of true urinary tract infection is assumed, a
      4-fold increase in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection
      in noncircumcised males can be demonstrated (unpublished
      data). Other factors, such as breast-feeding, can have a
      large impact on urinary tract infection rates, but their
      relative distribution to circumcised and noncircumcised males
      is unknown. Likewise, adjusting the large urinary tract
      infection database studies for prematurity or
      misclassification substantially reduced the odds ratio of the
      association between the prepuce and urinary tract
      infections.<sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup> After
      accounting for the combined impact of confounding factors and
      misclassification, the association between the prepuce and
      diagnosing urinary tract infection may be fatuous. This is
      suggested by several studies from Israel that have
      demonstrated that neonatal circumcision induces an incidence
      spike of urinary tract infections shortly following the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a>,<a
      href="#n153">153,154</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Randomized blinded prospective studies are
      impossible, so in their absence, methodologically flawed
      observational studies,<sup><a href="#n155">155</a></sup>
      showing that the prepuce predisposes to preputial stenosis,
      urinary tract infections, and penile cancer, were considered
      valid for purposes of this study. It is reasonable to doubt
      the role of the prepuce in these conditions. No study has
      ever demonstrated that neonatal circumcision significantly
      lowers the incidence of preputial stenosis. The incidences of
      penile cancer in Denmark,<sup><a href="#n115">115</a></sup>
      Finland,<sup><a href="#n117">117</a></sup> Norway,<sup><a
      href="#n116">116</a></sup> and Japan,<sup><a
      href="#n156">156</a></sup> where less than 1.5% of men are
      circumcised, are lower than in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n157">157</a></sup> where the majority of men are
      circumcised. If circumcision is believed to decrease the risk
      of developing penile cancer, it is unclear why these
      noncircumcising countries with similar standards of living
      and hygiene have lower incidences of penile cancer. There is
      inconsistency and a high degree of variation in the studies
      looking at circumcision status and sexually transmitted
      diseases,<sup><a href="#n112">112</a></sup> including HIV
      infection.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup> Nearly all studies
      of immediate complications from neonatal circumcision are
      retrospective and may underestimate the number of
      complications. For example, the only prospective study
      published to date investigated only bleeding and found that
      9.9% of boys who underwent neonatal circumcision had notable
      bleeding following the surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n158">158</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although the focus of this analysis is the
      cost utility of neonatal circumcision given the present
      medical milieu in North America, HIV data from Africa were
      included in the analysis because of their availability. Most
      experts agree that the pandemic in Africa is clearly
      different than the pandemic in North America.<sup><a
      href="#n98">98</a></sup> As a result, using African data may
      overstate the advantage of neonatal circumcision as North
      American studies have, for the most part, failed to document
      any advantage for circumcised males.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a>,<a href="#n110">110</a>,<a
      href="#n159">159</a>,<a href="#n160">160</a></sup> A cost
      utility of circumcision for males living in Africa would
      require a different set of assumptions but should be
      undertaken before implementation of any circumcision
      policy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Odds ratios closely approximate relative
      risks when the incidence of events is small. Since most
      outcomes for which the odds ratio were relied on occurred in
      less than 1% of the population, the expected difference
      between relative risks and odds ratio would be small. For
      example, the odds ratio of 1.7739 used for HIV infection
      corresponds to a relative risk of 1.7735. For penile cancer,
      the odds ratio of 3.002 corresponds to a relative risk of
      3.000. For urinary tract infections, the odds ratio of 1.506
      corresponds to a relative risk of 1.505. Clearly, converting
      odds ratios to relative risks would have a minimal impact on
      the outcome of the analysis.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are several factors excluded from the
      analysis because of the difficulty in quantifying their
      effect. For example, neonatal pain experts now believe that
      neonates may feel more pain for a given stimulus than older
      infants do.<sup><a href="#n161">161</a></sup> Although it is
      unknown how long neonates suffer from circumcision, it has
      been demonstrated that circumcised boys cry louder and longer
      when given their immunizations several months later.<sup><a
      href="#n162">162</a></sup> No attempt was made to quantify
      this alteration in pain response. Likewise, no attempt was
      made to place a value on bodily integrity or the retention of
      the specialized nerve endings concentrated in the end of the
      prepuce.<sup><a href="#n163">163</a></sup> These intangibles
      weigh in favor of leaving the penis alone. Also, the value of
      the infant to be free from intrusive unnecessary medical and
      surgical procedures before he has reached the age of full and
      legal discretion (<i>Little v Little</i> 576 S. W. 2d 493-5;
      <i>Re Richardson</i> 284 So 2d 185-7; <i>Wisconsin v

      <i>Prince v Massachusetts</i> 321 US 158 (1944)<sup><a
      href="#n164">164</a></sup> was not considered.</p>

      <p class="text2">Any adjustments in this analysis for the
      impact of neonatal circumcision on genital hygiene or genital
      &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; would be purely speculative since,
      other than 2 studies demonstrating an increase in
      hygiene-related issues in circumcised boys younger than 3
      years,<sup><a href="#n23">23</a>,<a href="#n80">80</a></sup>
      no study has demonstrated circumcision&rsquo;s impact on
      hygiene or &ldquo;being different&rdquo; from one&rsquo;s
      cohort, let alone their magnitude, prevalence, or direction.
      Given this lack of factual evidence, no attempt was made to
      incorporate these undocumented concerns into the
      analysis.</p>

      <p class="text2">The perpetuation of neonatal circumcision
      cannot be justified financially or medically; therefore, any
      justification for the practice must be based on religion,
      culture, or aesthetics. A limitation of cost-utility analysis
      is the inability to incorporate such factors. Currently in
      the United States, cultural considerations trump financial
      and health concerns when deciding to have a newborn male
      circumcised. Consequently, this cost-utility analysis will
      have little or no impact on circumcisions performed for
      cultural reasons. Instead, this cost-utility analysis is
      aimed at the financial and medical aspects of neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      companies take cultural factors into account when marketing
      their health plans. This justification has been given by
      members of the insurance industry for providing neonatal
      circumcision benefits to their customers. It seems odd,
      however, that other body modifications, such as ear piercing
      and tattoos, are rarely covered by medical insurance plans.
      The medical community faces a different set of issues. Should
      medical care providers perform a procedure on a newborn
      knowing that it is more likely to impair health than improve
      it? Medical ethical standards, such as &ldquo;do no
      harm,&rdquo; appear not to condone such a practice.<sup><a
      href="#n165">165</a></sup> By performing circumcisions on
      infants, health care providers venture into the realm of
      being &ldquo;cultural brokers.&rdquo; The debate whether this
      is the proper venue for medical services has not taken place.
      The analysis is clear: Neonatal circumcision cannot be
      justified on economic or medical grounds. <span
      class="yellow">If the medical community is interested in
      preserving health and saving money, they should refrain from
      promoting, encouraging, or presenting neonatal circumcision
      as a medical option. Third-party payers may want to reassess
      their current reimbursement policies and possibly consider
      paying physicians or parents not to perform neonatal
      circumcisions.</span> Either of these options would result in
      an overall cost savings.</p>
