          <h2>A study of clinical opinion and practice regarding
          circumcision</h2>

          <p><b>Z Farshi, K R Atkinson, R Squire</b></p>

          <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

          <p class="text1"><b><i>Aim</i> To establish clinical
          opinion regarding appropriate indications for
          circumcision and to examine actual clinical
          practice.</b></p>

          <p class="text1"><b><i>Methods</i> A questionnaire was
          sent to all NHS hospital consultants in the Yorkshire
          region of the UK identified as having a role to play in
          the management of boys (under 16 years of age) requiring
          circumcision. Retrospective data on actual clinical
          practice during a three month study period were also
          collected via a simple proforma.</b></p>

          <p class="text1"><b><i>Results</i> Of 153 questionnaires
          sent, 64 were returned. Responses revealed varying
          opinions regarding appropriate indications for
          circumcision within each consultant group, and between
          paediatricians and surgeons. Surgeons were generally more
          inclined to recommend circumcision for each of the
          indications listed in the questionnaire. Analysis of
          clinical practice revealed that almost two thirds of
          procedures were carried out for phimosis, and nearly half
          of these children were under the age of 5 years.</b></p>

          <p class="text1"><b><i>Conclusion</i> There are
          differences in the clinical opinions of surgeons and
          paediatricians on what constitutes an appropriate
          indication for circumcision. Paediatricians' opinions are
          generally more in line with current evidence than those
          of surgeons, possibly resulting in many unnecessary
          circumcisions.</b><br />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="text1">A number of clinical reports published
          in British journals recommend that circumcision is
          indicated for established clinical reasons only and that
          these are present in only a small percentage of
          boys.<sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> However, there is
          evidence to suggest that the incidence of circumcision in
          the UK is higher than would be expected given these
          recommendations.<sup><a href="#n5">5-9</a></sup> It is
          estimated that a total of 30 000 circumcisions are
          carried out in England each year. Department of Health
          statistics for 1995/96 reveal that 62% of these are
          performed on boys under the age of 15, with the Yorkshire
          region ranking sixth highest in terms of the number
          carried out on boys of this age.<sup><a href="#n7">7
          8</a></sup> We aimed to establish clinical opinion on
          appropriate indications for circumcision and examine
          actual clinical practice in the Yorkshire region.</p>

          <p><b>Patients and methods</b><br />
          </p>

          <p class="text1">To establish clinical opinion on
          appropriate indications for circumcision, we designed a
          questionnaire based on a list of indications for surgery,
          highlighted in a review of circumcision in
          childhood.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Table 1 lists
          these indications. We added pain as a presenting symptom
          because we believe that children are commonly referred
          for this reason. However, very little has been written
          about pain as an indication for circumcision.</p>

          <p><img src="Table1.gif" alt="Table 1" /><br />
           <i>Table 1 Opinions regarding appropriate indications
          for circumcision</i></p>

          <p class="text2">We sent questionnaires to all NHS
          hospital consultants in the Yorkshire region whom we
          identified as having a potential role in the management
          of boys requiring circumcision. These were paediatric
          surgeons and paediatricians, as well as general surgeons
          and urologists from those hospitals where there was no
          paediatric surgical service. We asked respondents to
          indicate whether they would "always", "sometimes",
          "rarely", or "never" consider circumcision for each of
          the indications listed in the questionnaire, or whether
          they were "unsure".</p>

          <p class="text2">To examine actual clinical practice, we
          designed a proforma to obtain information about the age
          of patients undergoing circumcision and the documented
          indication for surgery. We sent a letter to surgeons
          working in all 14 NHS hospitals in the Yorkshire region,
          stating the purpose of the study and requesting
          permission to include their patients. Copies of the
          proforma were sent to the clinical audit department at
          each hospital where surgeons had agreed to participate.
          Details of patients undergoing circumcision were
          extracted from the central information system held at
          each hospital. Patient details were obtained from
          hospital case notes and recorded on the proforma.</p>

          <p class="text2">Completed proformas from each hospital
          were returned to the lead investigator. Individual
          surgeons were allocated a personal identification code so
          they could compare their practice with that of others.
          This process ensured a high level of confidentiality
          throughout the study.</p>

          <p><b>Results</b></p>

          <p class="text1">We sent 153 questionnaires to 78
          surgeons and 75 paediatricians. Sixty four questionnaires
          were returned, 39 from surgeons (response rate 50%) and
          25 from paediatricians (response rate 33%).</p>

          <p class="text2">Comparison of the responses, as
          presented in table 1, reveals that the opinions of
          surgeons and paediatricians vary, with surgeons generally
          more inclined to recommend circumcision, most apparent
          for balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), though this may
          be because some paediatricians are less familiar with
          this diagnosis. However, surgeons also showed more
          inclination to circumcise boys for more controversial
          indications such as non-retractile foreskins, pain,
          ballooning, and balanoposthitis. Figure 1 illustrates
          combined responses of "always" and "sometimes" from
          paediatricians and surgeons, further highlighting the
          variation in opinion between the two consultant
          groups.</p>

           <i>Figure 1 Indications for surgery: percentage combined
          responses of "always" and "sometimes" from paediatricians
          and surgeons.</i></p>

          <p class="text2">We observed this variation of opinion
          within each consultant group for most indications, the
          widest variations being with regard to ballooning during
          micturition, and urinary tract infections.</p>

          <p class="text2">Eleven of the 14 hospitals invited to
          participate in the clinical study returned data,
          reporting 160 boys having undergone circumcision during
          the three month data collection period. A total of 137
          boys underwent circumcision for medical reasons (the
          remaining 23 were carried out for religious reasons).
          Table 2 lists the medical indications for circumcision,
          classified by age groups. Overall 64% of circumcisions
          were carried out for "phimosis" and nearly half of these
          children were under 5 years of age, when pathological
          tightness of the foreskin almost never occurs.</p>

          <p class="text1"><b>Discussion</b><br />
           There have been few studies of this nature carried out,
          and we consider that our study raises important issues
          regarding current clinical practice. Approximately 6% of
          boys undergo medical circumcision in England, yet
          evidence from the available literature implies that
          medical indications actually occur in fewer than
          2%.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Our findings provide
          further evidence to support this discrepancy.</p>

          <p class="text2">The findings from the questionnaire
          highlight differences of opinions between paediatricians
          and surgeons, and we are concerned that surgeons seem
          more inclined to recommend circumcision for
          non-retractability than their paediatric colleagues. We
          believe that in many situations evidence supports a
          non-operative approach. It was reported in 1949 that the
          normal foreskin is seldom retractable at birth, and 6% of
          normal boys aged 5 or over still cannot retract the
          foreskin.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> This was
          supported by data suggesting that most boys who have a
          non-retractable foreskin at the age of 5 will have a
          normally retractable prepuce at puberty, with only 1%
          having a pathological problem.<sup><a
          href="#n11">11</a></sup> As a result of these studies it
          is widely accepted among paediatric surgeons that unless
          there is a pathological process such as BXO, the foreskin
          should become retractable without the need for
          intervention. BXO is thought to occur in approximately 1%
          of boys, is extremely rare under the age of 5, and most
          commonly occurs as a secondary event to a prepuce that
          has previously been retracted.<sup><a
          href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">We identified 41 children under the age
          of 5, circumcised for "phimosis". Phimosis is a term
          taken from a Greek word meaning "muzzled", but it is not
          clear whether this should include physiological
          non-retractibility of the prepuce, or just refer to
          pathological conditions. Because of this lack of clarity
          we did not use it in our questionnaire. However, we found
          it to be the most common term used as an indication for
          surgery in clinical practice. While it is extremely
          unlikely that the children under 5 years of age had
          pathological phimosis, some of the 47 children aged over
          5 years who underwent circumcision for phimosis may have
          had BXO. It is interesting that the majority (74%) of
          surgeons appear to recognise BXO as an important
          condition, yet half of the paediatricians were unsure of
          its significance.</p>

          <p class="text2">We note that 49% of surgeons and 36% of
          paediatricians considered ballooning of the foreskin an
          indication for surgery. There is no evidence that
          ballooning is a pathological event occurring commonly in
          healthy but incompletely retractable foreskins, and
          generally does not occur when there is a pathological
          process such as BXO.<sup><a href="#n2">2 12</a></sup> We
          believe it is relevant that these issues are not fully
          covered in standard paediatric and surgical
          textbooks.</p>

          <p class="text2">We asked how the association of pain
          with non-retractability influences the clinical approach.
          In this context, pain may refer to soreness of the
          prepuce, possibly because of chemical irritation caused
          by contact with urine, or discomfort when trying to
          retract a "tight" foreskin. Not surprisingly pain biases
          both consultant groups towards circumcision, with
          surgeons more inclined towards a surgical solution than
          the paediatricians. We are not aware of any published
          data that include pain when assessing the indication for
          surgery, yet it must be one of the most common preputial
          problems that leads to children seeing their general
          practitioner, and then being referred to a
          specialist.</p>

          <p class="text2">The evidence regarding balanitis is less
          clear. While 3-4% of boys have one episode of
          balanoposthitis, less than half (probably 1% of boys
          overall) have recurrent episodes.<sup><a
          href="#n1">1</a></sup> In our study paediatricians and
          surgeons largely agreed that to carry out a circumcision
          following a single infection is unwarranted. Alternative
          options are available for recurrent balanitis, but
          surgery remains an option.</p>

          <p class="text2">The role of circumcision in preventing
          urinary tract infection is controversial, but current
          data would suggest that while neonatal circumcision
          reduces the incidence of infection in childhood, the risk
          of renal damage is not reduced.<sup><a href="#n13">13
          14</a></sup> Urinary infection may provide a theoretical
          indication for circumcision, particularly in the presence
          of an abnormal urinary tract which has been complicated
          by recurrent infections. However, there is no published
          evidence to support this approach and routine
          circumcision to prevent urinary tract infection is not
          recommended.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> The
          variation in opinions which we found may reflect the
          level of uncertainty in this area.</p>

          <p class="text2">There is no published evidence to
          support carrying out circumcisions on boys following an
          episode of paraphimosis, or to prevent subsequent cancer.
          Our study identified some clinicians who might disagree
          with this statement, but it is worth mentioning that
          paraphimosis is rare in children, and the clinical study
          did not identify any children in whom this indication was
          recorded.</p>

          <p class="text2">We aimed to build a picture encompassing
          the opinions and practice of specialists in a single
          region of England. Difficulties encountered in getting
          complete data are inevitable in this context. The overall
          response to the questionnaire was disappointing. The
          results were anonymised, so it is not possible to
          ascertain if the 33% of paediatricians, or the 50% of
          surgeons who replied were a representative sample, or
          even if the surgeons included were the same as those
          actually carrying out the circumcisions in the clinical
          study. No attempt was made to verify the diagnoses that
          were quoted as an indication for circumcision, and as the
          majority was carried out for "phimosis" some of the data
          should be interpreted with caution. Despite these
          reservations we believe that the data reflect current
          attitudes of consultants to foreskin problems.</p>

          <p class="text2">Because of a lack of available data we
          were unable to calculate the incidence of circumcision
          within the participating hospitals. Using Department of
          Health episode statistics we have ranked 14 regions of
          England in terms of the number of circumcisions performed
          on boys. Yorkshire region ranks sixth highest, carrying
          out 8% of these circumcisions nationally. Recent
          published evidence recommends that circumcisions should
          be carried out for established clinical reasons only; on
          that basis we suggest that up to 88 (64%) circumcisions
          carried out for phimosis in the three month study period
          may have been unnecessary.<sup><a
          href="#n17">17</a></sup> If our data reflect the national
          picture, then movement towards more evidence based
          practice would result in a significant reduction in
          workload, cost and most importantly, unnecessary
          operations. Circumcisions are not always uncomplicated
          and there is increasing public concern that unwarranted
          male circumcision constitutes a form of abuse.<sup><a
          href="#n16">16 17</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">We have shown a widespread discrepancy
          between the opinions of the two consultant groups
          studied. In some areas this may be because the evidence
          is poor, so that there are grounds for controversy.
          However, it is likely that lack of knowledge of existing
          evidence has a major impact in this field. Paediatricians
          may perceive this to be a surgical problem and thus not
          their responsibility. Yet much of the data are in the
          paediatric domain, reflected in this study by the fact
          that paediatricians' opinions are more in line with
          current evidence. Perhaps paediatricians should bear some
          responsibility (where possible) for ensuring that
          children managed by surgical colleagues receive
          appropriate treatment.</p>
