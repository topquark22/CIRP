      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1"><b><small>One hundred male infants were
        studied at the Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, Ontario
        to determine the incidence and complications of routine
        circumcision. The parents were also interviewed concerning
        the cause of the operation.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these 100 infants,
        complications, usually minor, were very common, and
        included hemorrhage (35), meatal ulcers (31), infection
        (eight), phimosis (one) and meatal stenosis.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons given for
        operation were prophylactic - to avoid the psychological
        trauma of later operations for infection, phimosis and
        "troubles" (40), cleanliness (11) and phimosis (four). The
        remaining cases were for social and other non-medical
        reasons. Attitudes of parents and physicians regarding
        circumcision varied from firm belief in its value to a
        casual approach. One half of the babies had partial
        circumcisions, confirming previous suspicions that
        non-Jewish males frequently had partial operations. Partial
        operations do not always guarantees cleanliness and
        probably do not eliminate the risk of penile carcinoma in
        all cases, if smegma is carcinogenic. Routine circumcision
        spare a few children psychologically traumatic operations
        at a later date and relieve parents of anxiety about the
        future of the uncircumcised child. This should be balanced
        against the complications, which, although usually minor,
        may occasionally be serious.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1961 and
        1962, at the Kingston General Hospital, 349 (48%) of 727
        male infants were routinely circumcised.</small></b></p>

      <p><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note - This study from 1966 is
      much cited and is of interest to researchers. Smegma is (in
      1996) proven not to be carcinogenic. Penile cancer and

      <p class="text1"><span class="init"><b>A</b></span> GREAT
      deal of controversy surrounds the subject of routine
      circumcision. Some have described the operation as a
      "well-secured life annuity" while others regard it as
      "shocking brutality." The indications for doing it are
      generally ill defined, the benefits are often difficult to
      demonstrate, the complications may be significant, yet the
      operation is frequently performed and is usually regarded as
      a minor procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision was discussed at length in 1949
      by Gairdner<a href="#n1"><sup>1</sup></a> in a classic paper
      entitled "The Fate of the Foreskin." The whole subject was
      reviewed again in 1951 by Hovsepian,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> later in 1953 by Speert<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and more recently by Weiss.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Other papers have dealt with
      particular aspects of the operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present communication describes the
      experience relative to circumcision in newborn babies in the
      Kingston General Hospital with particular reference to the
      incidence of complications of the operation and the reasons
      why it was performed.</p>

      <p class="text2">M<span class="sc1">ATERIAL</span> <span
      class="sc1">AND</span> M<span class="sc1">ETHOD</span> <span
      class="sc1">OF</span> I<span
      class="sc1">NVESTIGATION</span></p>

      <p class="text2">The records of all male babies born in the
      Kingston General Hospital between December 1961 and November
      1962 were reviewed in June 1963. One hundred consecutive male
      babies born in the latter half of this period, were chosen
      for further study because their parents were residing in
      Kingston and the immediate area. In each case the mother was
      interviewed in her home for 20 to 30 minutes. Both parents
      were seen whenever possible. The child was examined and the
      degree of circumcision was assessed by noting how much of the
      glans was covered by foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">R<span class="sc1">ESULTS</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Incidence</i></p>

      <p class="text2">In the Kingston General Hospital, between
      December 1, 1961 and November 30, 1962 circumcision was
      performed on 349 newborn babies, approximately 48% of all
      male babies born in this period. In 1952 this procedure was
      carried out on 50% of all male newborns, hence, the incidence
      over the 10-year period had not changed.</p>

      <p class="text2">M<span class="sc1">ETHOD</span> <span
      class="sc1">OF</span> O<span class="sc1">PERATION</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Except for three ritual circumcisions, all
      of the 349 operations were performed by 40 doctors, six of
      whom were pediatricians; one was as obstetrician and the
      remainder were general practitioners and hospital
      residents.</p>

      <p class="text2">The operations were performed either with
      the Gomco clamp described by Manson<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> or the "Plastibell" used by Karther
      and Smith.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The Gomco clamp is a
      metal cone which fits over the glans and lies between it and
      the prepuce. The distal foreskin is then removed. The
      Plastibell consists of a plastic cone which fits over the
      glans. The foreskin is stretched over this and a ligature is
      applied at the base. The distal foreskin is excised. The base
      of the Plastibell is left in situ; the rest of the cone is
      removed. This base falls off in a few days.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the 100 infants selected for special
      study, 51 circumcisions were performed with the clamp and 47
      with the Plastibell. Two operations were ritual procedures.
      In 25 of the 100 operations, the doctor performed the
      operation with full sterile precautions, using gloves. Most
      of the operations were performed when the child was 3 to 5
      days old, while was in the newborn nursery. One doctor
      circumcised 10 babies at birth.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Degree of Circumcision</i></p>

      <p class="text2">At follow-up examination wide variation was
      noted in the degree of circumcision in terms of the length of
      foreskin that remained after the operations. The degree of
      circumcision, depending on the length of foreskin covering
      the glans and exposure of the coronal sulcus, has been
      divided into four types (A, B, C and D) by Wynder and
      Licklider<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> and into three grades
      (circumcised, partially circumcised, uncircumcised) by Dunn
      and Buell.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the present series, 50 children had
      almost complete removal of the foreskin (circumcised, type D)
      whereas the glans was almost completely covered by foreskin
      (type A, uncircumcised) in four cases. In the remaining 46
      cases the glans was partially covered by the prepuce (types B
      and C, partially circumcised). The two ritual circumcisions
      showed the most complete removal of foreskin. In Table I the
      degree of circumcision is related to the method of operation.
      There was no significant difference in the amount of foreskin
      removed by the two methods of operation.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Complications of Circumcision</i></p>

      <p class="text2">The following data on complications include
      those complications that occurred in hospital and those that
      occurred after the infant's return to the home.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(a) Bleeding</i></p>

      <p class="text2">In 35 infants there was some postoperative
      bleeding (Table II). Slight bleeding, consisting mainly of
      oozing, occurred in 31 and in three of these bleeding
      occurred on the fifth to seventh postoperative day when the
      plastic ring fell off. In four there was moderate bleeding,
      sutures being necessary in one of them. Bleeding was more
      frequent following operations with the Gomco clamp. in no
      case was bleeding so severe as to require a blood
      transfusion.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(b) Infection</i></p>

      <p class="text2">In eight of the cases, infection occurred at
      the circumcisional site. The infection was mild in most cases
      but one child had severe infection and was given antibiotics.
      In one case the infection was followed by fibrosis and
      phimosis. Seven of the eight infections developed after the
      child was discharged to the home.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(c) Meatal Ulcers</i></p>

      <p class="text2">Meatal Ulcers were present at one time or
      another in 31 of the 100 babies, some children had recurrent
      ulceration. In most cases the ulceration was mild, but in one
      case it was severe and caused much discomfort to the child.
      No meatal ulcers were reported in the four babies in whom the
      foreskin covered the glans.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(d) Meatal Stenosis</i></p>

      <p class="text2">Eight of the 100 babies had a pin-hole
      meatal orifice. Freud<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> considers
      the meatal orifice to be abnormally small if the
      anteroposterior diameter is 3 mm. or less. Meatal stenosis
      was found to be commonly associated with meatal ulceration;
      half the cases of meatal stenosis occured in the 31 children
      with meatal ulceration. The association between these two
      lesions was noted in the younger babies (9 to 12 months) and
      in the older children (13 and 14 months) in this series.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(e) Phimosis</i></p>

      <p class="text2">Phimosis occurred in one child who had very
      little foreskin removed at operation. He developed infection
      at the circumcisional site which healed by norosis giving
      rise to the acquired form of phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this series the complications were severe
      infection, meatal ulceration, acquired phimosis requiring a
      second circumcision, and meatal stenosis. No deaths have been
      reported at the Kingston General Hospital in association with
      this procedure in the last 10 years. During this time, 6753
      circumcisions were performed on newborn babies and 589
      circumcisions were carried out on older children.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Reasons for circumcision</i></p>

      <p class="text2">Various reasons were offered for
      circumcising the baby. (Table III). Forty babies were
      circumcised to avoid a later operation, while for 10 cases
      the procedure was performed "for cleanliness." In seven
      instances the parents thought it was desirable to "match"
      (i.e., all boys should be circumcised) the child with
      siblings and with the condition of their friends and
      relatives.</p>

      <p class="text2">Relatives were responsible for advising the
      operation in eight cases while in a further two children the
      mother was guided by the advice of women's magazines. Four
      mothers thought the operation was "done automatically" and in
      a further four cases the doctor advised the operation for a
      "tight skin." Prevention of masturbation or "rupture" was
      given as the reason for four operations. There were two
      ritual procedures.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other reasons included the following: it was
      necessary for fertility; it was a requirement for admission
      to the armed forces; "it looks better"; "it is a good and
      proper thing to do"; it was a routine procedure in the
      parents' country of origin; the woman's magazines informed
      the reader that carcinoma of the cervix was rare in the wives
      of circumcised men; it prevented excessive crying; it
      prevented urinary obstruction in old age; and it avoided
      difficulty with micturition in childhood.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Decisions and Attitudes to
      Circumcision</i></p>

      <p class="text2"><i>The role of the mother.</i> In 74 cases
      the mother made the decision for operation. Mothers
      frequently had very firm views on the the subject; in 33
      cases they would have insisted on the operation. Twenty-six
      mothers had not discussed the subject with their husbands,
      complaining that the latter were indifferent or insisting
      that it was a woman's business. They frequently discussed the
      subject with friends relatives and neighbours and sought
      information from baby books and women's magazines.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two of the mothers were trained nurses who
      had witnessed adult circumcisions, while a third mother was
      taught at the nurses' training school that the operation
      should be done routinely.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mothers seemed uncertain about their ability
      to teach cleanliness to the child and were doubtful of his
      cooperation. The mother who had not for some reason, had an
      older sibling circumcised, seemed anxious about the future of
      that child. She wanted to be reassured that he would not
      develop a rupture in childhood, masturbate later, become
      infertile in adulthood, or develop urinary obstruction in his
      old age.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>The role of the father.</i> Fifteen
      fathers made the decision for circumcision. Six of them were
      in some way connected with the army. Most of the fathers had
      witnessed adult circumcisions or had undergone the operation
      themselves as adults. In some cases the mother had been
      warned not to bring the boy home uncircumcised. In general,
      however, the role of the fathers was indifferent.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>The role of the doctor.</i> In 11
      instances the doctor was responsible for the decision.
      Parents discussed the subject with their doctor in 84 cases.
      In a few instances the doctor disagreed with the parent, but
      generally he tended to go along with the parents decision;
      three doctors were firmly opposed to the operation. The
      doctors clearly influenced the incidence of circumcision,
      since those who opposed the operation circumcised 20% of
      their patients, those who favoured the procedure operated on
      100% of their patients, and the doctors who thought that the
      decision was best left to the parents operated on 50% of
      their newborn patients.</p>

      <p class="sc2">D<span class="sc1">ISCUSSION</span></p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of circumcision varies with
      different countries, year of birth, racial groups, social
      levels, and religious groups.</p>

      <p class="text2">The operation is rarely performed in most
      European countries, China, and some other Far Eastern
      countries. It is very popular in the United States, where
      according to the medical literature the incidence varies from
      60% to 97%.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dunn and Buell<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      have shown that the present high incidence of circumcision in
      the United States is a recent phenomenon; they found that 8%
      of males born before 1870 were circumcised, compared with 56%
      for those born after 1910. The effect of year of birth on the
      incidence of circumcision was also demonstrated by Doll and
      Hadley<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> in Britain, who found
      that the incidence among merchant seamen was 19% for those
      born in 1914, whereas it was 22% and 30% for those born in
      1924 and 1930 respectively. There seems to be a reversal of
      this trend in Britain, since at the present time few babies
      are circumcised in that country.</p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of the operation also varies
      with racial groups. Schrek and Lenowitz<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> demonstrated that early circumcision
      is more frequently performed in Negroes than in white men;
      also that this high incidence was decreasing among Negroes,
      since fewer coloured veterans of World War II were
      circumcised than veterans of World War I.</p>

      <p class="text2">The operation tends to be more popular in
      the higher socioeconomic groups. Carne<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> in Britain, found that boys who
      attended grammar and public schools were far more likely to
      be circumcised than were those who attended private schools.
      Speert<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> reported that 74% of
      private patients were circumcised, compared with 57% of staff
      patients.</p>

      <p class="text2">The operation is common among Jews and
      Moslems for religious reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our series about 50% of newborn babies
      were circumcised; there has been no change in the incidence
      during the past decade. We also found that private patients
      were more likely to be circumcised than staff
      patients.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The incidence of
      circumcision was influenced by the doctors' attitude to the
      operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">An interesting finding in the present study
      was the variable degree of circumcision. Dunn and
      Buell<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> observed that Jewish
      males probably had a maximum degree of anatomically complete
      circumcision. This degree was observed in less than half of
      non-Jewish males who considered themselves circumcised. Fifty
      per cent of babies in our study had complete circumcisions,
      as compared with 48% of men studied by Dunn and Buell.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> A recent study<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> from Macedonia indicates that the
      operation tends to be more complete among Moslems in
      Macedonia, since 95.8% had complete circumcisions. The degree
      of circumcision may be some importance in relation to
      cleanliness and carcinoma of the penis. Wynder et al.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> found that 13 of 31 Moslems in
      Madras, most of whom had incomplete operations had slight
      smegma present on the glans. Some mothers in the present
      series expressed dissatisfaction with the operation,
      maintaining that they and their child had not been relieved
      of the "bother of cleanliness."</p>

      <p class="text2">Although experimental evidence has given
      conflicting results,<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> many
      authors<sup><a href="#n17">17-19</a></sup> believe from their
      direct clinical observations, that smegma is an irritant
      agent, responsible for carcinoma of the penis. Jewish males
      who generally have complete circumcisions have almost
      complete immunity to this neoplasm; two cases of carcinoma of
      the penis in circumcised Jews have been reported in the
      literature. In the United States, Wolbarst<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> was unable to find a case of
      carcinoma of the penis among 1103 Jewish men with neoplastic
      disease and similar findings have been observed in Israel. In
      contrast to Jewish males, Moslems not infrequently have
      incomplete circumcisions<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> and
      they appear to be less protected from this disease. They do,
      however, have a lower incidence of this disease than the
      uncircumcised Hindu neighbour. Wolbarst,<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> reporting on 1336 cases of carcinoma
      of the penis from Indian hospitals, found that 26 patients
      were Moslems whereas 1303 were Hindus, despite the fact that
      the average Moslem population in these hospitals was 21%.
      Similar observations were also noted by Kennaway.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> Degree of circumcision may not be
      the only factor responsible for these variations. The age at
      which circumcision is performed may be another factor
      responsible for the difference in the incidence of this
      neoplasm between Moslems and Jews; the former circumcise
      their children between 4 and 9 years, the latter on the eight
      day of life.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Update: We now know that the major risk
      factors for penile cancer are human papillomavirus infection
      and the use of tobacco in any form. Smegma is not
      carcinogenic.]</p>

      <p class="text2">Complications of circumcision have occurred
      in almost all reported series but their incidence varies
      widely, partly because the different series have not been
      strictly comparable. Gairdner reported excessive hemorrhage
      in 3.8% of cases, whereas Moeller and Moss<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> found not cases of severe hemorrhage
      in 2400 circumcisions performed immediately after delivery.
      Kariher and Smith<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> found no
      bleeding in 600 babies operated on with Plastibell
      immediately after birth, yet Hovsepian,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> also operating at the same time in
      most of his 1878 cases, reported bleeding in 15% of cases.
      One child required sutures to control the hemorrhage; none
      needed a transfusion.</p>

      <p class="text2">Postoperative infection occurred in 8% of
      our cases. Seven of these children developed the infection
      after discharge from the hospital. This may account for the
      discrepancy between our figures and those reported by other
      authors; Hovsepian<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> and also
      Moeller and Moss<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> reported no
      cases of infection in their series, while MacCarthy, Douglas
      and Mogford <sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> found nine cases
      of infection in 443 operations.</p>

      <p class="text2">There was one child with postoperative
      phimosis in this study compared with seven out of 443
      children reported by MacCarthy, Douglas and Mogford.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> Most authors regard meatal
      ulceration as a complication of circumcision. The lesion was
      surprisingly common, being present at one time or another in
      about one-third of the babies in this series.</p>

      <p class="text2">Eight babies in the present series had
      meatal stenosis, the lesion being somewhat more common in the
      older than the younger babies. Berry and Cross<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> found that severe meatal stenosis
      occurred more frequently in circumcised boys age 12 to 18
      months than in uncircumcised boys in the same age group, the
      incidence being 10% and 3%, respectively.
      Innes-Williams<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> and Berry and
      Cross regard the stenosis as secondary to the ulceration,
      whereas Campbell<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> and
      Freud<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> consider that meatal
      stenosis is the chief factor predisposing to meatal
      ulceration and a meatotomy may cure the ulceration.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the present series, 55% of the children
      had some type of complications, varying from slight oozing of
      blood to phimosis needing recircumcision. This incidence of
      complications is considerably higher than reported by others.
      It may be due to the age at which the operation was performed
      (third to fifth day after delivery), the inclusion of all
      degrees of hemorrhage and all complications which occurred
      after the baby was discharged to the home, and the collection
      of data by personal interview rather than a mailed
      questionaire, telephone inquiry or outpatient records.</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to comparatively minor
      complications occurring in this series, other authors have
      reported more serious sequalae, such as urethral fistula,
      amputation of the penis, gangrene of the penis, avulsion of
      the scrotum, removal of material best suited for plastic
      repair of hypospadias, septicemia and death. Speert<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> reported that approximately 566,483
      babies had been circumcised in New York between 1939 and
      1951, with one death. In Britain, Gairdner<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> found 16 deaths attributable to
      circumcision among 90,000 children under the age of 5 years.
      The deaths were mainly due to anesthesia, hemorrhage and
      infection, while a few were unexplained.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since the operation is not free of risk, it
      is understandable that the question arises why it is
      performed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Forty operations were requested to avoid the
      need for later circumcision which parents considered was
      painful, psychologically traumatic and in older children and
      adults embarrassing. Some of the prophylactic operations were
      supposedly performed to preclude infection and phimosis, but
      a large number were done to forestall vague, unspecified
      future "troubles."</p>

      <p class="text2">True phimosis is a relatively rare
      condition, and paraphimosis is generally due to premature
      forceful retraction of the foreskin by the mother.
      Gairdner<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> found that normally
      the foreskin was retractable in only 4% of newborns, but that
      by the age of 4 years 90% of boys had a fully retractable
      foreskin. There is no way of knowing in the newborn period
      who will need the operation later for true phimosis. Since
      true phimosis is rare and its early recognition virtually
      impossible, opponents of the routine use of this operation
      maintain that there is no justification for using this as a
      reason for operating on a large number of children who
      normally would not require this operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Cleanliness is frequently considered as an
      argument for routine circumcision. This has featured
      prominently in this study, as in other series. The following
      comment by Pugh,<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> after he had
      interrogated 1000 men regarding instructions in penile
      hygiene, is worthy of note: "The answers indicated that this
      was largely omitted from instructions regarding personal
      hygiene, one of the effects of taboo, down through the
      centuries, so that circumcision came to be recommended to
      overcome the ill consequences of precepts that certain parts
      must not be discussed."</p>

      <p class="text2">The mothers of some patients in the present
      series thought that the operation would make it easier to
      maintain cleanliness but the majority of the believed that it
      would relieve them and the child of the "bother of
      cleanliness." It is evident that the operation as currently
      performed will hardly guarantee this. If circumcision is to
      provide cleanliness and not merely facilitate it, the
      operation should be complete. It is generally the lower
      social economic group who are notoriously reluctant to
      practise cleanliness, and Elliot<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> has therefore suggested that an
      early and complete circumcision is best applied at this level
      where continued hygiene is unlikely to be obtained
      otherwise.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some parents considered that there must be
      conformity among boys and thus had the baby circumcised so
      that he would "match" with his siblings and other boys.</p>

      <p class="text2">It was of interest that one boy was
      circumcised because of the low incidence of carcinoma of the
      cervix uteri in the partners of circumcised men. Medically
      the strongest argument for circumcision is the reduction in
      the incidence of carcinoma of the cervix uteri and carcinoma
      of the penis. Both of these neoplasms generally occur more
      frequently in the lower socioeconomic groups with poor penile
      hygiene. An earlier study by Wynder et al.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> and a more recent investigation
      reported by Terris and Oalmann<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> suggested a relationship between
      carcinoma of the cervix and circumcision. Other
      studies,<sup><a href="#n8">8,28,28</a></sup> however, have
      not as yet confirmed that there is a direct relationship
      between circumcision and carcinoma of the cervix uteri. In a
      study of neoplastic diseases in Bombay,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> carcinoma of the cervix uteri was
      more frequently found in Moslem than in Parsee women, yet the
      latter have uncircumcised partners. It is known that Parsees
      are fastidious about personal hygiene. The role of
      circumcision and cleanliness in relation to carcinoma of the
      penis was carefully studied by Schrek and Lenowitz,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> who concluded that this neoplasm
      could be prevented by early circumcision or good penile
      hygiene.</p>

      <p class="text2">The many other reasons that parents offered
      for having the operation scarcely reflect a proper medical
      need. Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the present
      study was the variety of attitudes to circumcision adopted by
      both parents and physicians. A few doctors were opposed to
      the operation, but in general the attitude varied from firm
      belief in the necessity for the operation to a completely
      casual approach. This agrees with recent findings of Shaw and
      Robertson,<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> who circulated a
      questionnaire on reasons for circumcision to physicians and
      parents and concluded that their survey "casts reasonable
      doubt on the belief that the decision - 'pro' or 'con' - is
      reached in any scientific manner." These authors also found ,
      as we have, that the majority of parents had never discussed
      the matter with their physicians and that their decisions
      were influenced more by social and cultural factors, often
      without foundation, than by medical advice. This situation is
      understandable, perhaps, in view of the lack of objective
      information about circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">It seems that the routine removal of the
      foreskin in all newborn babies may spare a few children the
      possible psychological trauma of a late operation. It will
      also relieve a large number of parents of their anxiety,
      concerning not only cleanliness but a host of other
      conditions which they believe will apparently befall the
      uncircumcised boy. <span class="yellow">This has to be
      balanced against the complications of circumcision which are
      generally relatively minor but on rare occasions may be
      unpleasant and serious.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">It is obvious from this study that there is
      a need for guidance of anxious, confused and misinformed
      parents. Information on most aspects of infant care and
      feeding is readily obtainable, yet little information is
      available on circumcision - an observation noted by some
      mothers.</p>

      <p class="text2">S<span class="sc1">UMMARY</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Experience of circumcision in a general
      hospital has been reviewed. One hundred circumcised children
      were followed up and examined, and one or both parents were
      interviewed.</p>

      <p class="text2">It was found that about 50% of all male
      babies born in the hospital were circumcised in the newborn
      period. The operation was performed by the Gomco clamp or the
      Plastibell technique, usually on the third to fifth day of
      life.</p>

      <p class="text2">There was a wide variation in the amount of
      foreskin removed. After operation the foreskin partially or
      completely covered the glans in 50 cases.</p>

      <p class="text2">A number of postoperative complications were
      encountered, including hemorrhage (35), infection (eight),
      meatal ulceration (31), phimosis (one) and meatal stenosis
      (eight). Most of the complications were minor.</p>

      <p class="text2">Enquiry into the reasons for circumcision
      indicated that the operation was frequently performed to
      prevent the need for a later circumcision or for cleanliness.
      A large number of operations were carried out for reasons not
      based on medical facts.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some physicians opposed the operation but in
      general the attitude of the physician and the parent varied
      from firm belief in the value of circumcision to a casual or
      indifferent approach.</p>

      <p class="text2">The study revealed the need for guidance of
      confused or anxious parents.</p>

      <p class="text3">I wish to thank Dr. M. W. Pattington for his
      constant advice and encouragement, also Drs. Alex. Bryans and
      D. Delahaye for their assistance. My appreciation is due to
      all the doctors who permitted me to study their patients and
      to all the patients who kindly co-operated in this study.</p>
