      <h2>The joy of uncircumcising</h2>

      <p class="text1">Now therefore why do you make trial of God
      by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which
      neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?" With
      these words St Peter, himself a circumcised Jew, won the
      argument against compulsory circumcision of Gentile converts
      to Christianity nearly 2000 years ago. Clearly he knew that
      that there was a penalty to be paid for being circumcised.
      This fact seems to have been forgotten by the medical
      profession during the past 100 years, when circumcision has
      been widely practised on children as treatment and sometimes
      as prophylaxis for phimosis. It has even been used as a
      treatment for masturbation, once considered a dangerous
      disease. When you look up circumcision in modern surgical
      textbooks you find the anatomy of the foreskin well described
      but no mention of its function. You find the indications for
      circumcision and how to carry it out, but no mention of the
      consequences.</p>

      <p class="text2">Like many boys of my generation in Britain,
      I was circumcised in infancy by a doctor. I grew up knowing
      that something had been removed from my penis as my older
      brother was intact, but I was told that this did not matter.
      The glans was always uncomfortable when rubbed by clothing
      throughout childhood and on into adult life, so that I always
      looked for tight supportive underwear to minimise friction.
      The discomfort was poorly localised, and it is only recently
      that I have realised that my intolerance of boxer shorts was
      the direct result of circumcision.</p>

      <p>* "It is time that doctors and medical students were
      taught that the foreskin has functions."</p>

      <p class="text2">The shaft skin was tight during erection,
      though I never thought of this as abnormal as I had nothing
      to compare with. Masturbation was often accompanied by
      laceration of the skin, so that I learnt to masturbate
      wearing a condom. I married 25 years ago and at first there
      were problems of dyspareunia from time to time which we
      attributed to vaginal dryness, as I considered myself normal.
      We overcame this by use of artificial lubricants. As time
      went on we explored ways of maximising our sexual enjoyment.
      I observed that there was remarkably little sensitivity in
      the glans, the skin of which seemed to thicken with advancing
      years. I remarked on this to my wife, who thought it strange.
      It was when I observed that the most sensitive part of my
      penis was the skin between the circumcision scar and the
      glans, that I began to realise for the first time how much I
      had been harmed by circumcision. This skin was the remnant of
      the inner lining of the foreskin, the remainder of which had
      of course been amputated. I assumed that there was nothing
      whatever to be done about this tragedy and I resolved to make
      the most of what was left.</p>

      <p class="text2">A few months ago I saw an article in a
      newspaper about foreskin restoration without surgery, using
      the method described by Jim Bigelow in <i>The Joy of
      Uncircumcising. Restore Your Birthright and Maximise Sexual
      Pleasure</i> (published by Hourglass Book Publishing, 1992).
      I started stretching the penile skin with surgical tape and
      weights, and sent for the book. The first few days were
      difficult and often uncomfortable, as I had little guidance
      from the newspaper article on how to apply the tape without
      discomfort. I persevered and every time something was painful
      I changed it until it was comfortable. As the first week went
      by it got easier, and by the end of one week I decided to
      continue my trial into the second week. Bigelow's book
      arrived from California on the Monday of the second week.
      This was most helpful.</p>

      <p class="text2">I carried on taping and at the end of the
      tenth day a most unexpected thing happened. I was moved to
      find that with my glans protected by skin held in place by
      tape I was more comfortable than I had ever been before in my
      life. All discomfort caused by contact with clothing had
      vanished; I no longer cared what sort of underwear I wore. In
      fact it was obvious that what I had been seeking all the time
      in the underwear department was a foreskin and now I had
      found it, and it was an incredible relief. It occurred to me
      that perhaps the human male's nervous system is wired in such
      a way that covering the glans causes release of a transmitter
      in some pleasure giving part of the brain, though I have no
      evidence for this. I knew that I would never go back to the
      barbaric practice of leaving the glans exposed. I had either
      to continue with the slow non-surgical method or submit to
      skin grafting. I decided to avoid surgery as I felt my penis
      had been cut enough already.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since then the benefits described by Bigelow
      have gradually unfolded. The glans became softer and steadily
      more sensitive, with great increase in sexual enjoyment.
      Furthermore after about ten weeks my wife and I both noticed
      that intercourse became much easier and almost frictionless,
      due to the expansion of the skin. The foreskin provides a
      reserve of skin so that on the natural penis there is plenty
      of slack and during intercourse the penile skin can cling to
      the vaginal wall while all movement occurs within the layers
      of the penis itself. When a man is tightly circumcised as I
      had been this is impossible, and all the movement occurs
      between the penis and the vagina. Undoubtedly this must often
      lead to complaints of vaginal dryness. I look forward to the
      day when I shall feel my foreskin slide over my glans during
      intercourse, and of course to the day when tape is no longer
      needed to keep the foreskin in place. I realise that a
      restored foreskin will never be quite the same as the natural
      one. How many nerve endings have been lost? The frenulum will
      not function to hold the foreskin in place. However it will
      be the best foreskin I can ever hope to have.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is clear to me that it is time that
      doctors and medical students were taught that the foreskin
      has functions. It is as important to the penis as the eyelid
      is to the eye. It maintains a soft, moist and sensitive
      glans, protecting it from abrasions. While the outer layer of
      the foreskin is composed of similar skin to that of the
      shaft, its inner layer is exquisitely sensitive. Finally it
      provides a reserve of skin essential for friction free
      intercourse. If doctors understood these functions they would
      be reluctant to amputate it and would develop conservative
      methods of managing phimosis, rather than multilating
      children for life.</p>
