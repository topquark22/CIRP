      <p><big><b>N</b></big>ot even the most vigorous opponent of
      routine circumcision in the male have proposed the
      restoration of the prepuce, once it has been removed.
      Attempts at uncircumcision have been made, nevertheless,
      since at least the second century before Christ, although not
      on hygienic or medical grounds. Uncircumcision has appeared
      as a result of social and political pressures on the Jews,
      the most widespread group practicing ritual circumcision.</p>

      <h3>The Hellenistic Period</h3>

      <p>The rapid spread of Greek culture and customs following
      the conquests of Alexander did not leave the Jewish nation in
      Palestine untouched. The Hellenized Jews adopted not only the
      Greek style of dress but also their methods of training the
      young and their interest in athletic games. Public nakedness
      became a commonplace throughout Judea; in Jerusalem itself
      baths and gymnasia were erected within sight of the Holy
      Temple, (to the horror of the followers of the law of Moses).
      The Hellenizers, in their desire to destroy all evidence of
      their barbarian origin (in the Greek sense of the word),
      tried to destroy the evidence of the Covenant of Abraham.
      Circumcision was not then standardized: the Oral tradition
      was ambitious, and frequently a large fragment of the prepuce
      was left behind. The Hellenizers pulled this fragment
      forward, manually, stretched it, and even applied blistering
      agents thereto, in order to make it cover the glans. Josephus
      says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><i>". . . they hid the circumcision of their genitals so
        that even when naked they might appear as Greeks."</i>
        <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I Maccabees 1:11, on which Josephus elaborated, merely
      says, "they made themselves uncircumcised." Dr. Solomon
      Zeitlin, the noted Jewish historian, in a comment on another
      such statement by Josephus says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"they hid the fact of circumcision by drawing forward
        the prepuce so that they resembled the Hellenes."</i>
        <sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The practice became widespread enough to be noted by the
      author of the apocryphal Book of Jubilees, in <i>15</i>:
      26-27:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"God's anger will be kindled against the children of the
        covenant if they make the members of their bodies appear
        like those of the Gentiles, and they will be expelled and
        exterminated from the earth."</i>
      </blockquote>

      <p>One of the causes given by the later Rabbis for the
      destruction of the Temple is the practice of
      uncircumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>" 'The hallowed flesh is passed from thee'--that is,
        they attempted to hide their circumcisions."</i> <sup><a
        href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Roman Period</h3>

      <p>Following the successful revolt of the Jews against
      Antiochus Epiphanes and the establishment of the Hasmonean
      Dynasty in 141 B.C., the practice of uncircumcision
      disappeared in Judea. The Romans, who soon became the
      overlords of the province, were initially as unconcerned with
      the Jewish religion as with that of any other subject people.
      They regarded circumcision as an interesting and amusing
      custom, less harmful than the self-castration of the Cybelean
      priests. Not quite three centuries later, however,
      circumcision was prohibited by the Emperor Hadrian, and
      uncircumcision again became practiced, this time, encouraged
      by the growing sect of Christians.</p>

      <p>The stiff-necked opposition of the Jews to the
      introduction of the Roman eagles and the altars to the
      God-Emperors in their holy places, their Messianic ideas, the
      repeated uprisings of the Zealots, all eventually culminated
      in the destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D. and the
      dispersion of the Jews. As in the Greek period, there was a
      strong tendency to assimilation on the part of the exiled
      Jews. They wanted to take advantage of the luxuries of Rome
      and they also wanted to avoid the payment of the onerous
      "Fiscus Judaicus," a tax levied against every Jewish male.
      Some devices were already at hand and others could be
      converted to hide the circumcised penis. Comic actors wore a
      special sheath over the penis even in the bath, "to protect
      the voice," it was believed; Jews began to use the same
      sheath. They also invented the "Pondus Judaeus," a bronze
      sheath worn so as to pull on the skin of the preputial
      fragment to make it recover the glans. <sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>The assimilationists were not the only group of Jews who
      found circumcision burdensome. The Apostle Peter (decried
      circumcision as "a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which
      neither our fathers nor we were able to bear." The insistence
      of some early Christians on "circumcision after the manner of
      Moses" (Acts 15:1) was a stumbling block to the conversion of
      the Gentiles. The persecution of the Jews who accepted Jesus
      as the Messiah by their more orthodox coreligionists led
      finally to the great schism, when the Christian Jews finally
      turned to the Gentile world for their proselytes. In the
      process, circumcision, as well as the distinction between
      clean and unclean foods, and then the rest of the Law went by
      the board. It is likely that some early Christians attempted
      to do away with the signs of the circumcision, as witness the
      Apostle Paul, in I Corinthinians 7: 18:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"Is any called being circumcised? Let him not be
        uncircumcised. Is any called being uncircumcised, let him
        not be circumcised."</i>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This passage has been sometimes construed as being purely
      allegorical, but the fact remains that the question of
      circumcision for converts concerned a physical process, not a
      spiritual one, as the history of the Early Church shows.
      <sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>Against both the assimilationists and the schismatics a
      reaction developed, especially after the loss of Jerusalem as
      the Holy City and the growth of the Rabbinic academies. The
      Tannaim, the Rabbis who first committed the Oral Tradition to
      writing as the Mishnah, set themselves the task of rebuilding
      a religious base for Judaism by making the Law "a fence
      around Israel." About 140 A.D., they finally standardized the
      technique of circumcision, effectively eliminating the
      previously used methods of uncircumcision. In Shabbat
      <i>19</i>: 6, we read:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"These shreds (of the foreskin) include flesh that
        covers the greater part of the corona . . .: if he waxes
        fat (and the corona is covered anew) . . . or if one is
        circumcised without having the inner lining torn, it is as
        though he had not been circumcised."</i>
      </blockquote>

      <p>To obviate the leaving of excessive preputial tissue, the
      <i>per'iah</i> was instituted. After the excision of the
      foreskin the mohel was instructed to seize the inner lining
      of the prepuce still covering the glans and with thumbnail
      and index finger of each hand to tear it so the he can roll
      it fully back over the glans and completely expose the
      latter.</p>

      <p>There is no evidence that any other method was used since
      that standardization of the operation. The Inquisitor was in
      error when he said</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"It is to be noted here that the Jews operate
        differently on their own children and on Christians,
        children or adults. To circumcise Christians, adults or
        minors, they do not cut the prepuce all around, as they do
        to their own children born in Judaism, but merely make
        semi-circular resection."</i> <sup><a
        href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Modern Times</h3>

      <p>From then until the very recent past there is no evidence
      of attempts at uncircumcision amongst the Jews. The plight of
      the Jews under the Hitler terrer, however, made
      uncircumcision no longer a question of social conformity but
      a matter of life and death. Escape from the Ghettos set up by
      the Germans in Poland was difficult but possible. On the
      "Aryan side," life for the Jews remained dangerous. No matter
      how "good" the visage nor how well-forged the
      <i>Kennkarte</i>, (identification documents), the male Jew
      carried with him incontrovertible proof of his origin.</p>

      <p>The blackmailers and the extortionists know as
      <i>schmaltzovniks</i> (from the Polish word "szmalec,"
      meaning "fat") used the circumcision as the criterion of
      Jewishness. Bernard Goldstein, a Bundist leader who lived on
      the "Aryan side," describes their activities vividly:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"These scum would approach their victims with the words,
        'Hand over your fat.' They were a terrible plague upon the
        Jews who lived on the Aryan side. In addition to the
        Gestapo, SS men, and others who hunted them relentlessly,
        the Jews lived in constant danger from these dregs of
        Polish morality, who made a business of Jewish lives.
        Hundreds were engaged in this hateful occupation--searching
        out the unfortunates who now lived under the protection of
        Gentiles . . . Jews who had nothing and were not profitable
        were handed over to the Nazis. Others had to pay monthly
        blackmail. When they finally had nothing left for the blood
        tax, they were handed over to their fate . . . They
        operated in gangs . . . They would pull their victim into a
        doorway or alley and rip open his trousers, looking for the
        fateful sign . . .</i> <sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Even Christians became their victims. <sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Respectable Poles, when asked to
      expose themselves, tried to give the hooliganswho surrounded
      them money to avoid the disgrace; such actions merely incited
      their tormentors further; they tore open their trousers and
      finding an intact prepuce, beat up their hapless prey in
      their chagrin. Those Catholics who took Jewish children into
      convents and orphan asylums also feared the
      <i>schmaltzovniks</i>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"They sent back Dr. E. Ringelblum's son (who had a good
        visage--i.e., he didn't look Jewish) because they feared to
        keep circumcised boys."</i> <sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>After the mass deportations from the Ghettos to
      extermination, the Gestapo continued its job of rooting out
      Jews in the towns and villages where they might be
      hiding.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"One day the Gestapo raided the villa. Tolla and her
        husbanh were discovered: their appearance and their
        documents were of no avail. The beasts examined her husband
        physically, discovered he was a Jew, and immediately shot
        both of them."</i> <sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Through illegal sources, Jews could sometimes obtain
      documents, stating that circumcision had been performed
      because of phimosis resulting from a chancre or infection
      secondary to venereal disease. Obviously such documents were
      valueless for children, as well as repugnant to many adults.
      Furthermore, although such papers might convince the laymen,
      they were regarded with great skepticism by the German
      doctors. The latter prided themselves on their skin in
      distingiushing between circumcisions performed in infancy
      (and hence ritual) and those done in adult life. <sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p>Ingenious surgeons devised methods of reforming the
      prepuce to answer demands for such operations.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"There was at least one doctor who, for tremendous sums,
        performed plastic operations to restore the appearance of a
        foreskin. The operation was extremely dangerous, but some
        were desperate enough to try it."</i> <sup><a
        href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The famous actor, Jonas Turkow, describes what happened to
      his nephew: Before placing the boy with Christians, his
      sister-in-law had to arrange for an operation to wipe out the
      sign of his Jewish origin.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"She had already come to an agreement with a certain Dr.
        G----------, former major in the Polish Army. I knew this
        individual well from the Warsaw Ghetto . . . He had now
        become a go-between for the surgeons who dd these
        operations and the Jews who wanted the operations. Tens of
        thousands of Jews had already had these operations. Several
        doctors on the Aryan side made a good living from this
        ...Major G--------- asked for this operation large sums of
        money which he split with the surgeon . . . The fee had to
        paid in advance . . . A few days after the operation, it
        appeared that it had been unsuccessful . . ."</i> <sup><a
        href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The same sum was demanded for another operation. It was
      done by another doctor,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>". . . in a meadow because the doctor didn't want to
        work in his house. The second operation was also
        unsuccessful. Yurek became very sick after this operation .
        . ."</i>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Techniques of uncircumcision</h3>

      <p>The earliest description of uncircumcision is given by
      Celsus in Book VII, Chapter 25, of <i>De Medicina:</i></p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"The prepuce is to be raised from the underlying penis
        around the circumference of the glans by means of a scapel.
        This is not very painful, or once margin has been freed it
        can be stripped up by hand as far back as the pubes, nor in
        so doing is there any bleeding. The prepuce thus freed is
        again stretched forward beyond the glans; next cold water
        applications are freely used, and a plaster is applied
        around to repress severe inflammation. And for the
        following days the patient is to fast until nearly overcome
        by hunder lest satiety excite that part. When the
        inflammation has ceased the penis should be bandaged from
        the pubes to the corona; over the glans the plaster is
        applied with the other end of the probe. This is done in
        order that the proximal part may aglutinate whilst the
        distal part heals without adhering."</i> <sup><a
        href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This operation was not only very painful and exposed the
      patient to danger because of the rules of anesthesia and
      asepsis, but it failed in a large number of cases.</p>

      <p>As scarring took place, the skin covering the glans
      retracted slowly and finally the circumcision reappeared.
      <sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p>At a later period, Paulus Aeginate, in Chapter 53 of his
      <i>Surgery</i>, say of uncircumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"Two kinds of operation have been described. Sometimes
        one cuts the skin circularly at the proxima edge of the
        organ, and, after separating the edges, the lower part is
        pulled forward to cover the glans. Other times one dissects
        with a bistoury the area just proximal to the corona, then
        one draws it distally, interposes a small piece of linen so
        that no adhesions form, and then covers the entire area
        with fine linen. Antyllus prefers this method and has
        advocated it for a long time . . ."</i> <sup><a
        href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In modern times, the only published description of such an
      operation is a single case report from the 1890's. Because of
      a misunderstanding the prepuce was removed. The violent
      objections of the patient led the surgeon to replace it
      immediately, suturing it to the original site. Cicatricial
      contraction followed, but the cosmetic effect was good.
      <sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p>A search of the literature since 1945, particularly the
      Polish, has failed to find description of the techniques used
      by the Polish surgeons. From information from lay sources I
      have been able to learn that three methods were used,
      depending on the age of the patient, the mobility of the
      post-coronal skin, and the skill of the surgeon.</p>

      <p>The first, and crudest, technique was to pull forward the
      skin from behind the corona, scarify the edges roughly, and
      suture the scarified edges together with non-absorbable
      suture to create an artificial phimosis. Post-operative
      swelling was common and infection frequent. If infection lead
      to scarring, the operation was successful; if however, as
      often happened, the sutures were extruded, the skin promptly
      retracted from the covered glans.</p>

      <p>The second method was a variation of that described by
      Celsus. After using local anesthetic solution sufficient to
      distend the loose skin behind the glans, the surgeon made a
      circular incision. By blunt dissection he separated the
      anterior and posterior portions from the underlying tissue.
      He then pulled forward the posterior part over the head of
      the glans. With absorbable suture the anterior portion was
      now fixed to the adjacent raw undersurface of the posterior
      (but now, upper) part. The tip of the remainder of the
      posterior portion, which now covered the glans, was narrowed
      by a circular suture so that retraction did not take place.
      The whole penis was then wrapped in layers of gauze. If
      infection did not supervene, this operation was quite
      satisfactory from a cosmetic point of view. If there was
      inflammation not responding to simple measures, multiple
      incision were made, allowing the release of accumulated
      serum, blood, or pus; the resultant scars sometimes caused
      irregular retraction of the new prepuce but seldom to the
      degree that it could be said that the patient had been
      ritually circumcised.</p>

      <p>The third method was very elaborate (and correspondingly
      expensive, although no more effective. Two laymen, with an
      understandable passion for anonymity, on whom this type of
      operation was done (by the same doctor) have described the
      technique to the best of their ability: The entire operation
      was done under local anesthesia. The preputial area was
      infiltrated. A circular incision was made and the edges of
      the wound separated. Bleeding was controlled by pressure with
      a "rag" (gauze sponge?) by the patient. An area over the
      iliac crest was infiltrated and a long oblong band excised.
      This strip of tissue was placed in a glass of solution
      (type?) while the surgeon covered the wound at the iliac
      crest with greased (petrolatum?) gauze. He then took the
      strip of skin and sutured the long edges to the anterior and
      posterior edges of the penile incision; the narrow edges of
      the strip were sutured together at the inferior surface of
      the penis at the frenulum. The anterior line was covered with
      oil (?). The anterior line of the bulging skin graft was then
      pushed back so that it became the inner surface of an
      artificial prepuce. The posterior line of incision was also
      covered with oil and a firm circular bandange applied. The
      patient was instructed to keep the iliac crest area dry for
      three days then wash it daily. The bandage over the penile
      wound was not to be touched for three days, then carefully
      unwound and replaced daily until all redness had disappeared
      at the site of the wound. A foul discharge occurred, both
      patients said, from the inside of the new prepuce, but they
      were afraid to push it back and wash the area lest they undo
      the operation. The wounds healed completely ("but with rough
      edges") in about two weeks.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>No better final comment can be made than that of Doctor
      Joseph Tenebaum:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>"Circumcision certainly proved a boon for the Nazis.
        Jews could dye their hair, assume an Aryan flair and learn
        to chant Catholic hymns, but they could not hide the mark
        of the covenant . . . being a surgeon myself, my
        professional curiousity made me interview dozens of doctors
        and examine the end results of these operations. The latter
        were either unsatisfactory or mutilating. One of the
        physicians, who himself underwent several plastic
        operations to undo the irreparable, said to me in great
        bitterness: "Jews have had all kinds of international
        conferences, from Zionist congresses to Esperanto
        conventions, but though Jewish doctors, starting with
