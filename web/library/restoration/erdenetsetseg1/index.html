      <h2>Reconstruction of the hypospadiac hooded prepuce</h2>

      <p><b>Erdenetsetseg G, Dewan PA.</b></p>

      <p><b>PURPOSE</b> The role of foreskin reconstruction as part
      of distal hypospadias repair remains uncertain. Thus, we
      wished to define better the indications with a view to
      improving the success of this cosmetic alternative. We
      reviewed the outcome in a group of patients who underwent
      foreskin reconstruction to highlight the criteria for likely
      success.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</b> The records of 51 boys who
      underwent foreskin reconstruction from 1996 to 2001 were
      reviewed from a total hypospadias repair group of 223. Boys
      who underwent foreskin reconstruction were 4 months to 9
      years old (median age 9.3 months). Surgery included a meatal
      advancement and glanuloplasty procedure in 22 patients,
      Mathieu urethroplasty in 2, King-Duplay repair in 2 and a
      meatotomy in 1, while in 24 with a normal glans meatus
      foreskin plasty was the only surgery. Cases in which the
      foreskin was required for chordee release and those in which
      the gap between the ventral aspects of the foreskin was wide
      were excluded from foreskin reconstruction. Also, patients
      were selected by intraoperative assessment of the ability to
      approximate the foreskin in the midline at the level of the
      coronal groove. If this maneuver can be performed without
      placing the foreskin under tension, the foreskin is
      considered suitable for reconstruction. All patients received
      regional and general anesthesia plus intraoperative
      antibiotics. After suitable urethroplasty the technique of
      foreskin reconstruction was generally similar for all types
      of the condition.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS</b> The result was excellent in 36 patients
      (70.6%) with a normal-appearing foreskin that retracted
      easily. There was a good result in 8 patients (15.7%) with a
      satisfactory meatus at the tip of the glans and a retractable
      foreskin but minor foreskin deformity. Only 3 patients had a
      minor complication, including a fistula through the prepuce
      in 2 and wound infection in 1. No boy had a complication due
      to urethroplasty and there were no urethral fistulas.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b> Our study shows that foreskin
      reconstruction is successful, particularly if the proximal,
      coronal groove portion of the prepuce can be easily
      approximated manually and the procedure can be combined with
      a range of distal repairs. <span class="yellow">We would
      recommend reconstruction of the prepuce if parents would
      prefer their son to be uncircumcised, providing that the
      foreskin is suitable for preservation.</span></p>
