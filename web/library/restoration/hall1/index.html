      <p class="text">"Any uncircumcised male who is not
      circumcised on the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off
      from his people; he has broken my covenant." So said God to
      Abraham, establishing the covenant of circumcision, a
      covenant "between me and you and your descendents after you"
      (Genesis 17:10,14)</p>

      <p class="text">For centuries, Jewish boys have regularly
      been circumcised when they are eight days old (Genesis
      17:12). An unusual challenge to circumcision developed,
      however, in the Hellenistic period (after about 133 B.C.E*).
      Hellenistic and Roman societies widely practiced public
      nakedness. But <span class="yellow">they abhorred baring the
      tip of the penis,</span> called the glans. To expose the
      glans was considered vulgarly humorous, indecent or both.
      This combination of attitudes could be&mdash;and often
      was&mdash;devastating for circumcised Jews. Enjoying oneself
      in a Greek <i>gymnasium</i> or Roman bath, where nudity was
      <i>de rigueur</i>, was a popular and stylish pastime. Here
      politics was discussed and business deals concluded. Athletic
      contests and exhibitions were also conducted in the nude.
      Participation in athletics was often a prerequisite for
      social advancement. Yet a circumcised penis effectively
      precluded this participation.</p>

      <p class="text">Consequently, for hundreds of years some Jews
      underwent a surgical procedure known as epispasm&mdash;an
      operation that "corrected" a circumcised penis. Some might
      call it circumcision in reverse. From references and
      allusions to the procedure in classical and rabbinical
      literature, it appears that epispasm <span class="cirp">[CIRP
      Note:
      &epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&pi;&alpha;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;,
      <i>epispasmos</i>]</span> reached its peak of popularity in
      the first century C.E.</p>

      <p class="text">The New Testament reveals bitter conflicts
      over circumcision among the followers of Jesus, conflicts
      expressed also in attitudes towards epispasm practiced by
      Jews. Paul, who thinks circumcision useless, nevertheless
      forbids epispasm: "Was any one at the time of his call
      already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of
      circumcision," he advises the Corinthians (1 Corinthians
      7:18).</p>

      <p class="text">Numerous written sources from the second
      century B.C.E. to the early sixth century C.E. speak about
      epispasm and attitudes toward it.</p>

      <p class="text">During these centuries, foreskins assumed an
      importance they have rarely had before or since. The Roman
      emperor Hadrian (117-138 C.E.) loathed circumcision as much
      as castration&mdash;both were unnatural, an offense against
      the Greek idea of natural beauty of the human body&mdash;and
      outlawed both.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Males who wished to conceal an exposed glans
      had several options. Dioscorides, a first century C.E.
      physician to Nero's troops and master of herbal lore, helped
      those who, though not circumcised, had a defectively short
      foreskin. He suggested applying thapsia, an herb that causes
      swelling.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> this would not work,
      Dioscorides recognized for those who were circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">Soranus, author of a second-century C.E.
      medical text, prescribed a different method for correcting
      defectively short foreskins in infants: The baby's nurse
      should pull the foreskin forward over the glans and tie it
      with a thread. "For if gradually stretched and continuously
      drawn forward, it easily stretches and assumes its normal
      length an covers the glans and becomes accustomed to keep the
      natural good shape."<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">A simple surgical procedure called
      infibulation, was another option for a defectively short
      foreskin. A surgeon would pierce the foreskin to receive a
      light wooden pin called a fibula.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> With the fibula inserted the foreskin
      was held neatly closed. Infibulation was supposed to improved
      the voice and health of adolescent boys, but Celsus, the
      author of a medical text from the first century C.E., doubts
      the therapeutic value of infibulation for this purpose.</p>

      <p class="text">Infibulation could also be used by those who
      had been circumcised. Some circumcised Jews concealed their
      circumcision by drawing the skin around the penis forward and
      securing it with a fibula&mdash;or with twine. Martial, the
      Roman poet, ridiculed an infibulated Jewish slave<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> and derided another Jew whose fibula
      fell out at the bath.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The Cadillac of correctives, however, was
      clearly epispasm: "If the glans is bare and the man wishes
      for the look of things to have it covered, that can be done,"
      Celsus assured his readers.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> It
      was a variation of an operation recommended for congenitally
      short foreskins. For congenitally short foreskins, the
      surgeon would tie forward the foreskin, Soranus recommended,
      and cut the sheath of skin around the penis just in front of
      the pubic bone. When the wound healed, the surgeon would
      remove the twine.</p>

      <p class="text">Epispasm on a circumcised penis required a
      somewhat more difficult operation: The surgeon would cut
      around the glans freeing the sheath of skin surrounding the
      shaft of the penis, pull the skin forward and dress the wound
      carefully so that the skin would reattach to the glans
      leaving a foreskin. At a time before effective anesthesia, a
      man inclined to try this procedure had Celsus' assurance that
      it was "not so very painful."<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Epiphanus, the fourth century C.E. churchman,
      tells of a man who was circumcised twice, once as a Samaritan
      and again as a Jewish proselyte. In the course of the
      discussion, Epiphanus mentions a spouthisteros, a special
      implement for performing epispasm. He tells up, "If you can
      make circumcision uncircumcision, do not marvel at some being
      circumcised twice."<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Some Jews probably submitted to epispasm
      because they shared the common Greek and Roman revulsion
      toward circumcision. Even if they did not, however, societal
      institutions and attitudes exerted strong pressure against
      remaining circumcised. Jews of means naturally wanted to
      participate in gymnasium and bath. Not only were these a
      chief means of recreation, they also functioned as hubs for
      business. If Jews exercised or bathed while circumcised, they
      offended their gentile neighbors and submitted themselves to
      incredulous ridicule; if they did not attend, everyone knew
      why&mdash;and talked about it. Either way their business
      would suffer.</p>

      <p class="text">Other factors also encouraged epispasm.</p>

      <p class="text">Athletics constituted a chief avenue of
      social advancement for underclass boys. Greek cities competed
      with each other to grant citizenship to promising boys and to
      sponsor them at the games. Since athletes exercised and
      competed without clothes, this avenue was denied to those who
      were circumcised. What city would sponsor an obscenity?</p>

      <p class="text">After the Jewish revolt against Rome in 66-70
      C.E., punitive measures against Jews were more easily
      enforced against those who could be identified because they
      were circumcised. Suetonius tells of an old man claiming
      exemption from the most hated of these measures, a two
      drachma tax to fund the worship of Jupiter. The court
      stripped the old man in court, found him to be circumcised
      and fined him.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> A Jewish man
      could escape such oppressive measures and the stigma attached
      to them by submitting to epispasm.</p>

      <p class="text">Obstacles to citizenship in Greek cities like
      Alexandria also encouraged Jews to undergo epispasm.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> In Alexandria and perhaps in other
      cities formed on the Greek model, citizenship and the
      important privileges that went with it were granted only to
      <i>ephebes</i>, those trained for citizenship in the
      ephebaion. Since local law forbade Jews becoming citizens and
      since <i>ephebes</i> regularly exercised naked in the
      <i>gymnasium</i>, a Jew who appeared naked with a circumcised
      penis was unable to circumvent the law. Some Jews did evade
      the law, however; a Greek delegation from Alexandria
      complained about this to the emperor.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Greek and Roman abhorrence of circumcision
      produced a variety of predictable reactions among Jews. Those
      who stood vigorously against Greek culture asserted the
      necessity of circumcision in stronger terms than ever. The
      Jewish author of Jubilees interpreted Greek culture as the
      product of the demonic world; circumcision he tells us, lifts
      Jews out of the evil realm and places them directly under
      God's rule.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Other Jews who accepted Greek culture
      attempted to explain circumcision to the Greeks&mdash;and to
      themselves. A certain Jew named Artapanos (third to second
      centuries B.C.E.) took a novel approach: Moses founded the
      religion of Egypt and gave circumcision to Ethiopia.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> If Egyptians and Ethiopians in
      following their ancestral practices still keep the teachings
      of Moses, why should Hebrews not keep them as well?</p>

      <p class="text">The first century C.E. Jewish philosopher
      Philo defends circumcision in Greek terms by listing physical
      and allegorical advantages. Circumcised men are more fertile,
      less vulnerable to disease and being cleaner, are more
      fittingly set aside as a nation of priests. In addition the
      heart begets the thought, which is the highest human
      excellence; therefore penises should be circumcised to
      resemble the godly heart. <span class="yellow">Moreover,
      circumcision represents the excision of the pleasure of sex,
      which bewitches the mind.</span><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Some Jews, faced with overwhelming societal
      repugnance toward circumcision, probably neglected it. Many
      of these Jews ceased to practice Judaism at all and quietly
      faded into the surrounding culture. Other neglected
      circumcision but actively claimed their Jewish heritage. The
      evidence for uncircumcised yet practicing Jews is indirect
      but unequivocal.</p>

      <p class="text">For example, Ananius, after successfully
      convincing Izates, prince of Adiabene, to become a Jew,
      argued that he should not be circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> The Jewish author of the Fourth
      Sybylline Oracle urged gentiles to repent and immerse
      themselves in water but found no need to mention
      circumcision. Rabbis debated whether circumcision or
      immersion in water really made a proselyte.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Philo tells us that the real
      proselyte circumcises not his foreskin but his
      passions.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> Such statements are
      readily explained if some authorities were contending that a
      person could be or become a Jew without being
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">Philo rebuked Jews who allegorize the law to
      abolish Sabbaths, feasts, the Temple and circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> The Jews interpreted the Torah to
      justify their neglect of circumcision, which suggests that in
      their own eyes they remained observant Jews.</p>

      <p class="text">Both confirming that many Jews neglected
      circumcision and affirming the rabbinic commitment to it, the
      Talmud tells us that Jerusalem fell to the Romans and the
      Temple was destroyed because Jews "broke the covenant by
      failing to circumcise their sons."<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Some Jews practiced a form of circumcision
      that did not show. The reaction can be seen in the Mishnah's*
      requirement that valid circumcision must bare the
      glans.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> The need for this
      ruling implies that some Jews practiced a form of
      circumcision&mdash;perhaps by simply nicking the
      foreskin&mdash;in a way that did not bare the glans. Removing
      only a little of the foreskin might obviate the need either
      for infibulation of epispasm. Jews who circumcised in this
      manner did not set out to abrogate the covenant of
      circumcision; they merely tried to keep the covenant without
      offending their gentile neighbors by baring the glans.</p>

      <p class="text">That epispasm was fairly widespread among
      Jews also seems evident from 1 Maccabees 1:11-15, where we
      are told that some built a <i>gymnasium</i> in Jerusalem and
      "made themselves uncircumcised."</p>

      <p class="text">As might be expected, the rabbinic references
      to epispasm condemn it (while at the same time reflecting
      that it must have been a fairly widespread phenomenon).</p>

      <p class="text">In <i>Pirkei Avot</i>** 3.16, we are told:
      "The one who voids the covenant of Abraham has no portion in
      the world to come."</p>

      <p class="text">According to the Talmud,<sup>&dagger;</sup>
      even Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, cannot eliminate the
      transgression of epispasm.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">In various
      <i>midrashim</i><sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup> several notorious
      biblical sinners, such as Jehoiakin,<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> Achan<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> and Adam,<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> are said to have submitted to
      epispasm. As late as the 12th century, The Rambam (Moses
      Maimonides) stated that "anyone who elongates his foreskin
      [to conceal his circumcision]" is denied a share of the world
      to come.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">On the other hand, some talmudic rabbis are
      less harsh. They consider whether one who has undergone
      epispasm (a <i>mashuk</i>) should be recircumcised when
      rejoining the rabbinic fold:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Rabbi Judah says, `One who has his prepuce
      drawn forward [i.e., who has submitted to epispasm] should
      not be recircumcised because it is dangerous.' They said to
      him, `Many were circumcised [after epispasm] in the time of
      Ben Koziba and they had children and did not die.'<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The references to epispasm here date from the
      second century B.C.E. to early in the sixth century C.E. As
      we have seen, however, epispasm was only one reaction to the
      Greco-Roman abhorrence of circumcision. Some Jews who
      rejected Greek culture heightened the religious and social
      importance of circumcision: Circumcision delivered one from
      evil. Others, like Philo, impressed by Greek philosophy, used
      arguments consonant with Greek presuppositions to support the
      practice of circumcision. Still others thought their
      religious obligation was fulfilled if only a minute part of
      the foreskin was removed. Those who interpreted the Torah by
      Greek methods and sensitivities, argued that the law, when
      properly understood, did not require literal circumcision.
      Such a wide spectrum of views allowed plenty of room for
      Jewish men to practice epispasm while still living as Jews.
      Many of these men never thought they had violated the
      covenant. They only wanted to live in both worlds. They had
      received circumcision; the second operation only made their
      circumcision less conspicuous.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Readers of <b>)</b> will remember how central
      the debates over circumcision were to the development of
      early Christianity.**** Since the early church was part of
      the Jewish community, the Christian debate can be seen as
      part of the Jewish discussion about circumcision. Like the
      Jewish community at large, the church was divided between
      those who required circumcision and those who did not. Many
      Christians despised the arguments of those who in their view
      sought to gain the approval of their gentile neighbors by
      neglecting the covenant of Abraham. If circumcision defines
      the sphere where God acts on behalf of his people and
      uncircumcision defines the sphere of demonic control, then
      Jesus must act among the circumcised; circumcision is
      required.</p>

      <p class="text">When Paul in Galatians (6:15) claims that
      circumcision is irrelevant or when Luke asserts that gentiles
      entering the people of God need not circumcise themselves
      (Acts 15:19-29, they enter a debate that has already
      solidified. All the arguments have already been made and
      answered; the two sides glower at one another across an
      unbridgeable gulf. Merely repeating well-known arguments
      would hardly convince anyone. Paul and Luke can persuade only
      by transcending the former arguments; they can obtain a
      hearing only from the party whose arguments they adopt.</p>

      <p class="text">Paul enters the fray accepting the arguments
      of the circumcision party. Paul agrees that the world has
      been divided into two spheres, the sphere of the circumcised
      where God has acted, and the sphere of the uncircumcised
      "gentile sinners" where demons rule (cf. Galatians 2:15). But
      for Paul the world is where this distinction rightly applies
      is passing away: "[Christ] gave himself for our sins to
      deliver us from this present evil world according to the will
      of God the Father" (Galatian 1:3-4). Distinctions between
      circumcised and uncircumcised, proper to the old world, do
      not apply in the new. Since in Christ Christians are leaving
      the old world, circumcision has no relevance for them: "But
      far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord
      Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and
      I to the world. For neither circumcision counts for anything
      nor uncircumcision, but a new creation" (Galatians
      6;14-15).</p>

      <p class="text">Luke also begins by accepting circumcision:
      he carefully depicts the circumcision of both John the
      Baptist and Jesus (Luke 1:59, 2:21). But after the
      resurrection Jesus reveals a new plan of God to a very
      puzzled group of disciples (Luke 24:36-49), a new plan that
      includes gentiles (Luke 24:47). In Acts, Luke works out the
      consequences of this plan and chronicles the revelation to
      the disciples that under the new plan gentiles do not require
      circumcision (chapter 15).</p>

      <p class="text">By accepting as valid the arguments of the
      circumcision party, Paul and Luke could hope that their
      argument would be heard. By tying their conclusion that
      circumcision is no longer necessary to the new thing Christ
      has done, they could hope that the might convince Christians
      of the circumcision party who, of course, agreed that God had
      done something new by sending the Messiah. By denying the
      necessity of circumcision they could expect to attract
      gentiles to belief in Jesus. How well Paul, Luke and others
      like them succeeded appears from the result: <span
      class="yellow">Eventually the Church abandoned
      circumcision.</span> The ancestors of modern Judaism did not;
      the wide variety of Jewish views on circumcision evidently
      died with the Hellenistic civilization that gave them birth,
      and Jews returned to the almost universal practice of the
      ritual of circumcision.</p>
