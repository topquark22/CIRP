      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2"><font size="2">A small, carefully selected
      group of circumcised, predominately homosexual males,
      expressing severe dissatisfaction with their circumcised
      condition, have responded favorably to operative
      reconstruction of the foreskin. The surgical technique for
      reconstructing the foreskin and the results are
      described.</font></p>
      <br />

      <p class="text2">Part of the American male population regards
      the foreskin as an important part of the ideal male figure.
      Members of this group feel that the foreskin is associated
      with masculinity (Levin, 1976; Money, Hampson, &amp; Hampson,
      1957) Some of these men are active in three political action
      groups. (Uncircumcised Society of America Introductory
      Newsletter, 1976; Wallerstein, 1980), and lobby against
      childhood circumcision (<a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/penn1/">Penn,
      1963</a>), a position also supported in the last decade by
      professional organizations. Some of these men have been
      motivated to seek surgical reconstruction. We report here our
      experiences with such a group, for some of whom we have
      reconstructed a foreskin.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Patient Population</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Referral from earlier patients have
      generated our patient population. All patients requesting
      foreskin reconstruction undergo an extensive psychological
      diagnostic battery and a diagnostic psychiatric evaluation.
      Surgery is not offered to those patients who any member of
      the team feel have unrealistic expectations. Surgery has also
      been refused any who display significant untreated
      psychiatric disorders or with whom we are unable to easily
      develop comfortable effective communication. Following the
      independent clinical evaluations by the surgeon,
      psychiatrist, and psychologist, the entire case is reviewed
      in conference with specific attention to the above issues,
      and a final decision to accept an reject the patient is made.
      Our patients are extensively counseled about the nature of
      the multiple surgical procedures necessary, possible
      complications and risks, and the expected results. All
      patients have been in good general health and free of active
      genitourinary tract disease.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Plan of Operation</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The procedure is done is four major stages.
      First a transverse bipedicle scrotal flap is used to cover a
      cylindrical turnover flap of the distal penile skin. In the
      second and third stages, the bipedicle flaps are divided, and
      the ends of the pedicles are joined. Residual deformities are
      corrected as a fourth stage.</p>

        <p><font size="2">Size of the foreskin reconstruction
        is<br />
        determined by measuring the distance<br />
        from the corona to the tip of the glans.</font></p>
      </center>

        <p><font size="2">The skin and subcutaneous tissue is<br />
        incised all the way around the penis.</font></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2"><i>Cylindrical Turnover Flap</i> (see Figure
      1).</p>

      <p class="text2">The first stage is done under general
      anesthesia. The distance from corona to tip of the glans is
      measured. A point equidistant, proximally, is marked on the
      shaft of the penis. An incision encircling the penis is made
      at this point (see Figure 2), and a cylindrical flap of
      penile skin, based upon the corona, is elevated. This
      turnover cylindrical flap becomes the lining of the
      reconstructed foreskin (see Figure 3).</p>

        <font size="2">Figure 3</font> 

        <p><font size="2">The cylindrical flap of penile skin

        <p><font size="2">A bipedicle flap equal in width to
        the<br />
        turned-over cylindrical flap plus its donor<br />
        area is designed and elevated.</font></p>
      </center>

      <p><i>Bipedicle Scrotal Flap</i> (see Figure 4).</p>

      <p class="text2">A bipedicle scrotal flap is then elevated.
      This flap is equal in width to twice the turnover flap, so it
      is sufficiently wide to cover the raw surface of the turnover
      flap as well as the donor site from the turnover flap. This
      flap is transversely oriented on the anterior surface of the
      scrotum. The penis is buried beneath the bipedicle flap (see
      Figures 5 &amp; 6.</p>

      <center>

        <font size="2">Figure 5</font>

        the bipedicle flap.</font></p>
      </center>

      <p><i>Pedicle Division</i> (see Figures 7 &amp; 8).</p>

      <p class="text2">The second stage is scheduled after
      induration and edema of the flaps have totally resolved. The
      time for this is highly variable but is usually several
      months. In this stage, the pedicles are divided, wrapped
      about the penis, and sutured together. This is done in stages
      to assure the new foreskin has gradually developed good
      circulation from the penis. Edema following these stages has
      been significant and may persist for several months. Again,
      the duration may be variable.</p>

        <font size="2">Figure 7</font> 

        <p><font size="2">A portion of each pedicle is divided
        and<br />

        pedicle<br />
        frees the penis from the scrotum.</font></p>
      </center>

      <p><i>Residual Deformities</i></p>

      <p class="text2">Any residual deformities or scars are
      corrected in the final stage. These are minor notches and
      dimples corrected in a variety of ways to achieve an optimum
      aesthetic result.</p>

      <p class="text2">Scrotal hair is rarely a problem. When
      present it has been handled by plucking.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Complications</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Significant complications have included two
      scrotal hematomas both of which healed without intervention.
      In one patient, an attempt to elongate the bipedicle scrotal
      flap during the initial procedure was made. That flap showed
      temporary vascular compromise but did eventually recover.
      However, at the time of pedicle division several months
      later, this flap sustained partial loss. Sufficient tissue
      remained to allow construction of a satisfactory result with
      local flaps.</p>

      <p class="text2">One patient developed epididymitis 2 weeks
      following the first stage. The patient responded to
      antibiotic management.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Results</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">We have evaluated 11 patients for foreskin
      reconstruction. Three were judged not suitable for operative
      management after initial screening. One of these had
      undergone 18 previous procedures to attempt reconstruction by
      another surgeon. That surgeon had refused to consider any
      further attempts. We were unable to establish effective
      rapport with the patient, felt he had unrealistic
      expectations, and therefore, refused to operate on him. All
      clinicians thought this patients foreskin looked very nearly
      normal. The patient stated during psychiatric evaluation that
      he wanted a "perfect phallus." None of the evaluators felt
      comfortable working with this mane, who seemed to harbor much
      rage.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another patient was rejected because of his
      youth and emerging identity conflicts. This patient was 18
      years old. (all others were over 30). He was actively
      conflicted about his family relations and openly expressed
      typical late adolescent uncertainty about who he was.
      Psychological testing suggesting unconscious connections
      between his family conflicts and foreskin concern. The
      psychiatrist was concerned that such a request in a late
      adolescent might not reflect the kind of stable body image
      issues which benefit for surgical intervention.</p>

      <p class="text2">The third patient was rejected because he
      has a long-standing, untreated, significant affective
      disorder. His interview behavior was anxious, agitated, and
      bordered on the inappropriate. Psychological testing
      suggested that he had a bipolar disorder. Since he seemed
      unaware of the problem and had never sought treatment, this
      was suggested to him before reapplying for surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">One patient accepted for operation had had
      previous reconstruction attempted elsewhere. We were able to
      improve his condition with local flaps. Seven patients'
      reconstructions were started by us. Nine of our patients were
      homosexual and two were heterosexual. All but the most recent
      applicants have completed all surgical stages.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Every patient has
      reported the results of the operation to be pleasing and
      gratifying. Most have reported increased glanular
      sensitivity.</span> Most of the reconstructed foreskins have
      developed transient edema, which, in every case, becomes less
      frequent and less severe with the passage of time (in one
      case, up to 1 year). When not edematous, the reconstructed
      foreskins have been soft, pliable, and mobile. Retraction
      during erections has been smooth and without difficulty.
      Subtle color discrepancy is present between penile skin and
      reconstructed foreskin, as is a difference in skin texture
      and contour.</p>

        <b>Comments</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">A team experienced and comfortable in
      dealing with sexual identity problems is necessary if these
      patients are to be dealt with effectively and safely. Our
      team is a subgroup of the University Gender Dysphoria Team.
      The surgeon must be experienced in planning flaps and
      imaginative in designing local flaps for completion of the
      reconstructions. The patients must be willing to undergo
      multiple procedures over a long period of time (up to 1
      year), and to withstand some disruption of his life-style
      during that time. Further research on both the surgical
      techniques and the patients who seek this surgery is
      indicated.</p>
