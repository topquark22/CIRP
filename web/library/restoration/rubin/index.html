      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: "Celsus" refers to Aulus Cornelius
      Celsus, fl. AD 14-37.]</p>
       
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>The Greeks and Romans, who celebrated the nude human body
      in art and sport, viewed any abnormal appearance of the
      genitals with distaste, even amusement. Surgical procedures
      were developed in the Hellenistic period for those who had
      undergone circumcision or had been born with little or no
      prepuce and who subsequently wished to cover their bared
      glans in order to move inconspicuously in Greek and Roman
      society. Celsus, writing during the reign of Tiberius (A.D.
      14-37), describes two such operations in <i>De medicina</i>
      (7.25.1). His account of decircumcision raises important
      medical and historical questions.</p>

      <p>That one can call decircumcision -- restoration of the
      prepuce -- a plastic surgical procedure is suggested by
      Celsus. He introduces his operations in this way: 'And if the
      glans is bare, and the man wishes for the look of the thing
      to have it covered, that can be done.' Decorum rather than
      health is the motive by using <i>decoris causa</i> ('for the
      sake of appearance'), Celsus implies that an uncovered glans
      was socially unacceptable in Rome of the early empire, a Rome
      that had adopted the Greek institution of public nudity in
      the gymnasium and the baths. Loss or lack of a prepuce may
      have compelled some individuals with this condition to
      undergo the operations that Celsus describes in order to
      restore it. Before considering some historical implications,
      I shall present, first, Celsus's description of
      reconstruction of the prepuce and, second, decircumcison
      proper.</p>

      <p>After his introductory sentence and statement of the
      operation's purpose Celsus compares prognoses according to
      different physical types the glans can be covered "more
      easily in a boy than in a man; in one in whom the defect is
      natural than in one who after the custom of certain races has
      been circumcised (<i>quiquarundium gentium more circumcisus
      est</i>); and in one who has the glans small and the adjacent
      skin rather ample, while the penis itself is shorter, than in
      one in whom the conditions are contrary" (7.25,1.A.20-23).
      The operation would be easier in a boy than a man since there
      would be a greater proportion of skin to penis. Healing would
      be more rapid at an early age.</p>

      <p>Second in order of ease and the best adult candidate for
      such surgery would be a man whose prepuce is naturally
      insufficient to cover his glans. The reason is clear from
      Celsus's operation for this condition -- some skin already
      exists in the prepuce to stretch over the glans. In contrast,
      those who have been circumcised require a different, more
      extensive operation that entails raising the skin from the
      corona. In an adult he predicts a better result when there is
      a greater proportion of skin to penis -- the same factor that
      makes a boy a better candidate for such surgery than an
      adult.</p>

      <p>After indicating prognoses, Celsus first describes an
      operation for the congenitally deformed penis with an
      insufficient prepuce:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <font size="2">The prepuce around the glans is seized,
          stretched out until it actually covers the glans, and
          there tied. Next, the skin covering the penis just in
          front of the pubes is cut thorough in a circle until the
          penis is bared, but great care is taken not to cut into
          the urethra, nor into the blood vessels there. This done,
          the prepuce slides forwards, towards the tie, and a sort
          of small ring is laid bare in front of the pubes, to
          which limit is applied in order that flesh may grow and
          fill it up . . . (1.25.1 B,24-9)</font>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      At this point in the text (7.25.1 B.29) there is a lacuna,
      which Marx attempted to fill, completing the sense of the
      final sentence in this way: &lt;It if and all, at not or
      little distended I? skin the bared been has penis of Part
      enough large a that seen is&gt; the breadth of the wound
      above supplies sufficient covering" (7.25.1 B.29-30).
      Celsus's test concludes "But until the scar has formed it
      must remain tied, only a small passage being left in the
      middle for the urine." (725.1.C 30-1). 

      <p>Celsus's description of decircumcision follows
      immediately:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <font size="2">But in one who has been circumcised the
          prepuce is to be raised from the underlying penis mound
          the circumference of the glans by means of a scalpel.
          This is not so very painful, for once the margin has been
          freed, it can be stripped up by hand as far back as the
          pubes, nor in doing so is there any bleeding, The prepuce
          thus freed is again stretched forwards beyond the glans:
          next cold water effusions are freely used, and a plaster
          is applied round to repress severe inflammation. And for
          the following days the patient is to fast until nearly
          overcome by hunger lest satiety excite that part. When
          the inflammation has ceased, the penis should be bandaged
          from the pubes to the corona; over the glans the plaster
          is applied with the other end of the probe. This is done
          in order that the lower part [between the corona and
          pubic area] may agglutinate, whilst the upper part [the
          new foreskin covering the glans] heals without adhering.
          (7.25.1.C.1-10)</font>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The two operations are based on different principles. In
      the first (Fig. 1), where some foreskin is naturally present,
      a shallow cut is made around the base of the penis, and the
      skin is peeled down over the glans like a glove to form a new
      foreskin. This reconstructed prepuce is formed of a
      continuous, folded-over layer of exterior skin attached to
      the original prepuce. No plaster dressing is needed in this
      operation to prevent the now foreskin from sticking to the
      glans since the skin next to the glans is preputial dermis.
      This double layer of skin is then tied to prevent its
      slipping backward. Celsus does not mention the strong pull
      exerted on the skin by the retraction of the annular scar
      around the base of the penis. A modern analogy confirms the
      feasibility of Celsus's first procedure. <a
      href="/library/restoration/penn1/">Penn</a> describes the
      reconstruction of the prepuce of a man who wished to reverse
      his circumcision. Penn's procedure conforms to Celsus's first
      operation in all particulars except that he applies a free
      graft of skin to the raw area from the edge of the new
      prepuce to the base of the penis to prevent scarring and to
      facilitate healing. Decircumcision in the second operation,
      the actual decircumcision (Fig. 2). no cut is made around the
      base of the penis. The skin covering the penis is freed by
      dissection, then pulled forward over the glans. Unlike the
      restored prepuce of the first operation, the new covering of
      the glans is not exterior dermis, but the raw underside of a
      full-thickness tube of skin. Cold water effusions ease the
      pain and swelling, while the application of a nonadherent
      plaster dressing around the glans and under the new prepuce
      aid the growth of a new epithelial surface next to the
      glans`* In <i>De medicina</i> (5.19) Celsus gives two recipes
      for healing plasters that especially repress inflammation and
      create scar tissue. Both contain lead oxide, the ancient
      version of mercury ointment.</p>

      <p><small>*The raw undersurface of the new prepuce would
      rapidly form a new epithelial layer due to the ability of the
      skin in this region to regenerate, This phenomenon is the
      basis of. corrective surgical procedure for
      hypospadias.</small></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><small>"There is also one (plaster), almost red in
        color, which is found to bring wounds rapidly to a scar..
        It contains incense 4 Gm., resin 8 Gm., copper scales 16
        GM., litharge (oxide of lead) 80 Gm., wax 400 Cm.. oil 250
        c.cm." (5.19.5) "As well, there is one called rhaptousa (a
        composition which `sews up' the wound) because it
        agglutinates, consisting of bitumen and split alum 16 Gm.,
        litharge 160 Gm., and 250 c.cm. of old oil." (5.19.6)
        Spencer describes litharge as "oxide of lead separated
        after heating lead and silver ores; litharge was heated
        with oil to make plaster." (vol. 2. xiviii) Celsus's use of
        lead plaster for suppressing bleeding and inflammation (5.
        19.1), cleaning wounds (5.52). and healing nasal
        ulcerations (6.8.1.A) suggests its antibacterial
        properties.</small></p>

        <p>The chief difficulty of both procedures, which Celsus
        does not fully answer, is how the skin was prevented from
        rob; retracting without sutures. Presumably the pressure of
        the bandages, applied after the inflammation had ceased,
        was meant to anchor the skin In the new position. Another
        question is whether a patient who had undergone either
        operation could have engaged in sexual intercourse.
        Celsus's injunction that they fast "lest satiety excite
        that part" (7.25.1.C.7) testifies to the unimpaired
        virility of his patients immediately after decircumcision.
        Due to the loose connection between the skin] and the deep
        underlying structure of the penis, a relatively-easy and
        almost bloodless separation could have been made. If
        performed correctly, Celsus's operation would have affected
        only the skin: the underlying structure of the penis, blood
        supply, and physiology of erection would have remained
        unaffected. Implications: Who would have undergone these
        procedures? Celsus distinguishes between patients with
        congenitally deficient foreskins and those who have been
        circumcised "after the custom of certain races."</p>

      <p>Were these certain races? The Jews seem most obvious but
      they were not the only circumcised peoples known to the
      Romans. The Egyptians also practiced circumcision, although
      by Roman times it was limited to the priestly caste. In
      addition, Arabs, Ethiopians-Colehians, and Phoenicians were
      also circumcised.</p>

      <p>While Celsus does not refer explicitly to the Jews, a
      glans bared by circumcision was associated with Jewishness in
      Rome during the early empire. Horace uses the adjective
      curtus (cut, shortened, mutilated) describe an easily
      recognizable national characteristic when he mentions the
      Jews (curtis Judueis) (Satire 1.9.70). Petronius has Cito
      say, "Circumcise us, that we may appear to be Jews."
      (Satyricon 102.14) Circumcision in this context is one of
      several physical signs of nationality, along with the white
      face of the Gaul and the pierced ears of the Arab. Tacitus
      expresses his opinion that the Jews "have instituted
      circumcising the genitals in order to be distinguished by
      this difference." (Historia 5.5) This statement occurs in a
      list of Jewish customs that Tacitus finds "base and
      abominable, persisting due to their depravity." His catalogue
      includes the Jews temple tax, their clannishness, refusal to
      sleep with non-Jewish women, food laws, lust, burial customs,
      and refusal to honor the Roman Emperor in short, their
      rejection of all things Roman. Suetonius (Domitian 12.2)
      implies that circumcision was the criterion for identifying a
      Jew; he recalls the crowded public examination of a man in
      his nineties to see if he were circumcised and so liable to
      the fiscus Iudaicus.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to separate the Romans' responses to
      circumcision per se from their reactions to the Jews, Tacitus
      does not malign circumcision more than other Jewish traits he
      finds offensive. It is also difficult to appreciate whether
      Roman satirists found the appearance of the circumcised penis
      itself funny or relied on any mention of a Jewish trait to
      raise a laugh. One encounters this problem in Petronius
      description of a clever slave: "Yet he has two faults which
      if he did not have, he would be perfect: he is circumcised,
      and he snores." (Sat. 68.8) Did the surprising collocation of
      circumcision and snoring strike a Roman as funny, or was
      Petronius making a "Jewish joke?" Martial describes an
      athlete whose large penis shield (some elaborate version of a
      fibula)* fell off in the middle of the palestra.</p>

      <p><small>*The fibula was usually a circular pin inserted in
      the edges of the uncircumcised Foreskin to prevent the
      prepuce from being retracted, (Cf. Celsus 7.25.3) Comic
      actors and singers often under-went infibulation to prevent
      intercourse which was believed harmful to the voice. In
      Martial 7.82 the fibula seems to have been a sheath that
      covered the glans.</small> revealing his circumcised
      glans:</p>

      <p>So great a fibula covers Menophilus's penis that it alone
      would suffice all the comic actors. I had believed (for we
      often bathe together) that this fellow was taking care to
      spare his voice, Flaccus. But while he exercised in the
      middle of the palestra, in public view. his fibula slipped --
      he was circumcised! (7.82)</p>

      <p>It is not clear where the humor lay for a Roman in
      Menophilus's unmasking. Was his disclosure funny because it
      indicated he was a Jew? Or was Martial tapping an unchanging
      human response to the revelation that someone is other than
      what he purports to be? Perhaps a modern analogy would be the
      amusement caused if the bikini top of a voluptuous film star
      fell off, revealing that she was flat-chested. Whatever it
      was about Menophilus's circumcision that amused Martial,
      Menophilus was embarrassed enough about his condition to keep
      up his disguise, even when bathing with his friend.</p>

      <p>The earliest evidence for decircumcision connects this
      operation with the Jews. I Maccabees 1:14-15 (c.167 B.C.)
      contains a reference to the reconstruction of the
      foreskin:<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>"Thereupon they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem
          according to the customs of the gentiles and made
          foreskins for themselves, rebelling against the sacred
          covenant."</small>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      The collocation of gymnasium and decircumcision reminds us
      that complete nudity was customary for all exercises and
      sports performed in a Greek gymnasium. Celsus's description
      in <i>De medicina</i>, nearly two centuries later, provides
      the next solid reference to the decircumcision operation.
      Then, in I Corinthians 7.18 (mid first century A.D.) Paul
      writes "Is any man called, who is circumcised? Let him not
      become uncircumcised" Paul's prohibition suggests that the
      operation was known among Jews and gentiles like at a date
      very close to that of Celsus. The coincidence of the first
      recorded mention of decircumcision during the reign of
      Antiochus IV in I Maccabees 1:14-15, with its reference to
      the Hellenistic institution of the gymnasium and the
      beginning of the persecution of the Jews, suggests that
      decircumcision was practiced by the Jews as one of the first
      steps in assimilation.* 

      <p><small>*Analogous phenomena include the Jews' perennial
      inclination to change their names in the Diaspora, and the
      recent popularity of reductive rhinoplasty in Twentieth
      Century America.</small></p>

      <p>Motives for assimilation fall into two categories (1)
      escape from persecution. and (2) improvement of one's social
      and economic position. In Rome of the early first century
      A.D., when Celsus was writing no secure evidence exists in
      either category for Jews who would have undergone Celsus's
      operations. In A.D. 19 Tiberius expelled 4,000 Jews from
      Rome, sending them to Sardinia for military service. It is
      possible that some Jewish males of military age (18 to 45)
      were decircumcised to escape the sentence. In the second
      category the evidence is no more encouraging. The social
      educational and economic status of most practicing Jews in
      Rome was low, excluding them from gentile social circles
      where decircumcision would have enhanced their chances of
      public success and economic improvement.</p>

      <p>The situation was different in Alexandria, where Celsus
      may have obtained his operation. It is highly likely that
      wealthy educated, newly apostate Jews attempted to gain Greek
      citizenship for their sons, which carried with it the double
      advantage of exemption from the laographia, a tax levied on
      all males who were not Greek citizens,' and social
      recognition. The criterion for full Greek citizenship or,
      next best, a reduced rate of payment of the laographia was an
      education as an ephebos in the gymnasium.' Second-generation
      Hellenized Jews probably abandoned circumcision entirely.</p>

      <p>To sum up, circumcision, associated particularly but not
      exclusively with the Jews, constituted an embarrassment in
      the Roman world of the first century A.D. For Jews and other
      circumcised individuals who wished to pass as normal in their
      society. Celsus described a relatively easy plastic surgical
      procedure that could remove the mark of circumcision. In
      addition, non-Jews who were born without foreskins and also
      were considered disfigured according to Hellenistic and Roman
      values may have undergone Celsus operation for reconstruction
      of the prepuce.</p>
