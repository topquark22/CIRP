      a deformity that was an accident<br />
      of nature, but I can't accept<br />
      that someone did that to me."<sup><a

    <div class="corpus">
      <p align="justify">The two questions I dread most these days
      are "What kind of work do you do?" and "What is the title of
      your new book?" When I say that I lecture and write about
      foreskin restoration, usually to people who have never before
      heard of such a thing, their responses range from a puzzled
      look (like maybe they did not hear me right) to outright
      disdain (as though I must be some kind of a weirdo to believe
      that a human male should even care whether or not he has a
      foreskin).</p>

      <p align="justify">The disdain stems, no doubt, from the fact
      that we in the United States have come to recognize two
      "normal" styles of penis&mdash;circumcised and
      uncircumcised&mdash;and from the fact that a majority of
      parents are continuing to choose for their sons the more
      seemingly trouble-free, low-maintenance circumcised variety
      as opposed to the reputedly untidy, trouble-prone natural
      sort. Most Americans seem unaware that the worldwide picture
      is much different: <i>every other</i> nation that adopted
      routine infant male circumcision as a "health measure" early
      in the 20th century has moved away from the practice. Indeed,
      <i>ours is the only nation in the world that now circumcises
      a majority of its newborn males for nonreligious
      reasons.</i></p>

      <p align="justify">The historical picture differs as well. No
      matter what reasons have been given to substantiate routine
      male circumcision throughout the centuries, countless
      circumcised males have been unhappy about what was done to
      them&mdash;so much so that some have relentlessly sought, by
      whatever means were available to them at the time, to undo
      the effects of the circumcision they did not choose for
      themselves. Historical accounts of both the motives and the
      methods used for foreskin restoration form a fascinating
      chronicle.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>Ancient Customs</b></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">The origin of male circumcision is lost in
      antiquity. We know, however, that it was practiced by
      Egyptians long before the time of Abraham, the father of
      Judaism. Whatever its earlier significance may have been,
      male circumcision took on a distinct meaning with Abraham: it
      was accepted by him as the sign and seal of the covenant
      between God and God's chosen people. According to dictate,
      the practice was to be universal among all male members of
      the community; whether freemen or slaves. Furthermore, the
      rite was to be performed on the eighth day of life. Thus was
      born, for the first time in recorded history, <i>routine
      infant male circumcision</i>&mdash;a tradition tahta now
      spans approximately 4,000 years.</p>

      <p align="justify">Foreskin restoration, also known as
      <i>epispasm</i> or decircumcision, has been documented
      periodically for more than half of those 4,000 years. The
      earliest references, dating from about 200 BC, contain
      descriptions of several different "methods" adopted in
      response to the prevailing social and political
      climate.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p align="justify">Throughout the Hellenic period (323 to 30
      BC) ethnic groups were pressured to give up their individual
      traditions in favor of one grand, universal and enlightened
      culture. For the Jewish male, this mean forsaking among other
      cherished traditions, his unique sign and seal of the
      covenant. Additional measures imposed on the Jewish community
      included the Greeks' idealization of the natural male form,
      the levying of special taxes such as a "temple tax," and
      selective military call-ups of circumcised youths. Under such
      conditions, it was inevitable that some less devout Jewish
      males would seek the benefits of being part of the larger
      society and would therefore attempt to hid or disguise
      evidence of their circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p align="justify">The need to disguise his circumcision was
      especially critical for any young Jewish athlete who wished
      to compete in the Greek games. These games were played in the
      nude, and the slightest exposure of the glans penis was
      considered both immodest and immoral. Even a non-Jewish youth
      with a "deficient" foreskin was expected to tie or clamp it
      forward over his glans so as not to offend the
      spectators.</p>

      <p align="justify">Jewish athletes of the time were able to
      accomplish this feat because their circumcisions had removed
      only the typically protruding tip of the infant foreskin,
      leaving the inner lining of the infant foreskin attached to
      the glans&mdash;thus leaving themature male with a
      "miniforeskin" that could rather easily be drawn forward over
      the glans. (Not until about 140 <font size="1">AD</font>,
      after the Bar Kokba uprising, was the more radical procedure
      of "stripping bare the glans" added to the Jewish
      circumcision rite.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>) Due most
      likely to Jewish athletes who regularly secured their rather
      generous foreskin remmant forward over the glans, it was
      discovered that over time the foreskin itself elongated.
      Before long, foreskin restoration through "stretching" (or
      pulling) became a widespread practice.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p align="justify">Eventually the physician Celsus, whose
      writings date from the early Roman period (<font
      size="1">AD</font> 14 to 37), developed two surgical
      procedures for elongating or replicating the male
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The "laying bare of
      the glans" followed about 100 years later and was intended,
      according to Jewish historians, to put an end to foreskin
      restoration so that the sign of the covenant could not be
      undone. And if the historical record is any indication, the
      new, more radical circumcision succeeded in doing just
      that.</p>

      <p align="justify">Not until the Nazi regime of this century
      do significant references to foreskin restoration reappear.
      According to the literature, there were Polish doctors who
      devised hasty, crude surgical techniques to help Jews in
      occupied areas of Europe avoid detection.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Some of these procedures were
      surprisingly reminiscent of those described by Celsus nearly
      2000 years earlier. There is no evidence that any of these
      methods was continued after the collapse of the Nazi
      regime.</p>

        <p><b>Modern-Day Reversals</b></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">In the United States, male circumcision
      has been practiced as a medical procedure for more than 100
      years, and routine infant male circumcision has been
      practiced since early in this century. The first recording of
      contemporary elective foreskin restoration, however, did not
      appear until 1963, in an article by South African physician
      <a href="/library/restoration/penn1/">Jack Penn</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> His method featured a free-graft
      procedure utilizing skin taken from elsewhere on the body.
      Soon after his article gained attention in the United States,
      interested men in this country began pressuring their doctors
      to develop procedures for restoring the foreskin. Between
      1977 and 1990, several surgical methods were devised.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p align="justify">One of the simplest methods involved the
      implantation of a small platinum ring within the tip of the
      "foreskin." The ring held the skin in place over the glans,
      resulting in a "created phimosis" (meaning that the skin
      could not be retracted while the ring was in place). The hope
      was to generate enough new skin to permanently re-cover the
      glans after the ring was removed. As it turned out the skin
      was left was a fibrous, raised band where the platinum ring
      had been lodged and there was not enough skin to cover the
      glans.</p>

      <p align="justify">While reviewing the results of the
      implanted-ring procedure, an engineer living the Pacific
      Northwest hit upon the idea of using tape to hold the skin in
      place over the glans. His intent was to avoid both the
      surgery needed to have the platinum ring implanted and the
      unsightly fibrous band it left. This simple idea was
      circulated among a small network of men who had been sharing
      whatever information they could find on foreskin restoration
      as well as their ideas and experimentation. As a result, in
      1982, BUFF (Brothers United for Future Foreskins) was
      born.</p>

      <p align="justify">Descriptions of the <a
      href="http://www.eskimo.com/%7egburlin/restore/uncirc.txt">BUFF
      taping method</a> of foreskin restoration, in its various
      stages of development have been circulating since 1982,
      advancing a growing network of interest. My particular input
      has been to revise and update the duplicated material in
      1990, to estabish the UNCircumcising Information and
      Resources Centers (UNCIRC) in California in 1991, and to
      write the book <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</i> in 1992.
      Since then the book has been reviewed in <i>JAMA (The Journal
      of the American Medical Association),<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Plastic and Reconstructive
      Surgery,<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></i> and various
      men's movement publications such as <i>Journeyman</i><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> and <i>Mentor.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></i> The move from duplicated
      information sheets available through small, private centers
      to a book available in bookstores nationwide represents a
      major step forward in the distribution of information to
      circumcised men throughout the English-speaking world, where
      routine male circumcision has brought such pain and left so
      many wounds.</p>

      <p align="justify">In its present form, the non-surgical
      restoration procedure is divided into three stages. Stage I
      calls for the application of Band-Aid-like straps to hold the
      shaft skin as far as possible over the glans. In Stage II, a
      tape ring is wrapped around the bunched shaft skin held in
      front of the glans. In Stage III, which begins when the
      weight and bulk of the penis no longer provide sufficient
      traction for further expansion, a device is added to furnish
      the needed tension.</p>

      <p align="justify">Curiously enough, pioneers in plastic
      surgery "discovered" the phenomenon of tissue expansion and
      began applying it to human subjects in the late
      1970s&mdash;precisely when the small network of men began
      gathering information that led them to apply tape to the
      shaft skin in an effort to restore the foreskin. Within a few
      years, Dr. Charles Horton, of Norfolk, Virginia, was using
      surgically implanted expansion devices to perform foreskin
      restoration, basing his work on the priniciples of tissue
      expansion as developed by plastic surgeons and the
      nonsurgical "stretching" method of foreskin restoration
      employ traction to generate new skin cells and, thereby,
      create additional skin.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>The Desire for a Foreskin</b></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">Invariably, the questions that follows
      (after the laughter has died down) is, "Why would any man
      who's never had one want one?" The reasons given by men are
      diverse and, often, painfully personal. Some reasons,
      however, are rather common. Many circumcised men find that as
      they grow older the exposed glans of their penis becomes
      increasingly insensitive to sensual stimulation&mdash;due, no
      doubt, to years of exposure and frictional contact with
      clothing&mdash;and they want to experience more of the
      sensitivity associated with the naturally covered and
      protected mucous surface of the glans. In fact, regained
      sensitivity of the glans is the most frequently reported
      outcome of restoration and is typically experienced long
      before the program is completed.</p>

      <p align="justify">Other circumcised men, especially those
      bearing the "tidy, tight cut" favored by many physicians in
      the United States, complain that the shaft skin is pulled too
      tight during erections, often to the point of pain. Some of
      these men cannot engage in foreplay, much less intercourse,
      without using artificial lubrication. Men who find sexual
      activity uncomfortable due to the painfully distended skin of
      their penis frequently undertake a restoration program simply
      to gain enough skin to comfortably accommodate an erection,
      waiting until later to decide whether or not to completely
      re-cover the glans with a restored foreskin.</p>

      <p align="justify">A large number of men never feel whole
      after realizing that a part of their body has been cut off.
      Recognizing the importance of a positive body image, we as a
      culture assume that a woman who loses her breast will want
      (and need) breast reconstruction if it as at all possible. We
      would never dream of asking her why or , worse yet, "What
      good is a breast if it is not a <i>real</i> one?" We
      understand far too well her deep need to <i>feel</i> whole.
      On the other hand, because we believe that the penis with its
      foreskin amputated is "normal" and because we harbor the
      equally false notion that men are less sensitive about body
      image, rarely do we think twice about asking a man who wants
      to restore his foreskin, "Why would you want to do that? What
      good is a fake one anyway?" And surely, insurance companies
      are not going to pay to fix a "perfectly normal, healthy"
      penis.</p>

      <p align="justify">Unfortunately, the more information we as
      a society disseminate about the negative effects of infant
      circumcision, the more a circumcised man must face the extent
      to which his penis has been diminished.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> And the more we expose the medical
      and social myths used to justify infant circumcision, the
      more the circumcised man must face the fact that what was
      done to him was, in all probability, pointless.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> Is it any wonder that many of these
      men want back as much as can possibly be restored? "I feel I
      was raped in the operating room of <a
      href="http://www.tgh.org/" target="_blank">Tampa General
      Hospital</a>," writes one man, "and I want back what was
      mine."<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p align="justify">A fourth reason given for restoring
      foreskin is the need to regain a sense of body
      ownership&mdash;a birthright that was in most cases violated,
      if not annihilated, within the first hours of life. For many
      of these men, the availability of a means to reverse their
      circumcision, whether acted on or not, serves as catalyst to
      awaken long buried and denied feelings of rage and
      indignation. At the root of this reaction lies an awarness
      that a perfectly normal, healthy&mdash;indeed, the most
      sensually responsive&mdash;part of their body was surgically
      amputated when they were too young and helpless to consent,
      refuse, or resist. As one man puts it, "I'm restoring my
      foreskin because I was born with one, and damn it, I'm going
      to die with one."<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p align="justify">Thousands of men have requested the
      instructional materials or purchased the book to help them
      restore their foreskin nonsurgically, and an unknown number
      of men continue to seek surgical restoration. As a result, a
      growing number of men have by now regained a foreskin of
      sufficient length to fool even physicians performing routine
      physical examinations. Many of these men maintain that
      restoring their foreskin is "the best thing I have ever done
      for myself."</p>

      <p align="justify">The tragedy is that they should ever have
      needed to do such a thing for themselves, since, with rare
      exceptions, each one was born with a <i>perfectly good</i>
      foreskin on his penis and since, also with rare exception,
      each one was deprived of his basic human right to participate
      in the amputation decision. In this time of unparalleled
      emphasis on an individual's right of choice, can it be long
      before this fundamental right is extended to males in our
      country, regardless of their age?</p>
