      urethral stenting and preserve the prepuce</h2>

      <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>

      <p>To report the early outcome of &gt; 200 boys who underwent
      a glanular reconstruction and preputioplasty (GRAP) repair
      for distal hypospadias, to assess the functional and
      anatomical outcome of the penis at least 10 years after
      surgery, and to compare these data with otherwise 'normal'
      aged-matched controls.</p>

      <h4>PATIENTS AND METHODS</h4>

      <p>The GRAP repair is a novel method for the day-case
      reconstruction of distal hypospadias, and uniquely allows the
      anatomical reconstruction of the prepuce as part of penile
      reconstruction for hypospadias. We retrospectively reviewed
      the notes of 205 consecutive cases of distal hypospadias who
      had a GRAP repair carried out by one surgeon. Of these, there
      were 63 consecutive patients who had been repaired using the
      GRAP 10 years earlier. In these patients a questionnaire was
      used to assess their perception of the appearance of their
      penis, the urinary stream, any problems with the foreskin and
      their recollection of surgery. Similar questionnaire data,
      except for the latter, were obtained from aged-matched
      controls for comparison.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p>Of the 205 patients, 183 (89%) were day cases; the
      remaining 22 remained in hospital overnight for medical or
      social reasons. Sixteen (7%) developed a urethral fistula,
      the incidence of which correlated positively with the length
      of the repair. Four children (2%) were circumcised, in two
      for phimosis resulting in a spraying stream, in a third for
      dribbling after voiding, and the fourth for a cosmetically
      unsatisfactory foreskin. Questionnaire responses were
      received from 45 boys (71%), while 18 were untraceable. The
      mean (sd) age at surgery and at survey was 3.25 (2.6) and
      14.26 (2.8) years, respectively. Forty-two (95%) children
      felt their penis was normal or only slightly different in
      appearance, two (5%) felt it looked fairly different and only
      one mostly avoided communal situations because of this. On
      voiding three boys (7%) sprayed most of the time while the
      remainder either never or sometimes sprayed. One youth
      sometimes had to sit to void because of difficulties in
      directing the stream; the rest (98%) always stood to void.
      There were no further circumcisions. These results were not
      significantly different from those of the age-matched
      controls. Most children had no (68%) or only slight (30%)
      recollection of hypospadias surgery.</p>

      <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>

      <p>The complication rate and patient satisfaction with GRAP
      is comparable with those of other techniques. GRAP is a
      simple day-case procedure with few complications, thus
      avoiding an overnight hospital admission for most patients.
      Importantly, the prepuce can be preserved and refashioned to
      give a good cosmetic result, with no phimosis, which is
      increasingly important as circumcision becomes less
      acceptable to both the general public and the medical
      profession.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP NOTE: This file does not include the
      tables.]</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Any technique to repair distal hypospadias
      should be simple, easy, and result in satisfactory functional
      and cosmetic outcomes, with few complications.[<a
      href="#n1">1</a>] Many techniques have been described which
      relocate the urethral meatus and correct chordee. We
      previously described a technique, glanular reconstruction and
      preputioplasty (GRAP) for distal hypospadias that meets these
      criteria and is suitable for day-case surgery with no need
      for urinary diversion. <span class="yellow">In addition, the
      unique advantage of the GRAP technique is that it preserves
      and improves the appearance of the foreskin, both of which we
      consider worthwhile goals.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">We report the short-term outcome of &gt; 200
      consecutive children who have had a GRAP repair by one
      surgeon (V.E.B.) for distal hypospadias. To investigate the
      long-term results, in particular the patient's perception of
      the success or failure of the procedure, we surveyed a group
      whose hypospadias was repaired &gt; 10 years previously. The
      significance of these functional and anatomical outcomes of
      the penis in these patients was compared with a group of
      age-matched controls.</p>

      <h4>Patients and Methods</h4>

      <p class="text1">Hospital patient-management systems were
      used to identify all boys undergoing a GRAP procedure by a
      one surgeon (V.E.B.). The degree of hypospadias was
      semi-quantified in most cases as a percentage of the total
      penile length compared with the distance from the tip of the
      glans penis to the meatus. Thus, glandular hypospadias is
      equivalent to 0-10%, coronal 10-20%, distal subcoronal 20-30%
      and proximal subcoronal 30-50%. Nine children with distal
      hypospadias were not classified and excluded from further
      study. The surgical technique used and peri-operative care
      were as previously described.[<a href="#n2">2</a>] All
      children were reviewed after surgery, typically at 3-6 months
      when the short-term outcomes, e.g. the character of the
      urinary stream, the presence of chordee, meatal stenosis,
      phimosis or fistula, were assessed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Long-term outcomes and patient satisfaction
      were assessed using a questionnaire that was sent to a
      consecutive cohort of patients who had undergone surgery
      <u>&gt;</u> 10 years previously. A section for other comments
      was included, so that patients could comment on anything
      important to them that had not been specifically requested.
      Clarification of response data was obtained by telephone in
      some cases. No patient was examined clinically. To assess the
      significance of these data, similar information was collected
      from aged-matched boys who had undergone appendicectomy and
      who were used as controls.</p>

      <p class="text2">The chi-squared test with or without Yates'
      correction was used in assessing fistulae in the full cohort.
      The results from the questionnaires were analysed using
      Fisher's exact probability test and the chi-squared test.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text1">In all, 214 consecutive children with distal
      hypospadias were identified who had had a GRAP repair, of
      whom 205 were suitable for further study. The position of the
      urethral meatus in these children is summarized in Table 1.
      While some children were admitted before surgery for social
      reasons, most operations, i.e. in 183 patients (89%), were
      undertaken as day cases.</p>

      <p class="text2">Problems immediately after surgery were
      rare; seven children (3.4%) were admitted overnight with
      medical problems. Of these boys, two had difficulty in
      voiding, one of whom required catheter drainage of the
      bladder. Two patients with uncontrolled pain required
      analgesia, two had significant nausea and vomiting, and one
      had a penile haematoma. Fifteen children (7.3%) stayed for
      one night after repair, with no clearly documented clinical
      indication.</p>

      <p class="text2">A fistula occurred in 15 patients (7%); of
      these, one is known to have healed spontaneously, eight have
      been corrected surgically on a day-case basis and one fistula
      was not initially recognized but reported at the 10-year
      follow-up. The last patient declined any further
      intervention. Of the remaining five boys, one was lost to
      review and the others have either had, or are awaiting,
      surgical repair of the fistula. There was a significant
      positive relationship between the length of the urethral
      repair and the incidence of fistulae (<i>P</i> = 0.004; Table
      2. For the longer repairs the relative risk was up to 3.2. No
      child re-presented to the regional paediatric service with
      stenosis of the urethroplasty requiring dilatation.</p>

      <p class="text2">At the review soon after repair the urinary
      stream was satisfactory in all but four children. Of these,
      one had postvoid dribbling caused by redundant foreskin and
      phimosis, two reported spraying and had phimosis. All three
      of these were treated by circumcision. The fourth child was
      noted at review to have a stream that 'was occasionally
      directed backwards' but no treatment has yet been
      undertaken.</p>

      <p class="text2">Only two children were thought to have an
      unsatisfactory appearance at the early review, caused by the
      typical hypospadiac deformity of the preputial skin. One was
      circumcised while the other was managed expectantly.
      Therefore, 201 (98%) preputioplasties were considered
      satisfactory both in terms of function and appearance.</p>

      <p class="text2">In eight boys chordee was noted after
      repair; four of these were considered minor and no surgery is
      planned. In three others this was corrected using a
      Z-plasty.</p>

      <p class="text2">In all, 63 patients were repaired 10 years
      ago; of these, six could not be traced to a current address,
      either by hospital notes or via a family doctor. Forty-five
      replies (71%) were obtained, either in response to the postal
      questionnaire or by telephone for those who initially did not
      respond. One questionaire was only partially completed, by a
      child with learning difficulties. Another was returned
      unanswered by a mother who did not want her son to know he
      had undergone surgery. The results are shown in Table 3; the
      mean (range) age of those who replied is now 14.3
      (10.25-20.75) years and the mean age at surgery was 3.25
      (1-11) years.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thirty-six boys (82%) thought the appearance
      of their penis was normal, six (14%) that it was slightly
      different and two (5%) that it was fairly different; none
      felt it was very different. Urine spraying (going in more
      than one direction) was reported never to occur in 21 (49%),
      sometimes in 19 (44%) and most times in three (7%) boys; none
      reported always spraying. They were also asked, if because of
      the spraying, they ever sat to pass urine; 42 (98%) said this
      was never the case and only one (2%) said this was sometimes
      the case. Only one boy (2%), as noted at the early review,
      had required circumcision to improve the cosmetic appearance.
      Forty-three boys (98%) had no fistula; one man (2%) had a
      fistula (distal) but which caused no problems and he declined
      further surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">The boys were also asked if they would try
      to avoid certain situations, e.g. communal showers, because
      of the appearance of their penis; 40 (93%) said this was
      never the case, two (5%) and one (2%), said, respectively,
      that this was sometimes and mostly the case. No child always
      avoided communal situations.</p>

      <p class="text2">There was no statistical difference between
      these patients and the controls on any of the variables
      (Table 3). Thirty boys (68%) did not remember the operation
      at all, 13 (30%) remembered it a little bit and only one (2%)
      claimed to remember it very clearly.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">The repair of distal hypospadias with
      urinary diversion is thought necessary by some [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>]. The data from the present 205 patients
      confirms that most can be treated with low morbidity, with no
      urinary diversion, by a day-case procedure. The incidence of
      complications was low, with only 1% being re-admitted, and
      only one (0.5%) requiring a catheter. This clearly
      facilitates day-case surgery and lessens the distress to the
      child. Only a few children will require an inpatient stay,
      but this is most commonly for social reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">The fistula rate of 7% with GRAP is
      comparable with that from other techniques (1.4-13%), being
      highest for more proximal disease (17.4%) [<a
      href="#n4">4,5</a>]. However, considering that fistulae are
      repaired as a day-case, this increased risk is more than
      justified for most boys, who will only require one day-case
      procedure, even when the position of the urethral meatus is
      up to half of the penile length from its normal position.
      Significant stenosis, either proximal or distal, has not been
      reported with GRAP but does occur with other techniques.[<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Many authors report a short-term follow-up
      or judge the outcome based on reports from parents or the
      attending physician rather than the patient [<a
      href="#n6">6,7</a>]. We think that a satisfactory outcome
      from the surgical repair of distal hypospadias cannot be
      judged by anyone other than the patient. Also,
      dissatisfaction with the functional status or anatomical
      appearance of the penis may only become apparent long after
      the procedure to correct hypospadias [<a href="#n6">6</a>].
      Longitudinal data on functional and anatomical outcome, as
      well as patients' perceptions 10 years after surgery, are
      therefore important; the present questionnaire focused on
      these topics.</p>

      <p class="text2">The results suggest that the long-term
      function and appearance of the penis after GRAP repair for
      distal hypospadias are not significantly different from that
      in age-matched controls. Particularly the risk of iatrogenic
      phimosis is no greater than in the normal population [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Early repair is clearly advantageous, with
      97% of respondents having no or little recollection of their
      operation, while only one patient clearly remembered it. Our
      current policy is to operate on these boys as near to their
      first birthday as possible. This will hopefully reduce the
      risk of any adverse memories of the event.</p>

      <p class="text2">In conclusion, these results confirm that
      GRAP is an appropriate and safe method for repairing distal
      hypospadias, compared with other techniques. It has the major
      advantages of facilitating day-case treatment with no
      stenting of the urethroplasty. In addition, it preserves the
      prepuce, that looks and functions normally compared with
      age-matched controls. While circumcision is necessary in a
      few patients, for either phimosis or unusual appearance, the
      risk of this being required is no greater than with the
      normal population. <span class="yellow">This is likely to
      become more important in the future because circumcision is
      becoming less acceptable to both the general public and the
      medical profession.</span> From these results we recommend
      the GRAP repair for all boys with distal hypospadias.</p>
