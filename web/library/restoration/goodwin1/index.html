        <blockquote>
          A simple technique is described for plastic
          reconstruction of the prepuce. Penile skin is used and
          the defect created is covered by implantation of the
          penis into the scrotum. At a second stage the penis is
          released from the scrotum. (<i>J. Urol., 144: 1203-1205,

      <p class="text2">Since the topic of circumcision continues to
      be controversial, the present status has been neatly
      summarized by Hinman<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> as well as others, including
      the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on
      Circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup></font> However, there is a small
      group of circumcised men who would like to regain a prepuce.
      A simple reliable operation is described for reconstruction
      of a foreskin. Penile skin is used to reproduce a prepuce
      after circumcision. Anterior scrotal skin, which by its
      elastic nature, coloring and appearance is an ideal
      substitute for needed extra penile skin, is used as a readily
      available in situ skin graft.</p>

      <center>
        MATERIALS AND METHODS
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The distal penile skin is mobilized is such
      a way as to be pulled down in a double layer to form a new
      prepuce. This is done by making a superficial circumferential
      incision around the base of the penis (part <i>A</i> of
      figure). The incision should not be so deep as to destroy
      important blood supply. The distal portion of the penile skin
      to be used for the new prepuce is identified. Stay sutures
      are placed to pull the skin down to cover the glans (part
      <i>B</i> of figure). Once these relationships are established
      3 or 4 small transverse incisions are made in what wil be the
      leading edge of the new foreskin. Then by careful dissection
      with scissors the entire skin around the head of the penis up
      to the glans is mobilized. Further mobilization of the skin
      is done by blunt scissor dissection in the immediate
      subcutaneous area on the proximal portion of the penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">This allows the distal penile skin,
      including the the remaining mucosal type of skin, to be
      pulled downward over the head of the penis. The transverse
      incisions are closed in a vertical fashion, thus narrowing
      the circumference of the new prepuce, which has become like a
      small hood covering the glans. Traction sutures should be
      placed on each side to ensure post operative tension and keep
      this new double layer approximated during the immediate
      postoperative period while the 2 inner layers grow together
      (part <i>B</i> of figure).</p>

      <p class="text2">This procedure leaves a defect of skin at
      the base of the penis. This denuded area is covered easily
      with scrotal skin. Two transverse incisions are made in the
      anterior scrotum and a shallow tunnel is created close to the
      scrotal skin between the two incisions. The penis then is
      pulled under the scrotal bridge and the skin edges are
      anastomosed. This method leaves the base of the penis buried
      in the scrotum (part <i>C</i> of figure) where the scrotal
      skin covers the denuded area.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> A catheter should be used and
      traction or adhesive binding to fix the new prepuce downward
      over the glans must be used for 5 or 6 days
      postoperatively.</p>

      <p class="text2">After approximately 3 months stage 2 is
      accomplished by lifting the penis out of the scrotum as
      described previously.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> It is noteworthy that at stage
      2 incisions should be made in a Z form on each side to
      provide plenty of scrotal skin for closure of on the ventral
      side of penis. This method prevents a vertical scar (Part
      <i>D</i> of figure).</p>

      <p class="text2">The procedure is remarkably simple. Patients
      do experience significant edema and postoperative discomfort,
      and attention mut be directed to prevention of erections
      until the distal skin has grown together. <a
      href="/library/restoration/rubin/">Rubin</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> described a
      similar operation by <a
      href="/library/restoration/penn1/">Penn</a> who used a skin
      graft instead of scrotum to cover the defect.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> The scrotum is
      an adjacent graft with good blood supply, and it appears much
      more normal and accommodating than a skin graft from
      elsewhere on the body.</p>

          small transverse incisions are made to free up skin that
          is to become new prepuce. <i>B</i>, penile skin is pulled

        DISCUSSION
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The idea for this technique originated from
      reconstruction of penile skin<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> and experience with
      phalloplasty.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> Later it was learned that the
      method is a modification of an ancient operation described by
      Celsus, who wrote during the reign of Tiberius in AD 14 to
      37. He described 2 such operations. Apparently, it was not
      then infrequent to undergo the operation for he patient to
      move "inconspiciously in Greek and Roman society." Anyone
      wishing to understand this historical note further (although
      this operation may seem to be strange in our times) should
      refer to the history as reported by <a
      href="/library/restoration/rubin/">Rubin</a>, who described
      problems of ancient times, especially as they concerned Jews
      and gladiators.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> This classical article not only
      is well referenced but well illustrated to show the technique
      used in those times. The operation described in the current
      article is similar but, since it is done in two stages, it
      may be somewhat less brutal.</p>

      <p class="text2">Further notes on historical aspects of this
      problem are presented in the chapter on history of external
      genital surgery by Rogers.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></font> Writing of Roman medicine and
      surgery, he stated:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 B.C. to A.D.
          50) was without a doubt the first great Roman physician.
          His work, <i>De Medicina</i>, was a vast encylopedia of
          medical and surgical knowledge that he had probably
          acquired both from his Greek and Egyptian predecessors as
          well as from earlier Roman medicine and surgery, although
          the last had been somewhat primitive and
          unremarkable.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Psychiatric considerations are considerable
      and have been reviewed by Mohl and associates.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">There are other methods to perform this
      operation. Some patients have elongated the penile skin by
      long-term traction, using adhesive tapes to pull the skin
      down and keep it tight over the glans. In Roman times this
      was done by what they called "infibulation," in which a
      fibula was placed across the distal preputial skin and
      traction was applied.</p>

      <p class="text2">One patient presented with a dorsal slit
      because of an acute infection during childhood. All of the
      normal preputial skin was still present and the patient
      wished the skin restored to a normal appearance. An inverted
      V-shaped incision was made where the dorsal slit had been and
      the two edges were sutured together, thus, reproducing the
      normal prepuce. <span class="yellow">The patient was
      delighted with the results.</span> It could be that this
      might be an answer to some critics of circumcision. A simple
      dorsal slit can be performed in patients who have phimosis or
      severe recurrent infections. At a later date, if they wished
      restoration, reconstruction to the uncircumcised appearance
      would be simple.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">One patient had
      successfully used traction and "stretching" for a long
      period, which produced a nearly normal-appearing prepuce even
      though he had been circumcised.</span> Possibly, the same
      result could be obtained by using 1 of the inflatable
      expanding devices that plastic surgeons currently are using
      to obtain extra skin. This could be a good means to expand
      area that is to become the new prepuce. <span
      class="yellow">Skin can, indeed be stretched. Of course,
      penile and scrotal skin is especially notable for
      elasticity.</span> All men who experience erections are aware
      of this elasticity and accommodation to natural
      pressures.</p>
