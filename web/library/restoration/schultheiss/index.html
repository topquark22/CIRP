              history, demands for restoration of the prepuce after
              circumcision were most commonly related to the
              political or religious persecution of the Jewish
              people. The first evidence for such a procedure is
              mentioned in the Bible: Under the reign of Antiochus
              IV (168 BC) Hellenistic ideals, such as public
              nakedness at athletic games or in public baths,
              emerged in Judea and forced Jews to stretch their
              shortened foreskins with a special weight, the
              <i>Pondus Judaeus,</i> to cover the glans (I.
              Maccabees 1). Similar efforts are reported in the
              Talmud during the time of Hadrian (132
              AD).</b></font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="+0"><b>Celsus (25
              BC-50 AD) was the first to give a detailed
              description of two surgical techniques for
              uncircumcision in his <i>De medicina libri octo.</i>
              Subsequent works, for example by Galen (131-200 AD)
              and Paulus Aeginata in the seventh century, only
              contained a repetition of these methods without
              presenting any new aspects.</b></font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="+0"><b>Ambroise
              Par&eacute; gave a new impetus in the sixteenth
              century, suggesting the insertion of a catheter into
              the distal urethra to guarantee free passage of urine
              during postoperative healing. In this past century,
              Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach was the first to
              dedicate a whole chapter to the problem of
              "posthioplastice" in a modern textbook of plastic
              surgery.</b></font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="+0"><b>Almost no
              written documents exist of uncircumcision during the
              Nazi era; nevertheless, surgical treatment seemed to
              be widespread as every circumcised man was in danger
              of being denounced as a Jew. Personal reports of
              patients and doctors performing surgical restoration
              of the prepuce are presented.</b></font></p>

              <p align="justify">Circumcision has been widespread
              since the beginning of civilization and was reported
              in the medical literature of the earliest cultures.
              It is not surprising, therefore, that the first
              illustration of a surgical procedure, a bas-relief
              from a tomb in Sakkara (Egypt; about 2200 BC),
              depicted a circumcision scene.)<a
              href="#n1">1</a></p>

              <p align="justify">In most cases, this procedure was
              performed with a ritual or religious intention, e.g.,
              as a sacrificial act for a god or as a token of the
              "covenant" as in Jewish religion. Furthermore,
              hygienic and medical reasons were of importance at
              all times. In ancient days, circumcision or even more
              extensive mutilation of the external genitalia was
              carried out on defeated enemies, captives, or slaves
              as a sign of subjugation.<a href="#n2">2</a>,<a
              href="#n3">3</a></p>

              <p align="justify">The demand for surgical or
              nonsurgical restoration of the prepuce after
              circumcision, the so-called uncircumcision, was
              usually associated with the persecution of the Jewish
              people. This association is documented from the times
              of the Old Testament until the darkest period of our
              century.</p>

              <p align="justify">By some authors, the procedure of
              restoring the lost or missing foreskin was called
              decircumcision (e.g., Celsus) or posthioplasty (e.g.,
              Dieffenbach). Because these terms were partly used
              for the same operative technique, there is no uniform
              definition for them; therefore, they are more or less
              exchangeable.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p align="center">FIRST WRITTEN EVIDENCE FOR
              RESTORING THE PREPUCE</p>

              <p align="justify">The first sign of evidence for
              uncircumcision among the Jews can be seen in a
              passage of the Old Testament (I Maccabees 1: 14-15):
              "Whereupon they built a place of exercise at
              Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen.
              And made themselves uncircumcised (sibi praeputia
              fecerunt), and forsook the holy covenant, and joined
              themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do
              mischief."<a href="#n4">4</a>,<a href="#n5">5</a>
              This passage was written at the time of the reign of
              Antiochus IV (168 BC), when the hellenization of
              Palestine and, therefore, the oppression of the
              Jewish religion and culture came to a first climax.
              Hellenistic ideals gained popularity, and it was, for
              example, common to exhibit the naked body at athletic
              games or at public baths. Jews were forced to hide
              their genitalia or restore their prepuces, so as not
              to be persecuted and to improve their social and
              economic position. This situation culminated in a law
              by Antiochius dictating that the act of circumcision
              was to be punished by death sentence (I Maccabees
              1:63-64).</p>

              <p align="justify">The restoration of the prepuce was
              either done operatively, as it will be described
              below, or bloodlessly with the help of the so-called
              <i>Pondus Judaeus.</i> Both methods took advantage of
              the common way of symbolic circumcision among Jews at
              that time, the <i>milah.</i> Only the distal part of
              the foreskin was cut off, leaving a short prepuce
              that partly covered the glans. The <i>Pondus
              Judaeus</i> was a special weight made of bronze,
              copper, or leather, which was fixed to this
              rudimentary preputial skin and pulled it downward.
              When it was applied for a longer period, the foreskin
              was lengthened and covered the glans totally as
              desired.<a href="#n3">3,</a><a href="#n6">6,</a><a
              href="#n7">7</a> This device could, therefore, be
              referred to as an ancient tissue expander, rather a
              tissue stretcher, keeping in mind that similar
              methods for uncircumcision are still offered in our
              days. Unfortunately, no detailed description or
              illustration of such a Jewish weight exists.</p>

              <p align="justify">The successful Jewish revolt
              against Antiochus IV in 141 BC led to the
              establishment of the Hasmonean or Maccabean reign in
              Judea, making uncircumcision unnecessary for the
              following period. Later in 63 BC, the Romans took
              over the supreme authority and, together with the
              rise of Christianity, a new desire for hiding the
              state of circumcision appeared. Obviously, many Jews
              who converted to the Christian religion underwent
              uncircumcision to emphasize the break with their old
              religion and to be fully accepted in the Christian
              community. The Apostle Paul condemned this practice
              by saying: "Is any called being circumcised? Let him
              not be uncircumcised. Is any called being
              uncircumcised, let him not be circumcised" (I
              Corinthians 7:18).</p>

              <p align="justify">The Roman tolerance toward
              circumcision among Jews came to an end with the
              hellenophilic emperor Hadrian, who was proclaimed
              emperor in 117 AD and once again urged a law
              forbidding circumcision. The Talmud gives proof that
              during his reign many of the circumcised turned to
              uncircumcision for obvious reasons.<a
              href="#n8">8</a> This habit was rejected by orthodox
              Jews and, therefore, after the law against
              circumcision was loosened again about 140 AD, they
              introduced radical circumcision to the Jewish
              community, the so-called <i>periah.</i> It left the
              glans totally uncovered and made it almost impossible
              to perform the above-mentioned methods of restoring
              the prepuce.<a href="#n3">3,</a><a
              href="#n7">7</a></p>

              <p align="justify">In Greek terminology, a person who
              had undergone the procedure of stretching the prepuce
              was known as <i>epispastik&oacute;s,</i> the
              stretched one (epispasm&oacute;s = pull-over).
              Similarly, the Romans addressed him as
              <i>recutitio,</i> the reskinned (cutis = skin), not
              differentiating by this term whether it was done
              surgically or nonsurgically.<a href="#n3">3</a></p>

              <p align="justify">Uncircumcision is also mentioned
              in Roman poetry of the first century. Petronius (died
              66 AD) in <i>Trimalchio's Dinner</i> from his work
              <i>Saturae</i> told us of a slave who had "two
              defects, without which he would be priceless: he is
              reskinned and he snores (recutitus est et
              stertit)."<a href="#n3">3</a></p>

              <p align="justify">In one of his epigrams
              (Epigrammaton Libri 7:30) Marcus Valerius Martialis
              (38/41-100 AD) portrayed a Roman prostitute named
              Caelia.<a href="#n3">3-</a><a href="#n5">5</a> She
              was never pleased by a Roman man but preferred to
              make love to Parthians, Germans, Dacians, Cilicians,
              Cappadocians, Egyptians, and Indians.<a
              href="#n3">3-</a><a href="#n5">5</a> This list is
              continued with the passage, "Nor do you shun the
              reskinned Jewish private parts (recutitorum inguina
              Judaeorum)." Martial also mentioned the <i>Pondus
              Judaeus</i> and gave a short description of it
              (Epigrammaton Libri 7:35).</p>

              UNCIRCUMCISION</p>

              <p align="justify">The first detailed description of
              an operative procedure for uncircumcision was given
              by the Roman medical writer Aulus Cornelius Celsus
              (25 BC-50 AD), seen on a later portrait in Figure 1.
              His comprehensive encyclopedic work <i>De medicina
              libri octo</i> was written during the reign of
              Tiberius (14-37 AD). It can be valued as the most
              important written document in the early history of
              medicine, which was not questioned until the
              scientific innovations of the Renaissance established
              modern medicine. In <i>De medicina</i> 7:25:1 he
              differentiated between two methods of prepuce
              reconstruction, which he referred to as
              "decircumcision."<a href="#n9">9</a></p>

              <p align="justify">The first procedure he recommended
              mainly for children or for those with a congenitally
              shortened foreskin (Fig. 2). The skin of the penis
              was incised around the root and after mobilization,
              stretched over the glans. Ligation at the tip
              prevented any recession into the original position.
              Thus a physiologic double-layered prepuce was
              reconstructed, and the proximal skin impairment was
              reepithelialized during the course of the healing
              process.</p>

              <i>(qui quarundam gentium more circumcisus est),</i>
              mainly the Jewish <i>milah,</i> Celsus suggested the
              second method. A coronary incision was made, and the
              penile skin was mobilized along the whole length of
              the penis to the root (Fig. 3, <i>above).</i> The
              skin was thus stretched over the glans and recession
              was now prevented by means of a bandage fixed
              securely over the penile shaft from the pubis to the
              glans (Fig. 3, <i>below).</i> Only a single layer of
              skin was obtained over the glans, and adhesion was

              unlikely that he never experienced severe wound
              infection performing this kind of genital surgery and
              not knowing the principles of asepsis. Furthermore,
              both methods suggest a significant risk of
              postoperative failure, as, e.g., Dieffenbach pointed
              out in his comment on Celsus work.<a
              href="#n10">10</a> When the new prepuce is not
              permanently tightened at its tip, retraction of the
              scars may pull the skin backward with the glans
              remaining uncovered again. A simple dressing might
              not be able to prevent this effect until wound
              healing is completed.<a href="#n6">6</a></p>

              <p align="justify">The founder of modern plastic
              surgery, Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1795-1847,
              Berlin, see Fig. 6), dedicated a whole chapter in
              both of his surgical textbooks, from 1829 and 1845,<a
              href="#n10">10</a> on the problem of how to restore
              the prepuce. He entitled this operation
              "posthioplastice". After recapitulating Celsus
              methods, he offered technical improvements to prevent
              postoperative failure. In the first method of Celsus,
              for example, he suggested a distal narrowing of the
              new prepuce to avoid retraction over the glans. This
              method could be done by triangular excision of skin
              or by fixation of a metal clamp at the preputial tip.
              Dieffenbach quoted Celsus indications for
              posthioplastice such as "luxury, religion, shame or
              politics". On the other hand, he called it "a
              disgrace to the medical profession to perform it with
              the intention of creating a male virgin, comparable
              to the surgical restoration of a new hymen in women."
              He additionally described the closure of the divided
              prepuce in hypospadias and reconstruction in a
              totally cicatrized inner foreskin layer after
              balanitis. In the second case, he made a circular
              incision at the tip of the foreskin retracting the
              penile skin back to the shaft. The remaining inner
              layer of the prepuce cicatrized to the glans was then
              separated with the scalpel. Finally, the penile skin
              had to be inverted and kept in this position by
              sutures with the former outer layer now becoming the
              inner layer of the new prepuce.<a

              ERA</p>

              <p align="justify">The persecution of Jews under the
              Nazi regime made the state of being circumcised a
              life-threatening fact, making no difference whether
              the person had lost his foreskin for religious
              reasons or because of a congenital or acquired
              phimosis. So every circumcised man at that time was
              in danger of being denounced and, therefore, had to
              hide his genital state or have it uncircumcised. No
              description of a surgical technique can be found in
              the official medical literature of this time, but
              there exist several personal reports of patients
              undergoing and doctors performing uncircumcision
              during this time. One example is the work of
              Tenenbaum who knew several of these doctors and also
              examined some of the patients treated.<a
              href="#n17">17</a></p>

              <p align="justify">From the memoirs of Jonas Turkow,
              a famous actor at that time, we hear the story of his
              nephew being uncircumcised twice without success. He
              pointed out that several "Aryan doctors" made a good
              living from this procedure by asking large sums of
              money for the treatment.<a href="#n18">18</a></p>

              <p align="justify">Feriz performed several operations
              on circumcised patients in occupied Holland. After a
              circumferential incision at the base of the penis the
              penile skin was pulled over the glans, forming the
              new prepuce. The proximal skin defect was then
              covered by burying the penis under a tunnel of
              ventral scrotal skin. In a second stage operation
              about 10 days later he mobilized the penis and closed
              the new skin layer at the underside of the penis. The
              scrotal defect was easily closed in all cases. In his
              publication from 1962, Feriz reported no
              complications, and all of his patients were satisfied
              with the postoperative result; none of them requested
              a reversal of the surgery after the war.<a
              href="#n19">19</a></p>

              <p align="justify">In 1965, <a
              href="/library/restoration/tushmet1/">Tushnet</a>
              reported three different procedures to restore the
              prepuce depending on the age of the patient, the
              remaining preputial skin, and the skill of the
              surgeon.<a href="#n6">6</a> These facts were also
              investigated by interviewing patients and doctors who
              remained unnamed. The first and crudest method was to
              pull forward the penile skin over the glans, scarify
              the new prepuce edges, and avoid recession by
              suturing them together, thus producing a phimosis.
              This implied a high failure rate because the sutures
              were often extruded and the skin was retracted to the
              former position. The second method was quite similar
              to the second procedure of Celsus, resulting in a
              single-layered new prepuce. The main disadvantage of
              this way of foreskin restoration was the high
              infection rate. Finally, the last and most
              sophisticated method was performed by using a skin
              graft from the area over the iliac crest serving as
              the new prepuce.</p>

              <p align="center">MOTIVATION FOR PREPUCE RESTORATION
              IN OUR DAYS</p>

              <p align="justify">During the past 30 years, a new
              movement of foreskin restoration has emerged mainly
              in the United States not originating from social,
              religious, or political demands. With routine male
              infant circumcision being established in America,
              more and more adult circumcised males are disturbed
              by the fact that the shape of their body had been
              altered after birth. Their main complaint is the loss
              of function; the prepuce is not just seen as a part
              of the human skin but referred to as a sensory organ
              of the body.<a href="#n20">20</a> Circumcision
              results in a lack of this organ and furthermore in a
              decrease of lubrication and sensibility of the glans
              because of increasing keratinization of the
              epithelium. That is why many circumcised men feel
              that their sexual pleasures are reduced. Others are
              more disturbed by the outer appearance of their
              circumcised penis and want to regain the natural
              status of a covered glans for physical and emotional
              wholeness and aesthetic body imaging. A minority is
              additionally irritated by the imagination that they
              had been mutilated as an infant without the chance to
              have a free choice of their genital status. A high
              percentage of these patients even resent their
              parents, doctors, or culture for their
              circumcision.<a href="#n7">7,</a><a
              href="#n21">21,</a><a href="#n22">22</a></p>

              <p align="justify">On the one hand, this development
              has led to the organization of several movements
              against routine circumcision in America. <a
              href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a> (National
              Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
              Centers) and <a target="_blank"
              href="http://www.noharmm.org/">NOHARMM</a> (National
              Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation
              of Males) were founded by "circumcision victims".
              Others were initiated by doctors or nurses who did no
              longer agree with the general attitude toward infant

              and Nurses for the Rights of the Child. Furthermore,
              <a href="http://www.norm.org/">NORM</a> (National
              Organization of Restoring Man) provides information,
              literature, and material about nonsurgical and
              surgical methods of foreskin restoration. Most of
              these organizations have spread to other continents
              and are easily accessible by means of the Internet
              (see Internet references<a href="#n23">23</a>).</p>

              <p align="justify">The first report of uncircumcision
              for psychological reasons was reported by <a
              href="/library/restoration/penn1/">Penn</a> in
              1963.<a href="#n24">24</a> This article and the ones
              of the following years failed to give detailed
              information on the patient's motivation, and the
              authors were to a certain extent criticized for
              performing such a procedure at all.<a
              href="#n25">25</a></p>

              <p align="justify">In 1981, Mohl presented the first
              detailed analysis of psychiatric aspects in a group
              of eight patients seeking prepuce restoration.<a
              href="#n26">26</a> He described several psychological
              disorders in these patients as narcissistic and
              exhibitionistic body image, depressions, major
              defects in early mothering, and ego pathology.
              Uncircumcision is compared with the request for
              augmentation mammoplasty in women. One of the main
              arguments of the modern uncircumcision movement, the
              loss of prepuce function in sexual activity, is not
              mentioned at all. Furthermore, all of the patients
              were currently or had in the past been exclusively
              homosexual.</p>

              <p align="justify">Nowadays the understanding of the
              psychological motivations for uncircumcision is
              increasing, and the problem is dealt with more
              seriously. Actually, it is no longer only a matter of
              the homosexual community because the majority of the
              males performing skin-stretching is heterosexual.<a

              <p align="center">MODERN TECHNIQUES OF
              UNCIRCUMCISION</p>

              <p><i><b>Skin Expansion</b></i></p>

              <p align="justify">Despite the antique reports on the
              <i>Pondus Judaeus,</i> modern techniques of
              stretching penile skin have become famous only as
              lately as in the 1980s.<a href="#n7">7</a> Today,
              foreskin-stretching is estimated to be performed by
              over 10,000 individuals in the United States for the
              above-mentioned reasons.<a href="#n27">27</a> All
              methods depend on some kind of tape that is attached
              to the skin. The best overview with detailed
              instructions for skin-expansion is given in the work
              of Bigelow.<a href="#n7">7</a></p>

              <p align="justify">The easiest way to start with is
              to pull the residual foreskin or the skin of the
              penile shaft over the glans as far as possible. The
              skin is fixed in this position by one or two tape
              straps that run from one side of the stretched penile
              skin over the tip of the glans to the other side of
              the shaft. If there is enough foreskin to cover the
              whole glans it is also possible to apply a tape ring
              around the distal skin of the new prepuce that makes
              it impossible to retract. The tape is either changed
              daily or in most cases left until it gets off the
              skin. In these simple methods simple pressure from
              the glans will start stretching the skin.</p>

              <p align="justify">After sufficient skin has been
              obtained some kind of extension device can be
              attached to it to get more tension on the tissue. A
              simple weight might be fixed to the tape stretching
              by gravity but only works when the patient is in a
              standing position. Alternatively a stretched elastic
              strap is attached to the back of a garter belt under
              the knee or at the waist to perform permanent
              tension. Finally rubber cones in graduating sizes can
              be worn within the foreskin which is held in position
              by a tape ring.</p>

              <p align="justify">The skin-expansion method is very
              time consuming. The period to regain a prepuce varies
              from about half a year to several years and depends
              on how much skin was left after circumcision, how
              persistently one is stretching, and what length of
              the new prepuce is desired. The problems of skin
              irritation through the tape can be diminished by
              correct hygiene and technique.</p>

              <p align="justify">The natural narrowing of the tip
              of the prepuce, the so-called frenar band, can be
              additionally reconstructed by minor plastic surgery,
              e.g., tissue-removal techniques, transverse incision
              with vertical suturing or a circumferential
              purse-string suture.</p>

              <p><i><b>Surgical reconstruction</b></i></p>

              <p align="justify">The very first case report in
              modern medical literature about foreskin
              reconstruction was published in 1898.<a
              href="#n28">28</a> Mercier from Canada only performed
              construction of the frenulum and narrowing of the
              "new" foreskin in a patient 2 years after moderate
              circumcision that left enough skin at the penile
              shaft to cover the glans.</p>

              <p align="justify">Several surgical procedures
              practiced during the Nazi era have been reported
              above.</p>

              <p align="justify">In 1963 <a
              href="/library/restoration/penn1/">Penn</a> from
              Johannesburg, after performing a proximal circular
              incision and pulling forward the penile skin to form
              a new prepuce, covered the denuded shaft with a "free
              graft", not indicating from where he took this
              graft.<a href="#n24">24</a></p>

              <p align="justify"><a
              href="/library/restoration/goodwin1/">Goodwin</a><a
              href="#n29">29</a> covered the same defect in 1990 by
              implantation of the penis into the scrotum first and
              then liberating it in a second stage. This procedure
              is almost identical to the method of Feriz mentioned
              earlier<a href="#n19">19</a> and had been slightly
              modified before by <a
              href="/library/restoration/greer1/">Greer</a> in
              1982.<a href="#n30">30</a> A pedicled island scrotal
              flap was used for the same purpose by Lynch and Pryor
              in a one-stage procedure in 1993.<a
              href="#n31">31</a></p>

              <p align="justify">All these publications are single
              case reports stating no severe complications, and it
              is not known whether the patients were fully
              satisfied with the result. Bigelow was able to
              reinvestigate a few patients operated on by the
              method of Greer and Goodwin.<a href="#n7">7</a> Some
              of them were extremely pleased with the result and
              others disliked their new genital status; there was
              even one patient who underwent recircumcision
              afterward.</p>

              <p align="justify">Despite the possible complications
              of surgery and the inevitable presence of scars, the
              main disadvantage seems to be the different color and
              texture of the original penile skin and the graft.
              This outcome may not be what the patient had
              expected; therefore, most foreskin restoration
              seekers nowadays prefer skin expansion systems, which
              avoid these problems</p>

              <p align="justify">Lastly, another historic example
              dealing with the matter of circumcision and
              uncircumcision can be presented from the fine arts,
              surprising us that this problem is of any relevance
              in this field. From 1501 to 1504 Michelangelo
              Buonarroti created the statue of David (Fig. 7),
              which is today one of Florence&rsquo;s main cultural
              and tourist attractions. One might be rather
              surprised that this representative of the Jewish
              people is shown with his penis not circumcised. Was
              Michelangelo just submitting to the aesthetic taste
              of his time, thereby making use of artistic liberty,
              as he had done before?<a href="#n32">32</a> Or did he
              fear any discredit of the Church or his customers by
              presenting such an obvious sign of Judaism as a
              circumcised penis? Some authors even postulated that
              Michelangelo had in mind to attach the face and
              weapons of David to the statue of Goliath.<a
              href="#n33">33</a> Because this question cannot be
              answered definitely, the reader is asked to make up
              his own mind.</p>
