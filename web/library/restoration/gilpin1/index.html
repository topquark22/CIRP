      <p>A novel repair of the distal urethra with glanular and
      preputial reconstruction is described for distal penile
      hypospadias; 52 consecutive patients underwent this procedure
      without catheter splintage or urinary diversion. All voided
      without problems on the day of operation; 44 (85%) were
      treated as day cases, while the remaining 8 boys stayed in
      hospital for at least 1 night post-operatively for reasons
      not associated with the operation. Follow-up was complete and
      ranged from 15 to 30 months (mean 18). There was no evidence
      of meatal stenosis, phimosis or urethral stricture; 26 boys
      (50%) had associated chordee pre-operatively which was
      incompletely corrected in 2 (8%). These have a minor degree
      of chordee of glans on penile shaft and neither has required
      further treatment. Four boys (8%) developed partial wound
      breakdown which necessitated reconstruction in 2 and both of
      these have now been treated successfully. <span
