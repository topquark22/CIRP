      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text1">Uncircumcision, the restoration of the
      prepuce, has been performed since antiquity, perhaps since
      shortly after the first circumcision. In history, restoration
      of the prepuce has been particularly important in societies
      where most men were uncircumcised, while a minority group
      practised ritual circumcision and thus were not accepted in
      communal settings of nudity.</p>

      <h3>Uncircumcision in antiquity</h3>

      <p class="text1">Many of the first references to
      uncircumcision are found in the Judeo-Christian religious
      writings of the Old and New Testament. In the era of the
      Roman Empire, the Greek practice of public nudity was adopted
      at the bath houses and gymnasia, for all exercises and sports
      activities. To have a glans penis without a preputial
      covering was considered socially unacceptable and ugly. The
      circumcised penis was considered deformed and disfigured,
      whether through congenital absence or surgery. It was also
      considered unacceptable if the uncircumcised foreskin was
      allowed to retract in public. In fact, to prevent the
      foreskin from retracting and exposing the glans penis, it was
      common practice to undergo infibulation, the placement of a
      circular safety-pin-like instrument (known as a fibula)
      across the distal edge of the prepuce [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">In ancient times, uncircumcisions were
      practised for <i>decoris causa</i> `the sake of appearance,'
      rather than for health reasons. Furthermore many Roman Jews
      red a secular life and attempted to conceal their `badge' of
      Jewishness, and thus their `outsider' identity, by undergoing
      uncircumcision [<a href="#n2">2</a>]. In the Book of
      Maccabees (1:14-15), during the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes
      (~167 BCE) and in the Talmud (132-135 CE), during the reign
      of Hadrian, as well as in Corinthians 7:18 (mid-first century
      AD) there are references to the practice of uncircumcision
      [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. Egyptians had also once practised
      ritual circumcision, but by Roman times circumcision was
      performed only on Egyptian priests [<a href="#n3">3</a>].</p>

      <p><i>Judeum Pondum</i></p>

      <p class="text1">One of the simpler methods for
      uncircumcision used during Roman times was the instrument
      known as the `judeum pondum' [<a href="#n2">2</a>], a
      funnel-shaped copper tube that was placed around the penile
      shaft (fig. 1). The heavy copper then pulled and stretched
      the shaft skin forward, to cover the glans. The hope was that
      the stretched skin would eventually stay in place and create
      a new prepuce. It is difficult to see how this technique
      could have produced any durable success [<a
      href="#n2">2</a>]. <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: This is
      a curious statement. Today, in contemporary society, many men
      are successfully using modern versions of the <i>judeum
      pondum</i> to restore their foreskins. The weight works by
      tissue expansion principles. Skin maintained under traction
      for an extended period forms additional skin cells and
      expands. Skin expansion is frequently used by plastic
      surgeons to create additional tissue for restorative or
      reconstructive surgery. The increase in size is permanent and
      is used to restore lengthen the penile shaft skin into a
      semblance of a foreskin.]</b></font></p>

      <p><i>Celsus` operations</i></p>

      <p class="text1">One of the first detailed descriptions of
      the operative techniques of uncircumcision was by Celsus [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. In his treatise, <i>De Medicina</i>,
      written between 14 and 37 CE, he described two such
      operations. As Celsus wrote, `and if the glans is bare, and
      the man wishes for the look of it to have it covered, that
      can be done'. Celsus called one of his operations
      `decircumcision' (or restoration of the prepuce) for those
      who were circumcised, and the other `reconstruction') of the
      prepuce for those with congenitally deficient foreskins. The
      ideal surgical candidate for best cosmetic results was felt
      to be a child or young adult with a small glans penis, with
      loose penile shaft ski, and where the prepuce was
      congenitally absent or underdeveloped, rather than previously
      removed by circumcision [<a href="#n1">1</a>].</p>

        create a prepuce, by pulling the penile shaft skin to cover
        the glans penis.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p><i>Decircumcision</i></p>

      <p class="text1">For those who were previously circumcised,
      Celsus performed a circumferential subcoronal superficial
      skin incision (deep to the dartos fascia), to be in an
      avascular plane. The penis was degloved and the shaft skin
      advanced distally to cover the glans. A plaster dressing
      containing lead oxide (an ancient version of mercury
      ointment) was placed between the glans and the new prepuce,
      to prevent the skin from adhering to the glans [<a
      href="#n1">1,2</a>] (fig.2). Postoperatively, erections were
      discouraged to prevent the penile skin from retracting.
      Therefore, the patient was not allowed to eat any solid food
      for days, because it was thought that by keeping the patient
      hungry and weak he would not have erections [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. When the penile oedema resolved the penile
      shaft was tighly bandaged from the base to the subcorona.
      Again, it is difficult to see how this technique had any
      success at producing a cosmetic and functional prepuce.</p>

        shaft skin over the glans. Note the binding that is placed
        to hold the penile shaft binding and the plaster cast
        (arrows) placed between the neo-prepuce and the glans penis
        (to prevent skin adherence).</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p><i>Reconstruction of the prepuce</i></p>

      <p class="text1">For the congenitally absent or
      underdeveloped prepuce, Celsus advocated making a superficial
      skin incision at the penile base superficial to the penile
      blood vessels and the urethra (e.g. superficial to Buck`s
      fascia) (Fig. 3). The penile shaft skin was then slid
      distally until the skin folded onto itself and covered the
      glans. A tie was then placed through the distal skin so that
      it could not retract proximally. The suture was tied loosely
      to allow for voiding via the urethra. The partially degloved
      penis leaves an open wound, that was then covered with flax
      dressings and allowed to granulate. Overall, favourable
      cosmetic or functional results seem doubtful with this
      technique.</p>

        base incision, to cover the glans penis. Note the exposed
        proximal penile shaft and the distal suture to prevent the
        skin from retracting. (b) Cross-sectional view showing the
        degloved penis with the shaft skin and dartos pulled
        forward and sutured distally in place.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Modifications of the original Celsus
      technique were described centuries later. The first such
      modification was detailed by Penn [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. Penn
      first degloved the penis in the same manner as Celsus's
      reconstruction of the prepuce. In addition, he placed a
      unmeshed split-thickness skin graft to the denuded area of
      the proximal penile shaft. (Fig 4a). In so doing he noted
      more favourable cosmetic results [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. In
      our extensive experience with skin grafting the penis, we
      would suggest that the skin graft be sutured in place to the
      penile shaft while under stretch to allow for erections after
      grafting. To immoblize the graft we commonly place long silk
      sutures at the margins and tie them together over a
      non-adherent dressing (e.g. Xeroform) followed by a bolster
      of mineral oil-soaked cotton batting (Fig. 4b). To further
      immobilize the penis in the vertical position we place a
      plastic housing unit (e.g. a one litre plastic saline bottle
      with the top cut off) around the bolster (Fig. 4c). Another
      modification of Celsus's was later detailed by Goodwin [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. As per Celsus, a circumferential incision
      was made in the penile base skin to deglove the penis and to
      move the skin distally until the entire glans penis was
      covered. Additionally, Goodwin made multiple small transverse
      incisions at the most distal aspect of the neoprepuce, and
      then sutured them closed longitudinally so as to narrow the
      distal aspect of the new prepuce. To keep the skin drawn over
      the glans, traction sutures were then placed at the margins
      of the neo-prepuce. Instead of leaving the denuded proximal
      shaft to granulate in, the penis was buried in a shallow
      tunnel of the scrotal skin. After 2-3 months the scrotal skin
      was tubularized around the penis and the scrotum closed
      primarily. Unfortunately, as the scrotal skin is
      hair-bearing, this method usually creates a hairy penile
      shaft which is distinctly not cosmetic.</p>

        silk sutures tied over a bolster of cotton wadding. (c)
        Plastic housing unit to keep the penis and skin graft
        immobile.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">To convert the Goodwin modification of
      Celsus's reconstruction of the prepuce into a one-stage
      procedure, Lynch and Pryor [<a href="#n6">6</a>] described
      covering the denuded proximal penile shaft with a pediculed
      island scrotal flap. Their scrotal skin flap was developed
      from the mid-scrotum and based on a vascularized pedicle of
      dartos. The longitudinal fasciocutaneous flap was then
      rotated 90&deg; on its blood supply to cover the proximal
      penis. The edges of the scrotal defect are then sutured
      closed. As the anterior, midline aspect of the scrotum is
      often hair-bearing, the scrotal flap will probably create a
      hairy proximal penis. To avoid this, we suggest that the
      anterior scrotum be carefully depilated and re-evaluated
      weeks before such anticipated neo-preputial surgery.</p>

      <h3>Prepuce restoration during the Nazi era</h3>

      <p class="text1">The practice of uncircumcision had a
      resurgence during the Second World War [<a href="#n7">7</a>].
      Because circumcision was rarely practised amongst any
      European ethnic group except for Jews, being circumcised was
      a physical characteristic that could expose and identify a
      Jew. In Nazi-occupied Poland, there are reports of several
      Warsaw doctors who had busy practices by performing surgery
      to restore the prepuce. The types of operations that were
      being performed, as well as the outcomes and success of such
      operations are unclear. Unfortunately, we can assume that
      these desperate people were merely exploited and probably
      disfigured. The wartime memoir of Solomon Perel [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>] , subsequently the subject of an
      award-winning film, details Perel's experiences during World
      War II as an orphaned Polish Jew who passed himself off as an
      ethnic German. At a Hitler Youth military school he
      ironically was often praised as a model Aryan. However, as he
      was circumcised, he constantly feared being discovered as a
      Jew; he was careful not to be naked in front of others. At
      one point he attempted to create a foreskin by sewing his
      penile shaft skin around the glans penis. As expected his
      attempt at prepuce restoration was unsuccessful. Like Perel,
      many other Jews also attempted preputial restoration; it is
      doubtful that many, if any, were successful.</p>

      <h3>Other methods for preputial restoration</h3>

      <p class="text1">Aside from the <i>judeum pondum</i>, there
      are other anecdotal reports of patients using long-term
      traction to stretch the penile shaft skin to cover the glans.
      Goodwin [<a href="#n5">5</a>] suggests the use of a tissue
      expander to obtain extra penile shaft skin. Such a tissue
      expander would need to be ring-shaped, have a rigid inner
      layer and a tissue-expanding outer layer. A rigid inner layer
      is needed so that the penis does not become compressed during
      insufflation of the expander. The ring diameter would need to
      be tailored to each patient's penile girth. The ring-shaped
      tissue expander could be easily placed around the penis and
      under the shaft skin through a subcoronal degloving incision.
      Over the following weeks the penile shaft skin could be
      stretched to sufficient redundancy that a relatively
      normal-appearing prepuce could be achieved.</p>

        <img src="Fig5.gif" alt="Figure 5" />

        the corners to tie over a cotton bolster.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Other potential methods for prepuce
      reconstruction could use either a fascial or a fasiocutaneous
      circular penile flap. Both flaps are from the distal penis
      and based on the highly vascular pedicle of Buck's fascia.
      Fascial flap and neo-prepuce development are shown in Fig. 5.
      An incision is made at the previous circumcision line
      completely around the pneis, extending through the dartos and
      Buck's fascia back to the base of the penis. The developed
      pedicle of Buck' fascia is then folded inward and onto itself
      at its distal aspect. The double layer of fascia is made as
      wide as the glans penis. The pedicle is then advanced
      distally to cover the entire glans and sutured in place. A
      split-thickness skin graft is then harvested from the inner
      aspect of the thigh in the usual way. The skin graft is not
      meshed, placed on the inner and outer aspect of the bed of
      folded Buck's fascia, and then sutured in place with
      absorbable sutures. Non-adhering bolster dressings of
      Xeroform, followed by mineral oil-soaked cotton batting are
      placed on the outer and inner aspect of the neo-prepuce and
      secured in place with previously placed silk stay sutures at
      the edges (Fig 5c). The skin graft is kept immobized for 5
      days and then the dressings are removed. The patient is then
      instructed to shower twice daily and air-dry the skin
      graft.</p>

        and the free skin graft on the outside surfaces of the
        neo-prepuce.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">To develop a neo-prepuce with a circular
      fasciocutaneous penile flap, we initially develop the flap as
      described by McAninch [<a href="#n9">9</a>]. The methods for
      such preputial restoration are illustrated in Fig. 6. The
      skin flap is made wide enough [to] correspond to the length
      of the glans penis The flap is not divided in the ventral
      midline. Instead, it is kept circular, folded inward and onto
      itself, and then sutured in place at the subcorona with
      absorbable sutures. A split-thickness skin graft is then
      harvested from the inner aspect of the thigh as usual. The
      unmeshed free graft is then placed on the outer aspect of the
      exposed Buck's fascia and sutured in place. Bolster dressings
      are placed and the graft managed as described above. The
      above two methods should be able [to] create a hairless,
      functionally successful and cosmetically acceptable
      neo-prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is also important to realize that as a
      cosmetic operation, preputial restoration has numerous
      associated psychological problems. Most of the men have had a
      life-long preoccupation with circumcision, many being
      homosexual and with prudish views of sexuality [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]. Before undertaking preputial restoration
      surgery, it is essential to carefully counsel the patient
      about the potential complications, cosmetic results and
      unusual nature of the surgery. Furthermore, it is essential
      that patients with underlying psychiatric conditions are
      unrealistic expectations, particularly for changes in their
      interpersonal relationships or psyche, be referred for
      psychiatric consultation [<a href="#n10">10</a>]. Overall,
      surgical methods for restoration of the prepuce are not
      standard, and reports in the literature are primarily
      anecdotal, with poorly documented follow-up.</p>

      <p class="text2"><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: 1) The
