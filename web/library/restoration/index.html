      and <a href="/library/history/hodges2/">Hodges</a><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> provide historical accounts.
      Foreskin restoration has been practiced at least since the
      Maccabean period in the 2nd century B.C.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a>,<a href="#n17">17,18</a></sup> The Greek
      idea of an ideal prepuce was a prepuce with a long tapered
      shape. They practiced foreskin elongation by the use of
      traction on the prepuce to achieve the desired
      appearance.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p>Foreskin restoration (epispasm) may have reached its peak
      of popularity during the first century A.D.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> The advantages have been
      rediscovered and it is now enjoying new popularity in the
      21<sup><u>st</u></sup> century by the use of modern
      non-surgical tissue expansion methods of restoration.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Surgical restoration.</b> <a
      href="penn1/">Penn</a><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>, <a
      href="greer1/">Greer</a><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>, and
      <a href="goodwin1/">Goodwin</a><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      describe various plastic surgical procedures for the
      reconstruction of the prepuce. There has been at least one
      report of complications resulting from surgical prepuce
      restoration. Surgical foreskin restoration has fallen into
      disfavor because of cost, complications, and the belief that
      non-surgical restoration provides an improved outcome at less
      expense.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Non-surgical restoration.</b>
      Non-surgical restoration is accomplished by tissue expansion
      of the residual shaft skin to resemble a foreskin. Although
      tissue expansion was known in ancient times,<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,</a></sup><sup><a
      href="#n17">17,18,19</a></sup> knowledge of tissue expansion
      was lost until 1957 when Neuman published a report on the use
      of an inflatable inplanted device to enlarge an area of
      skin.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The use of tissue
      expansion by medical doctors, however, did not become a
      standard procedure until after the publication of reports by
      Radovan.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Tissue expansion in medical practice
      relies on the use of an implantable inflatable device to put
      tension an area of skin to cause it to enlarge by the
      formation of new cells.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Tissue
      expansion now is an accepted surgical technique.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Non-surgical foreskin restoration,
      however, does not rely on implantable devices. The necessary
      skin tension is obtained without cutting or incisions by
      external application of traction to the residual shaft skin
      of the penis.</p>

      <p class="justified">Lay persons who were dissatisfied with
      their unwanted involuntary childhood circumcision pioneered
      the use of tissue expansion to accomplish foreskin
      restoration.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The medical
      community has been slow to recognize the many advances in
      contemporary non-surgical prepuce restoration by skin
      expansion that have been pioneered by lay persons and little
      information has been published in the medical literature.
      Goodwin<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> noted that a near
      normal appearance can be obtained by the application of
      traction over a long period of time. <a
      href="/library/restoration/bigelow1/">Bigelow</a>,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> <a href="pertot/">Pertot</a><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> and <a
      href="schultheiss/">Schultheiss</a><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> discuss non-surgical restoration. An
      anonymous writer provides a report of his personal experience
      with non-surgical foreskin restoration.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Non-surgical foreskin restoration is
      generally believed to be a safe procedure. For more
      information on current methods of non-surgical restoration,

      </center>

      <p class="justified"><b>Repair of dorsal slit.</b> A few
      males receive dorsal slit operations instead of
      circumcisions. A dorsal slit is a cut of the top of the
      foreskin. No tissue is removed from the penis. The foreskin
      then falls and collects below head in an unattractive ball.
      (There is another operation, the limited dorsal slit <i>with
      transverse closure</i> that is used to widen the narrow part
      of the foreskin to treat phimosis. The dorsal slit with
      transverse closure has good cosmesis. The two operations
      should not be confused.) The original form of the foreskin
      may be repaired by a plastic or urologic surgeon.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> The edges of the slit foreskin are
      gathered and sewn together to bring the foreskin back to its
      original natural intact appearance.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> This restores the various, protective,
      and sexual functions of the foreskin.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Psychological benefits.</b> The
      medical community has been deeply suspicious of men who seek
      to have their circumcision mutilation reversed. <a
      href="penn1/">Penn</a><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> required
      psychological evaluation of his patient but found that the
      only psychological problem was one caused by the involuntary
      unwanted circumcision. <a href="greer1/">Greer</a><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> likewise was deeply suspicious and
      required both psychological and psychiatric evaluation of his
      patients. Greer reported, apparently to his surprise, that
      the repair of the circumcision injury by plastic
      reconstruction produced a psychological benefit in his
      patients. He reported that, "[e]very patient has reported the
      results of the operation to be pleasing and gratifying." They
      also reported increased glanular sensitivity. <a
      href="goodwin1/">Goodwin</a><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      was also concerned about psychological problems but reported
      that foreskin repair "delighted" at least one of his
      patients. Foreskin restoration has been proposed to treat the
      adverse psychological effects of circumcision.<sup><a

      <h2>Hypospadias repair and foreskin preservation</h2>

      <p class="justified"><b>Hypospadias</b> is a condition in
      which the penile tube fuses incompletely during fetal
      development. This condition results in a malformed urethral
      orifice (meatus) with concomitant malformations of the glans,
      prepuce, and underside of the penis. The extent of the
      malformation varies, with the urethral opening positioned
      somewhere between the tip of the penis and the scrotum.</p>

      <p class="justified">Traditional repair of hypospadias
      typically consumed the foreskin, resulting in a denuded,
      unnatural-looking circumcised penis. Today a number of
      improved techniques for hypospadias repair are now available,
      achieving a penis with a natural-looking reconstructed
      foreskin and improved cosmesis. Foreskin preserving
      techniques are described in reports by <a
      href="kropfl1/">Kr&ouml;pfl and colleagues</a><sup>,<a
      href="#h1">1</a></sup>, Gilpin and others,<sup><a
      href="#h2">2</a></sup> Hoebeke <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#h3">3</a></sup> A ten year follow-up by Gray and
      colleagues shows distal hypospadias repair with foreskin
      preservation to be very successful.<sup><a
      href="#h6">6</a></sup> Erdenetsetseg &amp; Dewan reported
      excellent to good results in 86 percent of their
      patients.<sup><a href="#h7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p>Because hypospadias is not a life-threatening condition,
      it is not urgent to order immediate surgery. The American
      Academy of Pediatrics says that there should be no genital
      surgery in the first six weeks of a child's life when bonding
      is occurring.<sup><a href="#h4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>The AAP has stated that the best times for hypospadias
      repair surgery are between six months and twelve months of
      age.<sup><a href="#h4">4</a></sup> However, it makes more
      sense to wait until the child is old enough to understand
      what is happening. More and more groups are now saying that
      <i>any</i> non-urgent genital surgery should be delayed until
      the child can decide for himself about the surgery.<sup><a
      href="#h5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>Because hypospadias is not an emergency condition, there
      is also plenty of time to seek out a surgeon who is familiar
      with modern repair techniques and who can achieve the best,
      most natural-looking result. <b>The latest surgical
      procedures are able to provide a natural intact appearance in
      many cases.</b></p>

      <p>A general discussion of hypospadias is outside the scope
      of the Circumcision Reference Library. Parents are urged to
      seek out complete information elsewhere.</p>
