      <h2>SENSITIVITY IS THE RISING ISSUE ON CIRCUMCISION</h2>
      by 

      <p><b>Dr. Sandra Pertot</b></p>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>The debate about circumcision is one that just does not
      seem to want to go away.</p>

      <p>After a long period of relative quiet in which the medical
      position has been that circumcision is an unnecessary
      operation which may lead to complications of its own, a new
      and radical element has entered the picture.</p>

      <p>One obvious difficulty with the procedure is that the
      person affected, the infant male, has no say in what happens,
      and now increasing numbers of adult males who were
      circumcised at birth are protesting about male rights.</p>

      <p>They have two aims. One is to prevent it happening to
      other males, and the second is to explore methods of
      restoring what was taken from them at birth.</p>

      <p>These men claim not only that circumcision is traumatic to
      the newborn but also that the removal of the protective
      covering of the glans leads to keratinisation, a process
      which begins immediately after the loss of the foreskin and
      continues throughout life. Dr. Thomas Ritter, a US surgeon
      who was an early campaigner against circumcision, says over
      time the exposed glans takes on the character of external
      skin rather than mucous membrane, becoming dry and
      leathery.</p>

      <p>It is said this toughening process causes loss of
      sensitivity of the glans, reducing sensitivity during
      sex.</p>

      <p>In addition, circumcision is said to have other impacts on
      sexual pleasure.</p>

      <p>The foreskin itself is believed to contain <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">a generous endowment of
      specialised nerve endings</a> which contribute to sexual
      feeling, and the movement of the foreskin over the glans
      during intercourse enhances the pleasurable sensations of
      sex.</p>

      <p>Loss of the foreskin is believed to have a much greater
      impact on adult sexuality than has previously been
      acknowledged.</p>

      <p>Other circumcised men complain of life-long irritation of
      the exposed glans as it comes in contact with clothing during
      normal activity.</p>

      <p>Some claim discomfort during masturbation when the exposed
      glans is directly stimulated.</p>

      <p>Some men are so angry about this involuntary surgery that
      they refer to it as an assault, and equate it to genital
      mutilation of the young female who is ritually circumcised
      for religious or cultural reasons.</p>

      <p>These men are attacking the issue on several fronts.</p>

      <p>At a political level, groups such as NOCIRC and the NSW
      [New South Wales] Men's movement are lobbying the Federal
      Government [of Australia] for removal of the Medicare rebate
      for circumcision.</p>

      <p>In addition, they actively promote their views on
      circumcision in the media in an attempt to influence parents
      not to request the procedure, and at academic conferences to
      encourage medical practitioners not to perform it.</p>

      <p>The other, more personal, focus for men who feel they have
      suffered because of their circumcision is the development of
      techniques to restore a foreskin.</p>

      <p>There are two basic techniques.</p>

      <p>One was developed by Dr. James Bigelow, an American
      psychologist, who in his mid 50s, began to experiment with
      ways of redeveloping his foreskin.</p>

      <p>He achieved this by gently and gradually stretching what
      remained of his foreskin, keeping it in place with surgical
      tape.</p>

      <p>The tape was worn constantly and was cut is such a way as
      to allow normal urination. It was removed for intercourse,
      which Dr. Bigelow says interfered with spontaneous sex as he
      tended to time sex for those days when he was going to change
      the tape.</p>

      <p>After four years he has a foreskin he is reasonably happy
      with and hopes for further improvement over time.</p>

      <p>He says his circumcision was severe, and therefore other
      men way achieve a good result in significantly less time.</p>

      <p>The stretching process can be aided by attaching small
      weighted devices such as fishing weights to the tape.</p>

      <p>Dr. Bigelow is trialling [sic] a cone-shape expansion
      device which fits over the penis and allows for greater
      tension of the expanding skin. The final result is not an
      exact duplication of a normal foreskin, but is nevertheless
      considered close enough to be worth the effort.</p>

      <p>Dr. Bigelow's technique appears to have been
      enthusiastically received by enough men in Australia to lead
      to the development of a foreskin restoration self help
      group.</p>

      <p>The group, UNCIRC, offers a mail order service to supply
      Dr. Bigelow's book, <a href="http://www.norm.org/joy.html"
      target="_blank"><i>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</i></a>, which
      costs about $30 and takes about 2-3 months to arrive from the
      US.</p>

      <p>After the recipient has begun the program, the group has a
      telephone advisory service on how to deal with any
      difficulties is applying the technique.</p>

      <p>The other approach to restoring foreskin is by surgery
      using skin grafts. This has the advantage of providing a
      quicker result with a greater amount of new tissue, and is
      also popular in the US.</p>

      <p>UNCIRC is lobbying the Federal Minister of Health to have
      penile foreskin restoration covered by <a
      href="http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/"
      target="_blank">Medicare</a>.</p>

      <p>Those who have restored their foreskin say the glans
      gradually becomes softer--more like mucous membrane. Sex
      became more enjoyable and daily discomfort through friction
      disappeared.</p>

      <p>Whatever personal beliefs individual health providers may
      have about the merits or otherwise of circumcision, they
      could find themselves involved in debate about this practice
      again, and the publicity that is building around restoration
      procedures may lead to inquiries from patients as to what is
      involved.</p>

      <p>Clearly, the man (and probably his partner) need to be
      highly motivated to persevere with the slow and tedious
      procedure, but advocates claim the rewards are definitely
      worth it.</p>
