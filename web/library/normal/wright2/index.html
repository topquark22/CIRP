      <p><b>J E Wright</b></p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="abstract"><span class="yellow"><i>The fortunate
      foreskin of an infant boy will usually be left well alone by
      everyone but its owner. Problems such as phimosis are not
      common, and can usually be treated medically without
      circumcision.</i></span> <i><b>(Med J Aust 1994;
      160:134-135)</b></i></p>

      <p class="2"><span class="init">T</span>he natural history of
      the foreskin is a neglected subject. Gairdner, in an <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">historic article</a>
      entitled "The fate of the foreskin . . ."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> described it in 1949. In 1968, Oster
      again addressed the subject in a <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">paper</a> entitled "Further
      fate of the foreskin.".<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2"><span class="yellow">Gairdner's otherwise
      masterly description contained one inaccuracy. He said that
      the foreskin should be fully retractable by three years of
      age. Clinical observation reveals that this is not true. It
      should be open and beginning to retract by three years of age
      but full retractability may not be achieved to many years
      later. Indeed nature will not permit the assignment of a
      strict timetable to this process.</span></p>

      <p class="2">In infancy retraction is limited by adhesions
      between the inner layer of the prepuce and the glans. These
      adhesions form early in fetal development<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and provide a protective cocoon for
      the delicate developing glans. At birth and in early infancy
      the normal foreskin is non-retractable and adherent to the
      glans. Separation occurs slowly, usually with smegma
      collecting beneath the prepuce,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      but the process may not be complete until later childhood.
      Smegma (yellow sebaceous material) is often visible beneath
      the prepuce and may be erroneously diagnosed as a "cyst," or
      worse, as "infection." Its extrusion as the prepuce separates
      is often mistakenly called "pus." Far from indicating
      circumcision, it is more a contra-indication. <span
      class="note">[CIRP note: Dr. Wright uses the pathological
      term "adhesions" to describe the normal connections and
      bonding between the inner prepuce and the underlying glans
      penis. These are normal healthy connections, and bonding in
      the immature and still developing penis should not be
      confused with pathological adhesions which Dr. Wright
      discusses.]</span></p>

      <p class="2">Mild episodes of inflammation are often part of
      the natural process of separation of glans and prepuce. True
      balanoposthitis is usually staphylococcal and responds
      rapidly to bathing and a simple antibacterial agent such as
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. It is no more an indication
      for circumcision than one attack of tonsillitis is for
      tonsillectomy.</p>

      <h4>Phimosis</h4>

      <p class="2">This term used to be used in hospital records to
      justify social circumcision. Fortunately, this is less often
      performed, although there has been a resurgence of demand for
      circumcision with tacit medical compliance, in recent
      years.</p>

      <p class="2">It is easier to define what phimosis is not. It
      is not simply a non-retractable foreskin in infancy or early
      childhood. Phimosis means "muzzling." It is an unnatural and
      therefore abnormal condition. The prepuce is designed to be
      non-retractable in infancy and early childhood when the
      developing glans needs complete protection from the
      mechanical trauma of the nappy and clothing, and the chemical
      trauma of ammoniacal urine. Non-retractability in later
      childhood is abnormal and may then be called phimosis. At any
      age, abnormal narrowing of the preputial opening with
      ballooning on micturation (not simple filling) is
      "phimosis."</p>

      <p class="2">Thus true phimosis may be defined as an abnormal
      degree of narrowing of the preputial opening causing
      obstruction to urine flow, or non-retractability persisting
      well into childhood.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Phimosis is of two types:</p>

        <p>1. Phimosis with supple but as yet inadequately yielding
        skin. This is a delay of normal development.</p>

        <p>2. Phimosis associated with abnormal skin or "scarring"
        of the prepuce. This may be though natural causes such as
        lichen sclerosis et atrophicus (balanitis xerotica
        obliterans) or unnatural causes such an injury or trauma
        though premature and forceful attempts to withdraw the
        foreskin.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Management of the normal prepuce</h4>

      <p class="2"><span class="yellow">After years of almost
      universal neonatal circumcision, Australian parents and the
      Australian medical profession became ignorant of the care of
      the normal (i. e., uncircumcised) penis.</span> European
      migrants from countries where neonatal circumcision has never
      been practised are familiar with the natural history and are
      comfortable with the knowledge that the foreskin in infancy
      should be left alone. No attempt should be made to withdraw
      it or wash it inside.</p>

      <p class="2">The time to pull the foreskin back is when the
      child is old enough to do this himself. He will instinctively
      pull it forward in early childhood but will not be able to
      retract it at all until at least three or four years of age.
      The degree to which this can be done is determined by the
      residual attachment to the glans. It should be pulled as far
      back as possible without causing discomfort. If the child
      does this himself in a normal, hygienic manner in the bath,
      unnecessary force and trauma will be avoided.</p>
      <hr width="40%" size="4" align="center" />

      <p class="box"><i>The time to pull the<br />
       prepuce back is when<br />
       the child is old enough<br />
       to do this himself.</i></p>
      <hr width="40%" size="4" align="center" />

      <p class="2">What of residual preputial adhesions? Should
      these be separated digitally? If this is done too early there
      is excessive discomfort after the procedure and even
      bleeding. Further, they can reform. "Too early" is variable
      but from clinical experience it is unwise to attempt it
      before six years of age. Beyond this age it is a simple
      procedure if the prepuce is supple and fully and freely
      retractable to the limit of these adhesions.</p>

      <p class="2">If these conditions are fulfilled, the procedure
      can be done painlessly with the aid of a local anaesthetic
      cream (EMLA cream, Astra Phamaceuticals, a eutectic mixture
      of lidocaine and prilocaine). This is inserted into the
      prepuce and left in place one hour, during which time the
      child must not void. The glans is then insensitive and
      adhesions can be separated painlessly provided they are not
      too extensive. The cream does not penetrate deeply and, if
      the adhesions are widespread, the procedure should be
      performed in two stages six to twelve weeks apart. It should
      be emphasised that this procedure should not be done in
      infancy or early childhood, and some experts advise against
      it at any age.</p>

      <h4>Management of the abnormal prepuce and phimosis</h4>

      <p class="2">This is either surgical or, more recently,
      medical. Surgery may involve dilation, dorsal slit or
      circumcision. Dilation is likely to produce more scarring and
      make the condition worse. Dorsal slit, if not done
      adequately, causes scarring and recurrence. If done
      generously it produces an ugly foreskin with prolapse of the
      inner preputial layer, to produce a penis that looks neither
      circumcised nor uncircumcised. Circumcision is the best
      surgical procedure for phimosis. It is definitive and final.
      It is a good operation when performed for good reasons. <span
      class="note">[CIRP note: Dr. Wright seems to overlook the <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/">nonsurgical method
      of relief of phimosis</a> in adolescents and young men
      developed by french doctor Michel Beauge. In addition he
      fails to discuss the several preputioplasty surgical
      procedures described in the literature in recent years for
      the relief of phimosis. The benefits claimed for these
      procedures are an easier recovery and retention of the tissue
      of the foreskin and the preservation of its functions. <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/berdeu1/">Some observers
      believe that circumcision is outmoded as a treatment for
      phimosis</a>.]</span></p>

      <p class="2">In recent year a medical treatment has been
      found effective in nearly 90% of boys with phimosis. A
      topical steroid such as betamethasone valerate 0.05% applied
      to the tip of the phimotic prepuce, which has normal supple
      skin, will effect cure in most instances.<sup><a id="#n4"
      name="#n4"></a></sup> It must be applied to the tip of the
      prepuce regularly, at least three times a day for about one
      month. The pink distal end of the prepuce is the area
      concerned and there is no need to insert the steroid in the
      prepuce.</p>

      <p class="2">The response depends on the absence of
      "scarring" of the prepuce and the degree of parental
      compliance. If there is lichen sclerosus et atrophicus
      (balanitis xerotica obliterans) it will not be effective. It
      should be used for about one month, and for a further month
      in those who make good progress but do not achieve full
      response. It will not separate adhesions and it will not make
      the foreskin retractable beyond what may be expected for the
      child's age. Thus under three years of age it is sufficient
      to open up the prepuce and prevent ballooning on micturition.
      Beyond that age the foreskin should retract to the limit of
      adhesions, if any. These can then be treated, if deemed
      necessary, at the appropriate time.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <p class="2"><span class="yellow">The normal prepuce should
      be left alone, with no attempt to retract it until the boy is
      able to do it himself, at the earliest at three years of
      age.</span> A non-retractable foreskin under three years of
      age is not phimosis unless the opening is so narrow that
      there is ballooning on micturition. <span class="yellow">Full
      retractability of the foreskin may not be achieved until late
      childhood. Preputial adhesions are not abnormal in early
      childhood.</span> They can be separated digitally in later
      childhood with topical anaethesia. Phimosis in most boys can
      be successfully treated medically and is not a universal
      indication for circumcision. If medical treatment fails, as
      it will with phimosis caused by lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus or starring, circumcision is the best
      procedure.</p>
