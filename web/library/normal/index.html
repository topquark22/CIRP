      <h1>Normal development of the prepuce:<br />
       Birth through age 18</h1>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="justified">The genital organs are in a very
      immature stage of development at birth. The growth and
      development continues through puberty and into adulthood.
      This page and the indexed articles provide information on
      that normal development. Articles are indexed in
      chronological order.</p>
      <img alt="" src="/gif/hline.png" /> 

      <h3>"The Phony Phimosis Diagnosis"</h3>

      <p class="justified">The normal growth and development of the
      prepuce of the human male has been greatly misunderstood both
      by the medical community and by the public. This
      misunderstanding has led to many unnecessary, contraindicated
      circumcisions being performed on young boys.</p>

      <p class="justified">Typically, when a baby boy is born, the
      prepuce is long with a narrow tip.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a>,<a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Retraction is not possible in the
      majority of infants because the narrow tip will not pass over
      the glans penis. Moreover, the inner mucosal surface of the
      prepuce is fused with the underlying mucosal surface of the
      glans penis.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a>,<a href="#n4">4</a>,<a
      href="#n6">6</a>,<a href="#n11">11</a></sup> This also
      prevents retraction. This normal developmental narrowness is
      sometimes improperly diagnosed as <i>phimosis</i> (a fairly
      rare pathological condition, characterized by hardening of
      the tip of the foreskin, and a whitish ring of hardened
      tissue). In fact, the normal developmental narrowness is not
      phimosis. It is simply a normal stage of development.</p>

      <p class="justified">The fusion of the foreskin to the
      underlying glans penis is often improperly called
      "<i>adhesions.</i>" The fused foreskin and glans sometimes
      will separate by age 3-5, but usually this takes longer.
      &Oslash;ster observed boys in which this normal process was
      not completed until after puberty.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      </center>

      <p class="justified">As the infant matures into a boy and the
      boy into a man, a number of changes occur: The tip of the
      prepuce becomes wider, the tip seems to become shorter as the
      shaft of the penis grows. The membrane that bonds the inner
      surface of the prepuce with the glans penis spontaneously
      disintegrates and releases the prepuce to separate from the
      glans. The prepuce spontaneously becomes retractable.</p>

      <p class="justified">Many medical doctors in the United
      States receive no training in the normal development of the
      prepuce. Thus they improperly diagnose a normal developmental
      condition as "phimosis."<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">As noted above, a large number of
      medical doctors have not had the benefit of the information
      contained on this page, because it has not become part of the
      standard medical curriculum. Many physicians today are unable
      to distingish between normal developmental tightness (as
      described here) and clinical phimosis. Nor are they able to
      answer with accuracy when the prepuce should become
      retractable.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> These ill-trained
      doctors may attempt to prematurely retract the foreskin which
      is traumatic for the child.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      Parents should guard against this possibility.</p>

      <p class="justified">The prepuce contains muscle fibers that
      work to keep the tip closed when the child is not
      urinating.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a>,<a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      This may cause parents and physicians to believe that the
      opening is smaller than it really is. <a
      href="catzel/">Catzel</a> explains how to examine a child's
      prepuce correctly to avoid misdiagnosis.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">The false diagnosis of phimosis in boys
      is very common in the United States and the United Kingdom.
      See <a href="/library/treatment/phimosis/#phony">here</a> for
      more information.</p>

      <h3>Ballooning</h3>

      <p class="justified">There is a phase of development during
      which some boys may experience "ballooning." Ballooning is
      the inflation of the prepuce during urination by the pressure
      of urine inside. This can occur if the inner layer of the
      prepuce is separating or has separated from the glans, which
      typically happens around three years of age, before the
      prepuce has become fully retractable. Ballooning is an
      indication that the normal separation of the foreskin from
      the glans penis has occurred. Ballooning is a transient
      condition that goes away as the prepuce continues its natural
      growth and development and the opening at the tip further
      enlarges. Babu <i>et al.</i> report that ballooning does not
      interfere with voiding.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      Ballooning is <i>not</i> injurious, and it is <i>not</i> a
      cause for concern. Ballooning is <i>not</i> an indication for
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="justified">The maturation of the penis may take
      years to complete. Each boy develops at his own rate. The
      maturation of the prepuce continues beyond puberty as
      described below.</p>

      <p class="justified"><strong>The appearance of the infant
      penis does</strong> <em><strong>not</strong></em>
      <strong>reflect on the appearance of the adult
      penis.</strong> Sexual development after puberty causes many
      changes, which include retractibility of the foreskin.</p>

      <h4>Douglas Gairdner (1949)</h4>

      <p class="justified"><a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a>, a British
      pediatrician, observed 100 newborns and about 200 boys of
      varying ages through age 5. Gairdner reported that 4% of
      newborns had a fully retractable prepuce, In 54% the glans
      could only be uncovered enough to reveal the external meatus,
      and in 42% even the tip of the glans could not be uncovered.
      He also said that, in boys of six months of age, four out of
      five or 80% still had non-retractable prepuces. By 1 year of
      age, 50% still had non-retractable prepuces. By two years
      about 20% and by 3 years about 10% of boys still had a
      non-retractable prepuce.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">Gairdner also noted that the separation
      of the prepuce was incomplete at these ages and this
      incomplete separation is the cause of the non-retractabality.
      He said the surfaces should not be torn apart because this
      causes bleeding and infection. Gairdner provided a table
      which showed:</p>

      <center>
        <table summary="">
          <tr>
            <td>
<pre>
        Age                   Percent retractable. 

        Birth                         4    
        Age 1                        50
        Age 2                        75
        Age 3                        90
        Age 4                        91
        Age 5                        92
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="justified">Gairdner in 1949 had collected no data
      beyond age 5, which led some authors improperly to assume
      that circumcision was necessary if the prepuce was not
      retractable by that age.</p>

      <p class="justified">Gairdner's figures on percentage of
      retractability, collected in the 1940s,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> are now known to be too high.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a> <a href="#n17">17,18</a></sup>
      Unfortunately, many doctors still erroneously use these
      outmoded figures and this causes improper diagnosis of
      phimosis in normal boys and leads to unnecessary
      circumcisions. Later studies<sup><a href="#n6">6</a>,<a
      href="#n13">13</a>,<a href="#n14">14</a>, <a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> have indicated that only about 40-50
      percent of boys have fully retractable foreskins at age ten.
      (see below).</p>

      <h4>Jakob &Oslash;ster (1968)</h4>

      <p class="justified">The normal development of the prepuce
      beyond age 5 was first documented by <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Jakob &Oslash;ster</a>, a
      Danish pediatrician, who published his work in 1968.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">&Oslash;ster reported progressive
      increase in the retractability of the prepuce with increasing
      age. &Oslash;ster, a school health officer, was responsible
      for the physical examinations of large numbers of boys of
      school age. Neonatal circumcision is not practiced in
      Denmark, so all of the boys were intact. &Oslash;ster
      conducted examinations of boys aged 6 to 17 years old from
      school year 1957-58 through 1964-65.</p>

      <p class="justified">&Oslash;ster classified two grades of
      tightness of the prepuce: A non-retractable prepuce was
      termed <i>phimosis</i>, and a prepuce that could be retracted
      with difficulty he called <i>tight prepuce</i>. He found that
      the percentage of boys with "phimosis" or "tight prepuce"
      steadily declined with increasing age. Dr. &Oslash;ster's
      work is presented in his <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">article</a> in such a fashion
      that it is somewhat difficult to understand. He presented
      findings on "phimosis", "tight prepuce" and "adhesions"
      separately. Actually, all of those conditions prevent free
      and easy retraction of the foreskin so it is necessary to
      consider incidence of the three conditions together to
      determine the percentage of boys that have complete
      retractability. The Circumcision Reference Library restates
      &Oslash;ster's work here by combining his findings into one
      table. The combined total of boys by age who do not have
      complete retractability is shown in the table:</p>

      <p class="justified">&Oslash;ster's figures refute Gairdner's
      claims that 90 percent are retractable at age five,
      &Oslash;ster found that the 90 percent retractable stage is
      not reached until about age 16.</p>

      <h4>Grogono (1979)</h4>

      <p class="justified">E. B. Grogono, a school medical officer,
      observed that boys, with a non-retractile prepuce at age 11,
      have a fully retractile prepuce by age 14 or 15. Grogono
      further reported that the non-retractile prepuce caused no
      problems.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Hiroyuki Kayaba (1996)</h4>

      <p class="justified"><a
      href="/library/normal/kayaba/">Kayaba</a>, a Japanese doctor,
      recorded the findings on examination of 603 Japanese
      boys.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Kayaba classified the
      prepuce types into five categories. Kayaba noted a steady
      progression to increasing retractability with increasing
      age.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">Kayaba's work refutes the findings of
      Gairdner and confirms the work of &Oslash;ster. Kayaba
      reported that about 40 percent of boys in the 8-10 age group
      are fully retractable, this leaving about 60 percent with
      some degree of non-retractability, He also reported that 62.9
      percent of the boys in the 11 to 15 year old age group had
      completely retractable prepuces, thus leaving 37.1 percent
      with some degree of non-retractability. The prepuce is still
      developing in the 11-15-year-old group. Kayaba's findings are
      similar to those of &Oslash;ster.</p>

      <p class="justified">Kayaba made no reports beyond age
      15.</p>

      <p class="justified">Kayaba's report thus confirms the work
      of &Oslash;ster; we see that full retractability is not
      reached by about 1/2 of boys until the teen-age years. This
      is normal, and treatment is usually not required.</p>

      <h4>Imamura (1997)</h4>

      <p class="justified">Imamura's study, carried out in Japan,
      shows that the non-retractile prepuce is the normal condition
      in preschool age boys.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      Imamura found that only 38.4 percent of children three years
      old have a fully retractable prepuce. Imamura's data are
      similar to that of Kayaba.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      Imamura advises that no treatment is necessary for
      non-retractile prepuce.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      Imamura's findings<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> provide

      preputial retractability in 242 Japanese boys. They found
      that no boys had a retractable prepuce at birth but in the
      age group 11-15, 77 percent had a retractable prepuce while
      23 percent remained non-retracable. This confirms previous
      evidence that, for many boys, the prepuce does not become
      retractable until after puberty.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Thorvaldsen and Meyhoff (2005)</h4>

      <p class="justified">Thorvaldsen conducted a survey of young
      men in Denmark. They found that the average age of first
      foreskin retraction is 10.4 years.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Agawal, Mohta, and Anand (2005)</h4>

      <p class="justified">Agawal, Mohta, and Anand carried out a
      study in Delhi, India of boys up to age 12. Their study found
      that preputial retractability continues to develop through
      age 12, confirming the work of Oster (1968), Kayaba <i>et
      al.</i> (1996), and Thorvaldsen (2005).<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Beyond age 18</h4>

      <p class="justified">There are no studies in the medical
      literature of development of the prepuce beyond age 18.
      Anecdotal evidence indicates that most of the few males who
      still have a tight prepuce at age 18 find that the prepuce
      eventually stretches and enlarges so that full retractability
      of the foreskin is obtained in the early 20s.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <p class="justified">Almost all boys are born with narrow
      non-retractile foreskin which are fused with the glans
      beneath. This is a normal developmental physiological
      condition and is not a cause for concern. Some parents
      needlessly worry that the opening is not large enough.</p>

      <p class="justified">Retraction of the foreskin should never
      be forced. It will retract when it is ready. There is no
      "right" age for retraction to occur.</p>

      <p class="justified">A narrow non-retractable prepuce in boys
      is within the normal range of development and usually causes
      no problems. The prepuce usually will spontaneously widen
      until complete retractability is obtained. About 50-60
      percent of boys at age ten do not have fully retractable
      foreskins.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> This is
      normal.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> After puberty, the
      percentage of boys with full retractability rapidly increases
      spontaneously.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">If a narrow or non-retractile prepuce
      becomes a problem, a wide variety of <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">conservative alternative
      treatments</a> to circumcision are are now available.
      Circumcision is an outmoded, radical, traumatic,
      disproportionate, unnecessary surgery for a minor
      problem.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>After you have studied this page and
      its linked articles, you will know more about the normal
      development of the prepuce than most medical doctors.</b></p>

      <p><i>External irritants can sometimes cause a previously
      retractable prepuce to become non-retractable due to swelling
      of the tissues. If a child whose prepuce was retractable
      becomes non-retractable, environmental factors should be
      investigated. One known culprit is bubble bath. If a child is
      taking bubble baths and the prepuce becomes non-retractable,
      the bubble bath should be discontinued. See <a
      href="/library/hygiene/">Penile Hygiene in the Intact
      Non-circumcised Male</a> for comprehensive information on
      foreskin care.</i></p>
