      <h5>OBJECTIVES</h5>

      <p class="text1">To determine whether physiological phimosis
      with or without ballooning of the prepuce is associated with
      noninvasive urodynamic or radiological evidence of bladder
      outlet obstruction.</p>

      <h5>PATIENTS AND METHODS</h5>

      <p class="text1">From August 2001 to October 2002 all boys
      with a foreskin problem and referred to one paediatric
      surgeon were assessed in special clinics. Those with
      physiological phimosis were recruited for the study and had
      upper tract and bladder ultrasonography (US), followed by
      uroflowmetry and US-determined postvoid residual urine
      volumes (PVR). Data were compared between boys with and with
      no ballooning of the prepuce. The project was approved by the
      local research ethics committee and informed consent was
      obtained from all study participants.</p>

      <h5>RESULTS</h5>

      <p class="text1">In all, 54 patients were referred for
      circumcision; 32 boys with physiological phimosis completed
      the uroflow and US investigations. Ballooning of the foreskin
      was present in 18 boys (mean age 6.8 years, range 3-12); 14
      had physiological phimosis with no ballooning (mean age 6.5
      years, range 4-11). Upper tract US and bladder wall thickness
      were normal in all boys. <span class="yellow">The mean
      maximum urinary flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub>) was not
      significantly different in boys with ballooning and those
      without (mean 15.3 mL/s, sd 4.4, range 9-24, vs 15.4, sd 2.9,
      range 10.7-20, P = 0.96).</span> In addition, all
      Q<sub>max</sub> values were within the normal range when
      correlated with voided volume and compared with age-related
      nomograms. Most boys had flow rate patterns showing a normal
      bell-shaped curve; a few (9%) had subtle changes in the
      flow-rate profile, with either a plateau-type curve or slow
      initial increase in flow and prolonged time to achieve
      Q(max). The two groups had comparable mean PVRs (3.5 mL, sd
      5.1, range 0-18 with ballooning vs 6.1, sd 10.7, range 0-38
      without, P = 0.37). Only one patient had a marginally
      abnormal PVR.</p>

      <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">Physiological phimosis
      with or without ballooning of the prepuce is not associated
      with noninvasive objective measures of obstructed
      voiding.</span> Minor abnormalities in the flow-rate pattern
      in this patient group deserve further study.</p>

      <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>

      <p class="text1">The main medical indications for childhood
      circumcision are pathological phimosis, usually associated
      with balanitis xerotica obliterans, and recurrent
      balanoposthitis [<a href="#n1">1,2</a>]. Physiological
      phimosis is associated with a unretractile foreskin that is
      supple, unscarred, and said to `open like a flower' on
      attempted retraction [<a href="#n3">3</a>]. In addition,
      although retraction may reveal a pinpoint opening, drawing
      the prepuce forwards confirms a wide orifice with no evidence
      of true phimosis [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. Ballooning of the
      foreskin is also related to an unretractile foreskin [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>] with a relatively narrow opening and
      distensible preputial sac, although ballooning as a clinical
      sign is not restricted to physiological phimosis, and can be
      seen with a normal fully retractable foreskin and in
      cicatrising phimosis. Most paediatric surgeons and urologists
      consider physiological phimosis and associated foreskin
      ballooning as self-limiting features of normal foreskin
      development [<a href="#n3">3,5</a>], confirmed by follow-up
      studies with no intervention [<a href="#n6">6,7</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Both physiological phimosis and ballooning
      of the prepuce cause considerable parental concern/anxiety,
      and GPs and paediatricians frequently request surgical
      consultations for presumed phimosis and possible obstructed
      voiding [<a href="#n8">8,9</a>]. It is unclear why, despite
      reports supporting the conservative management of foreskin
      ballooning and physiological phimosis, paediatric surgeons
      continue to receive `inappropriate' referrals for
      circumcision. Obviously one reason could be a failure of the
      medical profession, and particularly surgeons, to disseminate
      information and educate primary-care physicians
      appropriately. However, it may be that in an age of
      increasing evidence-based medicine, clinicians are concerned
      that previous assumptions have not been qualified with robust
      objective data excluding a possibility of outlet obstruction.
      The aim of this study was to determine whether physiological
      phimosis with or with no ballooning of the prepuce is
      associated with noninvasive urodynamic or radiological
      evidence of obstructed voiding.</p>

      <h5>PATIENTS AND METHODS</h5>

      <p class="text1">Between August 2001 and October 2002 all
      boys referred to one surgeon (K.H.) by their GP with a
      foreskin problem were assessed in special clinic. Patients
      with physiological phimosis, defined as an unretractile,
      normal, supple, unscarred prepuce that with attempted
      retraction opened `like a flower' [<a href="#n3">3</a>], were
      identified and divided into two groups either with or with no
      ballooning of the prepuce, as determined from their history.
      Boys with evidence of true phimosis (balanitis xerotica
      obliterans), active infection, other penile anomalies, e.g.
      minor hypospadias, symptoms of voiding dysfunction or other
      urinary tract pathology, were excluded.</p>

      <p class="text1">Each boy had detailed renal and bladder
      ultrasonography (US) in the clinic by an experienced
      radiologist, after which a uroflow rate was obtained using a
      Urodyn&reg; 1000 spinning-disc (Dantec, Denmark) or a
      Flowmate-2 recorder (Micromedics, St. Paul, MN). The flow
      pattern, maximum flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub>) and voided
      volume were recorded and compared to established nomograms
      [<a href="#n10">10</a>] to determine whether the results were
      within the normal range for age. Flow rates were defined
      abnormal if they were &gt;2 SD of the expected normal mean
      [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. Bladder US was then repeated
      immediately after voiding to measure any postvoid residual
      volume (PVR), when &gt;10% of voided volume was considered
      significant [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. Parental consent was
      obtained for all patients and the project was approved by the
      local research ethics committee. The results were expressed
      as means, SD and range, with statistical analysis using an
      unpaired Student's <i>t</i>-test, with <i>P</i> &gt;0.05
      taken to indicate significant differences.</p>

      <h5>RESULTS</h5>

      <p class="text1">In all, 54 boys were referred for
      circumcision by their GP over the 14-month study period; 37
      boys had physiological phimosis and were eligible for
      inclusion. Four patients/parents did not agree to participate
      because of embarrassment or a perceived lack of time to
      complete the tests. One boy had his initial US but became
      anxious on attempting uroflow and was unable to cooperate
      with further testing. Thus 32 boys completed the study (mean
      age 6.7 years, range 3&ndash;12); 18 had physiological
      phimosis with ballooning of the foreskin (mean age 6.8 years,
      range 3&ndash;12) and 14 without (mean age 6.5 years, range
      4&ndash;11). The age distribution is shown in Fig. 1. All
      boys had a normal unscarred foreskin and no patient proceeded
      to circumcision. All patients had normal US appearances of
      the upper urinary tract (no hydronephrosis, no hydroureter
      and normal echogenicity of the kidneys) and none had evidence
      of increased bladder wall thickness.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text1">There was a normal bell-shaped smooth
      uroflow curve in 29 (91%) of the boys assessed (Fig. 2a);
      there was a slow initial rise and an increased time to
      achieve Q<sub>max</sub> (greater than the normally expected
      third of the total voiding time [<a href="#n12">12</a>]) in
      one boy with ballooning (Fig. 2b) and two boys with no
      ballooning had flat-topped, plateau-type curves (Fig. 2c).
      However, All Q<sub>max</sub> were within the normal range
      when correlated with voided volumes and compared to
      established nomograms (Fig. 3). The mean Q<sub>max</sub> was
      15.3 (4.4, 9&ndash;24) mL/s in the ballooning group. The boys
      with no ballooning of the foreskin had a mean Q<sub>max</sub>
      of 15.4 (2.9, 10.7&ndash;20) mL/s; there was no significant
      difference between them (<i>P</i> =0.96).</p>

      <center>
        <img src="babu1-fig2.jpg" alt="Figure two." />
      </center>

      <p class="text1">The patients with ballooning of the foreskin
      had a mean PVR of 3.5 (5.1, 0&ndash;18) mL and those without
      6.1 (10.7, 0&ndash;38) mL; there was no significant
      difference (P =0.37). Only one patient had a PVR of &gt;10%
      of voided volume (38 mL, voided volume 262 mL) despite a
      normal flow rate (13.9 mL/s) and is under continued
      follow-up.</p>

      <h5>DISCUSSION</h5>

      <p class="text1">At birth most boys have an unretractable
      prepuce because the inner surface of the foreskin is
      developmentally fused to the underlying glans penis. By a
      process of desquamation the two epidermal surfaces separate
      throughout childhood forming a complete preputial space; only
      4% of newborns have a fully retractable prepuce, by the age
      of 3 years, 90% of boys have retractile foreskins [<a
      href="#n6">6</a>] and at 16&ndash;17 years only 1% of young
      men have persistent phimosis [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. Boys with
      physiological phimosis and ballooning of the prepuce have
      unretractile foreskins and are often referred by their GP for
      assessment of a `tight' prepuce, with a presumed need for
      circumcision. Griffiths and Frank [<a href="#n8">8</a>]
      reported that 36 (30%) of 120 boys referred for circumcision
      had ballooning and 50 (42%) had an unretractile or partially
      retractile foreskin. Williams <i>et al.</i> [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>] noted that 10 (14%) of 69 boys referred
      with penile problems complained of ballooning and 30 (43%)
      had a healthy unretractile foreskin on outpatient assessment.
      Although follow-up details are not provided for the boys
      treated conservatively in these reports, spontaneous
      resolution is to be expected, given the data provided by
      Gairdner [<a href="#n6">6</a>] and &Oslash;ster [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>] in their papers on the fate of the
      foreskin. In the present study we documented 37 (69%) of 54
      boys referred for circumcision as having physiological
      phimosis, which would indicate a high level of
      `inappropriate' referrals for circumcision. This prompted us
      to make improvements in educating local GPs in
      differentiating between true phimosis and the healthy
      unretractile foreskin.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The statement in the paragraph
      above that "90% of boys have retractile foreskins is
      incorrect. It is based on half-century-old incorrect data
      that was supplied by Gairdner in 1949. Numerous later studies
      have shown this figure to be incorrect. CIRP believes that
      about 44% of boys have retractile foreskins by age ten. See
      <a href="/library/normal/">Normal Development</a> for more
      information.]</p>

      <p class="text1">Many parents are of the opinion that an
      unretractile foreskin and relatively narrow preputial
      opening, as seen in physiological phimosis, predisposes to
      urinary flow problems, and feel their suspicions are amply
      justified when they notice `alarming' foreskin ballooning.
      Although published data on the natural history of
      physiological phimosis suggests a benign, self-limiting
      condition, there is little objective evidence to refute these
      parental concerns, and to assist GPs in offering appropriate
      advice and reassurance. Online searches of Medline, the
      National Library of Medicine (PubMed), the Cochrane Library
      and `Turning Research Into Practice' databases revealed no
      articles investigating a possible relationship between
      physiological phimosis and obstructed voiding. In the present
      study, uroflowmetry in boys with physiological phimosis
      showed values of Q<sub>max</sub> vs volume voided within the
      normal range for age, and Q<sub>max</sub> values were not
      significantly different in boys with or without ballooning.
      These data together with the insignificant PVRs suggest that
      voiding efficiency in both groups is normal. Further
      supportive evidence of a lack of BOO is provided by the
      normal bladder wall thickness data.</p>

      <p class="text1">With regard to flow curve characteristics,
      Segura [<a href="#n12">12</a>] stated that `all morphologies
      that differ from the standard or bell-shaped curve must be
      considered as potentially anomalous,' and although in that
      paper he did not state whether the boys were circumcised or
      not, our few cases with abnormal flow patterns are of
      interest, and perhaps of some concern. However, it is well
      known that most of the features seen in the flow pattern of
      an obstructed individual can be seen in patients with normal
      voiding, and controversy still exists as to the value of
      specific flow-rate pattern analysis [<a href="#n13">13</a>].
      It is possible that a distensible preputial sac in boys with
      ballooning produces a dampening of response on uroflow, which
      could lead to a slow initial increase in flow and prolonged
      time to achieve Q<sub>max</sub>. In addition, the
      unretractile relatively narrow preputial opening of some boys
      might provide a constant, physiologically unimportant
      restriction to flow that is nevertheless sufficient to result
      in a plateau-type flow curve. The significance of these rarer
      flow rate patterns is unclear. For example, is it possible
      that these abnormal flow patterns are associated with longer
      term problems and persistent unretractability after puberty?
      If this were the case circumcision could be offered
      appropriately at an early stage in these boys, with the aim
      of preventing potential morbidity related to phimosis,
      including painful erections and possible adverse experiences
      on sexual debut. Obviously, clinical follow-up data are
      required to assess the significance of these subtle flow-rate
      findings.</p>

      <p class="text1">In this study we analysed whether
      physiological phimosis with or without ballooning of the
      prepuce is associated with evidence of obstructed voiding,
      using noninvasive uroflowmetry and US measurement of PVRs.
      These variables have been used by others as measures of
      voiding efficiency in children, e.g. after hypospadias repair
      [<a href="#n11">11,14</a>]. Bladder outflow problems cannot
      be excluded by these tests and formal invasive pressure-flow
      studies would be required to provide definitive data
      excluding obstruction. However, we would consider an
      investigation of this type inappropriate and possibly
      unethical in this patient group, because of the usual
      self-limiting nature of physiological phimosis. A criticism
      of this study could be that we only obtained one data-set for
      each patient, as it is known that flow-rate measurements
      often show considerable variation within patients [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>]. This was not done as we were concerned
      that participation in the study might be compromised if
      families had to stay in the clinic for several hours or
      attend on more than once. Notwithstanding these limitations,
      the present study failed to show any evidence of obstructed
      voiding in boys with physiological phimosis, whether
      ballooning was present or not.</p>

      <p class="text1">In conclusion, the noninvasive assessment of
      voiding efficiency in boys with physiological phimosis with
      or without ballooning of the foreskin, using uroflowmetry,
      PVR and assessment of bladder wall thickness, showed no
      evidence of obstructed voiding. Normal bell-shaped flow
      curves were obtained in most patients. The follow-up of boys
      with plateau-type curves and flows with a slow initial
      increase would be of interest.</p>
