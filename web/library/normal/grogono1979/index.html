      <h4>The case against neonatal circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text1"><span class="salutation">Sir</span>,&mdash;I
      have recently retired from some 15 years as the part-time
      medical officer of a large boys&rsquo; school. Having read
      your <a href="/library/general/BMJ/">leading article</a> (5
      May, p 1163) about circumcision I regret that I did not keep
      statistics and that a clinical impression will have to
      suffice.</p>

      <p class="text2">At school entry at age 11, very few (other
      than Jews) had been circumcised. Quite a lot, between 10% and
      40% had foreskins which would not easily retract. None of
      these had any history of pain or difficulty in micturition. I
      watched the first batches annually and anxiously, but soon
      learnt that by age 14 or 15 nearly all had become normally
      retractable. I only recall two circumcisions, with an annual
      intake of about 100. Obviously nearly all of those had
      preputial adhesions and no phimosis. Probably a vigorous and
      painful examination at the age of 11 would have found the
      rare true phimosis sooner. I thought, and still think, it
      unjustifiable and indeed contraindicated. What are the
      experiences of other school medical officers?</p>
