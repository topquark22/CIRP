        <p><font face="arial">Nature's Assurance That the
        Uncircumcised Glans Penis<br />
         Will Function Smoothly is Provided by Smegma</font></p>

        <p><img src="Fig1.gif" alt="Figure one." /></p>

        <p><i>Smegma is secreted by glands beneath<br />
         the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis.</i></p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Smegma useful?
      Yes, certainly. It lubricates the cavity between the foreskin
      of the penis and the glans, thus allowing smooth movement
      between them during intercourse.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During an erection,
      the glans increases in size. The foreskin, on the other hand
      does not change its dimensions. It is yielding enough and
      thin enough to accept the enlarged glans. Furthermore, the
      foreskin is pressed backward during intercourse, and on
      subsidence of erection returns to its normal position.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These movements are
      not entirely passive but are aided by the relaxation of the
      <a href="/library/anatomy/lakshmanan/">muscle fibers</a>
      within the foreskin.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But could these
      movements be comfortably performed if the surfaces between
      glans and foreskin were dry and harsh? Of course not. There
      would be difficulty, delay, need fro manipulation. Nature has
      therefore provided a &ldquo;natural ointment,&rdquo; smegma
      to ensure easy lubrication and protect this delicate region
      of the male genital organ.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To secure its even
      distribution, smegma is formed from the whole inner surface
      of the foreskin cavity. Recently, Soviet researchers at the
      Botkin's Hospital in Moscow have discovered important details
      of this process.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smegma production,
      they find, is concentrated in the cells of innumerable small
      prominences, minute microscopic protrusions of various shapes
      and sizes found on the inner surface of the foreskin
      cavity.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process is a
      continuous one: living cells are constantly growing toward
      the surface, only to undergo fatty degeneration in their turn
      and separate off as freshly formed smegma.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These smegma-forming
      prominences vary with the age of the individual. The
      prominences may be present in fair numbers, even in infants
      and young children, but they reach their largest size and
      greatest number in men between ages 20 and 40. Thereafter,
      the smegma-forming prominences regress until, in elderly men,
      they can be detected only in an atrophied form.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These findings tally
      with the amount of smegma produced at various ages.
      Comparatively little is formed in childhood. A noticeable
      increase occurs during adolescence, with its great
      acceleration of penis growth.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
      understandable because the penis is developing into its
      mature and adult form. Smegma is needed for the smooth
      operation of erection particularly during adolescence when
      sexual thoughts and dreams, nocturnal erections, and
      masturbation are common.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adult stage
      follows with its period of maximal sexual activity. Sexual
      intercourse becomes a regular feature of life and the
      function of smegma for lubrication assumes its full value.
      Middle age follows with a decline in amount until there is a
      virtual absence of the substance in old age.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These findings are,
      of course, subject to individual differences; in some men,
      the penis remains well preserved and functional even into
      extreme old age.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does smegma also
      contain sebum, the natural oil produced by the sebaceous
      glands or ordinary skin? This question has been debated for
      mary years but Soviet researchers have at last supplied the
      answer.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They find that in
      childhood sebaceous glands are in fact present in the inner
      surface of the foreskin. As age advances, these glands
      decrease in number and in adult life occur only at the base
      of the foreskin, inconstantly and sparsely.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other researchers
      have found them in rather large numbers in some individuals.
      But in general, it is now clear that while sebum forms an
      essential part of smegma in childhood it makes no significant
      contribution to it in later life.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attention has also
      been directed to certain papules present in some men on the
      corona of the glans. Recently naming them "pearly penile
      papules" - or P-3, for short - an American physician
      considers they are probably more common than in generally
      realized. They rarely cause trouble and, since they consist
      only of a network of blood vessels surrounded by connective
      tissue, they take no part in smegma production.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smegma is a substance
      of considerable chemical complexity, but little is known of
      its exact composition beyond the fact that it contains
      neutral fats, fatty acids, sterols; other lipids and cell
      debris.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific
      investigation is difficult because on exposure smegma readily
      undergoes changes in chemical composition and physical
      consistancy.; it can differ in color from yellow to white and
      may vary between individuals at different stages of life.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also varies in
      amount in relation to the so-called "smegma producing
      capacity" of the foreskin cavity. In other words, a long or
      wide foreskin produces more smegma than a short or narrow
      one. This is to be expected since the function of smegma is
      to produce a uniform general lubrication between foreskin and
      glans.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do these matters
      affect American men? Circumcision in infancy is a near
      routine procedure in the United States. Hence, as an American
      doctor recently stated, "the uncircumcised male . . . is
      becoming a rarity in our society." One must suppose then that
      most men would lack smegma though an absence of foreskin.
      <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: This paragraph which was
      published in September 1970 is outmoded. In 1971, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics stated, "there are no valid
      medical reasons for circumcision in the neonatal period." In
      1989, the AAP amplified this by stating, "It (circumcision)
      is an elective procedure to be performed only if the infant
      is stable and healthy." In 1995, the AAP said, "A patients
      reluctance or refusal to assent should also carry
      considerable weight when the proposed intervention is not
      essential to his or her welfare and/or can be deferred
      without substantial risks." In addition, parents are becoming
      more aware of the negative consequences of circumcision. All
      of this has contributed to the rapid decline of infant
      circumcision in America. The US government reported that the
      intact rate for 1993 had climbed to more than
      40%.]</b></font></p>

      <p>This will be true for those whose circumcision is
      complete. However the operation is by no means an
      "all-or-none" procedure. Surveys have shown that as many as
      one-third of circumcised men are left with a portion of
      foreskin that partially covers the glans.</p>

      <p>Adding to their number those individuals who have never
      been circumcised, we find a sizeable portion of men are still
      in possession of foreskins. Hence, from the practical point
      of view, it is important that they should realize the need
      for cleanliness of the foreskin cavity. This means, in effect
      keeping it free from an undesirable collection of smegma.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its fresh state,
      smegma is a wholesome and functional lubricant. But, if
      allowed to accumulate in the foreskin cavity, it becomes
      changed into an unpleasant, unhealthy, and bad-smelling
      substance.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such changes are due
      to chemical splitting of smegma fats and the action of skin
      germs, which are otherwise harmless. In addition, foreign
      material may gain access to the smegma deposit in the form of
      dirt, dust or sand, and urine and semen.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, a healthy
      foreskin can be retracted for cleansing and smegma can be
      removed by washing. The fact that it is a superficial
      substance renders its removal easy, provided cleansing is
      performed with regularity. Particular attention should be
      given to the depths of the foreskin where smegma is liable to
      lodge in the pocket between foreskin and glans.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To these must be
      added phimosis, or narrowing of the foreskin opening at its
      free end, which in extreme cases, becomes converted to a hard
      and rigid ring.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are conditions
      that require medical attention. This is necessary in order to
      regain genital health and restore enjoyable sexual relations,
      which though foreskin discomfort, may have become a source of
      unhappiness.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without correct
      treatment, ill health of the foreskin is liable to worsen -
      formation of smegma continues and, without outlet or access
      for cleaning, deposits collect and harden within the foreskin
      cavity. Such compact masses of smegma can lead to chronic
      disease, and even prepare the way for cancerous changes.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancer of the penis
      is not common in the United States but is frequent in certain
      tropical countries. It is almost always associated with
      uncleanliness and longstanding ill health of the penis.
      Usually a preceeding phimosis is present. Since the tumor
      commonly develops with such a closed foreskin cavity, it has
      been considered that retained smegma could be the
      cancer-inducing agent. <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note:
      Cancer of the penis is now known to be associated with the
      presence of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Cancer of the
      penis may occur in both circumcised and uncircumcised men if
      HPV is present. Additional risk factors are hygiene, genital
      warts, and number of sexual partners. Smegma is not now
      believed to be carcinogenic.]</b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless,
      experimental investigation of this so-called "smegma theory
      of genital cancer" has had little direct bearing on cancer in
      the male sex. Rather, it has been concerned with the
      causation of cervical carcinoma in in women. (cancer of the
      neck of the womb.) This might be conceivably be induced by
      smegma transferred to the vagina by the male during sexual
      intercourse.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such research is
      beset with difficulties. In the first place, distinction must
      be made between normal smegma and accumulated smegma, which
      has undergone a variety of changes in the warmth of the
      foreskin cavity. Hence, any potential cancer-inducing
      property could well lie in products formed by chemical
      breakdown or bacterial action rather than in smegma
      itself.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further problem
      arises in collection of fresh smegma in sufficient amount for
      experimental research. For this reason some workers have used
      smegma from horses because these animals produce it is large
      amounts. But despite repeated inoculations of horse smegma
      into the vaginas of laboratory animals, the results have been
      conflicting with regard to its inducing malignant
      disease.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly a number of
      factors are involved in the causation of malignant disease of
      the genital organs. Whether smegma does or does not play a
      part will be known only when the causes of cancerous changes
      in general become clear. <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: It
      is now clear that smegma is not a carcinogen. Cancer of the
      genital organs are caused by HPV and smoking. See <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/">Cancer</a> for more
      information.]</b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, personal
      hygiene and care of the penis rank high as a protection
      against chronic disease. Remember that it is stale and
      accumulated smegma that is a source of ill health for the
      penis. Freshly formed smegma, washed away regularly and
      constantly replenishing itself, is a wholesome lubricant -
      making for ease in erection and smoothness in sexual
      intercourse.</p>
