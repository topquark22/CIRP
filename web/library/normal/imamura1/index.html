      <h2>Phimosis of infants and young children in Japan.</h2>

      <p><b>Imamura E.</b></p>

      <p>Department of Pediatrics, <a href="http://www.imcj.go.jp/"
      target="_blank">International Medical Center of Japan</a>,
      Tokyo, Japan.</p>

      <p>The prepuce and glans was examined in 4521 healthy infants
      and young children with a birthweight over 2600 g. There were
      3238 infants aged 1-12 months and 1283 children aged 3 years.
      There is no custom of circumcision in Japan. The term
      phimosis implies the adhesion of the prepuce and glans, which
      cannot be separated by manipulation. Phimosis was found in
      88.5% of infants aged 1-3 months, and the corresponding
      figures at the ages of 4-6 months, 7-9 months, 10-12 months
      and 3 years were: 74.4, 63.9, 58.0 and 35.0%, respectively.
      However, cases where the prepuce could be retracted by gentle
      manipulation were found in 3.0% of infants aged 1-3 months,
      19.9% of those aged 10-12 months and increased to 38.4% of
      children aged 3 years, which exceeded the rate of phimosis.
      The complete adhesion of prepuce and glans was found in many
      infants, and a small space between the prepuce and glans was
      observed in some cases of 3-year-old boys. The smegma was
      notable in only 16 cases (0.5%) of infants and in 5 cases
      (0.4%) of the 3-year-olds. Balanoposthitis was found in only
      one case of the 3-year-olds. <span class="yellow">It is not
      recommended to separate the foreskin by manipulation, which
      sometimes leads to bleeding or paraphimosis. And it is not
      necessary to surgically correct phimosis in infancy and early
      childhood except in the case of accompanying urological
      disturbance.</span></p>
