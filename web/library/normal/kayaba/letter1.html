Dear Mr Falk,<P>

Thank you for your letter of 23 November.<P>

As an author of the <A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/kayaba/">article</A> which you have read in the <I>Journal of
Urology</I>, I reply to your question about the incidence of urinary
tract infection among the subjects in the article.  The statement
that "no boy had a urinary tract infection" means that none had a
symptomatic UTI, at least, at the time of examination.  Though,
there were no clinical evidence of UTI described in patient's
records describing their clinical history, there remains the
possibility of undiagnosed or subclinical UTI.  One boy aged 2
years included in this study had UTI (non-bacterial acute
cystitis) after the accomplishment of our study.  The true
incidence of urinary tract infection in a population is not easy
to know.  When I have a febrile child in our out patient clinic,
I do not always order urinalysis.  Pharyngitis, tonsillitis,
bronchitis, pneumonia, colitis and generalized viral infection
are the cause of fever in the majority of cases.<P>

I believe that the incidence of UTI in boys is very low compared
to those of URI or other infective disease, but there remains the
possibility that some patients receive medication before accurate
diagnosis of UTI is made.  When I suspect UTI as a cause of
fever, I observe urinary sediments obtained from spontaneously
voided urine.  I do not prefer invasive diagnostic procedure as
catheterization of puncture of the urinary bladder which Dr.
Wiswell described in his paper.  One may criticize me that the
diagnosis of UTI is inaccurate and its incidence may be
underestimated.  It is not a main purpose of our work to cal-
culate the incidence of UTI nor to criticize the result of the
paper by Dr. Wiswell.  You should be aware of the difference of
the age distribution of the subjects and of the method between
the studies by Dr.Wiswell and me.  It needs more strict study,
dealing with a large number of subjects in the same social class,
comparing the incidence of UTI between circumcised and uncircum-
cised boys to criticize (or support) the results reported by Dr.
Wiswell.<P>

As a pediatric surgeon, I believe that all the children should be
protected from unnecessary surgery.  The controversy on circum-
cision lasting for these decades in USA may be indicating that
neonatal circumcision is not a scientific surgery but a cultural
one.  It is an enigma that USA, one of the most sophisticated
countries criticizing some African people performing clitoridectomy
to young girls, has many neonates whose prepuce are circumcised
in hospitals.  It will take a long time to break with a custom,
and need long lasting activity of CIRP.<P>

I would like to know the reason why the sculpture of David by
Michelangelo (1475-1564) has no evidence of surgery on his
prepuce.  Please let me know if you have any information.<P>

I hope that things are going well for CIRP.<P>

Yours, sincerely<P>
