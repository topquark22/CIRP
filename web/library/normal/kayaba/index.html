        <p>Purpose: We evaluated preputial development in Japanese
        boys.</p>

        <p>Materials &amp; Methods: Preputial retractability and
        formation of a tight ring were evaluated in 603 Japanese
        boys 0 to 15 years old.</p>

        <p>The incidence of a completely retractable prepuce
        gradually increased from 0% at age 6 months to 62.9% by 11
        to 15 years, while that of a tight ring decreased with age
        from 84.3% to 8.6%. Nine boys had balanoposthitis but none
        had a symptomatic urinary tract infection. <i><a
        href="letter1.html">[clarification]</a></i></p>

        <p>Conclusions: <span class="yellow">Incomplete separation
        of the prepuce is common and normal in neonates and
        infants, and preputial separation progresses until
        adolescence. Awareness of these findings will eliminate
        unnecessary circumcision in boys.</span></p>

      <p class="text1">While neonatal circumcision has not been
      common in Japan, an increasing number of parents insist on
      circumcision of the prepuce in infancy due to
      unretractability. The American Academy of Pediatrics has
      concluded that "newborn circumcision has potential medical
      benefits as well as disadvantages and risks."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Reasons for performing circumcision
      include the prevention of balanoposthitis, phimosis with
      preputial ballooning, urinary tract infection, sexually
      transmitted diseases, and cervical and penile cancer. Reasons
      for not performing circumcision include pain, requirement of
      local anesthesia, contraindications and complications. While
      more than 60% of neonates are circumcised in the United
      States, controversy continues on whether neonatal
      circumcision should be performed.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The majority of neonates have physiological
      phimosis or an inability to retract the prepuce. During the
      first 3 or 4 years of life growth of the penile body,
      accumulation of epithelial debris, and intermittent penile
      erections eventually separate the prepuce from the glans,
      permitting retraction.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> reported that
      about 90% of prepuces become retractable by age 3 years in
      European boys,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> which suggests
      that knowledge of the natural history of the prepuce will
      eliminate unnecessary surgical trauma of the male genitalia.
      We evaluated preputial retractability in 603 Japanese boys
      due to the lack of information on development of the prepuce
      in this population.</p>

      <h4 align="center">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</h4>

      <p class="text1">We evaluated 603 Japanese boys 0 to 15 years
      old (average 3.8) who presented at our outpatient clinic from
      September 1994 to September 1995. With the subject relaxed
      and supine the prepuce was gently retracted without traumatic
      force and the degree of preputial retractability as well as
      presence or absence of a tight ring was determined. Preputial
      status was classified into 5 types based on preputial
      retractability: type I - no retraction of prepuce at all,
      type II - external urethral meatus exposure only, type III
      (intermediate) - glans exposure halfway to the sulcus of the
      corona, type IV - glans exposure to above the corona at the
      site of the preputial adhesion and type V -easy exposure of
      the whole glans (fig. 1). A tight ring was defined as a
      stenotic ring that prevented the prepuce from being
      retracted, or constricted the glans or penile shaft during
      retraction of the prepuce.</p>

      <h4 align="center">RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="text1">Of the 603 boys 3 were excluded from study
      due to previous surgery for phimosis. The degree of preputial
      separation increased with age (fig. 2). Before age 6 months
      the incidence of types I (completely unretractable) to V
      (completely retract- able) prepuce was 47.1, 21.5, 29.4, 2
      and 0% respectively. None of the 111 boys younger than 1 year
      had a type V prepuce. In the 3 to 4-year-old boys types I and
      V prepuce were noted in 6.2 and 16.5% respectively. The
      incidence of types I and II prepuce decreased from 68.6% at
      ages 0 to 6 months to less than 10% at age 5 years. Of the 11
      to 15-year-old subjects the prepuce was type V in 62.9%, type
      IV in 11.4% and type I in none.</p>

      <p class="text1">A tight ring was frequently noted in infancy
      but the incidence also decreased with age (84.3% at ages 0 to
      6 months, episodes of paraphimosis occurred and no boy had a
      urinary tract infection. So called pinhole prepuce, the most
      severe form of unretractable prepuce, was noted in only 4
      children younger than 2 years. Balanoposthitis was present in
      9 of the 565 boys (1.5%) 1.9 to 10 years old, including 2
      older than 8 years with Type IV and 7 younger than 5 years
      with types I to III prepuces.</p>

          <p class="fig">Figure 2. Distribution of types of
          prepuce. Degree of preputial separation increases with
          age. Before age 6 months incidence of types I and II was
          47.1 and 21.5% respectively. Thereafter type III prepuce
          was most common until preschool age. Of the 11 to
          15-year-old subjects 62.5% had type V prepuce.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h4 align="center">DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce appears as a ring of thickened
      epidermis at 8 weeks of gestation and grows toward the tip of
      the glans until 16 weeks of gestation. Separation of the
      prepuce from the glans begins by 24 weeks of gestation. The
      stage of preputial separation reached at birth varies greatly
      among individuals.<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig3.gif" alt="graph" /> 

        <p class="fig">Fig. 3. Incidence of tight ring in prepuce
        was 84.3% at ages 0<br />
         to 6 months but it decreased with age to 8.6% at 11 to 15
        years.</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Others have stated that preputial separation
      should be sufficient by 10 days of life to allow mechanical
      retraction without tearing the epithelium.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Nevertheless, in all of the Japanese
      male infants younger than 1 year in our study there was the
      same degree of difficulty in retracting the prepuce (types I
      to IV). The incidence of highly unretractable prepuce (types
      I to II). was approximately 70% by age 6 months and 50% by 12
      months. These findings support those of Gairdner, who studied
      500 English boys 0 to 13 years old.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Our study revealed a decreased
      frequency of unretractable prepuce and tight ring formation
      in the older age group. However, it is not easy to make a
      clear distinction between a tight ring that resolves
      spontaneously and a pathological tight ring that will
      eventually need surgical treatment. The incidence of
      completely retractable prepuce (type V) increased from 0% at
      age 6 months to 62.9% at age 11 to 15 years, while that of a
      tight ring decreased from 84.3 to 8.6%. <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a> examined
      preputial development in Danish boys 6 to 17 years old,
      including 173 monitored annually for 7 years, and reported
      that the incidence of preputial adhesion decreased from 70%
      at ages 6 to 7 years to 5% at 16 to 17 years.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> <span class="yellow">These findings
      indicate that incomplete preputial separation is common and
      normal in neonates and infants, and preputial separation
      progresses until school age.</span></p>

      <p class="text1">Incomplete preputial separation has been
      considered responsible for colonization of the prepuce by
      pathogens, which lead to balanoposthitis or urinary tract
      infection. In fact, all 9 boys with balanoposthitis in our
      series had an incompletely retractable prepuce. However, the
      incidence of this condition was only 1.5% and 7 boys were
      from 1 to 5 years old. Nogueras et al reported that 38 boys
      of 55 boys (69%) with balanitis were 1 to 4 years old and 6
      were younger than 1 year.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> This
      observation suggests that poor genital hygiene in preschool
      boys is more responsible for balanoposthitis than
      unretractablity of the prepuce. Wiswell and Roscelli showed
      that the incidence of urinary tract infection is lower in
      circumcised than uncircumcised infants.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> A reduced incidence of urinary tract
      infection may be at least one medical benefit but it is not a
      decisive reason for justifying indiscriminate circumcision.
      While circumcision should be performed in select cases, it is
      difficult to determine the neonate who ultimately will need
      circumcision. More detailed longitudinal study is needed to
      make a clear distinction between pathological and
      physiological phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text1">The incidence of penile cancer, which
      develops primarily in uncircumcised men, is reported to be
      exceedingly low in Scandanavian countries, where few men are
      circumcised but genital hygiene is excellent.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Before considering circumcision or
      application of estrogen cream<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup>. physicians and parents should
      encourage boys to wash their hands frequently and to learn
      basic hygiene. We agree with <a
      href="/library/general/wallerstein/">Wallerstein</a> that in
      the absence of emergency medical problems the prepuce of
      infants should remain uncircumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <h4 align="center">CONCLUSIONS</h4>

      <p class="text1">In most male individuals preputial
      separation continues until adolescence, presumably to protect
      the premature glans penis. Physicians as well as parents
      should be familiar with the biological role and natural
      development of the prepuce. While surgery must be considered
      in the presence of paraphimosis or dysuria associated with
      phimosis, few boys require circumcision until adolescence
      when the only reason for this procedure is poor preputial
      retractability.</p>
