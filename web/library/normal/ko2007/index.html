      <h2>Age-specific Prevalence Rates of Phimosis and

      <br />
       <b>Background/Purpose:</b> To estimate the age-specific
      prevalence rates of phimosis and circumcision in an urban
      sample of Taiwanese boys.<br />
       <b>Methods:</b> A convenience sample of 1145 boys aged from
      7 to 13 years was enrolled and cross-sectionally evaluated
      for preputial retractability and status of circumcision.
      Another convenience sample of 59 newborn male infants was
      enrolled from the infant room of a city municipal hospital.
      These infants were examined for preputial development at
      birth.<br />
       <b>Results:</b> None of the newborn male infants had a
      completely retractable prepuce (i.e. type 3). The prevalence
      rate of type 3 prepuce increased with age from 71.7% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 66.5&ndash;75.5%) for boys aged 7
      years to 72.4% (95% CI, 67.3&ndash;77.0%) for boys aged 10
      years and 84.1% (95% CI, 79.6&ndash;88.0%) for boys aged 13
      years. In contrast, the prevalence rate of type 1 prepuce
      decreased with age from 83.1% (95% CI, 71.0&ndash;91.6%) for
      newborn infants to 0.3% (95% CI, 0.0001&ndash;1.8%) for boys
      aged 13 years. On the other hand, the prevalence of
      circumcision slightly increased with age from 7.2% (95% CI,
      5.3&ndash;10.8%) for boys aged 7 years to 8.7% (95% CI,
      6.5&ndash;13.3%) for boys aged 13 years.<br />
       <b>Conclusion:</b> Nonretractability of the prepuce was very
      common among the Taiwanese newborns. <span
      class="yellow">Among the school boys, the degree of preputial
      separation and exposure of glans increased with age and
      progressed even more rapidly in adolescence.</span> Very few
      boys still suffered from unretractable prepuce by the age of
      13. [<i>J Formos Med Assoc</i>
