      <h2>Newborns:<br />
      Care of the<br />
      Uncircumcised Penis</h2>

      <p>At birth, the penis consists of a cylindrical shaft with a
      rounded end called the glans. The shaft and glans are
      separated by a groove called the sulcus. The entire penis -
      shaft and glans - is covered by a continuous layer of skin.
      The section of the penile skin that covers the glans is
      called the foreskin or prepuce. The foreskin consists of two
      layers, the outer foreskin and an inner lining similar to a
      mucous membrane.</p>

      <p>Before birth, the foreskin and glans develop as one
      tissue. The foreskin is firmly attached - really fused - to
      the glans. Over time, this fusion of the inner surface of the
      prepuce with the glans skin begins to separate by shedding
      the cells from the surface of each layer. Epithelial layers
      of the glans and the inner foreskin lining are regularly
      replaced, not only in infancy but throughout life. The
      discarded cells accumulate as whitish, cheesy ``pearls''
      which gradually work their way out via the tip of the
      foreskin.</p>

      <p>Eventually, sometimes as long as 5, 10, or more years
      after birth, full separation occurs and the foreskin may then
      be pushed back away from the glans toward the abdomen. This
      is called foreskin retraction. The foreskin may retract
      spontaneously with erections which occur normally from birth
      on and even occur in fetal life. Also, all children
      ``discover'' their genitals as they become more aware of
      their bodies and may retract the foreskin themselves. If the
      foreskin does not seem to retract easily early in life, it is
      important to realize that this is not abnormal and that it
      should eventually do so.</p>

      <p>[<b>The Function of the Foreskin:</b> The glans at birth
      is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The
      foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision this protection
      is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary
      opening (meatus) may become irritated or infected, causing
      ulcers, meatitis (inflammation of the meatus), and meatal
      stenosis (a narrowing of the urinary opening). Such problems
      virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin
      protects the glans throughout life.] <span><i>[CIRP Note:
      This important paragraph, and the drawing, were printed in
      the 1984 edition of this pamphlet; but were removed in the
      1990 version!]</i></span></p>

      <p><b>Infant Smegma:</b> Skin cells from the glans of the
      penis and the inner foreskin are shed throughout life. This
      is especially true in childhood; natural skin shedding serves
      to separate the foreskin from the glans. Since this shedding
      takes place in a relatively closed space - with the foreskin
      covering the glans - the shed skin cells cannot escape in the
      usual manner. They escape by working their way to the tip of
      the foreskin. These escaping discarded skin cells constitute
      infant smegma, which may appear as white ``pearls'' under the
      skin.</p>

      <p><b>Adult Smegma:</b> Specialized sebaceous glands -
      Tyson's Glands - which are located on the glans under the
      foreskin, are largely inactive in childhood. At puberty,
      Tyson's Glands produce an oily substance, which, when mixed
      with shed skin cells, constitute adult smegma. Adult smegma
      serves a protective, lubricating function for the glans.</p>

      <p><b>Foreskin Hygiene:</b> The foreskin is easy to care for.
      The infant should be bathed or sponged frequently, and all
      parts should be washed including the genitals. The
      uncircumcised penis is easy to keep clean. No special care is
      required! No attempt should be made to forcibly retract the
      foreskin. No manipulation is necessary. There is no need for
      special cleansing with Q-tips, irrigation, or antiseptics;
      soap and water externally will suffice.</p>

      <p><b>Foreskin Retraction:</b> As noted, the foreskin and
      glans develop as one tissue. Separation will evolve over
      time. It should not be forced. When will separation occur?
      Each child is different. Separation may occur before birth;
      this is rare. It may take a few days, weeks, months, or even
      years. <i>This is normal.</i> Although many foreskins will
      retract by age 5, there is no need for concern even after a
      longer period. [<span><i>1984 version only:</i></span> No
      harm will come in leaving the foreskin alone.] Some boys do
      not attain full retractability of the foreskin until
      adolescence.</p>

      <p><b>Hygiene of the Fully Retracted Foreskin:</b> For the
      first few years, an occasional retraction with cleansing
      beneath is sufficient.</p>

      <p>Penile hygiene will later become a part of a child's total
      body hygiene, including hair shampooing, cleansing the folds
      of the ear, and brushing teeth. At puberty, the male should
      be taught the importance of retracting the foreskin and
      cleaning beneath during his daily bath.</p>

      <p><b>Summary:</b> Care of the uncircumcised boy is quite
      easy. ``Leave it alone'' is good advice. External washing and
      rinsing on a daily basis is all that is required. Do not
      retract the foreskin in an infant, as it is almost always
      attached to the glans. Forcing the foreskin back may harm the
      penis, causing pain, bleeding, and possibly adhesions. The
      natural separation of the foreskin from the glans may take
      many years. After puberty, the adult male learns to retract
      the foreskin and cleanse under it on a daily basis.</p>
