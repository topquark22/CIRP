      <h2>The normal foreskin in the young child.</h2>

      <p>To the editor:</p>

      <p class="2">In the Paediatric Casualty Department at the
      Johannesburg Hospital we frequently see children with torn
      foreskins caused by forcing the foreskin back over the glans
      penis. The damage is most often done by clinic sisters, but I
      regret to say that it is sometimes caused by general
      practitioners who seem to be unaware of the normal
      development of the foreskin.</p>

      <p class="2">The normal foreskin will in the normal course of
      events dilate sufficiently to slip over the head of the penis
      by 5 or 6 years of age. <span class="cirp">[CIRP note: The
      previous statement is not completely accurate. Later studies
      show that many boys do not achieve full retractability of
      their prepuce until after puberty.]</span> It does not
      require anyone's help to do this. The head of the penis does
      not require cleaning. Nature does the job very efficiently by
      means of natural secretions. The white material which
      collects under the foreskin is not dirt or pus but good
      healthy epithelial debris which will slowly but surely
      separate the adherent foreskin from the glans better than any
      nurse or doctor should do it.</p>

      <p class="2">Lastly, a lot of infants are diagnosed as having
      phimosis because of incorrect technique in examining the
      penis. The foreskin should not be pushed back over the penis
      in babies, as this makes the opening look smaller than it is.
      It should be lifted up as in Fig. 1, and the opening will
      usually be found big enough to drop a football in (well,
      almost!).</p>

            <th colspan="2"><img src="catzel.gif"
            alt="(illustration)" /></th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th><b><u>Incorrect Method</u></b><br />
             If foreskin is pushed downward<br />
             it makes the opening look smaller.</th>

            <th><b><u>Correct method</u></b><br />
             If foreskin is grasped with both index fingers and
            thumbs<br />
             and pulled upward the true size of the opening is
            apparent.</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th colspan="2">
              <h4>Fig 1. Examination of the foreskin for
              phimosis.[1]</h4>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>
      <hr color="black" align="center" width="85%" />

      <p class="2">It is a good rule that is a baby passes a good
      stream of urine without causing ballooning of the foreskin,
      then that foreskin is entirely normal. <span
      class="cirp">[CIRP note: Ballooning of the foreskin now
      (2006) is considered to be a sign that separation of the
      foreskin from the underlying glans penis is proceeding
      normally. It is not a cause for concern. Ballooning is a
      normal stage of development. Ballooning will stop when the
      opening of the foreskin enlarges with normal growth and
      development over a period of time.]</span></p>
