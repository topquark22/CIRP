    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="2">As was the case with the dietary laws and
      shehitiah, ritual circumcision was the subject of a
      wide-ranging debate in nineteenth-century Germany.<sup><a
      href="#n117">117</a></sup> Circumcision had long been
      regarded as the most distintive and separartist of all Jewish
      rituals, and the discourse surrounding it went to the heart
      of the "willingness" of the Jews to fully participate in the
      "act" of being German. The ritual was interpreted as a signal
      of the Jews' refusal to rid themselves of their differences,
      imprinting on their own male bodies, as an aborginal would
      his tribal markings, an ineradicable expression of national
      identity. For some, it was circumcision itself that made the
      Jew. In the seventeenth century, the Jewish philosopher
      Baruch Spinoza declared that "the sign of circumcision is, as
      I think, so important, that I could persuade myself that it
      alone would preserve the nation forever."<sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup> For figures of the German
      enlightenment such as Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt,
      circumcision was one of those Jewish practices that
      "unnecessarily" separated Jews from the rest of society. The
      brothers were of the opinion that circumcision should be
      either significantly reformed or abandoned altogether.
      Expressed at the time of the debates over Jewish emancipation
      in the eighteenth century, the von Humbolts' suggestion was
      designed to help foster the assimilation of the Jews, and
      thus promote the cause of their emancipation.<sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup> In 1831, Heinrich Paulus,
      professor of Oriental languages and theology at the the
      University of Heidelburg, declared that for Jews to merge
      fully with Christians they had to abrogate circumcision, for
      unlike the universal act of baptism, it served only to ensure
      their isolaton and distinct national identity.<sup><a
      href="#n120">120</a></sup> At the fin-de-si&egrave;cle, the
      opinion that circumcision was the key to Jewish separatism
      and national identity was highlighted in one of the most
      important anthropological surveys of the Jewish people to
      appear in the nineteeth century, Richard Andree's
      <i>Ethnography of the Jews</i>. According to the author,
      "Circumcision was the pride of the Hebrews and a sign of
      their covenant and their separateness from other,
      non-circumcised peoples, and that upon which their
      nationality was conditioned."<sup><a
      href="#n121">121</a></sup> Further, Andree remarked that the
      consequence of circumcision is that it breeds in the
      circumcised an "arrogant and haughty" attitude toward the
      uncircumcised.</p>

      <p class="2">Given that circumcision among German gentiles
      was (and still is) extremely rare, Andree's remark went
      beyond the mere historical or anthropological to constitute a
      negative commentary on what he imagined were the hostile
      Jewish perceptions of Germans. In response to such claims,
      Jewish physicians downplayed the religious and nationalistic
      aspect of the ceremony and instead emphasized its medically
      beneficial and thus universalistic qualities, for there was
      nothing particularistic about the desire for good health. By
      stressing the hygienic advantages of circumcision, German
      Jews could offer Germans the benefit of millennial medical
      wisdom.<sup><a href="#n122">122</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The offer to share with large numbers of Germans
      the alleged pathological advantages of circumcision (and
      other Jewish rituals) first took place in 1911, at the
      International Hygiene Exhibition in Dresden. Attracting well
      over a quarter of a million visitors, the exhibit, and all
      that followed until the rise of the Nazis, was akin to a
      modern world's fair, but specifically focused on those
      positive health and social habits that served to promote good
      health among the world's different nations and races. The
      Jews manned their own pavilion, and in explaining their
      customs and life cyle events, the exhibitors considered their
      expository performance an act of generosity rather than a
      display of haughtiness.<sup><a href="#n123">123</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">In addition to having been the subject of
      historical, anthropological, and theological speculation,
      circumcision came under legal scrutiny and became highly
      regulated over the course of the nineteenth century. While
      this was reflective of the general trend of the German state
      to enforce ever more control over public health, the desire
      to assert authority over the Jewish body had, as we saw with
      the burial controversy, an established precedent. Various
      state governments and local authorities, often in conjunction
      with interested Jewish parties such as physicians and
      advocates of local reform, passed legislation and decrees in
      their attempts to control Jews, seeking to sanitize in both
      surgical and aesthetic terms the procedure and make it
      conform as best as possible to German sensibilities. For
      example in 1799, the Prussian Oberkollegium sponsored the
      preparation of an expert report on the dangers of
      circumcision and how they could be avoided. The result was
      that in 1819, Prussia promoted the practice of having a
      physician attend all circumcisions. This was expanded upon in
      1824 when it was decreed that the mohel had to pass an
      examination to prove his medical proficiency in treating the
      wound. By 1830, the Jews of the Rhineland had reached an
      agreement with the state's health officers that only their
      officially recognized mohelim would be allowed to practice.
      Nevertheless, a physician still had to be in attendance, and
      by 1843, noncompliance resulted in a monetary fine of between
      5 and 20 taler for the boy's father and from 10 to 50 taler
      for the mohel. In 1852 the Jewish community of Hamburg
      decreed officially sanctioned rules and instructions for
      mohelim, which were later supplemented at a general session
      of the mohelim commission of 1900. In 1885, the government of
      the district of Wiesbaden offered instruction for mohelim,
      and finally by 1887 in Vienna, only physicians were permitted
      to perform circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n124">124</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">During the 1840s, when Reform Jews held
      conferences to discuss issues of religious modification,
      debates about the nature and practice of circumcision also
      emerged.<sup><a href="#n125">125</a></sup> For a minority,
      circumcision was a blood ritual, more fitting for what were
      deemed savage tribes than for middle-class German Jews. Still
      others questioned whether circumcision was itself an absolute
      requirement as a sign and marker of Jewish identity. In 1843,
      the radical reformer Samuel Holdheim maintained that the
      ritual was no longer binding on Jews and that the sign of the
      covenant was to be symbolic rather than real. This view was
      soundly rejected by the overwhelming majority of German Jews.
      But all these were theological, not scientific arguments, and
      the majority of Jews were simply not prepared to argue over
      the religious nature of brit milah. As a Jewish ceremony it
      was a sanctified rite of initiation to be practiced in
      perpetuity.</p>

      <p class="2">Still, brit milah was under assault and needed
      defending. To this end, Jewish communities early on acted in
      consultation with state authorities and Jewish physicians to
      transform and modernize circumcision by focusing on the
      medical aspects of the ceremony. As early as the decree of
      1819, wherein the Jews agreed to permit a physician to attend
      every brit milah, a creeping concession to modernity was
      countenanced. The ceremony became more of a public
      performance and was conducted under the "impartial" and
      "scientific" eye of the modern physician. To satisfy the
      demands of German society, Jews ought to accommodate the
      ancient ceremony to the rigors of modern science. They set
      out to prove that the operation, with out abandoning its
      basic elements, still met the surgical requirements of modern
      medicine.</p>

      <p class="2">In 1844, a Jewish physician and staunch advocate
      of ritual circumcision from Berlin, Joseph Bergson, responded
      to the circumcision abolitionists by promoting medical
      reforms to make the procedure safer. For Bergson,
      circumcision served a religious, symbolic, medical,
      political, mythological, and, even quite possibly, a military
      purpose.<sup><a href="#n126">126</a></sup> In his view, the
      sheer antiquity of brit milah, plus its centrality in the
      cultural life of the nation, justified its eternal practice.
      But to defend brit milah from attack, Bergson proposed the
      introduction of modifications in the ceremony.</p>

      <p class="2">Because in matters of public health it was "the
      duty of the state to protect all its subjects, irrespective
      of religion and class," Bergson recommended that circumcision
      come under tighter regulation. Precisely because of its
      "bloody character," he wanted to see it more closely observed
      by both physicians and state medical authorities. Concerned
      about the possible abuses that could come from state
      intervention in religious affairs, Bergson suggested that the
      state tread lightly, embarking with the "greatest possible
      forbearance" on a "suitable program of education and
      "enlightenment" in order to promote the "physical well-being"
      of the child-an advantage to be later served by the state
      itself.<sup><a href="#n127">127</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Among the technical changes Bergson advocated
      were the abolition of <i>periah</i> by the traditional
      method, that is the peeling back of the entire foreskin and
      splitting it with a razor sharp fingernail. In order to
      expose the glans, and <i>metsitsah</i>, the sucking of the
      wound by the mohel to draw out the blood. Claiming that
      neither had biblical sanction, Bergson noted that the former
      procedure had long been rejected by "rational and ...modern
      surgery, a barbaric remnant from medieval field-surgery." In
      its stead, he recommended the use of recently invented
      scissors and other surgical implements, specifically designed
      for the task, and the application of the latest salves,
      balms, and elasticized bandages.<sup><a
      href="#n128">128</a></sup> Another Jewish physician who
      likewise sought to reform brit milah, D. Salomon, also
      recommended a postoperative surgical procedure that involved
      stitching the wound, a procedure that was never accepted in
      the Jewish world but nevertheless was endorsed by
      Bergson.<sup><a href="#n129">129</a></sup> According to
      Bergson, metsitsah played no prophylactic role whatsoever,
      and only increased the chances of transmitting a host of
      infectious diseases, including syphilis. It had to go
      entirely.<sup><a href="#n130">130</a></sup></p>

            unhygienic and morally dubious. In response, physicians
            invented a special glass tube (labelled here as number
            2) for metsitsah that was widely used in Germany.

      </center>

      <p class="2">In addition to changes in surgical procedure,
      Bergson wanted mohelim to receive fundamental instruction in
      anatomy and surgery, claiming that it was "little wonder that
      in recent times the opinion had been expressed that the
      operation should be taken out of the hands of mohelim and
      entrusted to qualified doctors." He lamented the fact that in
      antiquity, circumcision among Israelites had been performed
      by physicians, whereas it was now performed by the
      unqualified!<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> This is
      reminscent of the call by <i>maskilic</i> physicians in the
      eighteen century to remove the control over what Jews did
      with their own bodies and hand it over to duly certified
      professionals It also recalls a common <i>Haskalah</i>
      refrain, echoed by nineteeth-century Jewish social critics,
      that idealized and glorified the health care culture of
      biblical Israel while at the same time emphasizing the extent
      to which modern Jews seemed to have deviated from that
      ideal.</p>

      <p class="2">With advances in medical knowledge, criticism
      and advocacy of circumcision took on a more scientific tone
      by the late nineteenth century. The medical profession at
      this time expressed two diametrically opposed views of
      circumcision: one for and one against. As for the negative
      assessment, Jews had long been accused of hypersexuality and
      of being chronic practitioners of what a liberal French
      cleric, the Abb&eacute; Gr&eacute;goire, called, the
      <i>libertinage solitaire</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n132">132</a></sup> Similarly, Jews had long been
      linked to the spread of syphilis. Indeed as early as the
      fifteenth century, the Genovese ambassador to Charles VIII
      called it the "Peste of the Marranos." At the close of the
      nineteenth century, because of the association with skin
      diseases, antisemitic claims of their immorality, and the
      fact that Jews predominated in the nascent medical speciality
      of dermatology, Jews played an important role in the medical
      literature on venereal disease, and medical opponents of
      circumcision rarely failed to draw a causative link between
      alleged Jewish concupiscence and sexually transmitted
      diseases and the rite of circumcision. One German opponent of
      circumcision, a physician from Halle, even claimed that the
      majority of patients he treated for gonorrhea were
      Jewish.<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The opposite medical assessment was that Jews
      were to a large extent protected from a variety of diseases
      precisely because they were circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup> Stressing the prophylactic quality
      of circumcision, physician-advocates of the procedure
      regarded it as a mode of prevention against sexual
      malfunction and deviance, sexually transmitted diseases, and
      what some physicians called "sexual neuroasthenia."<sup><a
      href="#n135">135</a></sup> Proponents also saw it as a means
      to prevent childhood bed-wetting, and prolapse of the rectum,
      hernia, and hydrocele, caused by overexertion of the
      abdominal muscles in order to overcome impediments to
      urination caused by inflammation of the prepuce.<sup><a
      href="#n136">136</a></sup> One Zionist physician, Felix
      Theilhaber, held circumcision responsible for the lower
      incidence of uterine cancer among Jewish women.<sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Much like people today who display a seemingly
      insatiable appetite for medical news, the Jewish public at
      the turn of the century likewise sought out the latest
      information about medical breakthroughs, especially when they
      pertained to Jewish pathologies. In a lecture to a Breslau
      synagogue in 1902, Jewish physician Carl Alexander told his
      audience that there were several diseases that could be
      prevented by circumcision, for example, phimosis, a
      constriction of the penis opening, which was congenital in 12
      percent of boys, and elephantiasis, a chronic enlargement of
      cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, especially of the legs and
      scrotum. Alexander also believed circumcision helped stem the
      tide of diabetes.<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup> He and
      other Jewish advocates also stressed the humanitarian aspect
      of performing circumcision on newborn males because at that
      tender age, there would be no memory of either the event or
      the discomfort.<sup><a href="#n139">139</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Another physician noted that just as the dietary
      laws had a "hygienic basis" in addition to a religious one,
      circumcision was to be interpreted similarly. Circumcision
      and the attendant prescription of God to "be fruitful and
      multiply," he argued, was a holy prescription that for the
      Jewish people "led to a curative function." Fulfilling both
      requirements was "sure protection against the inclination to
      onanism."<sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup> Many Jewish
      physicians concurred that circumcision lessened if not
      eliminated entirely the instinct to mastubate-an act, they
      suggested, that was the end result of a buildup of irritating
      secretions under the foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n141">141</a></sup> The subtext of this observation
      was they because they were uncircumcised, it was Christians
      rather than Jews who challenged nineteenth-century bourgeois
      morality, which condemned masturbation as a vice that in
      addition to constituting a complete "loss of control" was
      "opposed to all that was manly and virile."<sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup> Here could Jewish doctors turn the
      tables on those who had accused the Jews of unbridled passion
      and predatory, deviant sexual behavior.</p>

      <p class="2">Critics of ritual circumcision were particularly
      hostile to the act of metsisah, sucking the wound. For many
      Jews, primarily those who had joined the German middle class
      and had come to share the culture and aesthetic sensibilities
      of that group, metsitsah appeared to be an atavistic,
      sexually deviant act.<sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup> Part
      of the traditional circumcision ceremony, the practice of
      metsitsah was widely condemned throughout the nineteenth
      century by medical and lay authorities, Jews and Gentiles
      alike. Charging that the practice promoted the spread of a
      host of sexual and infectious diseases, the arguments made
      against the practice were not confined to Western Europe but
      made their way east as well. A commission established in St.
      Petersburg in 1891 composed of physicians and "specialists in
      Jewish ritual" recommended that in the name of hygiene,
      metsitsah and the "tearing off of the <i>lamina interna</i>
      by hand" (periah) be abolished.<sup><a
      href="#n144">144</a></sup> A German Jewish physician named
      Bamberger also shared some of the more common misgivings
      about the procedure, such as the fear that syphilis or
      tuberculosis could be spread from child to mohel or vice
      versa. In a comprehensive study of brit milah Bamberger
      published in 1912, he advocated the use of a glass apparatus
      to suck the wound, citing in particular the device designed
      by a Professor Pettenkofer of Munich, at the urging of Rabbi
      Michael Cahn of Fulda.<sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> What
      Bamberger sought to impress upon his readers was that science
      and religion were not only compatible in theoretical terms,
      but the religion could be the mother to science's invention.
      Working together, they were capable of tackling the problems
      confronting the modern Jew, arriving at creative solutions
      that permitted ancient tradition to be adhered to.</p>

      <p class="2">Technical innovation was not only used to modify
      tradition and reconstruct ancient rites in order to harmonize
      them with modernity; scientific evidence could even be
      deployed creatively to defend all aspects of brit milah,
      including the most derided. In 1913, Emanuel Rosenbaum, a
      German Jewish physician practicing in Paris, published a
      thorough scientific defense of metsitsah. Drawing copiously
      on classical Jewish sources, he supplemented these with
      evidence from contemporary medical science to endorse the
      prophylactic nature of the act.</p>

      <p class="2">In defending metsitsah Rosenbaum made two
      principal points. The first was the hypocrisy inherent in the
      campaign against the practice, in that double standards of
      hygiene were employed to make unrealistic demands on Jews.
      The goal in the "rational treatment" of a wound, according to
      Rosenbaum, is to stave off infection by creating an "aseptic"
      environment. But even in a hospital setting the attainment of
      asepsis "in the surgical sense is an absolute
      impossibility."<sup><a href="#n146">146</a></sup> Why he
      demanded to know, were Jews required to observe standards of
      hygiene in domestic environment that were unobtainable even
      in a hospital? Rosenbaum's other method of supporting
      metsitsah was to use expert testimony on the treatment of
      snakebites. International authorities were quoted, all of
      whom testified that standard medical procedure in the case of
      such injury entailed sucking poison from the wound. From this
      Rosenbaum extrapolated that metsitsah was not only harmless,
      but efficacious.<sup><a href="#n147">147</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Rosenbaum directly tackled the issue of
      transmissibility of syphilis and <a
      href="/library/complications/reuben1/">tuberculosis</a>
      through metsitsah, claiming that not one case had been
      reported in the medical literature of contagion having been
      spread in this way. At any rate, the mohel's use of
      alcohol-"one of the most outstanding disinfectants"-prior to
      performing metsitsah ensured an antiseptic oral environment.
      And again highlighting double standards, Rosenbaum asked
      rhetorically why restauranteurs and hoteliers were not
      compelled to disinfect cutlery, crockery, and glassware in
      carbolic acid or Lysol after use by their customers if the
      threat of orally transmitted infection was so great and so
      roundly acknowledged.<sup><a href="#n148">148</a></sup> The
      fact that they were not required to do only confirmed his
      sense that the attack on metsitsah was biased.</p>

      <p class="2">Not only did the ceremony of brit milah require
      defending, but the mohel had long been an object of scorn.
      The mohel, who had no medical training, was clearly seen as
      inappropriate. Berlin Jewry had required a physician to
      attend each brit milah since the early part of the nineteenth
      century, and various reforms had been instituted throughout
      the course of the century in order to "medicalize" the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n149">149</a></sup> Although
      Bamberger defended the mohel, who was attacked most often
      because of his inadequate surgical training and because of
      the perception that his personal hygiene constituted a threat
      to the infant, he did note that rabbis were concerned about
      the surgical qualification and dexterity of the mohel,
      disqualifying anyone who suffered from "shortsightness,
      nervous disorders, shaking of the hands, and internal
      diseases." Indicating that change had taken place in the
      sensibilities of German Jews, Bamberger observed that "today,
      here and there, the religious character [of circumcision] has
      been stripped away and it is regarded as a medical
      operation."<sup><a href="#n150">150</a></sup> To this end,
      and in response to various accusations concerning the hygiene
      of the mohel himself, Bamberger offered the following
      inventory:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Before the [<i>mohel</i>] performs the act, he must
          thoroughly disinfect his hands. Today's <i>mohelim</i>
          wash their hands in this same warm water they soap
          themselves up with carbolic acid or Lysol and use a
          brush, especially around the nails. The same happens to
          the instruments which are boiled just before their use.
          These are: 1. A double-bladed knife, 8-10 cm long; 2. A
          metal clamp and forceps; 3. A common pair of tweezers to
          fasten the area around the wound; 4. 2-3 bolted tweezers
          to squeeze the bleeding; 5. different bandages, plasters,
          and swabs-all sterilized; 6. Scissors and a surgical
          sewing needle; 7. A glass tube for the metsitsah. In
          Hamburg the doctors have put together a 'sterile
          first-aid kit for circumcision.' Also the instruments,
          which are afixed inside a utensil for boiling, are
          sterilized at the scene of every circumcision.<sup><a
          href="#n151">151</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Here there is no God, no Abraham, no Covenant.
      This stark and clinical description of the mohel's
      instruments was designed to construct a clean counterimage of
      the Jews. Here in Judaism's most elemental rite of passage,
      one long derided for its supposed savagery and uncleanliness,
      Bamberger sought to demonstrate the antiseptic nature of brit
      milah as it was performed in contemporary Germany. Although
      the mohel was not a physician, let alone a trained surgeon,
      every precaution had been taken to ensure that he upheld the
      most stringent rules of modern hygiene. As much as it could
      be, the ceremony had been "de-orientalized," indeed
      Germanized, tailored to conform to German, not traditional
      Jewish notions of cleanliness.<sup><a
      href="#n152">152</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">One of the most important claims made about
      circumcision by its opponents in the medical world was that
      it was an unnecessary procedure, one that "deformed" a
      perfect organ, a view expressed for example by Paul
      Ascherson, professor of medicine at the University of
      Berlin.<sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup> In stark contrast,
      a Jewish physician, S. N. Kutna, declared circumcision to be
      an act of bringing about "bodily perfection," the foreskin
      being, "in a biblical sense, a defect."<sup><a
      href="#n154">154</a></sup> Jewish countercharges not
      withstanding, the accusation of their bodily deformity goes
      to the issue of how Jews fit into the ethic of human
      physicality is Wilhelmine Germany. Antisemites interpreted
      circumcision in political and nationalistic terms. For them,
      a deliberately mis-shapen body, such as one that had been
      circumcised, was an imperfect body, and an imperfect body
      was, by definition, inadmissable into the body politic of the
      nation. For example, the 1894 statutes of the fiercely
      antisemitic organization, the Deutschbund, claimed that "the
      Jew cannot belong to the Deutschbund, nor become eligible by
      baptism, because his circumcision harbours his
      nature."<sup><a href="#n155">155</a></sup> In this radical
      assessment, circumcision constituted a permanent taint that
      prevented the integration of Jews into German society.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="figure10.jpg" alt="antisemitic caricature" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">For many, the separatist rite of brit milah
      distinguished Jews from Germans in the most tangible way,
      permanently impressing upon Jews a mark of national
      otherness. Thus circumcision was to the notion of race, in
      that for antisemites it too was indelible. The Jew, because
      he was circumcised, would remain forever "physically" Jewish,
      even if he had converted to Christianity.</p>

      <p class="2">It was not only brit milah but the entire array
      of Jewish customs and ritualistic behavior that contributed
      in a sense that the Jews were fundamentally different from
      the Germans. Even those Germans who were well disposed to the
      integration of Jews into German society were quite convinced
      that the social product of the performance of Judaism's most
      important rites was Jewish separatism.</p>

      <p class="2">In response Jewish physicians in modern Germany
      enlisted the help of medicine to answer crises in and
      challenges to Judaism and Jewish culture itself. Sometimes,
      for example, in the case of the methods of animal slaughter,
      the challenge was driven by blatant anti-semitism. On other
      occasions, such as with the discussions of the ritual bath or
      the dietary laws, the agitation for reform could come from
      within as well as from without. Whatever the case, the
      challenges were generally the product of the Jewish encounter
      with the modern secular world. And, in what is a wonderfully
      intricate paradox, German Jews were able to use one of the
      defining characteristics of the modern
      age&mdash;science&mdash;to reinforce their Jewish identities,
      justify their ancient traditions, and help them navigate
      their way through the turbulent waters of modernity.</p>
