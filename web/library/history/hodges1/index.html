      <p class="text1"><b>Abstract</b><br />
       The medical term phimosis has been in use since antiquity,
      but in contrast to the imprecise definition of the term that
      is characteristic of nineteenth-century and some
      controversial modern medical writing, Greek and Roman medical
      writers imbued it with a clinically precise definition. Using
      the tools of the history of medicine, an analysis of the
      medical writings of antiquity reveals that phimosis was
      defined exclusively as a rare, inflammatory or cicatricial
      stricture of the preputial orifice consequent to a true
      pathological condition rather than a disease process in
      itself. Putative associations between phimosis and diseases
      such as urinary tract infections or cancer were not made in
      antiquity and are reflections of modern, geographically
      isolated social anxieties. The modern European scientific
      conceptualisation of phimosis, however, represents a return
      to the precise terminology and conservative therapeutic
      approach characteristic of Greek and Roman medicine.</p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p class="text2">Since the nineteenth century, medical
      writers have argued for the existence of a complex and
      broadly defined disease construct to which they have attached
      the ancient Greek word <i>phimosis</i>. In this context,
      phimosis has been conceived of as a morphological deviation
      from a mythical penile norm. Phimosis has, accordingly, been
      described as a foreskin that is &lsquo;&lsquo;too
      long&rsquo;&rsquo;(hypertrophic phimosis), a foreskin whose
      orifice is not as expandable as the foreskin of most adults
      (often called &lsquo;&lsquo;true&rsquo;&rsquo; phimosis), or
      a foreskin that has not yet completed the developmental
      process of physiological detachment from the glans
      (congenital phimosis). Rather than a symptom of disease,
      phimosis has been classified as a disease <i>sui generis</i>
      as well as a cause of disease, and as such, for nearly 200
      years, presumably responsible physicians, writing in leading
      medical journals and textbooks, have further claimed that the
      results of their research `prove' that phimosis is the cause
      of such diseases as cancer of the male and female
      reproductive organs, venereal disease, malnutrition,
      epilepsy, hydrocephalus, insanity, idiocy, masturbation,
      heart disease, homosexuality, deafness, dumbness, urinary
      tract infections, criminality, and death, to name but a few.
      The drive to cure and prevent phimosis, thus, has been
      presented as a surgical solution to the most pressing social
      and moral problems [<a href="#n15">15</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The European medical concept of phimosis,
      however, has made a significant departure from its
      nineteenth-century roots and from the current ideology of
      American medicine, which still clings to nineteenth-century
      notions in this respect. The vanguard of European medical
      experts no longer conceive of phimosis as disease or as a
      cause of disease. Phimosis is now defined as a stricture of
      the preputial orifice caused by lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus (LSA), also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans
      (BXO), a rare, dermatological condition of unknown aetiology.
      In Britain, <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood/">Rickwood et
      al.</a> have successfully argued that the definition of
      phimosis should be divested of any notions of preputial
      non-retractability, physiological balanopreputial attachment,
      or preputial length [<a href="#n19">19</a>]. The new
      definition of &lsquo;&lsquo;true phimosis&rsquo;&rsquo;
      refers to a condition where &lsquo;&lsquo;the tip of the
      foreskin is scarred and indurated and has the histological
      features of Balanitis xerotica obliterans&rsquo;&rsquo; [<a
      href="#n20">20</a>]. More recently, Rickwood has refined this
      to the formulas: &lsquo;&lsquo;Phimosis = BXO&rsquo;&rsquo;,
      and &lsquo;&lsquo;No BXO = No Phimosis&rsquo;&rsquo; [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>]. In the historical context, the
      contemporary European refinement of the definition of
      phimosis represents a return to an earlier definition of the
      term, one that is found in the classic medical writings of
      Greek and Roman antiquity.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Phimosis in antiquity</b><br />
       The word <i>phimosis</i> is derived from the Greek. For this
      reason, medical writers in the nineteenth century asserted
      that phimosis, as they defined it, was recognised by the
      Greeks as a genuine penile defect. An analysis of the corpus
      of ancient medical literature, however, demonstrates that the
      nineteenth-century conceptualisation of phimosis does not
      correspond with the Greek and Roman definition of the
      term.</p>

      <p class="text2">Throughout the greater portion of the span
      of antiquity, <i>phimosis</i> as a medical term did not
      exist. Indeed, Greek physicians of the classical era were
      evidently uninterested in the foreskin from a medical
      perspective. Significantly, the word <i>phimosis</i> does not
      appear in the Hippocratic corpus of the fifth century BC.
      Reference to the foreskin as a distinct part of the penis,
      however, is characteristic of the corpus. One such reference
      is found in the Hippocratic aphorism that states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        When a bone, cartilage, sinew, the slender part of the jaw,
        or the acroposthion is severed, the part neither grows nor
        unites [<a href="#n13">13</a>].
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Here we meet the useful Greek word
      <i>acroposthion</i>, which designates the visually defining,
      tapered, fleshy, nipple-like portion of the foreskin that
      advances beyond the terminus of the underlying glans penis.
      The acroposthion, especially in early youth, can run to
      impressive lengths. Distinguished from the
      <i>acroposthion</i> is the <i>posthe</i>, which is the
      portion of the foreskin that merely enfolds the glans penis,
      beginning at the coronal sulcus. While it is not possible to
      make a definitive interpretation of the above-cited
      Hippocratic aphorism, one might surmise that the allusion to
      the severing of the acroposthion confirms that the originator
      of this aphorism was aware of the foreskin-despoiling blood
      rituals peculiar to some of the Semitic tribes inhabiting
      those regions that lay south-east of Greek-inhabited
      lands.</p>

      <p class="text2">As demonstrated by their visual art, the
      Greeks highly esteemed the foreskin as a defining feature of
      the male body. Indeed, Galen speaks of the foreskin as a
      brilliantly useful <i>adornment</i>. [<a href="#n10">10</a>].
      It is not surprising, then, that half a millennium would pass
      before the word <i>phimosis</i> entered the medical lexicon.
      Although it makes its first appearance in the medical
      writings of the Roman era, writers first used the term
      <i>phimosis</i> loosely to indicate a condition of being
      <i>constricted</i>, irrespective of the part afflicted. For
      instance, Galen [<a href="#n14">14</a>], Heliodorus [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>], and Andromachus [<a href="#n1">1</a>]
      used the term to refer to inflammatory strictures of the anus
      or the eyelid, but not the foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">In his <i>Materia Medica</i>, the Greek
      physician Dioscorides of Anazarbus, who flourished under the
      reigns of Claudius and Nero (41-68 AD), mentioned briefly
      that a concoction of the juice of the leaves of the herb
      <i>cotyledon</i> and wine would &lsquo;&lsquo;soften
      constriction of the genitals, help inflammation, erysipelas,
      chilblain, and when plastered over, help scrofula and sore
      throat&rsquo;&rsquo; [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. The original
      Greek wording does not specify what part of the genitals of
      what sex Dioscorides recommends as the target for the healing
      powers of this herb. Furthermore, rather than use the word
      <i>phimosis</i>, he uses the etymologically related term
      <i>phimos</i>, which, in this case, could, with equal
      validity, refer to an imperforate anus or a urethral
      stricture of either sex. Still, the historically portentous
      association had now been made between the genitals and the
      idea of stricture.</p>

      <p class="text2">Even if Dioscorides did not make the
      association in terms of the foreskin, one or more of his
      coeval compatriots must have, for Aulus Cornelius Celsus, who
      in all probability lived during the reign of Emperor Tiberius
      (14-37 AD), says that they did. In his great work, <i>De
      Medicina</i>, Celsus reports:</p>

      <blockquote>
        On the other hand, if the glans has become so covered that
        it cannot be bared, a lesion which the Greeks call
        phimosis, it must be opened out, which is done as follows:
        underneath the foreskin is to be divided from its free
        margin in a straight line back as far as the frenum, and
        thus the skin above is relaxed and can be retracted. But if
        this is not successful, either on account of constriction
        or of hardness of the skin, a triangular piece of the
        foreskin is cut out from underneath, having its apex at the
        frenum, and its base at the edge of the prepuce. Then lint
        dressing and other medicaments to induce healing are put
        on. But it is necessary that the patient should lie up
        until the wound heals, for walking rubs the wound and makes
        it foul [<a href="#n5">5</a>].
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The first surgical treatment that Celsus
      describes is a ventral slit, a minor, tissue-sparing
      procedure that would have imposed a fairly minimal cosmetic
      defect. The second procedure, being a variation on the first,
      involves the removal of a small amount of sclerotic tissue.
      Here again, the ventral site of the incision would largely
      preserve cosmesis and preputial mechanical function.</p>

      <p class="text2">Elsewhere, Celsus provides a more detailed
      exposition of his concept of preputial pathology, without, it
      must be emphasised, using the word phimosis. In this
      instance, he stresses the abnormal induration of the
      preputial tissue as the primary diagnostic key:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>So then when the penis swells up owing to inflammation,
        and the foreskin cannot be drawn back, or conversely drawn
        forwards, the place should be fomented freely with hot
        water. But when the glans is covered up, hot water should
        be injected, between it and the foreskin, by means of an
        ear syringe. If the foreskin is thus softened and rendered
        thinner, and yields when drawn upon, the rest of the
        treatment is more speedy. If the swelling goes on, either
        lentil meal or horehound or olive leaves, boiled in wine,
        is to be laid on, to each of which, whilst being pounded
        up, a little honey is to be added; and the penis is to be
        bandaged upwards to the belly. That is required in the
        treatment of all its disorders; and the patient ought to
        keep quiet and abstain from food, and drink water just so
        much as is justified by thirst. On the next day
        fomentations with water must again be applied in the same
        way, and even force should be tried as to whether the
        foreskin will yield; if it does not give way, the foreskin
        is to be notched at its margin with a scalpel. For when
        sanies has flowed out, this part will become thinner, and
        the foreskin the more easily drawn upon. But whether the
        foreskin is made to yield by this procedure, or whether it
        has at no time proved resistant, ulcerations will be found,
        either in the ulterior part of the foreskin, or in the
        glans, or behind this in the penis, and these ulcerations
        must of necessity be either clean or dry or moist and
        purulent [<a href="#n6">6</a>].</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Celsus continues this passage with advice on
      diet, rest, and the application of fomentations. Given the
      strict emphasis on cankerous ulcerations, it is obvious that
      Celsus' concept of phimosis is that of a pathological
      inflammation of the foreskin as a complication of canker. The
      notching of the inflamed foreskin, in order to release the
      purulent discharge, indicates that a true pathological
      condition is at work. In contrast to the nineteenth-century
      medical conception of phimosis, Celsus does not define
      phimosis as a &lsquo;&lsquo;redundant&rsquo;&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;&lsquo;tight&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;&lsquo;adherent&rsquo;&rsquo; foreskin. For Celsus,
      phimosis is a diagnostic description of the effects on the
      foreskin caused by a real pathological condition, which, in
      the post-bacteriological era, we might recognise as being of
      likely microbial origin. Of special relevance is the first
      description of phimosis as an induration of the foreskin,
      which neatly matches the modern European medical
      understanding of the effects of LSA (i.e. BXO) on the
      foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">The second known use of the word phimosis is
      found in the extant writings of the Greek physician Antyllus,
      who lived in the second century AD. The writings of Antyllus
      enjoyed wide currency and were directly copied into the
      encyclopaedic medical compilation of Oribasus, from which the
      following passages are drawn, and Paulus &AElig;gineta [<a
      href="#n18">18</a>]. Proceeding where Celsus left off,
      Antyllus further refines the medical conception of phimosis
      to include reference to inelastic scar tissue and
      pathological granulations as the cause of symptomatic
      preputial nonretractability. The cure that he proposes
      entails a series of incisions in the scar tissue in order to
      expand it and allow the foreskin to function properly.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>On Phimosis</b><br />
         There are two kinds of phimosis: in one case, sometimes
        the foreskin covers the glans and cannot be pulled back; in
        the other case, the foreskin is retracted but cannot be
        returned over the glans. This second type is specifically
        called <i>paraphimosis</i>. The first type is the result of
        a scar that has formed on the foreskin, or on a thick
        granulation in this region. The second type is especially a
        result of inflammations of the genitals, when, the foreskin
        being retracted, the glans is swollen and holds the
        foreskin back. Thus, in the first kind of phimosis, we
        perform the following operation: after having placed the
        patient in a convenient position, we pull the foreskin
        forward and fasten little clips to the extremity of this
        organ, which we have the assistants hold, advising them to
        distend and open the foreskin as much as possible. If the
        stricture is caused by a scar, we make three or four
        equally spaced straight incisions in the inner fold of the
        prepuce with a lancet or a sharp instrument. These
        incisions are only made in the inner fold of the foreskin,
        for, in the part of the foreskin that covers the glans, it
        is double layered. We thus incise the inner fold of the
        foreskin, for, in this way, after having incised the
        cicatricial loop, we can retract the foreskin. If the
        phimosis is caused by a thick granulation on the inner
        aspect of the foreskin, we make all the incisions in this
        luxuriant flesh, we retract the foreskin, and we scrape out
        the thick granulations between the incisions. This done, we
        cover the whole glans with a lead tube, which we wrap with
        dried paper. In this way, we prevent the foreskin, which
        has been returned over the glans, from forming new
        adherences, since this last part is surrounded by the tube.
        We maintain the foreskin in a state of dilatation, with the
        aid of the lead and the paper that envelopes it. If the
        paper is soaked, it will expand and dilate the skin even
        more [<a href="#n3">3</a>].
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The thematic and lexicographic connection
      that Antyllus draws between phimosis and paraphimosis
      underscores the importance of the existence of an
      inflammatory process implicit in a diagnosis of phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a separate chapter, Antyllus describes a
      condition in which the previously retractable foreskin
      becomes adhered to the glans because of ulcerations of either
      part. The recommended cure entails freeing the adhesions.
      Antyllus is careful to avoid calling this condition
      <i>phimosis</i>, and instead calls it simply
      &lsquo;&lsquo;adherence of the foreskin&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>On Adherence of the Foreskin to the Glans</b><br />
         When either the glans, the foreskin, or both organs
        simultaneously are the site of an ulceration, an adherence
        is established. Retracting the foreskin as far as possible,
        one should free the adhesions with the sharp edge of a
        scalpel, while endeavouring especially to separate
        rigorously the glans from the part of the foreskin to which
        it is adherent. If this is difficult, however, it is better
        to leave a little part of the glans attached to the
        foreskin rather than do the opposite, for the foreskin,
        being thin, is easily pierced. After having freed the
        adherences, one places a thin cloth soaked in cold water
        between the glans and the foreskin in order to prevent the
        formation of new adherences [<a href="#n4">4</a>].
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">While, in the nineteenth century, it was
      common to use the word phimosis to denote, among other
      things, both the pathological, ulcerative balanopreputial
      adhesions of adult suffering the dermatological effects of
      sexually transmitted diseases and the natural physiological
      balanopreputial attachment characteristic of youth, Antyllus
      makes no such error, restricting the term phimosis to
      inflammatory nonretractability of the foreskin rather than
      pathological balanopreputial adherence. Neither Antyllus nor
      any other Greek writer confused the developmental,
      physiological, and transitory balanopreputial attachment of
      the juvenile penis with pathological adhesions. As such, the
      strict definition of the word phimosis was maintained.</p>

      <p class="text2">One common misuse of the word phimosis by
      nineteenth-century and some modern medical writers concerns
      the length of the foreskin. Penises were and are frequently
      diagnosed with phimosis because the foreskin has arbitrarily
      been determined to be &lsquo;&lsquo;too long&rsquo;&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;&lsquo;redundant&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;&lsquo;hypertrophic&rsquo;&rsquo;. The Greeks,
      however, recognised no such disease. In antiquity, the
      problem was not having too much foreskin, but having too
      little. Consequently, classical medical writers were
      concerned with a deformity called <i>lipodermus</i>, a
      condition in which the foreskin was <i>not long enough</i> to
      cover the glans penis completely. Galen [<a
      href="#n11">11</a>], Soranus [<a href="#n23">23</a>],
      Dioscorides [<a href="#n9">9</a>], and Antyllus [<a
      href="#n2">2</a>], among others, published lengthy
      descriptions of lipodermus and made detailed recommendations
      for its correction. Greek medical writers also devoted
      considerable space to surgical and non-surgical methods of
      foreskin restoration following posthectomy [<a
      href="#n22">22</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The wealth of classical medical writing
      devoted to the correction of lipodermus and posthectomy, when
      considered against the relative paucity of writing on
      phimosis as defined by medical writers in antiquity, lends
      strength to the argument that inflammatory or cicatricial
      stricture of the preputial orifice was a rare and unusual
      urological condition.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Conclusions</b><br />
       In contrast to the nineteenth-century conceptualisation of
      phimosis, which is predicated upon an alleged universality
      and defined purely in terms of a misunderstanding of
      preputial development and a biased view of penile morphology,
      the conception of phimosis in antiquity was based on rarity
      and on clinically verifiable histological pathology. The
      nineteenth-century conceptualisation of phimosis was
      predicated on the pathologisation of the three defining
      characteristics of the juvenile foreskin: physiological
      preputial nonretractability; physiological balanopreputial
      attachment, and generous length of the <i>acroposthion</i>.
      These pathologised, but not genuinely pathological,
      attributes were believed to be diseases in and of themselves
      that could cause other diseases. In antiquity, phimosis was
      defined strictly as a stricture of the preputial orifice that
      had been caused by a genuine dermatological disease process.
      The differing conceptualisations of phimosis provide an
      important example of how nineteenth-century medicine
      pathologised the natural body and sought justification and
      legitimacy for this culturally motivated process by asserting
      a false analogy with classical medical concepts.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, the current European concept of
      phimosis can be viewed as a return to the original classical
      understanding of phimosis as a symptom of clinically
      verifiable pathological conditions. This change is reflected
      in the increasing move towards establishing <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/jorgensen/">evidence-based
      pharmacological treatments</a> [<a href="#n16">16, 17</a>]
      and <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/cuckow/">tissue-preserving
      surgeries</a> [<a href="#n7">7</a>] that, like their
      classical antecedents, are focused on treating underlying
      pathology, maintaining foreskin function, and preserving
      natural cosmesis.</p>
