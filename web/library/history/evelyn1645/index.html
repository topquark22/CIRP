            <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: John Evelyn (1620-1706) was
            an English diarist. He travelled abroad for four years,
            and in 1645, he visited cities in Italy.* This is his
            account of a Jewish circumcision, which he witnessed at
            Rome in that year.]</p>

            <p>January 15, 2003 Daily Life - January 15, 1645 John
            Evelyn's diary has been overshadowed by Pepys's but it
            has its own encyclopaedic fascination, such as this
            description of a circumcision in Rome's Jewish ghetto
            witnessed during a four-year European tour</p>

            <p class="text">BY &amp; by came an old man who had
            prepar'd &amp; layd in order divers Instruments brought
            by a little child of about 7 yeares old in a box, These
            the man layd in a silver bason: The Knife was much like
            a short Razor . . . a small Instrument of silver cleft
            in the midst, at one end to take up the prepuce
            withall, clowtes of fine linnen wrap'd up &amp;c: These
            all in order the Women from out of another Chamber
            brought the Infant swadl'd, and deliver'd it to the
            Rabbie, who caried, and presented it before an Altar or
            Cuppord dress'd up, on which lay the 5 bookes of Moses,
            and the Commandments a little unrowled: Before this
            with profound reverence, and mumbling a few Words he
            waved the Child to and froo a while; then he delivered
            it to another Rabbie who sate all this time upon a
            Table . . . whilest the other Jew unbound the blankets
            that were about it to come at the flesh: at this action
            all the company fell a singing of an hebrew hymn, and
            in as barbarous a tone, waving themselves to and fro, a
            ceremony they observe in all their devotions: The
            Infant now strip'd from the belly downewards, the Jew
            tooke the yard of the child and Chaf'd it within his
            fingers till it became a little stiff, then with the
            silver Instrument before describ'd . . . tooke up as
            much of the Praeputium as he could possibly gather, and
            so with the Razor, did rather Saw, then cutt it off; at
            which the miserable babe cry'd extreamely, whiles the
            rest continu'd their odd tone, rather like howling then
            singing: then the Rabby lifting the belly of the child
            to his face, &amp; taking the yard all blody into his
            mouth he suck'd it a pretty while, having before taken
            a little Vinegar, all which together with the blood he
            spit out into a glasse of red-wine of the Colour of
            french wine: This don he stipp'd downe the remainder of
            the fore-skin as farr and neere to the belly as he
            could, so as it appeared to be all raw, then he strew'd
            read powder on it to staunch the bleeding and coverd it
            with a paper-hood, &amp; upon all a Clowte, and so
            swathed up the Child as before: All this while they
            continue the Psalme: Then two of the women, and two
            men, viz, he who held the Child, and the Rabbin who
            Circumcis'd it dranke some of the Wine mingl'd with the
            Vinegar, blood &amp; spitle.</p>
