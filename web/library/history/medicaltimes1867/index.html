        <p>CLITORIDECTOMY AND MEDICAL ETHICS</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">T<span class="sc">HE</span> operation of
      clitoridectomy, as performed under the conditions described
      in Mr. Baker Brown's writings and denounced in Dr. West's
      lectures, is an offence against Medical science and Medical
      ethics.</p>

      <p class="text2">1. It is an offence against Medical science
      in the first place, that it should be described as a mere
      circumcision (a) Instead of taking away a loose fold of skin,
      it removes a rudimentary organ of exquisite sensitiveness,
      well supplied with blood vessels and nerves, and the
      operation is described by the author as occasionally attended
      with serious bleeding ; in these respects it differs widely
      from circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is a second error to assume that if a
      woman desired to continue filthy habits this operation would
      stop her. The organ removed is but one amongst many
      susceptible of intense excitement.(b)</p>

      <p class="text2">In the third place, it is against all
      Medical science to remove such a part because "subject" (or
      subjected?&mdash;see note) " to unbearable irritation."
      Intense itching is a common malady, but this itching does not
      depend on local causes, and it may generally be relieved by
      proper measures. To cut off part of the body because it
      itches is monstrous.</p>

      <p class="text2">If indeed the clitoris be diseased, that is
      another thing ; but as clitoridectomy is practised, the part
      is cut off without any signs of disease in it.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is nothing to the purpose to affirm that
      clitoridectomy may have been successful in postponing
      epileptic fits or lengthening their interval. Any positive
      line of treatment will do that for a time. Many young men
      believe <i>for three months</i> that they have found a
      specific for epilepsy. An intimate friend lately thought he
      had found one in colchinum. Give enough of any potent drug to
      make the patient ill, break a leg, or cut off the clitoris,
      and the fits will probably be interrupted <i>for a
      time</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neither is it to the purpose to accuse Mr.
      Brown of having performed an operation rashly, groundlessly,
      and unsuccessfully Many such operations have been performed
      in the best faith. Marshall Hall used to propose tracheotomy
      for epilepsy ; a living Surgeon once performed castration for
      the same malady ; each operation thoroughly unsuccessful, and
      not to be defended, save on the ground of the good faith of
      the proposers, and of an enthusiasm which had carried them
      beyond the bounds of sound discretion.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although, then, clitoridectomy must be
      condemned as an offence against Medical science, if that were
      all, it might let pass into oblivion without further notice.
      It is the offence against Medical ethics which it involves,
      which has secured for it the reprobation of the
      Profession.</p>

      <p class="text2">2. It is an ethical offence, in the first
      place, if the Practitioner who is consulted for any common
      complaint, say hysteria, or fissure of the rectum, set
      himself to consider whether or not the patient is guilty of
      immoral practices, which have nothing to do with the case
      before him. Thus, as we said in our last number, and as we
      implied in the Med. Times and Gaz. June 4, 1864, if the
      clitoridectoral theory and practice were established, no
      parent who sent a daughter to any Medical man for any
      complaint whatever, could be sure that she might not return
      tainted with filthy inquiries, or branded by filthy
      suspicions&mdash;a thing incompatible with the honour of the
      Profession, and the possibility of that unrestrained frank
      intercourse between Practitioner and patient that happily
      exists now.</p>

      <p class="text2">As an illustration of this kind of breach of
      Professional honour and its consequences, we will mention a
      case which was shortly touched on in our first article in the
      number for June 4, 1864.</p>

      <p class="text2">A young lady was brought by her friends, ten
      or twelve years ago, to a Surgeon practising specially on the
      rectum, for a fistula. He did not content himself with
      exploring the fistula, but ascertained that she had lost her
      virginity, and told her father so. The consequences were
      frightful, including a painful trial, and loss of honour,
      character, and position to the parties concerned. All this,
      because the Surgeon had gone out of the path of his duty,
      and, instead, of confining himself to the malady for which he
      was consulted, had gratuitously imported into it certain
      moral considerations with which he had nothing to do. If this
      were a habit with Medical men, there would be an end to the
      present free an honourable intercourse with their patients.
      We should be accused, and justly, of making prurient, or
      indecent, or degrading inquiries, and of bringing a knowledge
      of evil to minds from which it had been absent.</p>

      <p class="text2">Affirming then, in the first place, that the
      very entry of thoughts of pollution into the Practitioner's
      mind respecting his patients is an offence of the deepest
      dye, this offence is aggravated by the kind of evedinec which
      the clitoridectomist is taught to accept as proof of his
      patient's guilt. That evidence consists, partly, in certain
      physical signs detailed in Mr. Baker Brown's book&mdash;a
      "peculiar straight and coarse hirsute growth," a peculiar
      follicular secretion, and other phenomena detected by
      inspection, which are as frivolous as they are disgusting. It
      is said by credible witnesses, that at a clitoridectomical
      operation nose as well as eyes were called into requisition,
      and that a respectable Practitioner was invited to apply his
      nose to the parts implicated, in order to satisfy his mind,
      by this test, that these parts had been subjected to abnormal
      irritation. The thing is almost too beastly to tell of, but
      we want to deal with this subject once for all, and to let
      our readers know why clitoridectomy does not stand in the
      same category as any other unsuccessful operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">But says Mr. Brown, "before commencing
      treatment, I have always made a point of having my diagnosis
      confirmed by the patient or her friends." And this brings us
      to what we may call the moral evidence on which the patient's
      guilt is assumed, the process of obtaining which is one of
      the most heinous offences against good sense and Professional
      ethics that can be conceived.</p>

      <p class="text2">We have heard of questions put (not by Mr.
      Brown) to female out-patients after the following
      fashion:&mdash;"Do you feel any irritation in certain
      organs?" "Is it very bad?" "Does it induce you to rub them?"
      "Does the rubbing ever make you feel faint?" And if the
      patient answers these questions affirmatively it is said that
      the evidence of unnaturally excitation is regarded as
      complete.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nervous young women, as it s well known, may
      be profoundly ignorant of the nature and drift of such
      questions. They delight to magnify their own sensations, they
      enjoy the Physician's sympathy and are sure to answer " yes "
      to any leading question whatever. But we say that if young
      women are subjected to such inquiries as these in out-patient
      rooms at Hospitals and Dispensaries, or by private
      Practitioners, the sooner the Profession speaks out the
      better. A Medical consultation may involve the worst
      contamination to the patient. We think we are justified in
      saying that the kind of evidence on which the guilt of the
      woman is assumed is itself an ethical offence.</p>

      <p class="text2">That the performance of clitoridectomy on a
      woman without her knowledge and consent, as detailed by Dr.
      West, is an offence against Medical ethics, needs not to be
      said. We suspect it is amenable to the criminal law of the
      land.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is an offence against Medical ethics,
      also, to obtain the woman's consent, nominally, while she is
      left in ignorance of the real scope and nature of the
      mutilation, and of the moral imputations which it involves.
      Consent to a thing whose nature is not known, is like the
      consent of an infant or lunatic&mdash;null and void. Equally
      do we repudiate, as an offence against Medical ethics, the
      performance of such an operation, even with the consent,
      nominal or real, of the patient, but without the full
      knowledge and consent of the persons on whom she is
      dependent, as wife or daughter. As the woman's character
      affects theirs, they have a right to decide whether a female
      relative should undergo this operation, with the disgrace it
      involves, or whether relief shall be sought from other
      means.</p>

      <p class="text2">We may be pardoned for adding that not one
      of the supposititious cases alleged by Dr. Routh at the late
      meeting of the Obstetrical Society has the least bearing on
      or analogy with the performance of clitoridectomy without the
      knowledge of the patient or her friends. Dr. Routh argued
      that all the details of every operation cannot be described
      to patients. But it is not the details&mdash;it is the moral
      questions involved in clitoridectomy, which ought not to be
      kept secret. Dr. Routh argued, also, that there are cases in
      which a Practitioner is bound to keep a patient's secrets
      from her husband ; but in cases before us, it is not secrets
      imparted by the patient, but dishonourable surmises and
      filthy imputations generated in the mind of the
      Practititioner&mdash;the nature of the mutilation and its
      disgrace&mdash;that are kept secret.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus, then, we have shown, as shortly as
      possible, the real position of clitoridectomy as an offence
      against science and morality, and the reasons why the Medical
      Profession, as an honourable, moral Profession, whose members
      have free and familial access to families, must repudiate and
      utterly reject it.</p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />
      <span class="note">(a) " Let it be known, once for all, that
      clitoridectomy is neither more nor less than circumcision of
      the female ; and as certainly as that no man who has been
      circumcised has been injured in his natural functions, so it
      is equally certain that no woman who has undergone the
      operation of excision of the clitoris has lost one particle
      of the natural functions of her organs. I would here protest
      against the cruel insinuation made agaist me by my accusers,
      that my reasons for performing the operation are because
      women are subjected to immoral habits ; when, as I have
      distinctly again and again asserted, I operation because
      there is undue and unbearable irritation of the clitoris, and
      in such cases alone is the operation likely to be
      successful."&mdash;(Mr. Baker Brown's "Replies to the Remarks
      of the Council," Nos. 12 and 13.)<br />

      <h3>Comments by the Medical Historian</h3>

      <p>Clitoridectomy and medical ethics<br />
       Editorial, <i>Medical Times and Gazette</i>, 13 April
      1867</p>

      <p><b>Background</b></p>

      <p>Although this is one of the most hypocritical documents in
      British medical history, its is also one of the most useful
      for illuminating the origins and nature of the double
      standard on male and female genital mutilation which persists
      to this day in English speaking countries. While it seeks to
      quarantine "mere circumcision" from real mutilation, it
      nonetheless makes a cogent and powerful case against any form
      of genital alteration which is performed without informed
      consent.</p>

      <p>The editorial was a response to the disgrace of Isaac
      Baker Brown, a prominent gynaecologist and dextrous surgeon
      who had made a name for himself as an authority on the female
      genitals, and the advocate of a procedure intended
      (guaranteed!) to cure many obscure nervous diseases&mdash;
      clitoridectomy. Brown claimed that conditions such as
      hysteria, epilepsy and catalepsy, as well as the masturbation
      which gave rise to them, could be prevented by the excision
      of the clitoris, and he insisted that he was merely following
      the lead of surgeons such as Jonathan Hutchinson, who
      similarly asserted that masturbation in boys could be stopped
      by amputation of the foreskin. In his genius for
      self-promotion, as well as in his conviction that he had
      found the magic bullet for the most intractable diseases of
      his age, he might be regarded as the Roger Short of the
      mid-nineteenth century. During the early 1860s Brown enjoyed
      considerable celebrity, but his methods came under attack in
      the 1860s, and the following year he was disgraced and
      expelled from the Obstetrical Society.</p>

      <p>In this editorial the <i>Medical Times and Gazette</i>
      explains why clitoridectomy is both scientifically unsound as
      medical therapy and a violation of medical ethics in terms
      which are still relevant today. Although it tries to
      quarantine male circumcision from female genital mutilation
      in a manner all too familiar to us, its reasoning here is
      feeble and the discrimination fails. The foreskin is also "an
      organ of exquisite sensitiveness, well supplied with blood
      vessels and nerves"; like clitoridectomy, circumcision is
      also an operation "occasionally attended with serious
      bleeding."* On the principle stated here&mdash;that sensitive
      organs, well supplied with blood vessels and nerves should
      not be excised without the informed consent of their
      owner&mdash;the editorial may be read as an attack on both
      clitoridectomy and circumcision, and a clear statement of why
      each procedure is an offence against both medical science and
      medical ethics.</p>

      <p>* Indeed, while there are numerous reports in nineteenth
      century medical journals of deaths and complications from
      circumcision, similar reports on clitoridectomy are very hard
      to find, suggesting that the latter was in fact the safer
      operation.</p>
