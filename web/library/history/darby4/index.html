         A review of the historiography - Review Essay</h2>
        <b>Robert Darby</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Although it is becoming rare as a routine
      procedure on newborn males, circumcision in both a medical
      and cultural/religious context has been the focus of
      increasing attention from medical historians. With the
      publication of David Gollaher's path-breaking investigations
      into its history, international efforts to ban the
      circumcision of women (female genital mutilation) as
      performed by some traditional Islamic and east African
      cultures, continuing protests against the survival of routine
      circumcision of male infants in the United States and parts
      of Canada, and a contrasting campaign on the part of some
      medical conservatives in Britain, the USA and Australia to
      restore the practice as a public health measure, scholarly
      interest in the origins and evolution of "the world's most
      controversial surgery" has never been more intense. Not that
      many definitive answers have emerged. Contrary to the mantra
      which opens nearly every article on the subject in medical
      journals (that circumcision is the oldest surgical operat ion
      known to man, practised by many ancient cultures etc),
      circumcision as a medically rationalised procedure is a
      recent invention, dating from the eighteenth century. Even as
      a religious ritual, circumcision was practised by only a few
      tribal societies, mostly living in desert regions: the
      Semtitic and Hamitic peoples of north and east Africa and the
      Middle East, and the Aboriginal people of central Australia
      are the most notable. (<a href="#n1">1</a>) Therapeutic
      circumcision was first introduced as a treatment for severe
      venereal infection of the penis (often causing scabs which
      fused the foreskin to the glans) and was no more than a
      last-ditch amputation of incurably diseased tissue; even then
      it was not performed often because most men were reluctant to
      lose part of their most prized possession. (<a
      href="#n2">2</a>) The concept of circumcision as a
      preventive, and then routine, procedure emerged in the
      mid-nineteenth century, though the reasons for this
      development remain contested. In a recent historical survey,
      Dunsmuir and Gordon cite prevention or cure of impotence,
      phimosis, sterility, priapism, masturbation, venereal
      disease, epilepsy, bed-wetting, night terrors, "precocious
      sexual unrest" and homosexuality as among the contradictory
      benefits urged by Victorian and Edwardian physicians in
      Britain and the USA, without offering any firm suggestions of
      their own as to the relative weight of these factors. (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>) Circumcision as a "routine" (that is,
      involuntary) operation on male infants was practised only in
      the English-speaking world; in its place of origin, Britain,
      it lasted only from the 1870s to the 1940s and probably
      affected no more than a third of boys at its peak--points
      which emphasise the importance of cultural and religious
      factors in explaining its rise and fall. (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>) Other authorities, however, stress the
      medical origins and continuing value of the procedure as a
      health precaution. According to Brian Morris, "the Victorians
      cited many of the same medical conditions associated with
      uncircumcised penises as do people today," while the idea
      that mass circumcision was introduced in the nineteenth
      century to discourage boys from masturbating is "in fact a
      falsehood that has been promoted by anti-circumcision
      groups." (<a href="#n5">5</a>) As a contemporary champion of
      the routine circumcision of male infants, Professor Morris is
      very critical of the unscientific approach of
      anti-circumcision activists, but it is strange to see him
      endorsing the Victorian enthusiasm for circumcision as
      consistent with today's arguments in its favour, yet denying
      that control of masturbation had anything to do with the
      matter.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is this issue that I wish to address
      here. By means of a review of the historiography of both the
      masturbation phobia and the rise of routine circumcision I
      hope to shed light on how significant the aim of preventing
      masturbation was in this process. To anticipate my
      conclusions, I shall argue that it has been widely accepted
      by medical historians since the 1950s that discouraging
      masturbation was a major reason why doctors, educationists
      and childcare experts sought to introduce widespread
      circumcision of both boys and girls in the nineteenth
      century, a campaign which was successful in the former case,
      unsuccessful in the latter--an outcome which still colours
      popular concepts about what constitutes genital mutilation. I
      suggest that a result of the partial character of this
      victory has been a high degree of blindness on the issue:
      while the treatment of hysteria and masturbation in women by
      clitoridectomy was noticed early on (and condemned with
      indignation), the comparable operation on boys (amputation of
      the foreskin) has been either ignored or given only fleeting
      attention, and has rarely been regarded with the same degree
      of abhorrence. I will also attempt to show the theological
      basis for much of the medical argument against masturbation
      and suggest that moral concern has always been an important
      element of the motivation for circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In searching for the link between the
      Western prohibition of childhood masturbation and the rise of
      routine circumcision, the psychoanalysts seem to have been
      the first on the trail. In a study of children with
      psychological and behavioural problems in the 1930s, Mabel
      Huschka reported that a high proportion of the boys had been
      threatened with mutilating operations on their penis if they
      masturbated. In her introduction to the data she makes
      reference to a small sample of medical literature which
      recommended circumcision for girls who persisted in the
      habit, and a rather more popular German book which recorded
      that some doctors "armed with great knives and scissors"
      threaten boys with a "painful operation or even to cut off
      the genital organs." The same authority added that "small
      operations" were sometimes helpful: one physician "cured a
      young fellow in whom ... no punishment had proved effective,
      by simply cutting off the anterior part of the foreskin with
      jagged scissors." He also mentioned infibulation a nd
      chastity cages to block access to the penis. (<a
      href="#n6">6</a>) Huschka seems unaware that infant male
      circumcision had become quite common in the USA by the 1930s
      (between 50 and 60 per cent of newborns--about the same as
      today), (<a href="#n7">7</a>) but the high incidence of
      mutilation threats received by boys, mostly picturing "the
      doctor" coming to cut their penis in some unspecified but
      painful way, would be possible only in a medical culture in
      which the surgical removal of (part of) the penis was
      frequently recommended and widely performed. There are no
      reports of such horror stories before the nineteenth century,
      and the cautionary tale for children with which these threats
      share the most affinity, "The story of little suck-a-thumb,"
      in Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter, was not published until
      1847, near the height of the masturbation scare in Germany.
      (<a href="#n8">8</a>) Discussing the prevalence of flogging
      in nineteenth century England, Ian Gibson comments that
      threats of castration for many varieties of bad behaviour,
      including playing with the genitals, were "probably not
      uncommon" and adds: "Circumcision, too, must have also seemed
      a castration threat to many children and been looked upon as
      a terrible punishment for having a penis." (<a
      href="#n9">9</a>) It would seem that the boys' fears were no
      more than an expression of medical/moral realities.</p>

      <p class="text2">After the war, in a much-cited article, Rene
      Spitz surveyed the medical literature on masturbation and
      related the increasing condemnation the practice to
      traditional Christian prohibitions against non-procreative
      sex and the publication of two alarmist texts in the
      eighteenth century: the anonymous Onania, or the heinous sin
      of self pollution (c. 1716), and Simon-Andre Tissot's
      Onanism, or a treatise on the disorders produced by
      masturbation (1758), from which nearly all the nineteenth
      century's invective against "solitary vice" can be sourced.
      (<a href="#n10">10</a>) Spitz quantified the greater
      prominence of punitive methods in the treatment of
      masturbation, in both girls and boys, in anglophone
      countries, and observed that "sadism" became "the foremost
      characteristic of the campaign" in the second half of the
      nineteenth century, including such "drastic measures" as
      surgery, restraint, severe punishment and fright; the surgery
      included blistering of the genitals, clitoridectomy in girls
      and circumcision in boys. (<a href="#n11">11</a>) Spitz notes
      that circumcision was consistently urged as a disincentive to
      masturbation in successive editions of L. Emmett Holt's
      influential textbook on paediatrics, The care and feeding of
      children, from 1895 until 1936, and points out that it was
      "not generally known that these sadistic practices found
      support among many authoritative physicians and ... were
      recommended up to a decade ago in official textbooks." They
      were not the obsession of a lunatic fringe. (<a
      href="#n12">12</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">A decade later, in an article cited even
      more often than that by Spitz, R.M. Hare traced the history
      of the masturbation phobia in more detail, especially the
      idea that it caused neuroses and insanity, a proposition
      which survived longer in Britain and the USA than in Europe.
      (<a href="#n13">13</a>) In this connection Hare drew
      attention to the importance of Claude-Francois Lallemand
      (1790-1853), Professor of Medicine at Montpellier, whose
      3-volume work Involuntary seminal losses (1836-42) seemed to
      confirm the reality of a disease later called spermatorrhoea.
      To cure this condition, which was often caused by
      masturbation, Lallemand recommended cauterisation of the
      urethra with silver nitrate, and circumcision in cases where
      the problem was the result of an excessively long or
      sensitive foreskin, and he exerted an enduring influence on
      British doctors, particularly William Acton. On the question
      of treatment, Hare observed that, by the second half of the
      nineteenth century, "surgical and pharmacological methods of
      preventing ma sturbation were certainly widespread,"
      mentioning depressant drugs and chastity devices for both
      sexes; infibulation of the foreskin, castration and severing
      the dorsal nerve of the penis in males; and clitoridectomy
      and ovariotomy in females. But he concluded that these
      interventions were either ineffective or too extreme to win
      wide acceptance. Like Spitz, he was horrified by the brief
      vogue for clitoridectomy which flared in Britain in the
      1860s, but relegated to a footnote his awareness that the
      eminent surgeon and expert on syphilis, (Sir) Jonathan
      Hutchinson, in his well known paper "On circumcision as a
      preventive of masturbation," nor only advocated universal
      circumcision of male infants, but considered that "measures
      more radical than circumcision would, if public opinion
      permitted their adoption, be a true kindness to many patients
      of both sexes." (<a href="#n14">14</a>) Hare's reticence on
      the growing acceptance of the compromise procedure on boys,
      which promised to curb undue lust while leaving the
      reproductive func tion intact, is puzzling.</p>

      <p class="text2">The sceptical mood and anti-puritanism of
      the 1960s found expression in Alex Comfort's light-hearted
      but reliable survey of medical manias, The anxiety makers
      (1967). "curious preoccupations of the profession" he listed
      the crusade for continence, an obsession with constipation,
      hostility to drinking tea, moralistic theories of venereal
      disease and the campaign against self-abuse. Following Spitz
      and Hare, Comfort observed that punitive treatments for the
      vice introduced in the second half of the nineteenth century
      included chastity belts and genital infibulation for both
      sexes, and spiked collars to wrap around the penis of boys
      afflicted by nocturnal emissions, as recommended by J.L.
      Milton in his much-reprinted book on spermatorrhoea. (<a
      href="#n15">15</a>) Comfort was more interested in and
      shocked by clitoridectomy than the circumcision of boys, but
      he points out that the latter was regularly recommended as a
      prophylactic against masturbation, notably by Jonathan
      Hutchinson. Comfort also drew attention to P.C. Remondino's
      tub-thumping advocacy of mass circumcision in his <i>History
      of circumcision from the earliest times to the present: Moral
      and physical reasons for its performance</i> (1891),
      according to which the procedure would not only discourage
      boys from masturbating, but immunise them against
      tuberculosis, cancer, syphilis, polio, idiocy, forgetfulness
      and just about any medical problem you cared to mention.
      Comfort makes the now obvious but then novel point that
      belief in the health benefits of circumcision is really the
      belief that the portion of the penis cut off is by nature
      pathogenic, an assumption which lay behind the medical
      profession's endorsement of routine circumcision in the
      nineteenth century, and which received forceful expression in
      Remondino's manifesto, where the foreskin is vilified, at
      tedious length, as a malign influence and moral "outlaw." (<a
      href="#n16">16</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Even more sceptical than Comfort was Thomas
      Szasz, who compared the cruel treatment of masturbators in
      the nineteenth century with the persecution of witches at an
      earlier period and related the obsession with masturbation as
      a illness-generating vice to the decline in the belief that
      diseases were the result of divine punishment for sin or the
      operations of witchcraft; in an age trying to be scientific,
      but when the cause of diseases was not understood, blaming
      them on personal habits was both morally satisfying and
      consistent with the "nerve force" theories then being
      developed by Albrecht von Haller (1708-77) and William Cullen
      (1710-90) as alternatives to traditional explanations based
      on humoral balance which stretched back to Hippocrates and
      Galen. (<a href="#n17">17</a>) Szasz also pointed out that
      much of the medical analysis of masturbation was no more than
      moral exhortation dressed in medical rhetoric. He accepted as
      an uncontroversial fact that "mutilating surgical operations
      on the penis" were standard sanctions against masturbation,
      citing both Hutchinson's paper, including his suggestion of
      castration in chronic cases, and E.J. Spratling's equally
      extreme tactic of cutting the dorsal nerve of the penis.
      Szasz identified a paradox in surgical treatment of the habit
      becoming more frequent as belief in the theory of
      masturbatory insanity declined, and explains this by
      suggesting that the phenomenon was related to "the
      development of surgical skills and aseptic operating
      techniques which allowed safe surgical mutilations1" not to
      new medical indications. (<a href="#n18">18</a>) Szasz also
      recorded the persistence of the advice to circumcise as a
      precaution against masturbation in textbooks such as Emmett
      Holt's and found the same recommendation in Griffith and
      Mitchell's Diseases of infants and children (1938). They
      present a paradox he was unable to explain: although they
      admit that masturbation does little damage, even when
      indulged in "to an extreme degree," they devote a page to
      treatments and conclude by endorsing circumcision for both
      boys and girls as a wise precaution. (<a
      href="#n19">19</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">H. Tristram Engelhardt further developed
      Spitz's and MacDonald's (<a href="#n20">20</a>) point that
      masturbation was originally sin rather than sickness by
      exploring the process by which a religious transgression was
      transformed into a medical disease without losing any of its
      immoral connotations, and drawing attention to the punitive
      character of the therapies evolved. He applied the ironic
      term "heroic methods" to cover such treatments as
      infibulation of the foreskin, vasectomy, cauterisation of the
      urethra, insertion of electrodes into the bladder and rectum,
      puncturing the prostate with needles, castration and
      circumcision. (<a href="#n21">21</a>) Engelhardt does not go
      into as much detail on the last of these as his sources
      warrant, and tends to leave the impression that it was a rare
      intervention instead of the routine procedure it soon became,
      but at least he identified it as a mainstream response to the
      problem. Arthur Gilbert provided further evidence on such
      remedies and also the nature of the diseases that
      masturbation was supposed to provoke. He suggested that the
      centrality of masturbation in accounts of organic disease was
      related to doctors' rising prestige and their tendency to
      take over the role of the priest; the cycle of sin,
      confession, penance and redemption was transferred from
      confessional to consulting room. At the same time, there was
      very little that physicians could actually do about most
      diseases, and blaming them on masturbation was often found
      more satisfactory than admitting their own impotence. (<a
      href="#n22">22</a>) Despite this, the authority of the
      medical profession increased steadily during the nineteenth
      century, and in 1889 an article in the Lancer compared them
      to "the old type of priests who combined moral and medical
      functions." (<a href="#n23">23</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">The moral mission of the medical profession
      was also the focus of a densely researched but little known
      paper by Ronald Hamowy, who shows how US doctors in the late
      nineteenth century successfully extended their ambit from the
      cure of disease to the enforcement of puritanical standards
      of sexual morality, and exerted a powerful influence on
      public law. He argues that psychological medicine, in
      particular, substituted the treatment of disease for the
      punishment of moral transgression and became both the arbiter
      and enforcer of virtuous conduct. By the end of the century,
      he suggests, it had succeeded in convincing the literate
      public as to the connection between sexual conduct and mental
      disease and been able to persuade US legislatures to pass
      laws which embodied the conclusions of the medical profession
      and "criminalize[d] sexual immorality under the guise of
      legislating in the area of preventive medicine." (<a
      href="#n24">24</a>) Hamowy documents the remedies proposed
      for masturbation, and goes into greater detail than many w
      riters on the use of clitoridectomy in girls, and
      infibulation, chastity devices and castration in boys. Among
      other examples, he describes a case in 1894 when eleven boys
      confined in a Kansas mental institute were castrated for
      persistent masturbation; when the local press raised an
      outcry at such severity, the <i>Kansas Medical Journal</i>
      defended the institute's action on the ground that the boys
      were confirmed masturbators.... This abuse weakened the
      already imbecile mind and destroyed the body. The practice is
      loathsome, disgusting, humiliating and destructive of all
      self-respect and decency, and had a bad moral effect on the
      whole school.</p>

      <p class="text2">It was backed up by doctors from all over
      the country. (<a href="#n25">25</a>) The puzzling omission
      from Hamowy's account is any discussion of circumcision. Many
      of the dozens of medical articles he cites (for example,
      those by C. Frank Lydston, E.J. Spratling and George Beard)
      are explicit and detailed about the preventive and curative
      value of such a therapy, and indeed regard it as the primary
      weapon, but Hamowy's only mention of it is in the form of an
      allusion by Lydston, who in 1893 called for the castration of
      "sex perverts," especially Negro rapists, "if the operation
      be supplemented by penile mutilation according to the
      Oriental method." (<a href="#n26">26</a>) Hamowy does not
      explicate this roundabout reference to circumcision, nor
      suggest why Lydston felt it was a necessary adjunct to
      castration in the control of Negroes. His discussion is thus
      not as complete as it could and, given his sources, should
      have been, but his detailed and fully documented discussion
      of castration alone should have made it impossible for later
      historians of nineteenth century sexuality to make bland
      statements such as this by Thomas Laqueur: "There was no male
      castration, no removal of healthy testes, except in a few
      rare and quite specific instances for criminal insanity or to
      treat cancer of the prostate." (<a href="#n27">27</a>) Cancer
      of the prostate was one disease from which those Kansas boys
      had been guaranteed permanent protection.</p>

      <p class="text2">R.P. Neuman added fresh dimensions to the
      discussion by relating the concern with masturbation to
      demographic factors. He argued that with the Industrial
      Revolution the average age of puberty declined while the
      normal age of marriage rose, creating an interval between
      childhood and adulthood which had not existed before. This
      led to a new concern with child-rearing and a far closer
      supervision of sexually mature children, who now spent a
      longer interval between puberty and marriage than used to be
      the case; the question (rarely spoken) was whether
      "adolescents" (as they later became known) were entitled to
      sexual activity during this time, and the puritanical
      tendencies of the period ensured that the answer was no.
      Associated with these developments was a denial that young
      children had any sexual feelings at all, with the result that
      manifestations like fondling and masturbation were
      categorised as pathological and attributed to local
      irritation (such as a tight foreskin, worms or "secretions"),
      to bad influe nces (particularly at school) or to servants'
      tickling a child's genitals as a tranquilliser. As Neuman
      puts it</p>

      <blockquote>
        In order to preserve the respectable sexual fantasy that
        sex was for adults, not children, and for the purpose of
        procreation rather than pleasure, doctors had to explain
        masturbation in the very young as the product of certain
        organic problems or as the result of bad habits taught by
        others. So it was suggested that infants scratched their
        genitals because of local irritations caused by uncleanness
        or worms. (<a href="#n28">28</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">William Acton's opinion that childhood ought
      to be a period of "absolute sexual quiescence" (<a
      href="#n29">29</a>) was an important influence here. If any
      manifestation of sexual capacity before puberty was
      pathological rather than normal, it had to be eliminated, and
      corrective surgery, including circumcision, was one of the
      usual means. None of this meant that masturbation after
      puberty was any less reprobated: Neuman reports the
      particularly chilling case of a 23-year old American man who
      was diagnosed as suffering from masturbatory insanity in the
      1880s, sent to a mental hospital, confined for two months in
      a straitjacket and finally subjected to an "operation on his
      prepuce calculated to interfere with or stop his vice," as Dr
      Spitzka (his gaoler/physician) put it. After this treatment
      he did not masturbate again for four months but, strangely,
      became no less paranoid. (<a href="#n30">30</a>) Neuman's
      argument also explains why the early sex educators, although
      regarded as dangerously advanced for their time, were
      actually seeking to curb adolescent sexual activity by
      "telling them the truth" about how harmful it was.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a particularly interesting article which
      showed that there were two sides to the familiar Victorian
      double standard on sexual morality, Gail Pat Parsons took
      issue with feminist historians who argued that while women in
      the nineteenth century were the victims of humiliating and
      invasive surgical procedures at the hands of (male) doctors)
      who left them raw and bleeding, men were treated differently
      and with more respect. No, she points out, "men as well as
      women suffered excruciating treatment at the hands of
      physicians, whose limited knowledge reduced them to punitive,
      at times brutal, methods," including chastity devices,
      circumcision and castration. (<a href="#n31">31</a>) She
      shows that belief in spermatorrhoea as a real disease was
      widely held by the medical profession and not just the
      obsession of a few cranks; she points out that "cures" were
      often modelled on treatments originally devised for uterine
      disorders, including the insertion of needles into the
      perineum and testicles, and the urethral cauterisation
      recommend ed by Lallemand, favoured by Acton and widely
      employed in both Britain and the USA. (<a href="#n32">32</a>)
      Parsons includes a telling discussion of the confused
      theories of disease on which the designation of masturbation
      as pathological and circumcision as curative were based. Some
      doctors favoured the new nerve force theories associated with
      Haller and Cullen, while others stuck to the traditional
      view, popularised by Tissot but going back to Hippocrates,
      Galen and Avicenna, that it was the loss of a precious
      animating secretion like semen which debilitated the system.
      Acton himself could never decide whether it was the shock of
      orgasm to the nervous system or the loss of vital fluid which
      did the most damage. (<a href="#n33">33</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Whatever the mechanism, as Barry Smith
      points out in his history of public health in nineteenth
      century Britain, doctors after 1870 generally advocated
      universal circumcision of boys, preferably done soon after
      birth. He does not go into details as to why, but cites
      Hutchinson for the main reasons then given: the foreskin was
      "a harbour of filth," a source of irritation, an incitement
      to masturbation and an obstacle to continence; circumcision
      not only corrected these problems, but reduced the risk of
      syphilis in the young and cancer in the aged. The endorsement
      of the procedure by one of England's most eminent physicians,
      and President of the Royal College of Surgeons, carried
      weight. (<a href="#n34">34</a>) In assessing the significance
      of masturbation in this list it is not a matter of asking
      whether routine circumcision was introduced as a deterrent to
      secret vice or as a health measure; the main health benefit
      of the procedure was the lessened tendency to masturbation,
      then regarded as a serious disease. Most doctors also
      believed in the virtue of continence (Acton was particularly
      eloquent on this topic), but few aimed explicitly to reduce
      sexual pleasure; that was a minor side-effect of a necessary
      precaution against seminal loss and nervous excitement. The
      new pressures of the modern age were also problems. In the
      United States Michael Kimmel identified a crisis in masculine
      identity brought about by rapid industrialisation, leading to
      the replacement of old models of manhood (the "genteel
      patriarch" and the "heroic artisan") with the "marketplace
      man." In this model, self-control and conservation of the
      body's energies were vital, and masturbation was inevitably
      seen as a waste of resources and a threat to success. In a
      context of both medical and moral warnings against the
      practice, Kimmel reports the invention of various devices
      contrived to prevent it, and refers particularly to J.H.
      Kelloggs' best-selling prescriptions for clean and healthy
      living in the 1880s. These included a list of 39 signs by
      which masturbators co uld be detected, and a set of remedies,
      including bandaging and caging the genitals; tying the hands
      to prevent touching; sewing up the foreskin with silver wire
      to prevent erection and create sufficient discomfort to make
      sexual impulse unwelcome; and finally circumcision--to be
      performed "without administering an anaesthetic, as the brief
      pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon
      the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of
      punishment." (<a href="#n35">35</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">During the 1970s several historians of
      childhood and the family realised that modernisation of
      attitudes to children was an uneven process: they might have
      been freed from their swaddling cloths in the eighteenth
      century, but other constraints were soon imposed. Lloyd De
      Mause, who was unusual in recognising that circumcision of
      boys as carried out by "Jews, Egyptians, Arabs and others"
      was a "mutilation of children by adults," noted that parents
      began punishing their children for masturbation in the late
      eighteenth century and that "doctors began to spread the myth
      that it would cause insanity, epilepsy, blindness and death,"
      a campaign which reached a climax in the late nineteenth
      century. In response circumcision, clitoridectomy and
      infibularion were sometimes used as punishment; and all sorts
      of restraint devices ... were prescribed. Circumcision became
      especially widespread; as one American child psychologist our
      it, when a child of two rubs his nose and can't sit still for
      a moment, only circumcision works. Another doctor, whose book
      was the bible of many an American nineteenth century home,
      recommended that little boys be closely watched for signs of
      masturbation, and brought in to him for circumcision. (<a
      href="#n36">36</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">De Mause was more willing than many of his
      colleagues to face ugly facts, but a trifle optimistic in
      believing that such methods died out in the 1920s.
      Nonetheless, such perceptions had some influence on
      mainstream historians, such as J.H. Plumb, who felt obliged
      to modify his otherwise genial account of childhood in the
      eighteenth century with the acknowledgment that the
      masturbation phobia meant a partial return to brutality: "by
      1800 crimes of unbelievable cruelty were being practised on
      young boys in order to cure them, such as circumcision
      without anaesthetic." (<a href="#n37">37</a>) Lawrence Stone
      likewise wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Inspired by fears of physical debilitation and even of
        insanity, some surgeons in the third quarter of the
        nineteenth century were performing clitoridectomy on
        masturbating girls and deliberately painful circumcision on
        boys, while agitated parents were attaching toothed rings
        to the penis and locking adolescents into chastity belts
        and even strait-jackets for the night. (<a
        href="#n38">38</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">In his study of English purity movements,
      Edward Bristow noted that during the nineteenth century
      doctors joined the quacks in "designing douches to cool the
      genitals and devices to restrain them, like the spiked penis
      ring," but that they then went a step further to
      "clitoridectomies and circumcision as treatment for
      masturbation." (<a href="#n39">39</a>) The same limited
      evidence was still being recirculated (mainly drawn from
      Spitz and Hare), but the sentiment of outrage was new.</p>

      <p class="text2">Plumb got the start rather than the end date
      wrong, but the relevant point is that the basic information
      had emerged from the specialist journals and been published
      in mainstream publications with a general readership. Even
      though there had been no dedicated study of the issue and
      scholars had barely scratched the surface of the medical
      literature, by the early 1980s it was well established that
      widespread circumcision of young boys was introduced in
      English-speaking countries in the late nineteenth century,
      and that the main reason for the procedure was the desire to
      discourage masturbation in both childhood and adolescence.
      Given the horror of circumcision which had prevailed only a
      century before, (<a href="#n40">40</a>) this represents a
      revolution in medical attitudes and body-related practices
      which demands explanation, so it is both surprising and
      disappointing that a major study of the Victorians' love
      lives, Peter Gay's much-praised <i>Education of the
      senses</i> (1984), does not even mention the phenomenon. Gay
      does include a brief discussion of masturbation but does not
      go beyond the standard secondary sources: he follows Spitz in
      describing some of the remedies as "draconian" and
      "sadistic," likewise noting that after the 1850s the
      "innocuous cures" (<a href="#n41">41</a>) favoured by earlier
      physicians gave way to "a formidable armamentarium of
      mechanical restraints resembling ... mediaeval torture
      instruments and surgical procedures like cauterisation of the
      sexual organs, infibularion, castration and clitoridectomy."
      (<a href="#n42">42</a>) But Gay exhibits his own double
      standard in waxing indignant at the case (cited from Spitz)
      of a girl treated for masturbation by the last of these
      therapies, while remaining silent about the fact that the
      amputation of the foreskin became a standard procedure on
      boys. (<a href="#n43">43</a>) It was one of the most
      distinctive and enduring of all the Victorian contributions
      to sexual health and bodily management, at least within the
      anglophone world, and you might think he would wish to
      analyse it in detail. Gay exaggerates the extent to which
      warnings against the dire results of masturbation disappeared
      after 1910, and also implies that the end of the panic was
      partly to the credit of Freud and psychoanalysis. Although
      their influence may have been significant, other factors,
      such as the acceptance of a valid theory of organic disease
      (germs) were probably more important, and it is misleading to
      suggest that the campaign against masturbation "was spent."
      One of Gay's own sources (Spitz) makes clear that the old
      alarm bells were still being rung in the 1930s, while Freud
      himself, as Gay acknowledges, had no doubts as to the
      pathological nature of the habit and cautioned his own son
      against it. (<a href="#n44">44</a>) Even Lesley Hall, in her
      discussion of "brutal remedies for [male] self-abuse"
      recommended by the Victorian medical profession, does not
      mention circumcision, though she is aware that their aim was
      to "guard the penis against improper manipulation" and keep
      the organ sufficiently sore "to render erection painful," as
      the Lancet put in 1870. (<a href="#n45">45</a>) Yet many of
      the sources she cites (such as James Copland's Dictionary of
      practical medicine, 1844-58) are emphatic on the prophylactic
      or curative value of circumcision, and letters she quotes
      from anxious men to Marie Stopes in the 1920s reveal that
      many of them been told at some stage of their lives that
      masturbation was a well accepted indication for circumcision.
      As CW wrote from Belfast in 1923:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I shall be much obliged for your advice on a "disease"
        which has troubled me for the last 10 years, that of
        self-abuse. I started it when a boy at school, and it seems
        impossible for me to shake off the vice now.... Would you
        advise me to be circumcised?.... If you advise circumcision
        could I do it myself as I don't wish to approach a doctor
        on the subject as I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. (<a
        href="#n46">46</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">With silences like these, it is hardly
      surprising that it was not until the 1990s that scholars
      began to acknowledge that forcibly amputating part of boys'
      genitals was morally no different from doing the same to
      girls. (<a href="#n47">47</a>) Morris's disapproval
      notwithstanding, it was the agitation of anti-circumcision
      campaigners in the late 1980s which finally brought the issue
      out into the open.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anticipating this change of mood was
      Wallerstein's remarkably temperate study of the survival of
      routine infant circumcision in the USA (Britain having
      abandoned the practice in the early 1950s, New Zealand in the
      1960s, and Australia and Canada relinquishing it more slowly
      from the 1970s). Wallerstein includes a discussion of
      circumcision as "one of the milder solutions" to the disease
      of masturbation and refers to the excitable Dr Remondino as
      one of those who popularised the concept of a link between
      the foreskin and proneness to the habit. He also points out
      that the religious prohibition on masturbation dates back
      beyond Christianity to ancient Judaic theologians, many of
      whom held it to be a "reprehensible sin" and even a "capital
      crime." (<a href="#n48">48</a>) The most astonishing of
      Wallerstein's revelations is that advocacy of circumcision as
      a disincentive to masturbation did not die with Emmett Holt.
      In 1941 Dr Alan Guttmacher, in a widely-read article in a
      popular magazine, recommended it because the simplified penis
      was easier to wash, but the aim was moral as well as physical
      hygiene: "It does not necessitate handling of the penis by
      the infant's mother, or the child himself in later years, and
      therefore does not focus the male's attention on his own
      genitals. Masturbation is considered less likely." As late as
      1956, in <i>Pregnancy and birth</i>, Guttmacher reiterated
      his conviction that the "handling of the genitalia" made
      necessary by the retention of the foreskin "encourages
      masturbation." (<a href="#n49">49</a>) Summarising his
      understanding of the origins of modern circumcision a few
      years later, Wallerstein wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        So-called "health" circumcision originated in the
        nineteenth century, when most diseases were of unknown
        etiology. Within the miasma of myth and ignorance, a theory
        emerged that masturbation caused many and varied ills. It
        seemed logical to some physicians to perform genital
        surgery on both sexes to stop masturbation; the major
        technique applied to males was circumcision. (<a
        href="#n50">50</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">It is remarkable how persistent that miasma
      has proved.</p>

      <p class="text2">The first focused attempt to account for the
      rise of routine male circumcision in Britain was made by
      Ronald Hyam, in his study of sexuality and empire, who
      relates the popularity of circumcision at the turn of the
      century to three main factors. The first was the fear of
      racial decline and falling physical fitness standards, giving
      rise to a host of anxieties and counter-measures, including
      the belief that circumcision would produce healthier and more
      self-confident males and "contribute to the general
      improvement of the ... manliness of the future guardians of
      empire." The second was the sudden enthusiasm for Jewish
      child-rearing practices, especially in response to reports of
      a low rate of syphilis and masturbation among Jews. The third
      was the necessity for colonial administrators to work in hot
      or humid climates where hygiene of the uncircumcised penis
      was presumed to be difficult. Hyam notes, in particular, that
      it was widely believed that normal males were more
      susceptible to venereal disease in hot env ironments, and
      that British Army doctors in India were vigorously in favour
      of the procedure and operated on their soldiers at the first
      sign of trouble. (<a href="#n51">51</a>) Hyam's account is
      not without serious gaps. He does not explain why hygiene in
      hot climates came to be seen as a problem only after the rise
      of circumcision in a cool climate, nobody having worried
      about the issue when the British first entered India in the
      eighteenth century; nor why it was believed that removal of
      the foreskin would produce healthier males; and he discounts
      the supposed value of circumcision in curbing masturbation as
      an explanation for its spread. On this point he is clearly
      mistaken, and his own discussion makes little sense without
      the conviction that masturbation was in itself a major health
      hazard and one of the factors contributing to national
      decline. The main reason for the sudden enthusiasm for Jewish
      child rearing practices was the impression that Jewish boys
      did not masturbate, a contention widely debated in the
      medical journals of the time but eagerly confirmed by Jewish
      doctors, who were understandably delighted that the gentile
      world was at last beginning to respect a ritual it had
      traditionally despised.</p>

      <p class="text2">More convincing on this point is Ornella
      Moscucci, who shows that circumcision was increasingly
      recommended as a cure for male masturbation from the 1850s
      onwards. She points out that part of this process was the
      demonisation of the foreskin as a source of nervous and
      physical disease and agrees with Hyam that circumcision was
      central to the late Victorian redefinition of manliness in
      terms of self-restraint and cleanliness: "Widely believed to
      dampen sexual desire, circumcision was seen positively as a
      means of both promoting chastity and physical health." (<a
      href="#n52">52</a>) Moscucci also discusses the contrasting
      case of female circumcision and clitoridectomy and explains
      how, after a brief vogue in the 1860s for treating
      masturbation and hysteria, the procedures fell rapidly into
      disfavour. Although the latter operation continued to be
      performed in the USA until the 1950s, it was effectively
      outlawed by the British medical profession and had
      disappeared from their surgical repertoire by the 1880s.
      Moscucci's article is particularly significant as one of the
      first to identify the double standard whereby female
      circumcision and clitoridectomy are denounced as mutilations
      which must be stopped, while male circumcision is accepted as
      a mild and harmless adjustment, even if irrelevant to health.
      When the London doctor, Isaac Baker Brown, was expelled from
      the Obstetrical Society in 1867 for treating masturbation in
      women by clitoridectomy, his opponents referred to the
      operation as a "questionable, compromising, unpublishable
      mutilation" which would affect the women's sex lives, leave
      them permanently maimed and cast an indelible slur on their
      honour. Brown defended himself by claiming that masturbation
      caused hysteria, epilepsy, mania and, eventually, insanity
      and death, and argued that clitoridectomy was no more
      mutilating than male circumcision, as proved by the
      subsequent pregnancy of one of his patients. His critics did
      not dissent from the proposition that masturbation could
      provoke the ills he mentioned, but they insisted that the
      practice was so rare in women that radical interventions of
      this kind were not necessary. The thing that outraged the
      society most, and the issue which probably sealed Brown's
      disgrace, was the fact that the operation was per formed
      without informed or any other kind of consent; but this was
      not a consideration which exercised their professional
      consciences in the case of little boys. (<a
      href="#n53">53</a>) Drawing a modem parallel, Moscucci refers
      to an article by a US doctor on the horrors of female genital
      mutilation in Africa, (<a href="#n54">54</a>) and the
      commentary of a colleague who reported that her own son was
      circumcised, against her wishes and audibly against his own,
      at the insistence of her husband, despite paediatric advice
      that the operation conferred no health benefits: in other
      words, it was a cultural ritual like the ordeal of the
      African girls. Referring to Gordon's indignation, she asked
      whether those who lived in glasshouses had the right to throw
      stones:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Where are the passionate voices of our Western, male
        medical anthropologists ... speaking out on the practice of
        male genital surgery in the United States? Why isn't male
        circumcision also one of the places, to cite Mel Konner,
        "where we ought to draw the line"? (<a href="#n55">55</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">It is only the rituals of other peoples that
      seem strange and barbarous.</p>

      <p class="text2">A similar question was asked by Szasz,
      returning to the fray in 1996 with a typically provocative
      article on the ethics of male routine neonatal circumcision
      (RNC). Pointing out that the similarities between RNC and
      female genital mutilation are obvious to anybody who has not
      been culturally conditioned to accept the former as normal
      and the latter as bizarre, he asks: "Why is RNC legal?
      Because it is defined as preventive medicine. Why is it
      defined as preventive medicine? To avoid having to ban it as
      male genital mutilation." (<a href="#n56">56</a>) Turning to
      the origins of the practice, Szasz refers to the
      transformation of childbirth in the late nineteenth century,
      from home deliveries assisted by (female) midwives to
      hospital births managed by (male) physicians, setting the
      stage for "the circumcision of the normal male infant by the
      obstetrician--a practice rationalised as prophylaxis ...
      against ... masturbation." He comments that</p>

      <blockquote>
        Virtually all medical texts at the end of the nineteenth
        century and the beginning of the twentieth century
        prescribed circumcision for a variety of ills, ranging from
        epilepsy and hydrocephalus to malnutrition and
        tuberculosis, and confidently asserted that it was a cure
        for the "disease" of masturbation. (<a href="#n57">57</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Szasz commends US critics of RNC for
      recognising that the determination to stamp out masturbation
      played an important part in the establishment of the
      practice, but also points our that masturbation was only one
      of "a long line of religious transgressions that were
      converted into medical diseases," and refers particularly to
      the severity with which it has been condemned in traditional
      Jewish theology, which regards it as "a sin more serious than
      all the sins of the Torah." (<a href="#n58">58</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">The most focused account of the rise of
      routine circumcision in the USA is provided by Frederick
      Hodges, who pays particular attention to the significance of
      masturbation in this process. Dr Hodges is associated with
      groups in the USA which oppose male and female genital
      mutilation, and he has been a prominent speaker at Nocirc
      conference since 1996--thus one of the mythmakers condemned
      by Professor Morris. But there is nothing in his exhaustive
      survey of the medical literature and his meticulous
      documentation of the medical profession's developing views
      and practices to suggest that he is inventing anything; if
      the conclusions of his research seem highly-coloured or
      gruesome, that is in the nature of the source material, which
      does yield dark truths which contemporary advocates of
      routine circumcision naturally find embarrassing. It is not,
      however, the cruelty or moralism of early enthusiasts which
      Hodges finds most disturbing, but their sloppy reasoning,
      poor science, lack of ethics, and the authoritarian zeal
      which many of them brought to their task. A telling quote is
      this by Dr Spratling in 1895:</p>

      <blockquote>
        In all cases [of masturbation] ... circumcision is
        undoubtedly the physicians' closest friend and ally.... To
        obtain the best results one must cur away enough skin and
        mucous membrane to rather put it on a stretch when
        erections come later. There must be no play in the skin
        after the wound has thoroughly healed, but it must fit
        tightly over the penis, for should there be any play the
        patient will be found to readily resume his practice, not
        begrudging the time and extra energy required to produce
        the orgasm. (<a href="#n59">59</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Spratling went on to suggest that a
      supplementary circumcision might be necessary as the
      remaining skin stretched.</p>

      <p class="text2">Hodges traces the origins of routine
      circumcision to the masturbation phobia of the eighteenth
      century, but more specifically to theories of degenerative
      disease and reflex neurosis which held that disturbances of
      nervous equilibrium could cause disease, and which thus
      targeted sensitive parts of the body as the guilty parties.
      In this scenario, erotic sensation was redefined as
      irritation, orgasm as convulsion and erection as priapism; as
      the most sensitive part of the penis, the foreskin was
      particularly suspect. In the work of Lallemand and his many
      followers the normal male sexual function--the production and
      emission of sperm--was categorised as a life-threatening
      disease which demanded drastic treatment. If all this sounds
      too incredible, we must remember that it was a time when the
      causes of most diseases were not understood, treatments were
      ineffective, and mortality (especially in children) was high;
      belief in witchcraft or spirits as causes of illness had been
      discredited by the Enlightenment, and m asturbation at least
      offered a materialist explanation. At the same time,
      theologians and other public moralists were advocating
      increased sexual purity, a demand which grew more insistent
      in the nineteenth century and reached a crescendo in the
      syphilis scare of the early twentieth. Lallemand recommended
      circumcision for serious cases of spermatorrhoea, and this
      idea caught on in the USA, where castration (not unusual in
      cases of epilepsy and insanity) was obviously too extreme a
      measure to become popular. The theory of the reflex neurosis
      was developed by the distinguished orthopaedic surgeon, Lewis
      Sayre, who claimed that many cases of muscular paralysis were
      caused by a long, tight or otherwise constricted prepuce and
      could be cured by circumcision; the same result in girls
      could be achieved by clitoridectomy. In seeking evidence for
      the effects of circumcision, the medical profession naturally
      looked to the Jewish community, whose own doctors were only
      too happy to assure them that Jewish boys did not ma
      sturbate, or not as much as the uncircumcised. As Dr M.J.
      Moses advised:</p>

      <blockquote>
        As an Israelite, I desire to ventilate the subject.... I
        refer to masturbation as one of the effects of a long
        prepuce; not that this vice is entirely absent in those who
        have undergone circumcision, though I never saw an instance
        in a Jewish child of very tender years except as the result
        of association with children whose covered glans have
        naturally impelled them to the habit. (<a
        href="#n60">60</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Support for preventive circumcision was
      strengthened by reports that Jews also presented with lower
      rates of syphilis and cancer of the penis, and it was assumed
      that the absence of the foreskin must account for the
      difference. These were powerful selling points in Abraham
      Wolbarst's influential call for universal male circumcision
      in 1914, but he was equally insistent on its value as a
      "prophylactic against masturbation." (<a href="#n61">61</a>)
      Among the most disturbing of Hodges' findings is the
      insularity of the American medical profession, which clung to
      the old theory of "congenital phimosis" long after it had
      been debunked in Britain and Europe; and among the most
      astonishing is that masturbation was still being listed as an
      indication for circumcision as late as the 1970s. Although
      paediatricians had dropped this notion, the third edition of
      a standard urological textbook, Campbell's urology (1970)
      stated: "Parents readily recognise the importance of local
      cleanliness and genital hygiene in their children and are
      usually ready to adopt measures which may avert masturbation.
      Circumcision is usually advised on these grounds." (<a
      href="#n62">62</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">The influence of politically inspired
      scholars like Hodges is apparent in the illuminating research
      of David Gollaher on the history of circumcision, and
      particularly in the difference between his path-breaking
      journal article of 1994 and his later book. In his article
      Gollaher focuses on the discoveries of Lewis Sayre and his
      subsequent theories on the link between problem foreskins and
      various paralytic illnesses, codified in his book On the
      deleterious results of a narrow prepuce and preputial
      adhesions (1888). He shows that other doctors were quick to
      take up Sayre's findings and push them further. Soon adherent
      prepuces were being discovered all over the country and their
      removal alleviating the symptoms of numerous childhood
      complaints; one doctor reported a case of "brass poisoning
      completely cured." Dr Norman Chapman suggested that the
      incidence of adhesive foreskins was probably higher than
      people realised; since "a long and contracted foreskin" was
      so often a source of "secondary complications," he went on to
      propose that it was "always good surgery to correct this
      deformity ... as a precautionary measure, even though no
      symptoms have as yet presented themselves." Chapman suggested
      in 1882 that Christians had much to learn from Jews in this
      respect:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Moses was a good sanitarian, and if circumcision was more
        generally practised at the present day, I believe that we
        would hear far less of the pollutions and indiscretions of
        youth; and that our daily papers would not be so profusely
        flooded with all kinds of cures for loss of manhood.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">As Gollaher observes, this declaration
      represents an important transition in thought: circumcision
      becomes not just a treatment for existing problems, but an
      anticipation designed to prevent possible "complications" in
      the future. Thus the preventive career of the operation was
      launched. (<a href="#n63">63</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Gollaher discusses masturbation as a
      separate causative factor, noting Remondino's convictions
      that the foreskin was always to blame for childhood
      masturbation and that "the children of circumcised races"
      were neither as prone to the habit nor as susceptible to wet
      dreams. He also reports that childcare handbooks were
      recommending circumcision to prevent the vile habit of
      masturbation" from the mid-1890s. (<a href="#n64">64</a>)
      Gollaher does not integrate masturbation with the theory of
      reflex neuroses which lay behind Sayre's adoption of
      circumcision as a cure for many nervous ailments, but the
      "irritabilities" supposedly provoked by either a constricted
      foreskin or the act of masturbation were remarkably similar,
      and each had such equally harmful effects that it was
      difficult to distinguish the two aetiologies: in the case of
      one teenage patient, it was suspected that the real cause of
      his paralysis was in fact masturbation. (<a
      href="#n65">65</a>) What is apparent throughout Gollaher's
      discussion is that a puritanical animus against sexual in
      dulgence was woven deeply into the texture of the doctors'
      clinical arguments and that it is impossible to separate
      their moral theology from their medical science. The same
      doctor who could not explain why circumcision cured brass
      poisoning nonetheless resolved that whether it be curative or
      not it is conservative, and removes one source of irritation
      from an exquisitely sensitive organ. I would favour
      circumcision, however, independent of existing disease, as a
      sanitary precaution.... (1) The exposure of the glans to
      friction etc. hardens it, and renders it less liable to
      abrasion in sexual intercourse, and consequently venereal
      ulcer. (2) It is acknowledged to be useful as a preventive of
      masturbation. (3) It certainly renders the accident of
      phymosis and paraphymosis impossible. (4) It prevents the
      retention of sebaceous secretion and consequent balanitis.
      (5) It probably promotes continence by diminishing the
      pruriency of the sexual appetite. (<a href="#n66">66</a>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Two of the five points are not medical
      considerations at all, but mere moral assumptions.</p>

      <p class="text2">In his more wide-ranging book on the history
      of circumcision Gollaher follows the same line of argument,
      but his discussion of masturbation is considerably expanded,
      and it plays a more central role in his explanation for the
      rise of routine circumcision. He cites Hutchinson, Kellogg
      and paediatricians such as Angel Money as fervent advocates
      of the intervention, and notes the importance of the Jewish
      example in encouraging doctors to believe that circumcised
      boys did not masturbate. He follows Szasz in recognising the
      severity of the ancient Jewish prohibition against the
      practice, notes the Lancet's discoveries in the 1860s that
      masturbation and bed-wetting were rare in Jewish communities,
      and describes M.J. Moses as a "crusader against the foreskin
      as the primary cause of masturbation." He also appreciates
      that doctors around the turn of the century were perfectly
      aware that circumcision reduced sexual pleasure and that they
      approved of it for precisely this reason. (<a
      href="#n67">67</a>) The inescapable conclusion of his t
      horoughly documented studies is that deterrence of
      masturbation was a major motivation for the introduction of
      widespread male circumcision in the late Victorian
      period.</p>

      <p class="text2">Whatever the balance between the various
      factors leading to this triumph, it is obvious that such an
      immense shift in medical thinking needed the conjunction of
      many causes. It is equally clear that routine circumcision
      arose from a mire of ignorance and now discredited theories
      of disease, including outright quackery (the pathologisation
      of male sexuality as spermatorrhoea); medical delusions
      (theories of reflex neuroses and masturbatory illness);
      puritanical zeal (the determination to suppress sexual
      activity in childhood and adolescence); loss of knowledge
      about the normal anatomy and physiology of the penis, with
      the result that the adhesion and non-retractability of the
      foreskin in young boys was classified as a congenital defect
      instead of being recognised as its natural condition; (<a
      href="#n67]8">68</a>) and wild hopes that a miracle cure had
      been found for such rapacious diseases as tuberculosis,
      syphilis, polio and cancer. Whether the desire to prevent
      masturbation was 30, 60 or 90 per cent responsible for the
      institut ion of routine circumcision, there is no basis for
      the claim that the connection is a lie put about by
      anti-circumcision activists.</p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, it can be seen that doctors in
      English-speaking countries introduced widespread circumcision
      of male infants in the late nineteenth century. At the time
      this innovation was justified largely in terms of
      discouraging masturbation, then regarded as a serious disease
      in its own right and as the cause of many more, but this
      rationale was increasingly overlaid by others in the early
      twentieth century, including protection against syphilis and
      cancer, freedom from phimosis (seen as a problem mainly
      because it was thought to provoke masturbation), and a
      general contribution to both moral and physical hygiene. To
      justify circumcision on the ground that it discouraged
      masturbation was to acknowledge that the operation reduced
      the sensitivity of the penis and curtailed sexual pleasure, a
      powerful argument to use at a time when most respectable
      people believed that excessive sexual indulgence was morally
      wrong as well as physically harmful; mainstream paediatric
      and child care manuals continued to assert the value of
      circumcision as a disincentive to masturbation right up until
      the 1950s. With the advance of the sexual revolution in the
      1960s (by which time routine circumcision survived only in
      the USA, Canada and Australia) this ceased to be a strong
      selling point; if a doctor there wanted to persuade parents
      to let him amputate part of their baby's penis he now had to
      reassure them that the procedure would significantly increase
      health without noticeably reducing sexual functionality or
      pleasure, and the original logic of its introduction was lost
      in a welter of social, aesthetic and medical
      rationalisations. At the scholarly level, the significance of
      the original link between masturbation and circumcision was
      rediscovered in the 1950s, when belief in the harmful effects
      of the former was declining, and as medical historians began
      to investigate the origin, course and effects of the onanism
      scare during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

        invention), seminal emissions and self abuse, and in this
        context focused on the foreskin. Following Lewis Sayre
        (discussed below) he reported that most sufferers from
        nervous disease had an abnormal prepuce, for the obvious
        reason that "a redundant, elongated prepuce, covering the
        gland [sic] and pressuring upon it, acts as an irritant to
        the whole system." Circumcision was required to relieve the
        pressure and thus cure the consequent illnesses. (George
        Beard, <i>The New Cyclopaedia of Family Medicine--Our Home
        Physician: A Popular Guide to the Art of Preserving Health
        and Treating Disease</i> [Sydney, 1884], 882-9.)

        orgasm rarely occurs as a result of the fondling and
        manipulation naturally undertaken by children before
        puberty, a fact which emphasises the point that the real
        objection to masturbation was moral, not medical. In trying
        to explain how masturbation caused organic disease, Tissot
        and his followers drew eclectically on the Galenic humoral
        tradition, revived in the eighteenth century by Hermann
        Boerhaave, and the new theories of nervous force developed
        by Hailer without showing awareness of their
        incompatibility. See Stengers, Ch. 6.

        understood by English physicians up until William Acton,
        who wrote: "In childhood the penis is naturally small, with
        the foreskin pointed, and nor only completely covering the
        glans, but even extending beyond it. The attempt to uncover
        the glans is attended with difficulty in consequence of a
        natural phymosis, and similarly the process of recovering
        the glans owing to a natural paraphymosis cannot be
        accomplished without ... violence.... The mucous membrane
        is soft and flaccid, and ... free from the secretion called
        smegma by which it is covered in after life" (Acton 1903,
        1). The errors of his successors were corrected by Douglas
