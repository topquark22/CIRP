      <p class="abstract"><span class="sc">S U M M A R Y</span>.
      During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
      there were two views on the relationship between syphilis and
      male circumcision: one was that circumcision provided
      protection, another that circumcision was a significant
      source of syphilic infection. This article reviews that
      debate, relates the first view to an influential article by
      Jonathan Hutchinson in 1855 and considers the subsequent use
      made of his statistics. It is suggested that the original
      statistics were of dubious value and that the promise of
      protection against syphilis was an additional argument for
      doctors who were keen to introduce universal circumcision for
      other reasons, the most significant of which were related to
      the conviction that it would discourage masturbation. The
      article further considers the controversy over whether Jews
      were healthier than other peoples, and the interaction among
      medical, moral, and customary/religious reasons for
      circumcising boys, and concludes that, <span
      class="yellow">while the operation never played any role in
      control of syphilis, circumcision was a considerable cause of
      illness and death among male infants before the
      standardization of aseptic operating techniques.</span></p>
