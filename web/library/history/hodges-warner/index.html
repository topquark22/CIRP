      <h2>The History of Male Circumcision in the U.S.</h2>

      <h3>by Frederick Hodges and Jerry W. Warner</h3>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>The subject of male circumcision is highly taboo in
      America. Most men&mdash;and this includes doctors&mdash;would
      prefer not to think about circumcision, and can become
      defensive when the subject is brought up. Most American men
      have never even seen an intact human penis.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is not a benign surgery. Besides destroying a
      significant segment of the male's sexual equipment, it has a
      significant complication rate. According to an important
      medical study, one serious complication-severe hemorrhage,
      infection, loss of entire penis, or death-occurs in every 500
      circumcisions (approximately 3,700 in 1993).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> According to another study, "Death as
      a complication from newborn circumcision has been estimated
      to occur in from 1 in 24,000 to 1 in approximately 500,000
      [cases]. Some investigators have actively sought out
      complications by interview and have recorded rates of
      55%."<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> These figures suggest
      that, with 1.2 million circumcisions performed in this
      country each year, at least 3 boys die each year, and for no
      other reason than that they were born in the United States.
      Prospective parents are not given these facts.</p>

      <p>The U.S. is the only Western nation that surgically alters
      its males in this manner. In Europe and in most of the world,
      [non-religious] circumcision is unknown, and intact males do
      not suffer from any of the diseases and discomforts claimed
      by American proponents of circumcision. Genitally-intact
      Europeans are often very amused to hear the notions
      circumcised Americans have about the normal human penis.
      Notions about improved hygiene after circumcision appear
      ludicrous to intact men. The European medical community
      condemns the U.S. for a practice they call a barbaric
      violation of human rights.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      Europeans believe that males have a basic human right to an
      intact penis, a right to keep the body they were born with,
      and a right to body ownership and autonomy. For them it is a
      question of respect and dignity.</p>

      <p><b>Men's Bodies</b></p>

      <p>The foreskin is one of the most erotically sensitive parts
      of the penis. It represents 50% to 80% of the skin system of
      the penis, depending on the length of the penile shaft. It is
      a unique and highly complex organ. The average foreskin has
      over three feet of veins, arteries, and capillaries, 240 feet
      of nerve fibers, and over 1,000 nerve endings. If unfolded,
      the adult foreskin would measure 20 to 30 square inches.</p>

      <p>The foreskin plays a large role in sexual function. When
      sexually aroused, its lips expand and unroll over the glans.
      The glans stimulates the foreskin, and the foreskin
      stimulates the glans. The foreskin functions much like the
      eyelid. The inside of the foreskin and the glans of the
      normal penis are glistening and red, just like the inside of
      the mouth. The foreskin has glands that produce a natural
      moisturizer and lubricant called smegma. Smegma serves the
      same purpose as tears do in the eye: it keeps everything
      moist, clean, and lubricated.</p>

      <p><b>Men's History</b></p>

      <p>In the U.S. there is a myth that the natural human penis
      is a self-destructing time-bomb, ready to go off at any time
      in an explosion of disease, filth, and horrible stenches, an
      inevitable disaster which only immediate surgery at birth can
      prevent. Can this be true? Why and how did this practice of
      routine infant circumcision begin in the United States?</p>

      <p>Non-religious circumcision was introduced into this
      country on a very small scale in the 1860s for a single
      purpose-to stop masturbation. Circumcision was used as a
      deliberate surgical intervention to debilitate and
      desensitize the penis.</p>

      <p>During the Victorian era, physicians began to believe that
      all sexual activity was dangerous to physical and emotional
      health. Masturbation was viewed as the most dangerous form of
      sexuality and was named as the cause of every known disease,
      from blindness to nervousness, insanity, venereal disease,
      tuberculosis, and death. With every credible American doctor
      and medical association issuing dire warnings about
      masturbation, any step taken towards its eradication and
      prevention was deemed justified.</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
        <p>In cases of masturbation we must, I believe, break the
        habit by inducing such a condition of the parts as will
        cause too much local suffering to allow the practice being
        continued. For this purpose, if the prepuce is long, we may
        circumcise the male patient with present and probably with
        future advantages; the operation, too, should not be
        performed under chloroform, so that the pain experienced
        may be associated with the habit we wish to
        eradicate.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

        <p>A remedy for masturbation which is almost always
        successful in small boys is circumcision. The operation
        should be performed by a surgeon without administering an
        anaesthetic as the pain attending the operation will have a
        salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be
        connected with the idea of punishment.<sup><a
        href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

        <p>Clarence B. was addicted to the secret vice practiced
        among boys. I performed &hellip; circumcision. He needed
        the rightful punishment of cutting pains after his illicit
        pleasures.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>
      </div>

      <p>By the turn of the century, circumcision had become a
      panacea. Amputation of the foreskin was "scientifically
      proven" to cure and prevent diseases ranging from insanity to
      epilepsy, malnutrition, hip-joint disease, paralysis, eczema,
      tuberculosis, headache, hysteria, alcoholism, criminality,
      and heart disease.</p>

      <p>In 1928, the American Medical Association published an
      editorial in its journal calling for the routine circumcision
      of all male infants at birth. The primary justification for
      routine circumcision was the prevention of
      masturbation.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <div class="blockquote">
        <p>I suggest all male children be circumcised. I am
        convinced that masturbation is much less common in the
        circumcised.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>
      </div>

      <p>During World Wars I and II, many soldiers were forcibly
      circumcised by military doctors under threat of court
      martial. Returning WWII veterans were now conditioned to
      believe that circumcision was the correct thing to do. They
      were told it was hygienic, that it prevented disease, and
      that conformity was necessary. Young parents did not object
      when their newborn boys were automatically circumcised after
      being delivered in hospitals, though in reality they had no
      choice. Hospitals did not require anyone's consent to perform
      this surgery.</p>

      <p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, this abusive situation
      was reformed. Hospitals and doctors were required to obtain
      informed consent from patients for any medical or surgical
      procedure. Circumcision now required consent before a doctor
      was legally allowed to amputate, but since a baby is unable
      to give his consent, parents were assumed to have the power
      to give consent on behalf of the baby.</p>

      <p>By the early 1970s, over 90% of newborn boys were
      automatically circumcised. In 1971, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics reviewed the medical literature on circumcision
      and determined that circumcision, after all, was not
      medically valid. The circumcision rate began to fall
      dramatically. New medical excuses continue to be invented for
      the surgery, but all have been disproved by European
      studies.</p>

      <p><b>Men's Awakening</b></p>

      <p>In the 1980s, an awakening began in the psyches of
      American men. Many began to realize that they had been
      alienated from their bodies. Many began to question the myths
      which told them that their genitals were inherently "dirty"
      and in need of surgical reduction. Today, American men in
      increasing numbers are becoming aware that they had a right
      to all of their reproductive organs and that no one had the
      right to remove part of their body. Men are now demanding the
      right to control their own sexual organs.</p>

      <p>Marilyn Fayre Milos, a registered California nurse,
      founded the National Organization of Circumcision Information
      Resource Centers (NOCIRC) in 1986. NOCIRC is now the nation's
      leading human rights organization for body ownership rights.
      The National Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine
      Mutilation of Males (NOHARMM) was founded by Tim Hammond in
      1992 in San Francisco, and has awakened millions of men to
      this men's movement issue. One recent NOHARMM survey of
      hundreds of victims of circumcision proves the lifelong
      negative consequences of this sexual alteration.</p>

      <p>Founded respectively by Wayne Griffiths and Dr. James
      Bigelow, the National Organization for Restoring Men (NORM)
      and the UNCircumcising Information and Resources Center
      (UNCIRC) have given hope to thousands of American victims of
      circumcision wishing to restore their foreskin. Dr. Bigelow's
      revolutionary book, <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</i>, shows
      men how they can gently stretch their remaining penile shaft
      skin to cover their glans. Restoration cannot give back the
      erotogenic nerves amputated at birth, but can create a more
      natural-looking penis. The restored foreskin functions as the
      original might have; it enables the glans to heal, soften,
      and return to a much higher and normal level of sensitivity.
      Restoration has been very therapeutic for men. It improves
      body image, improves self-esteem, dispels feelings of
      victimization, and empowers men to make choices about their
      own sexuality.</p>

      <p><b>Men's Destiny</b></p>

      <p>American men are beginning to realize the truth that
      nature knows more about designing the penis than do American
      doctors. Parents do not have the right to force circumcision
      on their sons. The only person who has the right to consent
      to the amputation of a normal, healthy, functioning body part
      is the person who must live with the consequences. Many
      circumcised American males unnecessarily feel uneasy and
      threatened by the men's pro-choice movement. The movement
      against infant circumcision is no threat to circumcised men.
      The men's pro-choice movement is fighting for the freedom of
      American males to keep the sexual organs nature intended them
      to have. Parents have nothing to lose and everything to gain
      by leaving their sons intact. Permitting their offspring the
      dignity of an intact body and protecting the basic human
      right to self-autonomy is both good and noble. Everyone has
      the right to an intact body.</p>

      <p>In the spirit of brotherhood, American men are now
      empowering themselves to fight the taboos which for decades
      have prevented them from speaking out against the violation
      of their basic human right to control their own reproductive
      organs. The men's pro-choice movement empowers men to fight
      to protect the rights of future generations. By saying "no"
      to circumcision, American men are saying "yes" to men's
      rights. We are wrenching the stainless-steel scalpels from
      the hands of the circumcisers and beating them into silver
      spoons for our sons. History will forever thank us if we act
      now.</p>
