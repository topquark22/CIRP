<h3>Kellogg, Graham and the Crusade for Moral Fiber</h3>
<em>"All kinds of stimulating and heating substances; high-seasoned food; 
rich dishes; the free use of flesh; and even the excess of aliment; all, 
more or less -- and some to a very great degree -- increase the 
concupiscent excitability and sensibility of the genital organs..."</em> 
-- Sylvester Graham<p>

<em>Treatments for Self-Abuse and its Effects: <br>
"A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is 
circumcision...The operation should be performed by a surgeon without 
administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation 
will have a salutary effect upon the mind...In females, the author has 
found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent 
means of allaying the abnormal excitement. " -- Dr. John Harvey 
Kellogg</em><p>

As a rule, there's usually more to hapless folk wisdom than 
bad science, and so it is with myths about masturbation and other aspects of 
sexuality. In America, a peculiar flowering of such myths took place in 
the 19th century. Though the predictable culprits -- Victorian prudery, 
evangelical Christianity, entrepreneuriallism -- are part of the picture, 
the lesser known reality is their century-old relationship with 
whole-grain foodstuffs. That is, thanks to certain influential health 
advocates back then, sex and diet were inexorably linked and for both, 
healthy meant bland. The souvenirs of these efforts with us today are 
only ironic footnotes on the graves of two crusaders: Sylvester Graham, 
immortalized not for his sexual and nutritional reform but for the 
sugared brown crackers used in pie crust and John Harvey Kellogg, a 
flaked food-believer eclipsed by his brother's breakfast cereal company.<p>

A free thinker, Sylvester Graham (1794-1851) lashed out against white 
bread, feather beds, pork, tobacco, salt, condiments, tight corsets, 
nocturnal emissions, heavy clothing and hot mince pie. His specialties, 
though, were masturbation and poor eating habits. Graham was by no means 
the first to decry the debilitating effects of masturbation; 
Judeo-Christian tradition has long considered it an evil, a barrier to 
the natural function of sexuality -- reproduction. But Graham's approach 
was different, focussing on health rather than morality.<p>

<img src="graham.gif">Sylvester Graham: grain lover<br><br>

Before 1700, medical references to the harmful effects of masturbation 
were scarce. In the eighteenth century, two works, <i>Ononia: Or the 
Heinous Sin of Self-Pollution, and all its Frightful Consequences... 
</i>(by an anonymous author) and Samual Tissot's <i>Treatise on the 
Diseases Produced by Onanism</i> introduced concepts that Graham adopted 
and help popularize (for example, Tissot's idea that loss of semen under 
any condition caused health hazards). Graham's <i>Lecture to Young 
Men</i> (1834) was the first of its kind and launched a whole genre of 
medical tracts on masturbation, known then as "self abuse" or "self 
pollution."<p>

Graham knew his audience. A solid grasp of rhetorical devices had him 
making claims no one could disprove. Or rather, <em>would</em> disprove. 
Though people often disagreed on the particular causes of masturbation, 
most believed the symptoms were easy to recognize -- victims were usually 
shy, suspicious, languid, unconcerned with hygiene, jaundiced. Graham 
used this to his advantage; in fact, he found most any health problem 
could be tied to masturbation. Only first-hand experience (yuk yuk) could 
disprove his claims and Graham came prepared to beat down any challengers 
with flamboyant, over-the-top gore. According to Graham, a masturbator 
grows up "with a body full of disease, and with a mind in ruins, the 
loathsome habit still tyrannizing over him, with the inexorable 
imperiousness of a fiend of darkness."<p>

The cause of acne in incriminating teens is revealed, and the result: 
"...ulcerous sores, in some cases, break out upon the head, breast, back 
and thighs; and these sometimes enlarge into permanent fistulas, of a 
cancerous character, and continue, perhaps for years, to discharge great 
quantities of foetid, loathsome pus; and not unfrequently terminate in 
death."<p>

After 1834, Graham stopped lecturing about sexuality and started 
focussing his attention on sound nutrition. The frank talk had become too 
heated, too divisive. Graham considered his move into dietary reform a 
natural, evolutionary step: the proper diet moderated sexual desire.<p>

From his early days, Graham believed both kinds of hunger -- sexual and 
nutritional -- threatened good health. As equally influencial on him as 
sex theorist Tissot was homeopath William Metcalfe. Metcalfe, an English 
clergyman, was the first public advocate of vegetarianism in American and 
a strong believer in the future of asparagus seed as a coffee substitute. 
But while Metcalfe argued vegetarianism on moral grounds, Graham was more 
concerned with the carnal passions meat-eating provoked. The stomach was 
considered the major organ of the body, so anything that inflamed it was 
compared to lust. The medical profession was evil, according to Graham, 
and, besides, there was no need for it since: "Disease is never the 
legitimate result of the normal operation of any of our organs." All 
irritations or excitements such as hunger or sexual desire exhausted the 
body and increased the chance of disease and death. Fortunately, this 
made the cure for virtually ever human sickness simple -- sexual 
moderation (no more than 12 times a year for married couples), exercise 
(to help prevent nocturnal emissions) and the proper diet (to facilitate 
free peristaltic action of the bowels, among other benefits).<p>

By 1840, Graham's public career was finished; but not without having 
influenced a number of bran-lovin' upstarts. One of these was James Caleb 
Jackson (1814-1895), a diet expert who combined Graham's health reform 
plan with hydropathy. Hydropathic therapy, also known as the water-cure, 
involved applying extremely cold water -- showers, tubs, soaks, and 
wet-packs -- to different parts of the body. Jackson's real brainstorm, 
however, was creating a stone-like wafer out of graham flour and water. 
He called his treat Granula, and would later go down in history as having 
made the first cold breakfast cereal.<p>

<img src = "kellogg.gif">John Harvey Kellogg<br><br>

Though unpleasant to the taste, Granula found a ready-made market at 
Jackson's sanitarium in Dansville, NY, where it was digested by 
residents. It was here that Sister Ellen White of the Seventh Day 
Adventists visited on the advice of an angel. And it was here that she 
received a message from above instructing her to duplicate the Dansville 
setup and open a two-meal-a-day facility for Adventists. Thus was born 
the Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, Michigan.<p>

At the time, Battle Creek was the world headquarters for Seventh Day 
Adventists, a fundamentalist "society of the faithful." Convinced 
vegetarians, the Adventists followed Genesis literally where it says 
"Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed...to you it shall be 
meat." Known later as the Kellogg Sanitarium or just The San, the 
Institute was to play a key roll in revolutionizing the American 
breakfast, making Battle Creek the international Cereal City.<p>

Sister White was a health reform pro when she opened the Sanitarium. 
Inspired by Graham and Jackson, she had published a book on masturbation 
in 1864, called <i>An Appeal to Mothers: The Great Cause of the Physical, 
Mental and Moral Ruin of Many of the Children of Our Time.</i> But a 
leader she was not and the Institute she founded with Adventist money 
floundered for ten years until a quirky young doctor, John Harvey 
Kellogg, took over daily operations. Kellogg, another Graham disciple, 
was highly regarded in Adventists circles for his hard-hitting medical 
journalism. Unlike Graham, he openly embraced medical science and was 
constantly experimenting with whole-grain foods.<p>

After two years on the job, he came up with the first Battle Creek health 
treat -- a mixture of oatmeal and corn meal, baked into biscuits, then 
ground to bits. He called his discovery Granula, a peculiar decision 
considering the only other cereal then was called Granula. Once they 
finished suing, Kellogg re-named his product Granola.<p>

Granola was only one of several delicacies the doctor designed for 
patients at The San. Other house specialties included Caramel Cereal 
Coffee, Bulgarian yogurt (Kellogg was big on yogurt) and meat substitutes 
Protose (like beefsteak) and Nuttose (like veal). At one point, Kellogg 
concentrated solely on nuts. He wrote a paper, "Nuts May Save the Race," 
supposedly invented peanut butter, several other nut spreads and Malted 
Nuts.<p>

Though low on flavor, the ambitious menu helped turn the hospital around 
financially. Under Kellogg's guidance, most of the patients admitted to 
The San just needed a diet. They were overweight or overworked. They 
suffered from <i>Americanitis</i>, treatable with rest, room service and 
wheelchair socials. The cure rate became remarkably high since no one 
seriously ill was admitted.<p>

No chronic masturbators were admitted either. Kellogg echoed Graham's 
doom-and-gloom views on the matter and even added to them. On the night 
of his honeymoon (more on this in a moment), he spent his time writing 
<i>Plain Facts for Old and Young</i>, a warning on the evils of sex. Of 
the 644 pages, 97 address "Secret Vice (Solitary Vice or Self-Abuse),"  
its symptoms and results. Included are 39 signs indicating someone is 
jacking off; a list comprehensive enough to indict everyone vaguely 
human: #7. Sleeplessnes, #11. Love of solitude, #12. Bashfulness and #13. 
Unnatural boldness, #14. Confusion of ideas, #24. Capricious appetite, 
#28. Use of tobacco, #30. Acne.<p>

Such was Dr. Kellogg's power play: in rejecting known masturbators from 
the hospital, he avoided acknowledging there was no real cure. Yet his 
theories gave him an outlet from poor slobs the hospital diet couldn't 
cure. Dr. Kellogg could diagnose them as masturbators and thus pass 
responsibility for the problem onto the patient. If the illness 
persisted, that was proof that the secret vice persisted, that its 
effects were long-term or irreversible, or that its effect had been 
inherited from the secret vice of the parents. Dr. Kellogg was never 
wrong. In fact, he made an issue of abstaining from all sexual relations 
himself, supposedly to prove that sex was not necessary to health. Though 
he married Ella Eaton, their marriage was never consummated and they 
lived in separate apartments.<p>

It's quite likely, though, that the doctor was in some way dysfunctional 
(one book suggests he had mumps). After breakfast every morning, he had 
an orderly give him an enema. This may mean he had klismaphilia, an 
anomaly of sexual functioning traceable to childhood in which an enema 
substitutes for regular sexual intercourse. For the klismaphile, putting 
the penis in the vagina is experienced as hard, dangerous, and repulsive 
work.<p>

Whatever the reason for Dr. Kellogg's various beliefs, they had a lasting 
effect. The San became more and more famous while Dr. Kellogg became 
something of a demagogue. Gradually, his medical training and unwavering 
belief in the power of wholegrain foods started to win out over his 
fundamentalist faith. <p>

A major step in this direction took place when a patient showed him 
little wheat mattresses a friend had sent her for digestive trouble. The 
wheat cakes were being peddled by a man in Denver, Henry Perky, who 
called his creation "Shredded Wheat." Dr. Kellogg experimented with the 
wheaty filaments and concluded that they were "like eating a whisk 
broom." Still, his curiosity was raised.<p>

Shredded Wheat, it should be pointed out, was not yet considered a 
breakfast food. Originally the biscuits were intended as a main course, a 
"natural food" in the Grahamite tradition. There was cheese-and-Shredded 
Wheat toast, creamed peas in "biscuit baskets," fried mushrooms on split 
biscuits, banana croquettes with Shredded Wheat and more. Perky even 
founded a domestic science institute, Oread Institute, to train 
demonstrators to educate housewives in how to use the product.<p>

But in the wheat biscuits the doctor saw potential for a ready-to-eat 
breakfast food and went about creating his own. After much 
trial-and-error, he came up with Granose, the first flaked wheat cereal. 
Shortly thereafter, he set up commercial production in a barn behind the 
Sanitarium and went to work securing patents to protect himself from 
copy-cats. The efforts, however, were to no avail (Dr. Kellogg should've 
figured this out since 43 patents weren't enough to keep him from ripping 
off Shredded Wheat). The whole town of Battle Creek exploded with flake 
fever; cereal and "health food" manufacturers appeared over night and 
Battle Creek became Cereal Central.<p>

Leading the parade was a man who practically cut his teeth at the the 
Sanitarium, C.W. Post. An overworked inventor, Post came to Battle Creek 
to cure his upset stomach while his wife, to help pay the bills, sold 
suspenders door-to-door. Post stayed at the Sanitarium for nine months 
and absorbed all the diet theories, health remedies and menu options 
Kellogg had to offer. He did not get well, in fact he claimed the staff 
had given him up to die. But he didn't leave uninspired. Toward the end 
of the 19th century, Battle Creek -- always on the cutting edge of 
spiritualism -- had become home to various psychics. Post, having 
witnessed a sort of mental healing at the San, sought these people out 
and developed an appetite for Christian Science, popular occult books and 
parapsychology...not unlike a new age zealot of today. After a few 
trials, Post found himself a Battle Creek mental healer with a miraculous 
two-day cure for his appendix. And with that, he was, as he was known to 
say, on "the road to Wellville."<p>

Though outside the sanitarium, Post still sensed unexplored commercial 
possibilities in the Sanitarium health foods. He proposed to Dr. Kellogg 
that they work together to promote Minute Brew, a health coffee similar 
to the one served at the hospital. The Doctor flatly refused. Post then 
went to the east limits of Battle Creek and, in May 1992, set up his own 
medical boardinghouse, La Vita Inn. The plan was to provide patients not 
only with a special diet, but spiritual healing.<p>

Post was not a doctor, he "simply treated patients by mental 
therapeutics." Nevertheless, his cures -- which basically boiled down to 
convincing oneself, "I am well!" -- became the talk of the town. Back 
pains, toothaches, rheumatic joints -- all could be undone in less than 
five minutes with quick mental negation (sort of a precursor to <i>The 
Power of Positive Thinking</i>). Meanwhile, Post did some channeling on 
the side; he once approached Dr. Kellogg and offered to pray for his 
patients for $50 a week. (The doctor declined, providing another motive 
for Post to promote La Vita as a refuge for former Sanitarium patients.)<p>

In 1895, Post rolled out the first commercial batch of Postum, his 
cereal-based coffee substitute, and within a few years, became a 
multi-millionaire. Having figured out early on that religious imagery 
upped product value, he nicknamed Postum "Monk's Brew" and dubbed his 
first cereal Elijah's Manna (later renamed Post Toasties since it was 
against the law in Britain to register Biblical names).<p>

Post wrote all the advertisements, product descriptions and company 
literature himself. In so doing, he created a totally new kind of copy -- 
the first to advertise food as a medicine for regular (sorry) consumers. 
The original campaign for Postum claimed "It Makes Red Blood." After 
that, Post went hogwild and invented a disease, "coffee neuralgia," to 
help sell Postum. "Lost Eyesight through Coffee Drinking," read the ad, 
followed by a tear-jerking case reported from Somewhere, Illinois. The 
moral: quit coffee, drink Postum.<p>

Post's next brainstorm was a batch of wheaty, rock-like morsels called 
Grape Nuts. This time he advertised the cereal food as an alternative to 
surgery for an inflamed appendix. Grape Nuts, a "brain food" could also 
cure consumption, malaria and loose teeth. <p>

Every box of Grape Nuts came with a copy of Post's classic text, <i>The 
Road To Wellville</i>. Basically, it urged conscious consumers to "Eat 
Grape Nuts, drink Postum, and think positive thoughts." What's 
interesting is how this evolved out of La Vita's original recipe -- 
simply to think positive thoughts. Of course, positive thoughts alone 
don't turn much profit, so converting Wellness into a tangible made a lot 
of sense. Plus it allowed Post to quietly shut down La Vita (which was 
becoming a hassle) and dedicate himself fulltime to the organic 
revolution.<p>

It didn't take long for other entrepreneurs to catch onto Post's 
advertising techniques and once they did a full-scale health food craze 
was underway. Ralston Health Food, for example, claimed its tiny grains 
were "Full of vegetable Phosphorous that makes children grow like magic 
and develop strong mentally," giving the brain "all the phosphorus it can 
use in heavy thinking." The American Cereal Company (predecessor of 
Quaker Oats) said its Apetiza made red blood, which as Carson points out, 
distinguishes it from all other foods, except Grape Nuts, which also made 
red blood. And said so first.<p>

Where was Dr. Kellogg during all this? Oddly enough, the doctor started 
losing money just as cereal was evolving into a breakfast food staple. 
The Sanitarium had a few problems -- it burned down, lost its money, and 
the Adventists excommunicated Dr. Kellogg (and eventually severed ties 
with the Sanitarium). Plus the company Dr. Kellogg had started, Sanitas 
Food Company, was losing money; the doctor was much more interested in 
playing with food than selling it. His brother, however, was an entirely 
different animal.<p>

William K. Kellogg had worked for his brother since the Sanitarium 
opened. An organizer with sharp business sense, W.K. wasn't interested in 
crusading against masturbation or bad eating habits -- he wanted to get 
paid. In the Doctor's inventions, he saw a potential fortune. The problem 
was getting his brother to agree to anything; as he got older, Dr. 
Kellogg only seemed to grow more and more manic, refusing to compromise 
his ideals and commercialize his creations.<p>

The break-through came when W.K. convinced his brother that they should 
form a new company to manufacture corn flakes. The Battle Creek Toasted 
Corn Flake Company was incorporated in 1906 and placed under W.K.'s 
management. Dr. Kellogg was the majority stockholder, but he distributed 
part of this stock among the Sanitarium doctors. Later, while Dr. Kellogg 
was away in Europe visiting Pavlov, W.K. went around and bought up the 
stock until he personally owned a majority. The new president, W.K., 
promptly put his signature on the box and renamed the company that was 
ultimately to become Kellogg Co. <p>

Here our story pretty much ends. When W.K.'s signature went on the corn 
flakes, the picture of the San came off and from that day forth, corn 
flakes were known for their great taste rather than their health 
benefits. Sugar and other additives became part of the recipe and 
advertising spared none -- pretty girls, baby contests, door-to-door 
canvassing were all employed to make Kellogg a household name. This 
didn't happen without fight. The Doctor and W.K. went through years of 
legal battles over the name, but W.K. won out. Both men lived to be 91. 
Though that was certainly long enough to see the Doctor's ideas about sex 
and diet disproved by his beloved medical establishment (germ theory, 
immunological theory, molecular-genetic theory, hormonic and metabolic 
theory) he never retracted his claims. He was never wrong. To this day, 
some of his ideas about masturbation and sexuality are still polluting 
the populous.<p>
