      This study examines the evolution of Greek and Roman medical
      conceptualizations of preputial aesthetics, utilizing
      evidence found in classical medical texts as well as clues
      from literature, legal sources, and art. A conclusive picture
      emerges that the Greeks valued the longer prepuce and
      pathologized the penis characterized by a deficient
      prepuce&mdash;especially one that had been surgically
      ablated&mdash;under the disease concept of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite>. The medical conceptualization of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> is also placed in the historical
      context of the legal efforts to abolish ritual circumcision
      throughout the Seleucid and Roman empires.</p>

      <p class="summary"><span class="smallcaps">KEYWORDS</span>:
      <cite>lipodermos</cite>, penis, prepuce, aesthetics,
      classics, Greek art, Roman art, circumcision</p>

      <p class="heading1">Introduction</p>

      <p>It is a biological norm in <cite>Homo sapiens</cite> that,
      in youth, that part of the penis known as the prepuce often
      runs to impressive lengths, frequently representing more than
      three-quarters of the length of the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This anatomical fact is not without
      its cultural or artistic consequences. In his survey of
      images of the phallus in Greek vase painting, K. J. Dover
      <span class="page">[Page 376]</span> comments that depictions
      of attractive, virtuous, heroic, or divine subjects feature
      <a href="hodges01.jpg">a prepuce that can comprise up to
      three-quarters the entire length of the penis</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> This may be an accurate representation
      of an ethnic norm; a broad-based, culturally significant
      idealization of the penis; or, in some cases, the
      representation of a prepuce that has been deliberately
      lengthened. Whatever the case, the well-proportioned prepuce
      was the longer prepuce, with its distinctive taper.</p>

      <p class="2">An iconographic representation of this feature
      of male excellence can be seen in the well-known masterpiece
      of Attic red-figure vase painting, attributed by J. D.
      Beazley to the Sosias painter, in which <a
      href="hodges02.jpg">Achilles binds the wounded arm of
      Patroklus</a>.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The frontality
      of Patroklus and the linear arrangement of his legs and upper
      body directs the gaze to his penis, the most prominent
      feature of which is the prepuce, <a
      href="hodges02a.jpg">which decorously drapes itself across
      his right foot</a>. It is also a convention of vase painting
      that, even when in a state of erection, the prepuce of
      paragons of male beauty should retain its proportionality to
      the rest of the penis; despite erection, therefore, <a
      href="hodges03.jpg">it is almost invariably represented as
      unretracted, long, and finely tapered</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The special value accorded to the prepuce in
      Greek culture is mirrored in the medical literature, where
      Galen (ca. 129&ndash;210 <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.) singles it out as being among the most
      brilliantly useful adornments of the body:</p>

      <p class="quote">Nature out of her abundance ornaments all
      the members, especially in man. In many parts there is
      manifest ornamentation, though at times this is obscured by
      the brilliance of their usefulness.The ears show obvious
      ornamentation, and so, I suppose, does the skin called the
      prepuce [&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&eta;] at the end of the
      penis and the flesh of the buttocks.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>
      <span class="page">[page 377]</span> 

      <p>Galen is content here to leave his admiration for the
      prepuce unqualified by allusions to its length, but he
      nonetheless provides us with powerful corroboration of the
      fact that the Greeks prized the prepuce on its own merits
      while simultaneously associating it with other aspects of
      male beauty.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">As I will demonstrate, the aesthetic preference
      for the longer, tapered prepuce is a reflection of a deeper
      ethos involving cultural identity, morality, propriety,
      virtue, beauty, and health. Accordingly, the violation of
      this ethos by the specter of a deficient prepuce was
      addressed through individual, political, legal, and medical
      remedies. Here as elsewhere, medicine reinforced cultural
      values and their political application.</p>

      <p class="heading1"><cite>Posthe</cite> and
      <cite>Akroposthion</cite></p>

      <p>As would be expected in a culture that valued the prepuce,
      the Greek language reflected this esteem through precise
      terminology. The Greeks understood the prepuce to be composed
      of two distinct structures: the <cite>posthe</cite>
      (&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&eta;) and the
      <cite>akroposthion</cite>
      (&alpha;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&sigma;&theta;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;).
      <cite>Posthe</cite> designates that part of the prepuce that
      covers the glans penis, but Greek writers occasionally used
      this word (or any of its variations, such as
      &pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&iota;&eta; or
      &pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&iota;&alpha;) in a general sense
      to designate the entire prepuce or, by extension, the entire
      penis. <cite>Akroposthion</cite> (or any of its alternative
      forms, such as
      &alpha;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&iota;&alpha;
      and
      &alpha;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&iota;&eta;)
      designates the tapered, tubular, visually defining portion of
      the prepuce that extends beyond the glans and terminates at
      the preputial orifice. When we speak of the iconographic
      representation of the long prepuce, we are really speaking of
      the long <cite>akroposthion</cite> for the
      <cite>posthe</cite> can never be larger than the unchanging
      surface area of the underlying glans penis. Rufus of Ephesus,
      a physician under Trajan (98&ndash;117 <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>.), describes
      the penis accordingly:</p>
      <span class="page">[page 378]</span> 

      <p class="quote">The tip of the shaft is called the glans
      [<cite>balanos</cite>], and the skin around the glans [is
      called the] prepuce [<cite>posthe</cite>], and the extremity
      of the prepuce is called the
      <cite>akroposthion</cite>.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">In the Hippocratic <cite>Aphorisms</cite>, the
      akroposthion is presented as having a special nature:</p>

      <p class="quote">When a bone, cartilage, sinew, the slender
      part of the jaw, or the <cite>akroposthie</cite> is severed
      [&delta;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&pi;&eta;], the part
      neither grows nor unites.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p>This aphorism, most likely a reflection of the limits of
      reparative surgery during the fifth century <span
      class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>. seems to imply that a completely
      severed (circumcised) <cite>akroposthion</cite> could not be
      successfully reattached to the penis from which it was
      amputated.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The seventh-century
      commentary of Stephanus of Athens, referring to the blood vs.
      semen dichotomy in the Galenic theory of embryology,<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> explains that the akroposthion does
      not unite or grow because it originates from semen.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Aristotle, having the advantage of
      living closer to the era in which the <cite>Aphorisms</cite>
      made their first appearance, attempts to explain it through
      comparative anatomy:</p>

      <p class="quote">Now the eyelid is encased with skin; and
      that is why neither the eyelid nor the akroposthia will
      reunite, because both are skin without flesh.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Although in later centuries Greek physicians
      would demonstrate that a severed <cite>akroposthion</cite>
      could be repaired&mdash;at least in a limited sense&mdash;the
      deeper meaning that underlies this aphorism is that the
      <cite>akroposthion</cite> shares characteristics with
      anatomically and physiologically analogous structures, such
      as the eyelid&mdash;thus providing a solid scientific
      foundation for a preexisting common high regard for the
      prepuce.</p>
      <span class="page">[page 379]</span> 

      <p class="heading1">Positive References to the Prepuce in
      Literature</p>

      <p>The cultural significance of the prepuce is also reflected
      in literature. In the domain of pleasures, for instance, the
      longer prepuce often serves as the object of erotic interest
      and as a signifier of the sexually attractive male, as
      demonstrated by the following ribald passage from the
      <cite>Lexiphanes</cite> of Lucian:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Surely," I said, "you don't mean that
      notable Dion, that lusty, low-scrotumed, cuntish, and
      mastic-chewing youth who masturbates and gropes whenever he
      sees someone with a large penis
      [&pi;&epsilon;&omega;&delta;&eta;] and a long prepuce
      [&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&omega;&nu;&alpha;]?"<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p>Lucian is not satirizing the fact that a long prepuce
      should function as the visual cue that triggers Dion's erotic
      responses. On the contrary, he is satirizing Dion's general
      lack of decorum and self-control in the face of such
      self-evident visual stimulants. The desirability of the long
      prepuce, hence, remains beyond question.</p>

      <p class="2">The eroticization of the prepuce is also evident
      in the <cite>Thesmophoriazusae</cite> of Aristophanes, where
      the lusty father-in-law, pressing to his face a garment owned
      and worn by the young and handsome poet Agathon, exclaims:
      "By Aphrodite, this has a pleasant smell of [a little]
      prepuce [&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&eta;]!"<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> The diminutive <cite>posthion</cite>
      (&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;), as opposed
      to the standard word <cite>posthe</cite>
      (&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&eta;), is most likely used here
      as a term of endearment.</p>

      <p class="2">In addition to a diminutive form of
      <cite>posthe</cite>, the Greeks had a form to express the
      opposite state. In the <cite>Peace</cite> of Aristophanes,
      the descriptive noun <cite>posthon</cite>
      (&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&omega;&nu;), meaning a male with
      a large prepuce, is used to designate a little boy: "Tell me,
      O large foreskinned one
      [&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&omega;&nu;], are you singing
      about your father?"<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> The
      scholiast notes that <cite>posthon</cite> was a common
      nickname for young boys.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> In
      his commentary on this word, Jeffrey Henderson draws our
      attention to Freud's observation of the widespread tendency
      to equate children with the genitals and the genitals with
      children.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Here as elsewhere,
      the prepuce serves as a sign for the boy's whole being and as
      a synecdoche for the whole penis.</p>
      <span class="page">[Page 380]</span> 

      <p class="2">This process is most clearly attested in a
      hortatory verse in Aristophanes' comedy <cite>Clouds</cite>.
      In the first prescriptive part of the oration, Socrates'
      <cite>Better Argument</cite> states:</p>

      <p class="quote">If you follow my recommendations,<br />
       And keep them ever in mind,<br />
       You will always have a rippling chest, radiant skin,<br />
       Broad shoulders, a wee tongue,<br />
       A grand rump and a petite <cite>posthe</cite>
      [&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&eta;].<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p>Here, the allusion to the <cite>posthe</cite> clearly,
      although humorously, summons up an image of the entire penis,
      albeit one that conforms to the aesthetic ideal seen in
      artistic depictions of gods and heroes. The imprecise use of
      the word <cite>posthe</cite> serves the humorous context
      because, as others have shown, the Greeks valued the longer
      over the shorter prepuce in relation to the length of the
      entire penis, and the smaller over the larger penis as a
      whole.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Even if one were to
      argue that the word <cite>posthe</cite> was being used
      precisely here, the rules of proportion, as deduced from art,
      would require that a petite <cite>posthe</cite> be part of a
      proportionally even more petite penis.</p>

      <p class="2">For comedic purposes, it seems also to have been
      possible for the prepuce to serve as a visual hereditary link
      between father and son, and, in this capacity, as proof of
      paternity. In the <cite>Thesmophoriazusae</cite> again, the
      father-in-law tells a racy story in which an old nurse tries
      to deceive a man, her former charge, into believing not only
      that his wife has just given birth to a child, but that the
      child is his. She cries out:</p>

      <p class="quote">You're the father of a lion, a lion! He's
      the very spitting image of you in every way, including his
      [cute little] prepuce
      [&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&omega;&nu;] &mdash;it's just
      like yours, twisted like a pine catkin.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p>Given that this is a humorous context in which the
      audience is meant to laugh at the old woman's impertinence
      and colorful language, the notion that the prepuce could
      serve as a standard against which to measure family
      resemblance should not be injudiciously extrapolated to
      Athenian society as a whole. Still, whatever the case may
      have been, the larger issue <span class="page">[Page
      381]</span> here is the remarkable frequency with which the
      prepuce is referenced in various contexts.</p>

      <p class="heading1">The <cite>Kynodesme</cite> as Protector
      of Public Morals</p>

      <p>The association between the longer prepuce and
      respectability was so strongly felt that Greeks took steps to
      prevent unwanted exposure of the glans. In this regard, the
      consistent artistic portrayal of the adult penis with a
      generously proportioned <cite>akroposthion</cite> may well
      represent an anatomical ideal peculiar to Greeks, but, in
      some cases, it could accurately represent a penis whose
      <cite>akroposthion</cite> has been elongated&mdash;either
      deliberately or accidentally&mdash;through the continuous,
      long-term application of traction. Such traction may have
      come from the use of the <cite>kynodesme</cite>
      (&kappa;&upsilon;&nu;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&sigma;&mu;&eta;,
      literally a "dog leash"), a thin leather thong wound around
      the <cite>akroposthion</cite> that pulled the penis upward
      and was tied in a bow, tied around the waist, or secured by
      some other means.</p>

      <p class="2">Tethering the <cite>akroposthion</cite> with the
      <cite>kynodesme</cite> is frequently confused with preputial
      infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved
      by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so
      created for the insertion of a metal clasp
      (<cite>fibula</cite>) in order to fasten the prepuce shut.
      Celsus, whose work was most likely composed during the reign
      of Tiberius (14&ndash;37 <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.), disapprovingly describes infibulation
      as being performed on adolescents "for the sake of the voice,
      or for health's sake."<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> There
      is no suggestion that it improves the appearance of the
      penis.</p>

      <p class="2">Vase paintings and statues frequently portray <a
      href="hodges16.jpg">nude athletes wearing the
      <cite>kynodesme</cite></a>.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
      One of the most informative iconographic representations is
      found on an Attic red-figure calyx-krater painted by
      Euphronios, <span class="page">[page 382]</span> dating from
      520&ndash;510 <span class="bce">B</span>.<span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>. which shows
      <a href="hodges17.jpg">a young athlete in the process of
      grasping the lips of his <cite>akroposthion</cite></a> with
      the fingers of his left hand and pulling the prepuce taut
      while his right hand is poised ready to <a
      href="hodges18.jpg">loop the <cite>kynodesme</cite> around
      the neck of the <cite>akroposthion</cite></a>.<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Because of the frequency with which the
      <cite>kynodesme</cite> is seen in athletic settings, some
      scholars have speculated that it was worn for athletic
      protection<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>&mdash;but, as Paul
      Zanker maintains, this explanation fails to encompass all of
      the facts.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> Athletes are not
      the only group regularly depicted wearing the
      <cite>kynodesme</cite>.The case for its more general use is
      supported by the nonspecific definitions recorded by ancient
      lexicographers. For instance, Julius Pollux, the
      second-century <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>. grammarian and sophist, states simply:
      "The cord with which they tie up the foreskin, they call the
      dog leash,"<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> while Hesychius,
      the fifth-century <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>. grammarian of Alexandria, defines it
      merely as an "<cite>akroposthion</cite> band."<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> The second-century <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>. grammarian
      Phrynichus Arabius, however, in an etymological and
      demographic mood, defines <cite>kynodesmai</cite> as "the
      thing with which the people of Attica who have their glans
      exposed bind their penis. They call the penis
      <cite>kyon</cite> [dog]."<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> The
      lexicon of Photius (ca. 820&ndash; 91) goes even further and
      adds a moral dimension, stating that the
      <cite>kynodesme</cite> is "the little piece of hide with
      which the prepuce of those is bound, who in undressing
      disgrace themselves."<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> Photius
      is unspecific about the exact nature of this disgrace, but we
      can safely assume that it <span class="page">[Page
      383]</span> lies in the unseemly externalization of the glans
      that a deficient or loose-lipped prepuce is unable to
      prevent. The <cite>kynodesme</cite>, then, is a means by
      which any male so affected can maintain his dignity when in
      the nude.</p>

      portrayed wearing the <a
      href="hodges21.jpg"><cite>kynodesme</cite></a> as
      well.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> A striking example is a
      statue of the poet <a href="hodges22.jpg">Anacreon</a>, in
      the guise of a <cite>komast</cite>, in which <a

      practiced, Zanker observes that preventing unwanted exposure
      of the glans was a "sign of the modesty and decency expected
      in particular of the older participants in the
      symposium."<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2"><a href="hodges24.jpg">Satyrs are sometimes

      Additionally, <a href="hodges26.jpg">the hair-skirted satyr

      <span class="page">[Page 384]</span> 

      <p class="2">For those who continuously wore the
      <cite>kynodesme</cite>, the resulting traction on the
      <cite>akroposthion</cite> would have the benefit of
      permanently elongating it. It is conceivable, then, that the
      lengthening of the prepuce could have been the primary
      object, at least in some cases: aesthetics would be improved,
      and morals preserved.</p>

      <p class="heading1">Greco-Roman Views on Alien Rites of
      Preputial Ablation</p>

      <p>The intensity with which the Greeks esteemed the prepuce
      was equalled by the intensity with which they deplored its
      ablation as practiced in certain communities scattered
      throughout the southeastern fringes of the known world.
      Indeed, medical writers such as Oribasius and Paul of Aegina
      found but a single medical use for circumcision, mentioning
      it only as part of the surgical management of dire cases of
      penile gangrene.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> Celsus
      similarly states:</p>

      <p class="quote">Sometimes through such an ulceration the
      penis is so eaten away underneath the foreskin that the glans
      falls off; in which case the foreskin itself must be cut away
      all round. It is the rule, whenever the glans or any part of
      the penis has fallen off, or has been cut away, that the
      foreskin should not be preserved, lest it come into contact,
      and adhere to the ulceration, so that afterwards it cannot be
      drawn back, and further perhaps may choke the urethra.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <p>This rare instance of medical circumcision is clearly not
      a rationale for the indiscriminate amputation of the healthy
      prepuce of healthy infants in any context.</p>

      <p>The Greeks were highly skeptical about any of the
      religious rationales used by certain foreigners in an attempt
      to justify their blood rites of penile reduction. The
      <cite>History</cite> of Herodotus (484&ndash;420 <span
      class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.) is the earliest Greek text reporting
      the practice of genital mutilation of various degrees, such
      as circumcision. Herodotus ascribes circumcision to the
      Colchians, Ethiopians, Phoenicians, Syrians, and Macrones, as
      well as to the Egyptian priestly caste.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> He also reports, however, that the
      salutary influence of Greek culture induced the Phoenicians
      to abandon circumcision.<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> In
      an oft-repeated passage, always quoted out of context, <span
      class="page">[Page 385]</span> Herodotus describes the
      topsy-turvy world of the Egyptian priestly caste with obvious
      disapproval:</p>

      <p class="quote">Everywhere else in the world, priests have
      long hair, but in Egypt they shave their heads. In times of
      mourning, it is the norm elsewhere for those most affected by
      the bereavement to crop their hair; in Egypt, however, in the
      period following a death, they let both their hair and their
      beards grow, when they had previously been shaved. Everywhere
      else in the world people live separately from their animals,
      but animals and humans live together in Egypt. Other people
      live off barley and ordinary wheat, but Egyptians regard it
      as demeaning to make those grains one's staple diet; their
      staple is hulled wheat, or "emmer" as it is sometimes known.
      They knead dough with their feet and clay with their hands,
      and they pick up dung with their hands too. Other people,
      unless they have been influenced by the Egyptians, leave
      their genitals in their natural state, but the Egyptians
      practise circumcision.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup></p>

      <p>Later in the following paragraph, Herodotus repeats the
      revelation about the circumcision of the priests and places
      it in the context of their impenetrable cultic
      fastidiousness:</p>

      <p class="quote">Because they are exceedingly religious, more
      so than any other people in the world, they have the
      following customs. Everyone, without any exceptions, scrubs
      clean the bronze cup he uses for drinking every day. The
      linen cloaks they wear are always freshly washed; this is
      something they are very particular about. Their concern for
      cleanliness also explains why they practise circumcision,
      since they value cleanliness more than comeliness.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The ironic tone of this passage, which has
      hitherto been poorly appreciated, underscores Herodotus's
      dismay at the Egyptian priestly caste's illogical notions of
      cleanliness and religiosity and their unfathomable disregard
      for physical beauty. Clearly, he is emphasizing that the
      notions of genital cleanliness that he ascribes to a people
      who routinely handle dung bare-handed and prepare food with
      their bare feet are necessarily at variance with those of the
      civilized Greeks.</p>

      <p class="2">An important clue to the Greeks' assumptions
      about the association of circumcision with the Egyptian
      priesthood is to be found on the fifth-century <span
      class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>. Attic red-figure <cite>pelike</cite> by
      the Pan painter, depicting <a href="hodges29.jpg">Herakles
      overthrowing Busiris</a>, a mythological priest-king of
      Egypt, and his bald-headed priestly attendants who have
      attempted to make of Herakles a human sacrifice.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> The painter has taken great pains to
      depict the priests <span class="page">[Page 386]</span> as
      having fat, ugly, wrinkled, circumcised penises with a
      bulbous externalized glans, which contrast sharply with the
      neat and attractive penis of Herakles, with its elegantly
      long and tapered prepuce. Likewise, the snubbed noses and
      monkey-like faces of the Egyptians could hardly be more
      dissimilar to the heroic Greek profile of Herakles. To
      paraphrase K. J. Dover, if a circumcised penis goes with a
      hideous face and a long and tapered prepuce goes with a
      handsome face, it is the long and tapered prepuce that was
      admired.<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Later Greek writers, such as Strabo (b.64 <span
      class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>) and Diodorus Siculus (first century
      <span class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>, horrified their readers with accounts
      of the genital mutilation practices of various primitive,
      sometimes cave-dwelling tribes living around the Red Sea, as
      well as those of the Hebrews and Egyptians.<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> While some of these tribes amputated
      only the prepuce, others amputated the glans,<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> and still others amputated the
      entire penis.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> Strabo also
      provides a secular account of the origin of circumcision
      among the Hebrews. He writes that they are partly descended
      from Egyptians who left their homeland to follow an apostate
      priest named Moses, who was displeased with the state of
      affairs in Egypt and sought to worship his "Divine Being"
      divorced from animal imagery. Moses led his followers to
      Judaea and established an autocratic theocracy at what is now
      Jerusalem:</p>

      <p class="quote">His [Moses'] successors for some time abided
      by the same course, acting righteously and being truly pious
      toward God; but afterwards, in the first place, superstitious
      men were appointed to the priesthood, and then tyrannical
      people; and from superstition arose abstinence from flesh,
      from which it is their custom to abstain even to-day, and
      circumcisions and excisions [of females] and other
      observances of the kind.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Strabo's statement that the Hebrew priesthood
      imposed male and female circumcision for tyrannical and
      superstitious reasons supports Wilhelm Reich's theory of
      circumcision as a mechanism of social con- <span
      class="page">[Page 387]</span> trol.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> Additionally, these Greek accounts
      of the bodily mutilations practiced by some primitive Near
      Eastern tribes underscore the association between
      circumcision and more severe penile mutilations. They also
      highlight the association between the circumcised penis (and,
      therefore, the exposed glans) and the linked concepts of
      primitiveness, barbarity, backwardness, superstition, and
      oppression.</p>

      <p class="2">The association between the circumcised penis
      and slavery is illustrated in an unusual sixth-century
      Corinthian painted clay tablet that depicts four slaves at
      work in a mining excavation, heaving pickaxes and gathering
      lumps of stone or clay into baskets.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> <a href="hodges30.jpg">One slave, a
      pickax-wielding, Herculean mammoth, is clearly
      circumcised</a>. His enormous penis swings between his legs.
      The glans is externalized and painted black like the rest of
      his body, and the artist has inscribed two fine, wrinkled,
      cicatrix lines behind the weathered corona glandis. The other
      workers, though not obviously circumcised, have stumpy little
      penises without the elegant taper of a Greek prepuce; perhaps
      the painter meant to portray these slaves as sexually
      disfigured in some way as well. It is quite clear that these
      mutilated, misshapen, and misfortunate slaves fail to live up
      to Greek ideals of male beauty.</p>

      <p class="2">Another source, albeit an unobjective one, that
      attests to the Greeks' ethical opposition to circumcision is
      the <cite>Special Laws</cite> of Philo Judaeus of Alexandria
      (d.ca.50 <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>). Philo claimed that circumcision was
      the "object of ridicule among many people."<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup> His dismissal of opposition to
      circumcision as "childish mockery " betrays his failure to
      understand the philosophical and aesthetic underpinnings of
      the Greeks' high regard for the cultivation of physical
      health and beauty&mdash;that is, the philosophy of
      <cite>kalokagathia</cite>.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup>
      Similarly, the Greeks would have found incomprehensible,
      ludicrous, and chilling the alien ideological milieu in which
      Philo could formulate a rationalization for the circumcision
      of children by an appeal to the alleged necessity for
      "excising pleasures" and "banishing conceit."<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup> Circumcision for Philo was a
      surgical means of obtaining moral objectives through a
      deliberate numbing, desexualization, <span class="page">[Page
      388]</span> disinvigoration, and uglification of the body.
      The Greeks did value modesty, moderation, and restraint, but
      the idea of cutting off part of the genitals to achieve these
      moral objectives would have appeared to be counterproductive,
      to say the very least, for by permanently and artificially
      externalizing the glans, the remnant penis and its possessor
      would be cast into a permanent state of lewdness. Considering
      the antithetical nature of the Hebrews' concept that morality
      could be surgically engineered, it is immediately apparent
      why the Greeks would have viewed the circumcision of
      children, the ideology behind the circumcision of children,
      the advocates of the ideology of circumcision, and the
      circumcised penis with antipathy.</p>

      <p class="heading1">Legal Responses to Genital
      Disfigurement</p>

      <p>Considering that the name of the part being cut
      off&mdash;<cite>posthe</cite>&mdash;could also designate the
      whole penis, the idea of circumcision might well have evoked
      the same feelings aroused by penile castration. Freud points
      out the widespread tendency to equate penile castration with
      circumcision, which, he maintained, must have been a
      relatively milder substitute that was designed to take the
      place of penile castration in primeval days.<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> Thus, to the Greeks and Romans, both
      mutilations must have seemed to be the ultimate in mindless,
      barbaric irreverence, excess, and depravity. In this context,
      it is immediately understandable why the Seleucid and later
      the Roman imperial administrations, charged with the
      self-imposed task of civilizing the known world,
      unhesitatingly criminalized the ritualized disfigurement of
      the penis.</p>

      <p class="2">For instance, in the Hellenistic era, the
      Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175&ndash;165 <span
      class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.) consolidated the empire of Alexander
      and, according to Tacitus, "endeavoured to abolish Jewish
      superstition and to introduce Greek civilization."<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> Although the corroborative accounts
      of Josephus and the first book of Maccabees are afflicted
      with a bias that undermines their value as historical
      sources, it is notable that one product of superstition that
      these sources name as being banned by Antiochus was the
      ritual circumcision of infants.<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup> Clearly, the Hebrew religious <span
      class="page">[Page 389]</span> element emphatically disagreed
      with the Greeks' positive evaluation of the prepuce. Although
      it is most likely a convenient post hoc rationalization of
      ritual male circumcision rather than the original reason for
      its introduction into Hebrew religious ritual, there can be
      no escape from the devastating cultural implications of the
      Talmudic dictum, echoing the Mishnah: "The foreskin is
      disgusting."<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> Here we witness
      one of the fundamental and irreconcilable points of discord
      between the Greek and Hebrew views of the body.</p>

      <p class="2">With evident hostility, Josephus and the authors
      of 1 Maccabees also report that circumcised Hebrew males
      during this era voluntarily sought foreskin restoration
      therapies, interpreting this as an illicit attempt at
      assimilation into Greek culture.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> It is regrettable that, if any
      Hellenophile Israelites committed alternative perspectives to
      writing, nothing of this nature seems to have survived. What
      has survived, however, is documentary evidence that the
      Romans picked up where the Greeks left off in the campaign to
      rid the world of sexual disfigurements of all degrees.<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> Upholding a standard of beneficence
      all their own, the Romans united the Greeks' high regard for
      the intact body with a greater gift for administration.
      Accordingly, Emperor Domitian (81&ndash;96 <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>.) and his
      successor Nerva (96&ndash;98) issued proscripts against the
      castration of citizens and slaves.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> Although there remains no direct and
      indisputable contemporary Roman legal or literary
      confirmation for it, Hadrian's late biographer, Aelius
      Spartianus, as well as modern scholars, have argued
      convincingly that, around 132 <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>., Hadrian
      issued a universal decree <span class="page">[Page
      390]</span> outlawing circumcision, under penalty of
      death.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> There is, however,
      conclusive documentation that Hadrian reiterated the ban on
      castration, and he and his successors seem not to have made
      any ethical distinction between castration and circumcision,
      for the wording of the laws as well as the extreme penalties
      for both crimes are nearly identical: forfeiture of all
      property and execution of the perpetrators&mdash;or, for
      those of higher rank, deportation to an island.<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup> The fact that circumcision was
      punished with the maximum penalty allowed under the law
      attests to the strength of Greek and Roman views on the
      subject.</p>

      <p class="2">Taking into account the compassionate spirit of
      the almost identically framed laws banning castration, the
      ban on circumcision was most certainly motivated by
      humanitarian and ethical considerations rather than by a
      purely theological discord with those groups, such as the
      Hebrew priesthood, whose rationale for the ritualized
      circumcision of infants was defended (ineffectively, as far
      as the Greeks were concerned) by an appeal to the
      supernatural. Yet, of the various peoples affected by this
      ruling, apparently only the conservative religious element
      among the Hebrews took umbrage, leaving behind a series of
      elaborated, mythologized, and, not untypically, contradictory
      accounts, alleging the interdiction to have been religiously
      motivated.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> It is interesting
      to note, however, that the abundance of special rules and
      regulations regarding the cultic activities of
      "uncircumcised" Hebrew priests, as preserved in the Talmud,
      strongly hints that even in the highest circles of the Hebrew
      ruling classes there existed, for a period, a measure of
      active pluralism on the question of infant circumcision that
      was independent of Roman legal persuasion.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The <cite>Digest of Justinian</cite> (a legal
      compilation collected by learned jurists at the behest of
      Justinian in 533), however, documents that, around 140, <span
      class="page">[Page 391]</span> Emperor Antoninus Pius at
      least modified the ruling of Hadrian to allow only the
      Hebrews to circumcise their children, while upholding the
      legal protections from circumcision for all other
      peoples:</p>

      <p class="quote">Jews are permitted to circumcise only their
      sons on the authority of a rescript of the Divine Pius; if
      anyone shall commit it on one who is not of the same
      religion, he shall suffer the punishment of a
      castrator.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></p>

      <p>While Pius limited the exemption to Hebrews, papyrological
      documents in Greek, dating from 155 to 189 <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>. indicate
      that complex bureaucratic mechanisms were provisionally
      established to grant individual exemptions to this edict for
      certain members of the Egyptian priestly caste.<sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup> Few such exemptions, however, appear
      to have been granted. The widespread approval for the
      abolition of circumcision was limited by neither space nor
      time, for by the end of the third century, Pius's
      interdiction against circumcision was enhanced by the
      enactment of an additional legal prohibition:</p>

      <p class="quote">Roman citizens, who suffer that they
      themselves or their slaves be circumcised in accordance with
      the Jewish custom, are exiled perpetually to an island and
      their property confiscated; the doctors suffer capital
      punishment. If Jews shall circumcise purchased slaves of
      another nation, they shall be banished or suffer capital
      punishment.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup></p>

      <p>The incorporation into the <cite>Digest</cite> of Pius's
      more recent revisions of the law banning circumcision would
      explain why the sixth-century compilers of the
      <cite>Digest</cite> did not include the obsolete original
      decree of Hadrian. The two rescripts of Pius, coupled
      together, were reenacted under Constantine the Great in the
      fourth century,<sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup> and, of
      course, under Justinian in the sixth century. Simultaneously,
      the church adopted these as well as additional bans on
      circumcision into canon law and into its regional legal
      codes. Furthermore, the secular Roman law of the Byzantine
      Empire and the countries of Western Europe, at least through
      the Middle Ages, preserved and enhanced laws banning Hebrews
      from circumcising <span class="page">[Page 392]</span>
      non-Hebrews and banning Christians or slaves of any religious
      affiliation from undergoing circumcision for any
      reason.<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">It is important to note that one of the reasons
      for the seemingly continuous need to reenact laws banning
      Hebrews from circumcising non-Hebrews stems from the
      unavoidable conflict that arose over the issue of Hebrew
      religious freedom. From the pagan reign of Emperor Antoninus
      Pius and through the Christian imperial administrations of
      the Middle Ages, with a few notable and isolated exceptions,
      the freedom of the Hebrews to practice Judaism was guaranteed
      by law.<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup> Hebrew law, however,
      requires that Hebrews circumcise their slaves and servants,
      although this circumcision does not constitute a conversion
      to Judaism.<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> The Torah, the
      Talmud, and the later <cite>Schulchan Aruch</cite> all attest
      to the Judaistic imperative for forcibly circumcising
      non-Hebrews in this context.<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup>
      Although the periodic need to reenact anticircumcision laws
      indicates that they were frequently violated (and specific
      instances of violation have been preserved),<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> Roman and church law agreed in
      principle that the absolute freedom of the Hebrews to
      practice Judaism ended at the beginning of the preputial
      epidermis of non-Hebrews.</p>

      <p class="heading1">The <cite>Psolos</cite> Male</p>

      <p>In the classical era, the association between the denuded
      glans and criminal impropriety is reflected in the
      vernacular, for in the plays of Aristophanes we find use of
      the derisory adjective <cite>psolos</cite>
      (&psi;&omega;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;).<sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup> The <span class="page">[Page
      393]</span> scoliasts suggest that <cite>psolos</cite> can
      simply mean "having an erection,"<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> a situation that can inadvertently
      cause the prepuce to evert, exposing the glans, but this
      definition does not take into account the varied contexts in
      which the word is used. The <cite>psolos</cite> male need not
      necessarily be circumcised either, as in the following
      slander: "He's come back here with an old man who's filthy,
      hunchbacked, wretched, wrinkled, bald, toothless, and, by
      God, I think he's <cite>psolos</cite> too!"<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> When applied to certain foreigners
      of ill repute, however, <cite>psolos</cite> can very well
      imply that circumcision is the cause of the offender's
      lewdness. In the <cite>Birds</cite>, for instance, in the
      context of an uncharitable speech dealing with the Egyptians
      and the Phoenicians, a reading of "circumcised" for
      <cite>psolos</cite>, when it is used here to denote these
      peoples, may well be intended.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> Whether the glans was exposed
      through preputial slackness, inappropriate erection, or
      preputial amputation, the affront to good taste was the same.
      The public exposure of the glans was unsightly and
      indecent.</p>

      <p class="2">In vase painting, except in some erotic scenes
      or in humorous depictions of old men, the eversion or
      amputation of the prepuce to expose the glans was, as Zanker
      has observed, "shameless and dishonorable, something we see
      only in depictions of slaves and barbarians."<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup> Greek artists also took pains to
      represent <a href="hodges31.jpg">ugly, decrepit old men,
      barbarian slaves, lecherous old satyrs, and comics as having
      a large, ungainly penis, sometimes with an exposed glans</a>,
      even when unerect, lending an effect of comic lewdness.</p>

      <p class="2">Even in the private sphere, eversion of the
      prepuce and exposure of the glans seems to have been
      desirable only under certain exceedingly intimate
      circumstances. For instance, there are only a small handful
      of vases depicting an <a href="hodges32.jpg">exposed
      glans</a> (albeit only partial exposure) in an attractive
      youth who, in these instances, <a href="hodges33.jpg">is
      erect</a> and <a href="hodges34.jpg">about to engage in <span
      class="page">[Page 394]</span> irrumation.</a><sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup> <a href="hodges35.jpg">Portrayals of
      irrumation by attractive, young, human males</a> generally
      depict the <a href="hodges36.jpg">prepuce as unretracted,
      teat-like, and neatly tapered</a>;<sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup> consequently, preputial eversion
      alone, without erection, must have been deemed unseemly in
      public precisely because it was so strongly associated with
      erection. An exposed glans was also undesirable because of
      its superficial resemblance to the permanently externalized
      glans of the circumcised penis. Hence, we see that in the
      Greek cultural constellation of symbols, the image of the
      exposed glans was remarkable for the intensity and sheer
      abundance of negative imagery associated with it.</p>

      <p class="2">One final note on the word <cite>psolos</cite>,
      however, would be in order. The definition in the
      tenth-century Byzantine <cite>Suidae Lexicon</cite>, which,
      like the earlier lexicon of Photius, was most likely compiled
      to clarify the meanings of increasingly obscure words in
      classical texts, reads: "&omicron;
      &lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&pi;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
      [<cite>ho leipodermos</cite>]"&mdash;that is, one suffering
      from <cite>lipodermos</cite>.<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup>
      Thus, we have concrete evidence, although from a late source,
      that the condemnatory moral view of the penis with an exposed
      glans&mdash;the lewd <cite>psolos</cite> penis&mdash;had at
      some point been subsumed into a new framework: it had been
      transformed into a medical concept, but it was more than
      this. Immorality, impropriety, and genital unattractiveness
      were now diseases, for which the medical profession offered
      cures.</p>

      <p class="heading1">The Appearance and Definition of
      <cite>Lipodermos</cite></p>

      <p>As we have seen, a mutually reinforcing synthesis between
      preexisting Greek cultural views of the prepuce and Greek
      reactions to the anti-preputial practices of certain Near
      Eastern peoples who had been incorporated into the Seleucid
      and Roman empires converges in a single medical concept:
      <cite>lipodermos</cite>
      (&lambda;&iota;&pi;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
      or, alternatively,
      &lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&pi;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;)
      literally, "lacking skin"&mdash;the pathological disorder of
      the penis whose symptom was an artificially or congenitally
      externalized glans penis.</p>

      <p class="2">The spurious but genuinely ancient
      <cite>Definitiones medicae</cite>, a work written by an
      unknown hand but frequently cited by Renaissance scholars of
      <span class="page">[Page 395]</span> Galen, provides the
      following definition of <cite>lipodermos</cite>, linking it
      with this useful distinction between <cite>posthe</cite> and
      <cite>akroposthion</cite></p>

      <p class="quote"><cite>Lipodermos</cite> is a defect of the
      skin cover of the glans such that it can be laid bare no
      further. That which covers the glans (balanos is called the
      posthe or the akroposthia.<sup><a
      href="#n81">81</a></sup></p>

      <p>Lipodermos could be used as an adjective, describing a
      male (or a penis) characterized by a deficient prepuce, and
      it could also be used as a noun, signifying the name of this
      disorder.</p>

      <p class="heading1">The Treatment of
      <cite>Lipodermos</cite></p>
      The extant writings of a significant number of Greek and
      Roman physicians feature discussions of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> and its treatment. According to
      Galen, the now-lost medical work of Crito, a physician at
      Trajan's court, contained a section on the treatment of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> as well.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> In accordance with the severity of
      the condition or its cause, <cite>lipodermos</cite> was
      treated with topical medications, traction, or surgery. 

      <p class="heading2"><cite>Medicinal Treatment</cite></p>

      <p class="2">In his <cite>Materia medica</cite>, Dioscorides
      of Anazarbus (41&ndash;68 <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.) recommended the curative and soothing
      properties of honey in combination with repeated soakings of
      the affected part in warm water to make the penile skin more
      supple and to allow stretching of the prepuce:
      "<cite>Lipodermos</cite>, if not due to circumcision, is
      cured by honey, if for thirty days the <cite>posthe</cite> is
      softened with honey, especially after a bath."<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup> Dioscorides' second herbal treatment
      for congenital <cite>lipodermos</cite> involves a preparation
      from the rubefacient plant thapsia (<cite>T.
      garganica</cite>). Physicians attributed to this plant the
      property of augmenting the volume of the parts onto which it
      was applied: "[Thapsia] is useful for the prepuce
      (&epsilon;&pi;&alpha;&upsilon;&omega;&upsilon;&iota;&omicron;&nu;)
      of those suffering from <cite>lipodermos</cite>, providing it
      not be as a result of circumcision. It induces swelling,
      which when bathed and anointed, restores the defect of the
      <cite>posthe</cite>....<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup></p>
      <span class="page">[Page 396]</span> 

      <p class="2">Galen also advocated the use of thapsia and
      hinted that there were several topical preparations that were
      helpful for the treatment of lipodermic men. In <cite>De
      compositione medicamentorum per genera</cite>, Galen
      attributes such a preparation to a certain Epidauros:</p>

      <p class="quote">Another of Epidauros' Treatments for the
      Lipodermic<br />
       <span class="menu">Ingredients:</span><br />
       <span class="menu">thapsia root, 3 drachms</span><br />
       <span class="menu">black or long pepper, 1
      drachm</span><br />
       <span class="menu">fat of a calf, 12 drachms</span><br />
       <span class="menu">frankincense, 4 drachms</span><br />
       <span class="menu">balsam, 2 drachms</span><br />
       <span class="menu">pine resin, 16 drachms</span><br />
       <span class="menu">beeswax, 8 drachms</span><br />
       <span class="menu">Pour the melted [ingredients] over the
      dry..<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup></span></p>

      <p>The ingredients in this cerate were commonly used in
      medicinal preparations, especially emollients.<sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup> The fat as well as the aromatic pine
      resin, frankincense, and balsam were thought to have, among
      other things, cleansing properties. The beeswax was a
      carrier, and the thapsia and pepper (the dried berries of
      <cite>Piper nigrum</cite>, as opposed to the New World
      <cite>Capsicum</cite> were counterirritants used to treat
      bruises and other complaints, when applied externally. This
      cerate presumably would have facilitated the manual
      stretching of the penile skin while simultaneously inflaming
      it.</p>

      <p class="heading2"><cite>Tractional Treatment</cite></p>

      <p>The medical sources affirm that the use of the preputial
      ligature was not limited to athletes or <cite>komasts</cite>.
      The Ephesian physician Soranus, who lived under the reigns of
      Trajan and Hadrian (98&ndash;138 <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>.), has left
      us indication of both a wider use of a ligature and the more
      general cultural diffusion of the concept of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite>. In his <cite>Gynecology</cite>,
      Soranus justifies the medically prescribed stretching of the
      foreskin by an appeal to aesthetics. He advises wet nurses to
      massage the newborn child periodically, and to pay particular
      attention to performing manipulations designed to improve the
      appearance of the congenitally lipodermic penis:</p>

      <p class="quote">If the male neonate appears to be lipodermic
      (&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&pi;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&rho;&eta;&omicron;&sigmaf;),
      she [the wet nurse] should gently draw the
      <cite>akroposthion</cite> forward or even hold it together
      with a strand of wool to fasten it. If gradually stretched
      and continuously <span class="page">[Page 397]</span> drawn
      forward, it easily stretches and assumes its normal length,
      covers the glans penis and becomes accustomed to keep the
      natural good shape.<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup> Preserved
      in their original setting in <cite>De methodo
      medendi</cite>,<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup> Galen's
      nonsurgical methods of elongating the prepuce involve
      different applications of traction and tension. The abridged
      account of Galen's exposition that appears in Oribasius's
      compilation states:</p>

      <p class="quote">When the skin of the penis needs only a
      short stretch in order to give it a natural appearance, I
      have often obtained the desired result through simple
      tension: I roll around the circumference of the penis a strip
      of strong and soft papyrus, after having coated the skin with
      glue. It is clear that it is necessary to glue the end of the
      strip of papyrus to the part of the same strip placed on the
      underside of the end. In effect, this device dries quickly
      and pulls without discomfort. One places under the skin of
      the <cite>posthe</cite>, on the interior fold, a rounded
      object of suitable dimension, that one can easily remove when
      the strip of papyrus is adhered. When I have no such object
      at my disposal, I often roll up and introduce a piece of
      papyrus of average size to serve as a support for the one
      with which I surround the penis. I want to be careful to
      provide the patient with a way to urinate easily when the
      paper rolled around his penis is completely solidified and
      the supporting one is removed. Some of those who use thapsia
      to return the <cite>posthe</cite> over the glans construct
      the round object in question in the form of little lead
      spout. They stretch the skin of the posthe over the exterior
      of this spout and secure it with a soft leather cord.This
      procedure can sometimes also be useful for those individuals
      who are missing a large amount of <cite>posthe</cite>. I also
      treat this surgically.<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The alternative method that Galen outlines, that
      of inserting a lead spout under the prepuce and holding it in
      place by binding the enveloping prepuce with a leather cord
      (<cite>himas</cite> [&iota;&mu;&alpha;&sigmaf;]), would have
      added weight and perhaps tension, depending on the length of
      the lead spout, to the restorative technique.</p>

      <p class="2">Like the technique of Soranus, Galen's method of
      manually stretching the deficient preputial skin over the
      glans and winding a leather cord around the
      "<cite>akroposthion</cite>" would have a similar effect to
      that of the <cite>kynodesme</cite>. These techniques depend
      for their efficacy on the principles of tissue expansion,
      today a major reconstructive technique. Given sufficient
      application of constant tension, new and permanent skin can
      be induced to grow. Penile skin, noted for its great
      elasticity, is especially responsive to expansion
      techniques.</p>
      <span class="page">[Page 398]</span> 

      <p class="heading2"><cite>Surgical Treatment</cite></p>

      <p>The surgical techniques developed in antiquity to repair
      the lipodermic penis have been described in modern medical
      journals,<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup> but these papers
      erroneously portray these operations as having the sole
      objective of surgically repairing the
      <cite>circumcised</cite> penis rather than the
      <cite>lipodermic</cite> penis, which, as the ancient sources
      show, need not necessarily have been caused by circumcision.
      For instance, Celsus prefaces his account of his surgical
      technique by specifying that it is to treat "those in whom
      the defect is natural,"<sup><a href="#n91">91</a></sup>
      rather than those in whom it is caused by circumcision. The
      Latin translation omits the term <cite>lipodermos</cite>, but
      the subject matter and composition fit so well with other
      explicitly denominated descriptions of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> repair (see below)that the
      attribution may be taken to be legitimate:</p>

      <p class="quote">And, if the glans is bare and the man wishes
      for the look of the thing to have it covered, that can be
      done; but more easily in a boy than in a man; in one in whom
      the defect is natural, than in one who after the custom of
      certain races has been circumcised; and in one who has the
      glans small and the adjacent skin rather ample, while the
      penis itself is shorter, rather than in one in whom the
      conditions are contrary.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the treatment for
      those in whom the defect is natural is as follows. The
      prepuce around the glans is seized, stretched out until it
      actually covers the glans, and there tied. Next the skin
      covering the penis just in front of the pubes is cut through
      in a circle until the penis is bared, but great care is taken
      not to cut into the urethra, nor into the blood vessels
      there. This done the prepuce slides forwards towards the tie,
      and a sort of small ring is laid bare in front of the pubes,
      to which lint is applied in order that flesh may grow and
      fill it up. &lt;It is seen that a large enough part of the
      penis has been bared, if the skin is distended little or not
      at all, and if&gt; the breadth of the wound above supplies
      sufficient covering. But until the scar has formed it must
      remain tied, only a small passage being left in the middle
      for the urine. But in one who has been circumcised the
      prepuce is to be raised from the underlying penis around the
      circumference of the glans by means of a scalpel. This is not
      so very painful, for once the margin has been freed, it can
      be stripped up by hand as far back as the pubes, nor in so
      doing is there any bleeding. The prepuce thus freed is again
      stretched forwards beyond the glans; next cold water
      affusions are freely used, and a plaster is applied round to
      repress severe inflammation. And for the following days the
      patient is to fast until nearly overcome by hunger lest
      satiety excite that part. When the inflammation has <span
      class="page">[Page 399]</span> ceased, the penis should be
      bandaged from the pubes to the corona; over the glans the
      plaster is applied with the other end of the probe. This is
      done in order that the lower part may agglutinate, whilst the
      upper part heals without adhering.<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">In addition to the surgical technique outlined
      by Celsus, the compilations of Paul of Aegina and Oribasius
      contain abridged accounts of a similar surgical treatment,
      originally from the <cite>Cheirourgoumena</cite> (preserved
      only in fragments), a lost work by Antyllus, a second-century
      <span class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>. Greek
      physician.<sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup> Unlike Celsus,
      Antyllus freely uses the term <cite>lipodermos</cite>, but
      like Celsus, he stresses that this operation is of little
      value in circumcision-caused <cite>lipodermos</cite>. In a
      brief commentary, however, Paul of Aegina voices his
      disapproval of Antyllus's operation, expressing his doubt
      that anyone would choose to submit to its dangers.</p>

      <p class="heading1">The Identity of Lipodermic Patients</p>

      <p>Having marshaled the evidence, a few general questions
      left unanswered in the sources can be posed. It is worth
      asking who would have been a candidate for
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> treatments and surgical restoration
      of the prepuce at this time, and what their motivation would
      have been.</p>

      <p class="heading2">Hebrews</p>

      <p>The available sources do not specify the demographics of
      treatment seekers, but the most obvious candidates among
      those whose lipodermos was attributable to circumcision would
      seem, at first, to have been Hebrew males, circumcised
      involuntarily at eight days of age, who wished to solidify
      their assimilation into Greco-Roman society. The ban on
      Hebrew circumcision instituted by Antiochus Epiphanes in
      Jerusalem could not have lasted long, and the Seleucids soon
      lost control over the region. Still, then, as now, not all
      Hebrews lived in Palestine, and even among those who did, it
      is difficult to imagine that all would have been indifferent
      to the reinstatement of compulsory circumcision. If we are to
      trust the account of Josephus (37&ndash;100? <span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>.), "many of
      the Jews, some willingly, others through fear of the
      punishment which had been prescribed, followed the practices
      ordained by the king."<sup><a href="#n94">94</a></sup> In his
      first epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 7:18), Saul of
      Tarsus (St. Paul) alludes to Hebrews <span class="page">[Page
      400]</span> who stretched their remnant penile skin to create
      a facsimile prepuce, but without mentioning the cure of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> as the incentive. The Talmud as well,
      which traditionally dates, in its oral form, from about this
      period, alludes to Hebrew priests among others in whom "the
      prepuce is drawn forward to cover up the corona."<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Given that the native Hebrew sources on Hebrew
      history are almost exclusively biased toward the religious
      perspective, it is easy to lose sight of the possibility that
      these sources may not represent a majority view. There is
      little basis for the assumption that Israelite society was
      any less pluralistic than any other. The religiously oriented
      sources (and Josephus, as an apologist for the religious
      oligarchy, must be included in this category as well)
      acknowledge the existence of a divergent view on infant
      circumcision within Israelite society, but they denigrate
      that view.</p>

      <p class="2">The situational nudity in the transplanted
      culture of the Greek conquerors of the Near East and the
      prevalence of the nude in public art throughout the Greek and
      Roman cities of the Empire would have served as a reminder to
      the Hebrew of the physical alienation that had been imposed
      upon him by his hieratic overlords. From the medical point of
      view, however, circumcision had not merely alienated the
      Hebrew: it had afflicted him with a sexual pathology as well.
      A regular regime of thapsia-laced unguents, a discreet weight
      suspended from the remnant penile skin, or even reparative
      surgery may have seemed a fair price for the restoration of a
      more biologically natural-looking penis and access to the
      cultural advantages that it represented.</p>

      <p class="heading2">Slaves</p>

      <p>The second group of candidates that comes to mind is
      manumitted slaves of Hebrews (or unmanumitted slaves, once
      owned by Hebrews and later sold to non-Hebrews) who had been
      forcibly circumcised in accordance with Mosaic law. Bearing
      the mark of Hebrew slavery, it is understandable that they
      might have been eager to erase the physical reminder of their
      degradation. A self-deprecating verse of Martial
      (40&ndash;104 <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.) hints at a complex tale of an
      unmanumitted slave who was in the process, it is tempting to
      think, of curing his <cite>lipodermos</cite>:</p>

      <p class="quote">Your slave stands with a black strap round
      his loins whenever you submerge your whole self in the warm

      <span class="page">[Page 401]</span> 

      <p>We see in this verse documentation that the conical,
      leaden <cite>antilipodermos</cite> weight described by Galen
      may have been known as the <cite>pondus judaeus</cite>, which
      indicates that Hebrews were more closely identified with its
      use. That the presumably Roman speaker of this poem should
      also be wearing the <cite>pondus judaeus</cite> raises
      interesting questions that should be considered, at least in
      part, in relation to <cite>lipodermos</cite>.</p>

      <p class="heading2">Egyptians</p>

      <p>It is often alleged that male circumcision was a widely
      observed custom among the Egyptians, and if this were so, one
      would expect some Egyptians of the Greco-Roman era to have
      sought treatment for <cite>lipodermos</cite>. On closer
      inspection, however, it emerges that there is no concrete
      proof at all that circumcision was widely practiced in
      Egypt.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup> It is not necessary
      for our purpose to consider this question in detail, but a
      general survey of the evidence has to be presented before one
      can fully understand the impact in Egypt of both the Roman
      legal prohibitions on circumcision and the Greco-Roman
      medical concept of <cite>lipodermos</cite>.</p>

      <p class="2">The modern assumption that circumcision was
      widely practiced in Egypt originated, for the most part, in
      the work of early-twentieth-century scholars whose primary
      interest was in confirming the classical sources (especially
      their misreading of Herodotus)and in confirming and
      authenticating the "historical basis" of the Bible. <a
      href="hodges37.jpg">A few examples of Old Kingdom
      (2649&ndash;2134 <span class="bce">B</span>.<span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>.) statuary
      present some adult males</a>&mdash;usually priests,
      functionaries, or low-status workers<sup><a
      href="#n98">98</a></sup>&mdash;as having under-gone a
      vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although
      <a href="hodges38.jpg">no flesh has been removed</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n99">99</a></sup> Similarly, a sixth-dynasty
      (2323&ndash;2150) tomb relief&mdash;the <a
      href="hodges39.jpg">Mastaba of Ankhmahor at
      Saqqara</a>&mdash;depicts something happening in the vicinity
      of the penis of a "<cite>ka</cite>-priest": no flesh has been
      cut, and there is little reason to imagine that a preputial
      amputation must follow; the hasty interpretation of this as a
      "circumcision scene" and as "proof" that circumcision was
      routine in ancient Egypt would seem to be an <span
      class="page">[Page 402]</span> injudicious and unwarranted
      extrapolation.<sup><a href="#n100">100</a></sup> Ann Macy
      Roth convincingly argues that at least the <a
      href="hodges40.jpg">right side panel of the Mastaba of
      Ankhmahor most likely depicts the ritual pubic shaving of the
      <cite>ka</cite>-priest</a> rather than a circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n101">101</a></sup> She suggests that the left scene
      could involve penile cutting, but the vertical angle of the
      oval object in the right hand of the squatting
      man&mdash;assuming that it is a knife&mdash;shows that the
      incision about to made cannot be a circumcision, which
      requires a horizontal cut; if any cutting is about to take
      place, and this is by no means definite, it can only be a
      vertical dorsal slit. Roth conventionally translates the
      caption to this left-hand scene as "circumcising
      <cite>ka</cite>-priest," but acknowledges that there are
      unusual problems with the hieroglyphics that make a
      conclusive translation impossible.<sup><a
      href="#n102">102</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">By the time Herodotus visited Egypt, sometime
      after 460 <span class="bce">B</span>.<span
      class="bce">C</span>.<span class="bce">E</span>. the dorsal
      slit may have indeed mutated into a full preputial
      amputation, but it seems to have been restricted to certain
      males of the priestly caste. Still, some skepticism about the
      accuracy of Herodotus's observation seems pardonable and
      prudent. The opportunities to make a detailed and
      comprehensive examination of the penises of members of the
      Egyptian priesthood are likely to have been severely limited,
      especially for a foreigner. And whether they experienced full
      preputial amputation or merely a dorsal slit, there is still
      disagreement on how prevalent such practices were among the
      priests, and how long they persisted. Egyptian civilization
      spanned millennia: it is unwise to assume that any customs,
      especially ones as restricted as penile incision or
      circumcision, would necessarily have endured unchanged over
      such a long time span. The only indisputable documentary
      support for the existence of circumcision among the Egyptian
      priesthood remains the Roman-era papyrological evidence cited
      above.</p>

      <p class="2">Evidence suggesting that, at least in later
      centuries, the Egyptian masses enjoyed freedom from any
      degree of penile cutting is manifested, among other places,
      in the thirtieth-dynasty (380&ndash;343 <span
      class="bce">B</span>.<span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.) limestone relief of Horhotep, which
      shows a scantily clad procession bringing tribute to
      Horhotep, the high priest of Buto.<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup> Apart from the seated <span
      class="page">[Page 403]</span> priest, who wears a kilt, all
      of the males in this scene, young boys as well as strapping
      adult men, are indisputably in full possession of robust
      prepuces. It may also be observed that the remarkable wealth
      of statues, statuettes, and reliefs of <a
      href="hodges41.jpg">nude Egyptian youths</a> and young gods
      such as Horus and Harpocrates, dating as early as the Old
      Kingdom, uniformly feature a <a
      href="hodges42.jpg">generously proportioned
      <cite>akroposthion</cite></a>.<sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup> It is not surprising, then, that
      modern radiological methods have disproved the
      early-twentieth-century claims that Egyptian mummies bear the
      mark of circumcision.<sup><a href="#n105">105</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Further corroboration is provided by Josephus,
      himself an Alexandrine, who, in defending ritual Judaistic
      circumcision against criticism voiced by Apion, an
      Alexandrine Egyptian academician, declares that the Egyptian
      priests of his day were circumcised&mdash;implying that all
      other Egyptian males were free from circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n106">106</a></sup> Support for this .nal point can be
      deduced from Josephus's ungracious allegation about the fate
      of Apion's prepuce.<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup> Thus,
      we have a strong case that even before the edict of Hadrian,
      outside the priestly caste, circumcision was not a feature of
      secular Egyptian life. Few if any Egyptians would have been
      diagnosed with circumcision-induced <cite>lipodermos</cite>,
      although some could well have been diagnosed with a degree of
      congenital <cite>lipodermos</cite>.</p>

      <p class="heading2"><cite>Miscellaneous Near Eastern
      Peoples</cite></p>

      <p>What of the other peoples at the fringe of the Empire who
      circumcised children prior to Hadrian's abolition of
      circumcision? Intriguing evidence is fortuitously preserved
      in a unique Syriac text, <cite>The Book of the Laws of
      Countries</cite>, a dialogue concerning Bardaisan of Edessa
      (154&ndash;223 <span class="bce">C</span>.<span
      class="bce">E</span>.), written down by his pupil Philippus.
      Bardaisan states:</p>

      <p class="quote">Recently the Romans have conquered Arabia
      and done away with all the laws there used to be,
      particularly circumcision, which was a custom they used. For
      a man of his sovereign free-will submits himself to the law
      laid upon him by another, who also possesses sovereign
      free-will. But I shall tell you another <span
      class="page">[Page 404]</span> thing too, more convincing
      than all the rest to fools and unbelievers: all the Jews that
      have received the law of Moses, circumcise their male
      children on the eighth day, without waiting for the coming of
      stars and without regard for the local law.<sup><a
      href="#n108">108</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Evidently, even by the beginning of the third
      century, the news that the Roman authorities had exempted
      Hebrews from the abolition had not yet reached this corner of
      the world. No sources have yet emerged to verify whether
      Greco-Roman physicians practicing in Arabia diagnosed or
      treated <cite>lipodermos</cite>. Still, given that Greek
      medical texts found currency here, it would be surprising if
      lipodermos were not occasionally diagnosed, at least in the
      few remaining centuries before the rise of Islam.<sup><a
      href="#n109">109</a></sup></p>

      <p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>

      <p>After this survey of the evidence, some conclusions about
      Greek views of the prepuce can now be drawn. In the
      multinational Seleucid and Imperial Roman eras, the medical
      support for a preexisting ethos of male genital aesthetics
      that favored the longer, securely closed prepuce was
      confirmed and intensified. This led to concerted and
      concerned action to address violations of that ethos.</p>

      <p class="2">Through the development of the concept of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite>, Greek medicine gave to Greek
      civilization a scientific reinforcement of its disapproval of
      the violations of genital integrity occurring in the Near
      East. This ethos posited not only that a circumcised penis is
      a deviation from the natural&mdash;although that is of real
      importance&mdash;but that a circumcised penis is a defective
      and disfigured penis, one that can be repaired by medical
      treatment. Medicine and law thereby entered into a mutually
      supportive relationship: circumcision was against the law
      because it mutilated its victims, but, taken to the next
      logical level in this medico-ethical argument, it was also
      against the law because it necessarily inflicted a state of
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> on its victims.</p>

      <p class="2">The effect of recognizing the circumcised penis
      as defective through the concept of <cite>lipodermos</cite>
      was not merely the addition of a medical dimension to the
      Greeks' critical view of circumcision: it also led the Greeks
      to view the intact penis in a more critical light. While a
      circumcised penis would necessarily have been considered
      lipodermic and thus <span class="page">[Page 405]</span>
      pathologically disfigured, the intact penis with a
      congenitally insufficient <cite>akroposthion</cite> that
      risked exposing the glans was also regarded as suffering from
      a degree of <cite>lipodermos</cite>. The lipodermic penis, as
      we have seen, was not only the stigma of slaves and unpopular
      foreigners from the Near East, but a provocative focal point
      for criticism. Moreover, during the Roman era, where
      circumcision was a capital crime that was associated with the
      rejection of Greek or Roman civilization, the poorly
      proportioned lipodermic but intact penis with its glans
      exposed to one degree or another, because of its superficial
      resemblance to the circumcised penis with its surgically
      externalized glans, would have been seen as a sign of
      criminality, apostasy, and unpatriotic rebellion. These must
      have been impelling incentives to seek treatment. Mercifully,
      Greek medical writers reassured their readers that congenital
      <cite>lipodermos</cite> was much easier to alleviate than
      accidental or surgically induced <cite>lipodermos</cite>.</p>

      <p class="2">The Greeks obviously attached great importance
      to attainable ideals of physical beauty. Expressions of
      physical pride stand as one of the hallmarks of their
      literature and art. Judging by the way they depicted
      themselves in their figurative art, and taking into account
      the general use of the <cite>kynodesme</cite> and its
      accompanying ethos that exalted the well-proportioned, sleek,
      tapered, protective, beautifying, and propriety-preserving
      <cite>akroposthion</cite>, one may surmise that they would
      have agreed with a recent commentator in the <cite>British
      Journal of Urology</cite> who wrote: "One can never be too
      rich or too thin or have too much foreskin."<sup><a

      Mosaic law permits Hebrews to enslave other Hebrews for a
      maximum of seven years (Exod. 21: 1&ndash;6); there are no
      such limitations on non-Hebrew slaves (Lev. 25:39&ndash;46).
      Converting a non-Hebrew slave to Judaism would eventually
      entail a considerable financial loss, which may be one of the
      practical reasons why the circumcision of a slave does not
      constitute conversion to Judaism.<br />
