      <strong><font face="arial, sans-serif" size="5">CIRCUMCISION:
      THEN AND NOW</font><br />
      <br />
       <font face="arial">By: James E. Peron, Ed.D.</font></strong>

      <p class="justified"><strong><cite>Milah: Symbolic
      Circumcision of Covenant</cite><br />
      </strong> The original Biblical circumcision of Abraham's
      time was a relatively minor ritual circumcision procedure in
      which only the redundant end of the foreskin extending beyond
      the tip of the glans was removed. This was called "Milah". It
      is from this term that the Jewish Religious Covenant
      circumcision ritual Bris Milah or Brith Milah got its
      name.</p>

      <p class="justified">Following "Milah", a penis so
      circumcised would still contain a considerable portion of the
      foreskin and the penis would have continued to go through its
      natural development since most of the foreskin would have
      remained intact. Protection of the glans would still have
      occurred. The foreskin would not be stripped back off the
      glans and would naturally separate from the glans gradually
      as the child matures, much as it would had the child not been
      circumcised. The sensitive frenulum would not have been
      disturbed or moved, and the foreskin remaining would continue
      to cover and protect a substantial portion of the glans,
      especially when flaccid, and the glans would appear as
      uncircumcised. There would be minimal loss of sensitivity or
      intended protection.</p>

      <p class="justified">This type circumcision continued
      throughout the ages and during the time of Christ. The
      circumcision of Christ would have been this type circumcision
      as referred to in the bible. Indeed, biblical reference to
      circumcision is strictly this form of circumcision. It
      continued into the New Testament. It has been argued that
      Michelangelo's David should show David as Circumcised.
      Interestingly, Michelangelo presented David precisely as he
      should have appeared following an infant "Milah"
      circumcision. His glans is essentially covered with only the
      tip of the glans showing.</p>

      <p class="justified"><strong><cite>Changes to the Ritual
      Circumcision Procedure:</cite></strong><br />
       No other feature was added to the religious ritual until
      about 140 AD when a second step to the ritual circumcision
      procedure was introduced.</p>

      <p class="justified"><strong><cite>Periah: The laying bare of
      the glans</cite></strong><br />
       After performing "milah", the cutting back of the end of the
      infant's foreskin, a second step, periah was then performed.
      Periah consists of tearing and stripping back the remaining
      inner mucosal lining of the foreskin from the glans and then,
      by use of a sharp finger nail or implement, removing all of
      the inner mucosal tissue, including the excising and removal
      of the frenulum from the underside of the glans. The
      objective was to insure that no part of the remaining penile
      skin would rest against the glans corona. If any shreds of
      the mucosal foreskin tissue remained, or rejoined to the
      underside of the glans, the child was to be
      re-circumcised.</p>

      <p class="justified">This is a much more radical form of
      circumcision. <i>It was dictated by man, and is not the
      biblical commanded circumcision rite. [Italics mine]</i> Its
      introduction has a bizarre history. The rabbinate sought to
      put an end to the practice of youths desiring to appear
      uncircumcised by stretching the remainding foreskin for
      social economic benefits and for sports competitions. By
      introducing the painful and debilitating "Periah" they would
      obliterate the foreskin completely such that proper
      circumcised Jew could not disguise "the seal of the
      covenant". From this point in Jewish history, the male's
      glans is directly affected by the circumcision procedure, and
      the denuded glans and traumatized infant will heal with
      considerable nerve damage and loss of sensitivity. <i>Again,
      it is important to note that this is not the Covenant
      circumcision of Abraham defined in the Bible. [Italics
      mine]</i></p>

      <p class="justified"><b><i>Metzitzeh: (Mezzizza/Mizizah) The
      sucking of blood from the wound</i></b><br />
       During the Talmudic period (500-625 A.D.), a third step was
      added to the Orthodox circumcision ritual. It was not
      universally adopted by all Jewish groups, but became a
      practice of the more Orthodox groups. This third step was
      called "Metzitzah". During "Metzitzah", the mohel takes the
      now badly bleeding penis into his mouth and sucks the blood
      from the wounded pant. This was most probably adopted to
      collapse the major blood vessels to stem bleeding and to
      extract any induced bacteria from the wound and blood system.
      In effect, it often introduced infection, such as
      tuberculosis and venereal diseases, with very serious and
      tragic consequence, as reported throughout history. More
      modern day <cite>mohels</cite> use a glass tube placed over
      the infant's penis for suction of the blood when performing
      metzitzah. In many Jewish ritual circumcisions this step of
      Metzitzah has been eliminated.</p>

      <p class="justified"><strong><cite>The introduction of
      Routine Infant Circumcision:</cite></strong><br />
       Routine Infant Circumcision was introduced during the late
      1800's and throughout the 1900's on the pretext that it
      offered health and hygiene benefits, would stop the habit of
      masturbation, and proffered an endless list of presumed cures
      for a variety of ailments and diseases. As mother's opted to
      use physicians to give birth in hospitals or clinics, rather
      than using a midwife for home birth, the practice of routine
      circumcision of male infants blossomed and became nearly
      universal.</p>

      <p class="justified">As one would expect, many of those
      experienced in the procedure were Jewish physicians and
      mohels. They taught new physicians to perform the surgical
      procedure as was practiced by Jewish ritual circumcision
      procedures. This meant that most infants underwent a fairly
      radical complete form of circumcision. What was performed was
      the Jewish "Milah" followed by "Periah", with most if not all
      of the foreskin being removed and the frenulum either
      severely damaged or completely removed. This remains the
      routine infant circumcision procedure to this day. Many males
      throughout these past decades have suffered the lasting
      physical, psychological, and sexual dysfunctional
      consequences of routine circumcision, which they did not
      choose.</p>
