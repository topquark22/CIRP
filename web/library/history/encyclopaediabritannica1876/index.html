      "Circumcision" from the ninth edition of the

      <br />

      <p class="text2">CIRCUMCISION. The importance of this rite is
      so largely due to its quasi-sacramental character in Judaism,
      that any inquiry into its history and meaning must be
      prefaced by a reference to the Old Testament.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. There are three
      distinct narratives in the sacred literature of the Jews
      which claim to be considered. It is related in Gen. xvii.
      that when Abram the Hebrew was ninety-nine years of age, he
      became a party on behalf of himself and his descendants to a
      covenant with his God. Of this covenant the sign and
      condition was circumcision, which was directed to be
      performed (a peculiarity of Judaism) on the eighth day after
      the child&rsquo;s birth. Is this account, we may ask, based
      on a historical tradition ? If so, the circumcision of the
      Israelites is entirely unconnected with that of other nations
      unless indeed other nations have borrowed theirs from the
      Israelites. This has actually been maintained in the case of
      the Egyptians by Archdeacon Hardwicke, but the theory is not
      only improbable in itself, considering the imitative
      character of the Israelites, and their low importance in
      Egypt (Gen. xlvi. 34), but contrary to the evidence of the
      Egyptian monuments (see below). If, as has been supposed by
      some, the document to which Gen. xvii. belongs is of
      post-captivity origin, this would put it out of court as a
      witness to the popular tradition of the Hebrews. But there is
      another narrative, apparently of a more archaic complexion,
      which leads to a directly opposite historical result. We read
      in Exod. iv. 25, 26, that when Moses was returning from
      Midian to Egypt, he was in danger of his life owing to the
      neglect of circumcision in his family. &ldquo;And
      Zipporah,&rdquo; his Midianitish wife, &ldquo;took a sharp
      stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at
      his feet, and said, Sure a <i>khatan</i> (Auth. Vers.,
      &lsquo;husband&rsquo;) of blood art thou to me ; so he (sc.,
      the offended deity) desisted from him. At that time she said,
      a <i>khathan</i> of blood with reference to the
      circumcision.&rdquo; The meaning of the story can still be
      discerned. <i>Khathan</i>, or <i>khatan</i>, meant originally
      not &ldquo;husband&rdquo; (as Auth. Vers. of Exodus), nor
      &ldquo;son-in-law&rdquo; (as in ordinary Arabic), but a
      &ldquo;a newly-admitted member of the family.&rdquo; This
      appears from the sense of Arab. <i>khatana</i> &ldquo;to
      provide a wedding-feast,&rdquo; and <i>khatana</i>, &ldquo;to
      give or receive a daughter in marriage.&rdquo; So that in the
      sense of the old Hebrew tradition, &ldquo;a <i>khathan</i> of
      blood meant &ldquo;one who has become a <i>khathan</i>, not
      by marriage but by circumcision,&rdquo; a meaning which is
      still further confirmed by the derived sense of Arab.
      <i>khatana</i> &ldquo;to circumcise,&rdquo; circumcision
      being performed in Arabia at the age of puberty. To sum
      up:&mdash;an Arabian woman plays the chief part in the story,
      and her words are only explicable from the Arabic ; it is far
      from improbable that Yahweh (or Jehovah) was himself first
      made known to the Jews in Arabia (comp. Judg. v. 4, Hab. iii.
      3) ; putting all which together, we obtain a strong case for
      the hypothesis of the Arabian origin of Jewish
      circumcision.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third narrative is
      Josh. v. 2-9, where Joshua is said to have circumcised the
      children of Israel a second time with &ldquo; knives of
      stone,&rdquo; and have thus &ldquo;rolled away the reproach
      of Egypt from them.&rdquo; It is not unnatural that this
      should have been used by some to confirm the view of an
      Egyptian origin of circumcision, among others by Dr Ebers,
      whe refers to the additional words in the Septuagint, Josh.
      xxiv. 31, &ldquo; There they buried with him. . . . . the
      stone knives with which he had circumcised the children of
      Israel in Gilgal.&rdquo; But, first, with regard to his
      singular statement of the Alexandrine version, it must
      henceforth be abandoned by all scholars. It is simply an
      unscientific attempt to account for the existence near
      Joshua&rsquo;s supposed tomb of flint instruments, such as
      those discovered by M. Gu&eacute;rin on this very site. It
      need hardly be added that the flint instruments discovered by
      the French <i>savant</i> were really pre-historic ; they
      consist not only of knives, but of saws, which would have
      been available for the purpose ascribed to Joshua (see Burton
      and Drake&rsquo;s <i>Unexplored Syria</i>, ii, 295-300). And,
      secondly, Bishop Colenso has shown some reason for the
      suspicion that verses 2 to 8 (not verse 9) are later
      additions to the narrative, in which case the &ldquo;
      reproach of Egypt&rdquo; means, not the state of
      uncircumcision, but the contempt of the Egyptians so forcibly
      expressed in Exod. xxxii. 12, Num. Xiv. 13-16. As for the
      &ldquo; knives of stone &rdquo; (comp. Josh. xxiv. 31,
      Sept.), on which Ebers has laid some stress, such implements
      are not distinctively Egyptian, if they were even employed at
      all by the Egyptians for the purpose of circumcision. It is
      true that Herodotus (ii. 104, comp. Diod. Sic., i. 28)
      asserts the Egyptian origin of circumcision to have been
      admitted in Palestine, but he is probably right on so far as
      the Ph&oelig;nicians or Canaanites are concerned.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II. We may now proceed
      to consider circumcision from an ethnographical point of
      view. It was not a specially Semitic rite, being only known
      to the southern and western Semites, who probably derived it
      directly or indirectly from the Egyptians, if not from some
      entirely non-Semitic source. Though not referred to in the
      Koran, it was a primitive Arabian custom to circumcise youths
      at their entrance on puberty (i.e., between their tenth and
      fifteenth year), as appears not only from Gen. xvii. 25, Jos.
      <i>Antiq.</i>, i. 12, 2, but from the express statement of
      Ibn-al-Athir (quoted by Pococke, <i>Specimen Hist.
      Arabum</i>, p. 319), which is confirmed by a remarkable
      passage in the life of the old Arabian poet Dh&ucirc;-l-isba
      (<i>Zeitschr. F. d. Kunde des Morgenlandes</i>, iii. 230).
      From Arabia it was carried by the preachers of Islam to
      Persia, India, and Turkey ; from Arabia, too, as we have
      seen, it probably came in remote times to the Israelites. The
      circumcision of the Ph&oelig;nicians or Canaanites has been
      disputed, but is attested by Herodotus (ii. 104), and is
      confirmed by the story in Gen. xxxiv., as also by the fact
      that the term of contempt, &ldquo;the uncircumcised,&rdquo;
      is reserved in the Old Testament for the Philistines. The
      rite seem, however, to have fallen into disuse in later times
      in Ph&oelig;nicia as well as in Egypt ( Dr Ebers refers to
      the uncircumcised figures on the stele of Pianchi, comp. also
      Herod. <i>L. c.</i>, Jos. <i>Antiq.</i>, viii. 10, 3,
      <i>Contr. Ap.</i> i. 22, and perhaps Ezek, xxxii. 24, 30),
      which may partly account for its being afterwards regarded as
      distinctive of the Jews. The Egyptians, too, were
      circumcised, and that prior to the immigration of the Hebrews
      (Wilkinson), as appears from the representations on the very
      earliest monuments. The most striking of these is the sceneon
      a bas-relief discovered in the temple of Chunsu at Karnak, a
      drawing of which is given by M. Chabas and Dr. Ebers. Their
      age, says Dr Ebers, must be between six and ten, which agrees
      with the present custom in Egypt, where, as Mr Lane tells us,
      circumcision is generally performed in the fifth or sixth
      year, though often postponed by peasants to the twelfth,
      thirteenth, or even fourteenth year (<i>Modern Egyptians</i>,
      i. 71). It has often been asserted that only the priests
      underwent the operation, but there is no earlier evidence for
      this than that of Origen (ed. Lommatzsch, iv. 138), in whose
      time it is quite possible that the Egyptians, like the later
      Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity which exposed them to
      ridicule and contempt.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the rite of
      circumcision is known among nations which cannot be suspected
      of communication with Egypt. Similar causes produce similar
      effects all the world over. It was in use in some form among
      the ancient civilized peoples of Central America, though this
      is better attested of the Nahua branch (including the Aztecs)
      than of the Maya (Bancroft, <i>Native Races</i>, vol. iii.)
      It is still kept up among the Teamas and Manaos on the Amazon
      ; also among three different races in the South Seas, among
      most of the tribes of Australia, among the Papuans, the New
      Caledonians, and the inhabitants of the New Hebrides. It is
      widely spread in Africa, especially among the Kaffir tribes.
      Among the Bechuanas the boys who are circumcised form a sort
      of society, for which among other reasons, Waltz conjectures
      that the Bechuanas communicated the rite to the other
      Kaffirs. Prichard (<i>Physical History of Mankind</i>, ii.
      287) rightly dismisses the idea that the Kaffirs borrowed the
      rite from Mahometan nations, though the progress of Islam
      will help to account for its prevalence in other parts of
      Africa.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III. Very different
      views were held in antiquity as to the meaning of the rite of
      circumcision. There was a myth common to Egypt and
      Ph&oelig;nicia, though not of very ancient date in its extant
      Egyptian form, which seems to bring circumcision into
      connection with the Sun-god. In the <i>Book of the Dead</i>,
      chap. Xvii., we read of the &ldquo; blood which proceeded
      from the limb of the god Ra, when he wished to cut
      himself,&rdquo; which the late Vicomte de Roug&eacute;
      interpreted, with much plausibility, of circumcision
      (<i>Revue arch&eacute;ologique</i>, nouveau s&eacute;rie, i.
      244). And in a fragment of the Philonian Sanchoniathon
      (<i>Fragmenta Historicorum Gr&oelig;corum</i>, ed.
      M&uuml;ller, iii, 568, 569), we find a similar tale of El
      circumcising his father Uranos, or, according to another
      version, himself, and the blood flowing into the springs and
      rivers. Space forbids us to discuss the bearings of this
      myth. Herodotus (ii. 37) ascribes the Egyptian custom to the
      motive of cleanliness (<font
      size="2"><i>&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&tau;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;
      &epsilon;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;</i></font>) This
      is also one of the four causes reported on the authority of
      tradition by Philo the Jew (<i>Opera</i>, ed. Mangey, ii.
      210), the three others being avoidance of carbuncle, the
      symbolizing of purity of heart, and the attainment of
      numerous offspring. Mere cleanliness, however, seems hardly
      an adequate motive for the practice. Sanitary reasons seem
      much more probable, judging from the well-ascertained
      physical advantages of circumcision to the Jewish race. But
      even this is not a complete explanation. Why was the practice
      adopted by some nations and not others ? The most scientific
      theory is that which refers it to a religious instinct common
      to all nations, though not always expressing itself in the
      same way, and this seems to be at least obscurely indicated
      by the tradition of the Israelites. The prophet Jeremiah (ix.
      25,26), too puts it in the same class with cutting off of the
      hair (comp. Herod. iii. 8), which, like other bodily
      mutilations, has been shown to be of the nature of a
      representative sacrifice (Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive
      Culture</i>, ii. 363, 364). The principle of substitution was
      familiar to all ancient nations, and not least to the
      Israelites. Witness the story of Gen. xxii., the pascal lamb,
      and the redemption of the first-born by an offering (Exod.
      xiii. 11-16), and compare the similar phrase ascribed to Saul
      in 1 Sam. xviii. 25. On this principle circumcision was an
      economical recognition of the divine ownership of human life,
      a part of the body being sacrificed to preserve the
      remainder. But it was more than this ; otherwise it would
      scarcely have asserted its claim to existence among the Jews,
      when all other mutilations were strictly forbidden as
      heathenish (Lev. xix. 27, xxi. 25). It can scarcely be
      doubted that it was a sacrifice to the awful power upon whom
      the fruit of the womb depended, and having once fixed itself
      in the minds of the people, neither priest nor prophet could
      eradicate it. All that these could do was to spiritualize it
      into a symbol of devotion to a high religious ideal (comp.
      Jer. iv. 4 ; Deut. x. 16 ; Jer. ix. 25).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, we must
      briefly refer to an analogous rite, of which women are in
      many countries the subjects. It is said to consist in
      mutilation of the clitoris, which is sometimes connected with
      the degrading practice of infibulation. It was prevalent at
      the time of Strabo (pp. 771, 824) in Arabia and in Egypt,
      and, as Mr Lane attests, is still native to those regions
      (<i>Modern Egyptians</i>, i. 73, <i>Arabic Lexicon</i>, s.v.
      &ldquo;hafada&rdquo;). Carsten Niebuhr heard that it was
      practised on both shores of the Persian Gulf, and at Baghdad
      (<i>Description de l&rsquo;Arabie</i>, p. 70). It appears in
      some parts of West Africa, e.g., Dahomey, but it is said to
      be still more common in the eastern part of that
      continent.</p>
