        The mutilation of the genitals among the various savage
        tribes of the world presents a strange and unaccountable
        practice of human ideas, which one is not able to reconcile
        with any reasoning power. Why such customs should be in
        vogue none can tell at the present time; but we must
        suppose that at some period they had their significance,
        which in the course of ages has been lost, and the practice
        has been handed down from generation to generation.

        The operation of circumcision is one which may be performed
        for moral reasons; one which is demanded for hygienic
        purposes; one which is frequently necessary for
        pathological conditions; and, finally, one which is of
        unquestionably prophylactic importance.

      </ul>

      <p class="text1">Since the early years of the twentieth
      century, neonatal circumcision has been the most frequently
      performed surgery in the United States. For generations in
      fact the operation became so commonplace that physicians and
      parents scarcely considered it surgery at all. By all
      indications, the procedure was done with little thought, as
      though it were simply a routine of childbirth like cutting an
      infant's umbilical cord. Yet in this respect America differs
      remarkably from Western Europe and, for that matter, from the
      rest of the world where circumcision generally has remained
      either a religious ritual or an infrequent medical
      intervention to treat specific diseases. [<a id="cite2"
      name="cite2" href="#ref2">2</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">How did a ritual surgery, older than
      civilization itself, become firmly enshrined in standard
      American medical practice? And how has an operation whose
      benefits have never been conclusively verified (although they
      continue to be hotly debated) managed to survive down to this
      day? [<a id="cite3" name="cite3" href="#ref3">3</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The medical history of circumcision in the
      United States properly begins in New York on 9 February 1870.
      That morning Dr. Lewis A. Sayre was summoned by a colleague,
      the eminent New York gynecologist James Marion Sims, to
      consult on a perplexing case. "Please let me know at what
      hour you can come to my house to see the son of Mr. M_____,
      of Milwaukee," Sims wrote. "The little fellow has a pair of
      legs that you would walk miles to see." Sayre was at the time
      America's leading orthopedic surgeon, a renowned teacher and
      scholar, an authority on the anatomy of bones, joints, and
      muscles. Intrigued by the prospect of seeing some rare
      musculoskeletal pathology, he dropped what he was doing and
      went at once. When he arrived, Sayre encountered "a most
      beautiful little boy of five years of age, but exceedingly
      white and delicate in his appearance, unable to walk without
      assistance or stand erect, his knees being flexed at about an
      angle of 45 degrees." Sims, it turned out, had called him in
      to perform a tenotomy, the desperate remedy of severing the
      child's hamstring tendons. [<a id="cite4" name="cite4"
      href="#ref4">4</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">After he examined the patient though, Sayre
      concluded that "the deformity was due to <i>paralysis</i> and
      not <i>contraction</i>, and it was therefore <i>necessary to
      restore vitality to the partially paralyzed extensor muscles,
      rather than to cut the apparently contracted flexors</i>."
      But the cause of this paralysis was a mystery. There was no
      history of injury and seemed to be no other symptoms of
      disease. Puzzled and determined to trace the problem to its
      source, he finally decided to test the boy's reflexes by
      applying electric current to his legs. While he was doing
      this, the child's nurse exclaimed, "Oh, doctor! be very
      careful - don't touch his pee-pee - it's very sore." An
      examination of the patient's genitals showed that the penis
      was normal, except that "the glans was very small and
      pointed, tightly imprisoned in the contracted foreskin, and
      in its efforts to escape, the meatus urinarius had become as
      puffed out and red as in a case of severe granular
      urethritis." This was, according to the nurse, a chronic
      condition. Often the pain awaked him at night, the child's
      genitals having become so sensitive that even the slight
      friction of bedclothes caused painful erections. Pondering
      this information, Sayre suddenly imagined that he knew the
      source of the boy's problem. "As excessive venery is a
      fruitful source of physical prostration and nervous
      exhaustion, sometimes producing paralysis," he explained
      afterward, "I was disposed to look upon this case in the same
      light, and recommended circumcision as a means of relieving
      the irritated and imprisoned penis." [<a id="cite5"
      name="cite5" href="#ref5">5</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">He was so confident of his diagnosis that he
      brought the boy to Bellevue Hospital in order to demonstrate
      the operation to his students there. The following day, after
      the patient was anesthetized, Sayre drew the foreskin forward
      and cut it with scissors. To his surprise, "the mucous
      portion [remained] quite firmly adherent to the glans nearly
      to the orifice of the urethra." So he finished the procedure
      by "seizing the thickened mucous membrane with the thumbs and
      finger nails of each hand" and tearing it away from the
      glans. Whatever it may have lacked in elegance, this
      operation seemed to produce a wonderful result. From the
      first day, the child's health began to improve. Color
      returned to his cheeks. Soon he regained his appetite, slept
      soundly and, most remarkable of all, within a few weeks "was
      able to walk with his limbs quite straight." Improbable as it
      seemed, Sayre postulated that "simply quieting his nervous
      system by relieving his imprisoned glans penis" circumcision
      had restored the young patient's health. [<a id="cite6"
      name="cite6" href="#ref6">6</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">While the five-year old was recuperating,
      the surgeon tried a similar experiment on the
      partially-paralyzed son of a prominent New York attorney.
      This boy was in his teens. For over a year Sayre had treated
      his paralysis with electricity, had "injected strychnia into
      the paralyzed muscles every tenth day," and had dosed him
      with iron and other tonics. Yet nothing had worked. Now,
      inspired by his new theory, Sayre recommended trying
      circumcision in this case as well. The worried father, who
      confided suspicion that his son "was guilty of masturbation,"
      agreed without hesitation. Once again the outcome was
      marvelous. Within a few weeks of the operation, Sayre
      reported, every symptom of paralysis vanished and the lad's
      general health improved so dramatically that "his most
      intimate friends scarcely recognize him." [<a id="cite7"
      name="cite7" href="#ref7">7</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">In the months that followed, Sayre
      hypothesized that irritation of the genitals was the source
      of many varieties of paralysis and hip-joint disease which
      stubbornly defied conventional treatments. In April 1870 he
      proceeded to treat three young boys who had crippling hip
      problems by detaching the foreskin from the glans penis.
      "This slight operation," he wrote, "answered all the purposes
      of circumcision, and at once quieted their nervous
      irritability." Shortly thereafter, with an evident sense of
      discovery and excitement, he published his findings in the
      <i>Transactions of the American Medical Association</i>,
      certain that he had unlocked the secret of a host of ills.
      "Many of the cases of irritable children, with restless
      sleep, and bad digestion, which are often attributed to
      worms, is [sic] solely due to the irritation of the nervous
      system caused by an adherent or constricted prepuce," Sayre
      asserted. "Hernia and inflammation of the bladder can also be
      produced by the severe straining to pass water in some of
      these cases of contracted prepuce." Up until now, he told his
      fellow physicians, standard medical texts had largely ignored
      genital deformities and the debilitating irritation they
      caused. "Satisfied that attention of the profession has never
      been sufficiently directed to it," he said, "I have thought
      it advisable to lay before the Association the above narrated
      facts, in order to attract attention to the subject." [<a
      id="cite8" name="cite8" href="#ref8">8</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">As it turns out, his findings were not
      entirely original. Five years earlier an English doctor named
      Nathaniel Heckford had published <i>Circumcision as a
      Remedial Measure in Certain Cases of Epilepsy, Chorea,
      etc.</i> (1865). This pamphlet stemmed from his work at the
      East London Hospital for Children (an institution he founded)
      where he conducted surgical experiments similar to Sayre's
      several years later. But Heckford attracted scant attention
      in England, his paper was not published in America, and it
      remains unclear whether or not Sayre ever read it.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sayre's work, on the other hand, sparked a
      great deal of interest. This was a tribute not only to its
      surprising conclusion, but also to its author's eminence and
      energy. "He was philanthropist and missionary as well as
      surgeon," remarked an early historian of orthopedic surgery.
      A man who proudly traced his ancestry directly back to the
      Mayflower, Sayre had in 1853, at age thirty-three, been
      appointed surgeon to Bellevue Hospital. There he rapidly made
      a name for himself. In 1859 his responsibilities expanded to
      include the New York City Lunatic Hospital on Blackwell's
      Island. When the Civil War broke out, the mayor named him
      resident physician for New York City, an office in which he
      campaigned for sanitary reforms, including inspection of
      tenement housing, proper sewage disposal, and compulsory
      smallpox vaccination. In 1866 he was the official who ordered
      the steamer <i>Atlanta</i> quarantined in New York Harbor
      after hearing reports that cholera had broken out on board.
      Working with the Metropolitan Board of Health, he was
      credited with helping prevent a recurrence of the devastating
      cholera epidemic of 1849. His professorship at Bellevue
      Medical College was the first chair in orthopedic surgery in
      the United States, and he used it as a platform for
      innovation. To treat spondylitis and scoliosis, for example,
      he designed a plaster-of-Paris body-caste for straightening
      the spine. His <i>Lectures on Orthopedic Surgery and Disease
      of the Joints</i> (1876), based on his teaching at Bellevue,
      went through a dozen editions, comprising the standard
      reference for a generation of surgeons. He was a born
      organizer: the prime mover in the New York Pathological
      Society; an officer of the New York Academy of Medicine; and
      in 1866 vice president of the fledgling American Medical
      Association (AMA). In honor of his indefatigable striving on
      behalf of their profession, in 1880 the medical elite elected
      Lewis Sayre president of the AMA. Among his lasting
      professional contributions was Sayre's push to upgrade the
      organization's published transactions, which he christened
      the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association.</i> [<a
      id="cite9" name="cite9" href="#ref9">9</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">When a man of Sayre's experience,
      reputation, and professional standing insisted that serious
      orthopedic disease could be cured by a comparatively simple
      operation on the foreskin, the medical world was prepared to
      take him seriously.</p>

      <p class="text2">For the better part of three decades, until
      his death in 1900, he continued zealously to promote
      circumcision, discovering an amazingly wide array of benefits
      connected with the operation. Not only orthopedic problems,
      but epilepsy, hernia, and even lunacy appeared to respond. In
      1875 he issued a pamphlet, <i>Spinal Anemia with Partial
      Paralysis and Want of Co-operation from Irritation of the
      Genital Organs</i>, in which he proposed that "peripheral
      irritation" from the foreskin could produce "an insanity of
      the muscles," the muscles acting "on their own account,
      involuntarily... without the controlling power of the
      person's brain." [<a id="cite10" name="cite10"
      href="#ref10">10</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">To prove this point, he recounted the case
      of an eighteen-month-old boy who was to all appearances "like
      a lunatic, an insane child," crying constantly, sleeping only
      when dosed with laudanum or morphine. The result of
      circumcising him was, Sayre boasted, "almost a miracle; it is
      beyond the power of man to comprehend it unless you see these
      cases from the start." Hoping that he had found a cure for
      certain forms of mental disorder - the most elusive of
      illnesses - Sayre made several expeditions to the Manhattan
      State Hospital's Idiot Asylum on Randall's Island where he
      "carefully examined the external genitals of sixty-seven
      children, operating on a number of them." Afterward he was
      convinced that some boys' mental symptoms improved, but his
      surgical experiment ended in frustration. No patient
      recovered enough to be discharged from the asylum. [<a
      id="cite11" name="cite11" href="#ref11">11</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Occasional setbacks did not dampen Sayre's
      enthusiasm though. It is a measure of the signal importance
      he attached to this work that, as AMA delegate to the great
      1876 International Medical Congress in Philadelphia he
      supplemented his brilliant demonstration of hip-joint
      excision (of which Joseph Lister exclaimed that "this
      demonstration would of itself have been a sufficient reward
      for my voyage across the Atlantic") by delivering a long
      paper "On the Deleterious Results of a Narrow Prepuce and
      Preputial Adhesion." [<a id="cite12" name="cite12"
      href="#ref12">12</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Sayre developed his argument for
      circumcision during a period of dauntless surgical
      experimentation on the genitalia of both sexes. Reflex
      neurosis - the theory that there was an intricate web of
      nervous affinity running through the spine to every organ of
      the body and that, in turn, each organ had its own sphere of
      influence on physical and mental health - was the technical
      concept behind the vogue of sexual surgery. This idea rested
      on a theory of "irritation" whose roots lay in the eighteenth
      century: a mechanistic view of the body, and especially the
      nervous system, which attributed many diseases to
      pathological agitation of tissues and, later, of cells.
      Taking the theory to its extreme, Rudolf Virchow, the father
      of cell biology, suggested that irritation was the hidden
      cause of malignant growth of cells. At bottom, doctors found
      theories of irritation and reflex neurosis appealing because
      they suggested that inexplicable mental disorders and other
      baffling syndromes like neurasthenia had a discrete somatic
      basis. This opened up therapeutic possibilities. If
      irritation could be traced to its source, presumably it could
      also be eradicated. [<a id="cite13" name="cite13"
      href="#ref13">13</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Inspired by reflex theory, beginning in the
      early 1870s American gynecologists, led by James Marion Sims,
      invented scores of new genital surgeries intended to
      alleviate psychological symptoms. Cutting the body to cure
      the mind could lead to frightening practices. Robert Battey,
      a young Georgia surgeon, for instance, lent his name to the
      so-called "normal ovariotomy." With no apparent misgivings,
      he removed women's healthy ovaries to relieve symptoms
      ranging from hysteria and neurasthenia to backache. Accepted
      on both sides of the Atlantic, Battey's operation was
      especially popular in America where, according to one
      scholar, it "was not a marginal procedure conducted by a
      handful of crackpots, but central in the arsenal of
      late-nineteenth-century gynecology." [<a id="cite14"
      name="cite14" href="#ref14">14</a>] Other doctors (including
      Sayre himself) revived the mutilating procedure of
      clitoridectomy, with the clitoris subjected to a variety of
      surgeries, manipulations, and chemical preparations. These
      practices were sustained in America long after they had
      fallen out of favor in Europe. [<a id="cite15" name="cite15"
      href="#ref15">15</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">On the level of theory, reflex neurosis
      applied both to males and females. Both sexes were thought to
      be subject to organic disturbances, including pelvic or
      genital irritations, which might portend dire consequences
      for body and mind. But in practice, surgery in males to
      suppress sexual function was comparatively rare. While it
      seemed permissible for male surgeons to use the scalpel
      heroically on women's pelvic organs, undeterred by the
      prospect of "unsexing" their patients, few performed
      castration unless they confirmed symptoms of life-threatening
      disease. Even if they had tried to expand sexual surgery on
      males, there is no reason to suppose that physicians could
      have overridden men's objections. Clearly, in an age prone to
      denigrate female sexuality, they found women more pliable
      when it came to the dictates of medical authority.</p>

      <p class="text2">What is notable in retrospect, though, is
      that while female sexual surgery gradually declined, male
      circumcision eventually became standard practice. Moreover,
      procedures like clitoridectomy and "normal ovariotomy," even
      in the days of their greatest acceptance, were performed on a
      small minority of American women. Yet circumcision, quietly
      democratized in the last decade of the nineteenth century,
      was subsequently extended to a majority of the male
      population. The operation's first medical advocates were
      physicians who followed the logic and example of Lewis Sayre;
      but these men were succeeded by others who insisted that
      performing the surgery was salubrious and appropriate even on
      patients who exhibited no symptoms of disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before the 1870s the primary medical
      indications for circumcision were cancerous lesions and
      phimosis, an abnormal constriction or tightening of the
      foreskin interfering with normal function. The rationale for
      surgery to remove diseased tissue or to relieve acute
      inflammation caused by phimosis was self-evident. Cases of
      phimosis severe enough to require surgery were uncommon
      though, and down through the ages it was considered a rare
      affliction. Before the 1870s, medical textbooks and journals,
      when they mentioned the subject at all, passed over it
      cursorily.</p>

      <p class="text2">What Sayre did was to train physicians to
      look for genital irritation or phimosis when they were
      confronted by confusing, seemingly unrelated, symptoms.
      Before he sounded the alarm, wrote a leading Georgia surgeon,
      "<i>congenital phimosis</i> and <i>adherent prepuce</i>, as a
      cause of paralysis, reflex muscular contraction, curvature of
      the spine and acquired deformity, escaped the notice of the
      profession." Traditionally, doctors had described phimosis a
      <i>local</i> ailment. Sayre, on the other hand, characterized
      it as <i>systemic</i>: a perpetual state of excitement,
      erection, and nervous irritation radiating throughout the
      body. As the first doctor to formulate this original theory,
      according to his peers, Sayre deserved "the credit of waking
      the profession up upon this condition of the genital
      apparatus." Once he had established "the reflex nervous
      consequences of genital irritation," noted an admiring
      editorial in the <i>Louisville Medical News</i>, physicians
      around the country quickly confirmed his observations with
      "facts of a similar bearing" taken from cases of their own.
      [<a id="cite16" name="cite16" href="#ref16">16</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">So one Louisville doctor, unable to do
      anything to relieve an infant's spasms and high fever,
      circumcised him. Two days later the baby recovered. In
      another case, E. P. Hurd reported examining a five-month-old
      who suffered from whooping cough, chronic crying, and
      unexplained weight loss. Upon finding that "our infantile
      sufferer revealed a sadly neglected phimosis," Hurd cut away
      his foreskin, a procedure whose delicacy he likened to
      resecting "the femur of a grasshopper." Before the operation,
      the baby's urine had contained "a copious sediment of uric
      acid [and] crystalline structures." Afterward this lithuria
      disappeared, leading Hurd to conclude that irritation from
      the foreskin must have been impairing renal function. [<a
      id="cite17" name="cite17" href="#ref17">17</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">As doctors identified a growing list of
      maladies as results of "phimosis and adherent prepuce," they
      drifted into a patern of using these terms expansively. Part
      of the problem was that, except at the extremes, there were
      no clear guidelines for distinguishing what was normal from
      what was abnormal and potentially pathological. In a typical
      passage, Norman H. Chapman, a disciple of Sayre's who served
      as professor of nervous and mental disease at the University
      of Kansas City, suggested that while no one had tabulated the
      incidence of congenital phimosis as a percentage of all male
      births, it was bound to be much higher than people realized.
      At any rate, he continued, since "a long and contracted
      foreskin" was so often a source of "secondary
      complications... it is always good surgery to correct this
      deformity... as a precautionary measure, even though no
      symptoms have as yet presented themselves." In this regard,
      Christians stood to learn something from Jews. "Moses was a
      good sanitarian," Chapman observed, "and if circumcision was
      more generally practised at the present day, I believe that
      we would hear far less of the pollutions and indiscretions of
      youth; and that our daily papers would not be so profusely
      flooded with all kinds of sure cures for loss of manhood."
      [<a id="cite18" name="cite18" href="#ref18">18</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Chapman's language captures an important
      transition in thought. Here was a physician arguing for
      circumcision not exclusively as a means of alleviating reflex
      irritation, but as a preventive, hygienic measure. New
      grounds for the procedure were important if it were to gain
      wider acceptance, because reflex theory, long suspect in some
      circles, fell under increasing assault. Indeed, as early as
      1881, in a direct attack on Sayre, a Brooklyn doctor named
      Langdon C. Gray read a paper to the New York Neurological
      Society in which he flatly stated that "in not one of the
      cases of reflex paralysis supposed to be dependent upon
      genital irritation, which have thus far been published, is
      there conclusive proof of this relation of cause and effect."
      Implicitly, however, even a physician who had misgivings
      about reflex theory might still endorse circumcision as a
      sanitary reform. [<a id="cite19" name="cite19"
      href="#ref19">19</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">This was precisely the attitude of doctors
      like J. M. McGee. Enthusiastic after first reading Sayre's
      articles, he had tried to achieve similar results with
      paralyzed children in his own practice. To his dismay,
      though, circumcision was to no avail and his efforts ended in
      "a sad disappointment." Nevertheless, in the further trials
      of the operation he found that circumcision had serendipitous
      effects. A boy with a bad case "of tubercular meningitis was
      temporarily rendered less irritable, slept better, etc. One
      of myetitis, involving the anterior cornu, showed 'marked
      improvement.' One of <i>brass poisoning</i> completely
      cured!" McGee frankly confessed his inability to fathom how
      amputating the foreskin could relieve these diverse
      conditions. Yet in the final analysis, he resolved:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>whether it be curative or not it is conservative, and
        removes one source of irritation from an exquisitely
        sensitive organ. I would favor circumcision, however,
        independent of existing disease, as a sanitary
        precaution.... (1.) The exposure of the glans to friction,
        etc., hardens it, and renders it less liable to abrasion in
        sexual intercourse, and consequently venereal ulcer. (2.)
        It is acknowledged to be useful as a preventive of
        masturbation. (3.) It certainly renders the accident of
        phymosis and paraphymosis impossible. (4.) It prevents the
        retention of sebaceous secretion and consequent balanitis.
        (5.) It probably promotes continence by diminishing the
        pruriency of the sexual appetite. And its performance
        surely settles forever the question of reflex trouble as to
        that particular cause. [<a id="cite20" name="cite20"
        href="#ref20">20</a>]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The phrase "sanitary precaution," as used in
      this passage, intermingles a variety of physical and, more
      significantly, moral, social, and cultural values. One
      approach to unravelling these connotations has been suggested
      by the historical study of manners, habits, and personal
      comportment. Inspired by Norbert Elias's groundbreaking
      <i>Ueber den Prozess der Zivilisation</i> (1939; translated
      into English as <i>The Civilizing Process</i> in 1978),
      scholars like Lawrence Wright and Richard L. Bushman have
      endeavored to track the development and explain the
      significance of behavior so commonplace - spitting, farting,
      bathing, and so forth - that it has scarcely seemed
      historically significant. Cleanliness is of particular
      interest because, while sanitary reform as public health has
      been studied extensively, sanitary reform on the personal
      level has received less attention. Yet just as
      nineteenth-century Americans participated in major efforts to
      clean up the urban environment, they also radically changed
      their standards of personal cleanliness. During the course of
      the century, as Richard and Claudia Bushman have shown,
      taking baths "went from being an occasional and haphazard
      routine of a small segment of the population to a regular
      practice of the large bulk of the people." The main impetus
      for changes in habits of bathing derived from a deep-seated
      cultural transformation, they suggest, above all a yearning
      for gentility. Washing with soap, brushing one's hair,
      clipping nails, and other acts of personal cleaning and
      grooming slowly came to exemplify superior cultivation,
      literally separating the washed from the unwashed. [<a
      id="cite21" name="cite21" href="#ref21">21</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Americans gave a new twist to John Wesley's
      famous saying that cleanliness is next to godliness.
      Increasingly they identified personal cleanliness with good
      morals, sound health, and upright character. So the Victorian
      moralist William A. Alcott admonished his readers "that he
      who neglects his person and dress will be found lower in the
      scale of morals, other things being equal, than he who pays a
      due regard to cleanliness." [<a id="cite22" name="cite22"
      href="#ref22">22</a>] The same argument could be applied
      broadly. During the later Victorian period, an age obsessed
      with racial and social hierarchies, there was an allure to
      ranking civilizations, peoples, and social groups from clean
      to dirty. Used increasingly by the middle class as a caliper
      of moral judgment and evidence of material prosperity,
      "cleanliness indicated control, spiritual refinement,
      breeding; the unclean were vulgar, coarse, animalistic.
      Cleanliness, in other words, became an essential criterion of
      social respectability. Dirt was seen as a moral, and thus a
      social, hazard whose dangers people would strive assiduously
      to avoid. [<a id="cite23" name="cite23"
      href="#ref23">23</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The changing cultural significance of
      cleanliness provides a context for understanding the popular
      acceptance of circumcision; but it does not explain why, if
      people were newly attentive to genital hygiene, in this
      instance surgery replaced soap and water. Most other
      industrial nations, at different times, underwent
      transformations in personal cleanliness without resorting to
      routine circumcision. In most Western European nations better
      standards of cleanliness called merely for washing more
      thoroughly and more often. What happened in America (and to a
      large degree in England, where Sayre also lectured,
      published, and was in 1877 decorated by the British Medical
      Association) revolved around a profound reconsideration of
      what was clean and what was dirty.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recently there has been growing debate among
      historians of medicine about the ideas and activities that
      defined public health at the turn of the twentieth century.
      In Paul Starr's view, for example, this period was a
      watershed. He described it as a time when the focus of health
      shifted from the environment to the individual, from the
      prerogative of public health laymen to physicians who, in
      turn, became ever more specialized. As for the authority and
      prestige of the medical profession, the theory that diseases
      were spread by microbes was a godsend. For it implied that
      only the specialized training of physicians equipped a person
      to master the wonders of the invisible realm of bacteriology.
      Anxious about the status of their profession and eager to
      build their private practices, this argument goes, physicians
      in the 1890s displayed declining enthusiasm for conventional,
      environmentally-based public health activities. [<a
      id="cite24" name="cite24" href="#ref24">24</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Evidence from newer studies, however,
      suggests that there was not a smooth transition at all. Germ
      theory, at least as far as clinical practice was concerned,
      appears to have caused a great deal of confusion within the
      medical community. In the first place, few doctors had enough
      scientific training to understand the new theory. And even
      those who did had little understanding of how to apply it to
      individual patients. The history of physicians' responses to
      the violent epidemic of polio that swept the country just
      before World War I is a history of intellectual bafflement
      and chaos in the face of danger. Although the virus and its
      means of transmission were not understood, public health
      officials were determined to act forcefully. So they patched
      together policies based on sanitation, personal hygiene, and
      quarantine of infected patients. Bewildered by a mysterious
      disease, doctors relied on whatever tools were at hand,
      seldom stopping to ascertain whether or not their methods
      were efficacious. [<a id="cite25" name="cite25"
      href="#ref25">25</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Surgery was the most potent weapon in the
      medical armamentarium, and it found a new and important role
      in public health. With characteristic zeal, for example,
      Rhode Island health official Charles V. Chapin reminded his
      colleagues of the potential epidemiological benefits of the
      operations they performed. If doctors wanted to inhibit the
      spread of childhood diseases, he announced, it was "more
      important to remove adenoids from the child than it is to
      remove ashes from the back yard." As though acting on
      Chapin's suggestion, public health physicians in New York
      briefly tried performing cholecystectomies on carriers of
      typhoid fever, surgically removing the organ thought to carry
      the infectious bacteria. [<a id="cite26" name="cite26"
      href="#ref26">26</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">For many laymen and physicians, germ theory
      elicited an image of the human body as a conveyance for all
      manner of dangerous microbes. Germ phobia helps explain why,
      at the end of the century, one sees a popular fixation on the
      dirt associated with the bodily functions of human beings:
      their excrement, urine, blood, pus, and other secretions.
      Owing to their function, even in a healthy state genital
      organs were closely identified with "dirty" waste products of
      the body. Accordingly, they were often found dirty by
      association, a prejudice betrayed in the words physicians
      chose for describing genitalia. Beginning sometime around
      1890 medical writers adopted the habit of portraying the
      penis as though it were intrinsically a source of
      contamination. Using a term that had formerly been reserved
      for contagious diseases, for instance, a St. Louis physician
      named Jonathan Young Brown went so far as to label smegma
      "infectious material" [<a id="cite27" name="cite27"
      href="#ref27">27</a>] (Ironically, Brown appears not to have
      realized that the word "smegma" derived from Greek and Latin
      words for cleansing and soap.) From this premise it followed
      that circumcision should be considered preventive medicine
      and practiced universally as a matter of public health.</p>

      <p class="text2">At the end of the nineteenth century the
      most strident champion of universal circumcision was a
      physician and public health official named <a
      href="http://sandiegohistory.org/bio/remondino/remondino.htm">
      Peter Charles Remondino</a>. Like Lewis Sayre, he was an
      activist within his profession - vice president of the
      California Medical Society, and an official of the Southern
      California chapter of American Public Health Association. In
      the early 1880s he ran across Sayre, whom he celebrated as
      "the Columbus of the prepuce," the scientific explorer who
      charted "this territory [which] Hippocrates and Galen
      overlooked." Fascinated by the simplicity of an operation
      seemingly so rich in benefit, and determined to carry the
      good news to a wider audience, Remondino spent the next
      several years scouring libraries to research his magnum opus,
      <i>History of Circumcision</i>. Despite its title the book
      offers much less history than polemic. The author knew full
      well that patients willingly submitted to surgery in cases of
      injury or distress; "but such a thing as surgery to remedy a
      seemingly medical disease," he wrote, "or what might be
      called the preventive practice of surgery, is something they
      cannot understand." He intended to change their minds. Thus,
      for more than three hundred closely-printed pages, he
      ransacked world history, piling up evidence, as he put it,
      "to furnish my professional brothers with some embodied facts
      that they may use in convincing the laity... that
      circumcision is absolutely necessary." [<a id="cite28"
      name="cite28" href="#ref28">28</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">To a modern reader, Remondino's "facts"
      appear to be a rambling, slapdash collection of folklore,
      conjecture, opinion, and pseudo-science. Hardly more
      scrupulous a scientist than he was an historian, he had
      absorbed just enough of Darwin to infer that the foreskin was
      a primitive vestige of the evolutionary past. "With
      improvement in man's condition and his gradual evolution into
      a higher sphere," Remondino confidently insisted, "the
      prepuce became a superfluity." And a nefarious one at
      that.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The prepuce seems to exercise a malign influence in the
        most distant and apparently unconnected manner; where, like
        some of the evil genii or sprites in the Arabian tales, it
        can reach from afar the object of its malignity, striking
        him down unawares in the most unaccountable manner; making
        him a victim to all manner of ills, sufferings, and
        tribulations; unfitting him for marriage or the cares of
        business; making him miserable and an object of continual
        scolding and punishment in childhood, through its
        worriments and nocturnal enuresis; later on, beginning to
        affect him with all kinds of physical distortions and
        ailments, nocturnal pollutions, and other conditions
        calculated to weaken him physically, mentally, and morally;
        to land him, perchance, in jail or even in a lunatic
        asylum. Man's whole life is subject to the capricious
        dispensations and whims of this Job's-comforts-dispensing
        enemy of man.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Born with "this unyielding tube," he
      estimated, ninety-five percent of uncircumcised men suffered
      some degree of phimosis. Although he accepted Sayre's claims
      at face value, Remondino was prepared to go much farther,
      contending that the most common diseases associated with the
      foreskin were not matters of reflex neurosis at all. These
      included rheumatic disorders, asthma, Bright's disease and
      other renal infections, and more ominously, impotence,
      malignant epithelioma and syphilis. In light of these perils,
      he asserted, "life-insurance companies should class the
      wearer of the prepuce under the head of hazardous risks." [<a
      id="cite29" name="cite29" href="#ref29">29</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The connection between cancer and the
      foreskin had been a matter of concern for years. As early as
      1878, in his classic treatise on surgery, John Ashurst,
      Professor of Clinical Surgery at the University of
      Pennsylvania, had included among the dangers of phimosis
      increased susceptibility to venereal infections and
      "predispos[ition] to the development of malignant disease of
      the part." Among regular doctors in the 1880s and 1890s, the
      most popular theories of cancer held that inevitably it was
      "excited," as Sir Herbert Snow said, by "some continued
      mechanical irritant." Different organs of the body were
      susceptible to various irritants. Simple deduction seemed to
      indicate that venereal lesions like chancre presented
      convenient sites for cancerous irritation. By the end of the
      century, although no scientist had been able to trace a
      precise etiology, surgeons took it for granted that
      irritation from the foreskin was "a predisposing cause to
      epithelioma of the penis." [<a id="cite30" name="cite30"
      href="#ref30">30</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision as a safeguard against
      malignancies was an idea with considerable appeal, for, like
      their descendants a century later, Victorians were horrified
      by cancer. The awful public ordeal of General Ulysses S.
      Grant, who died from what his doctors called "an epithelioma"
      of the soft palate, transfixed the public and the medical
      community alike. Post-mortem analysis convinced Grant's
      physicians that his disease had been caused by irritation, in
      his case irritation in the mouth and throat from years of
      smoking cigars. Epithelioma, one of his doctors announced,
      "as a rule starts from local irritation, and unlike other
      forms of cancer, is not dependent upon hereditary disposition
      to the disease." Penile cancers were said to develop
      according to similar principles. Thus, in a world bereft of
      effective therapies, the finding that in many cases of penile
      cancer it had been demonstrated "conclusively that the
      prepuce is the inciting cause as well as the initial point of
      attack" became an influential argument to operate before
      disease struck." [<a id="cite31" name="cite31"
      href="#ref31">31</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Venereal infections, owing to their virulent
      contagiousness and social stigma, were feared nearly as much
      as cancer. Syphilis in particular raged out of control,
      seeming to approach epidemic proportions. During the 1880s
      and 1890s medical researchers made great strides in
      understanding the pathology of syphilis, and later gonorrhea.
      Therapeutics, however, lagged dismayingly behind. The virtues
      of chastity were widely celebrated in theory, but unpopular
      in practice. Into the early years of the twentieth century
      physicians continued to rely heavily on mercury to treat
      syphilis, employing a variety of treatments which
      systematically poisoned their patients. [<a id="cite32"
      name="cite32" href="#ref32">32</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Given how few weapons physicians possessed
      to fight venereal diseases, their hopes that circumcision
      might provide prophylaxis are understandable. In his treatise
      on surgery, John Ashurst observed that phimosis "apparently
      renders its subject more liable to various forms of venereal
      infection, and becomes a serious complication when venereal
      diseases are acquired." A Chicago surgeon, A. C. Williams,
      reported that of the more than 400 circumcisions he had
      performed, at least half had been done to cure genital
      herpes. "Many men who have herpes imagine they have syphilis,
      and with or without the advice of a physician take
      constitutional treatment," he wrote. "I would follow in the
      footsteps of Moses and circumcise all male children." J.
      Henry C. Simes, noting that venereal diseases were markedly
      less prevalent in Jews than gentiles, agreed. Circumcision,
      he reasoned, "causes the epithelial covering to become more
      of the nature of the skin rather than that of the mucous
      membrane," and therefore more resistant to venereal
      microorganisms. [<a id="cite33" name="cite33"
      href="#ref33">33</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">That circumcision prevented cancer and
      syphilis seemed to be born out by an epidemiological study of
      American Jews published in 1890 and summarized the following
      year in the venerable <i>North American Review</i>. "On the
      Vital Statistics of the Jews," written by the distinguished
      physician John S. Billings, brought to light statistics from
      the 1880 Census. "Death-rates of this race are lower, he
      observed, "they have fewer still-born children, greater
      average longevity, and [are] less liable to certain forms of
      disease than other races." Billings reported, for example,
      that the incidence of cancer among Jews was 6.48 per 1000
      compared to 10.01 per 1000 for the general population. Also,
      the "defective classes" - insane, idiots, epileptics -
      represented a comparatively tiny minority of Jews. Billings's
      work inspired other public health studies that confirmed low
      rates of morbidity, including syphilis as well as infectious
      diseases like diphtheria and tuberculosis, within Jewish
      communities, even among the poorest classes. [<a id="cite34"
      name="cite34" href="#ref34">34</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Searching for physiological reasons to
      explain why Jews were healthier than other ethnic groups, a
      number of physicians theorized that their lower morbidity and
      mortality reflected the benefits of circumcision. Above all,
      the incidence of penile epithelioma and syphilis among Jews
      was strikingly lower than among gentiles. [<a id="cite35"
      name="cite35" href="#ref35">35</a>] Jewish physicians, whose
      attitudes toward circumcision were partly shaped by their own
      cultural experience, found this evidence especially
      compelling. In addition, since Jews were disproportionately
      represented at the higher levels within medical societies and
      medical institutions, there was an influential minority of
      doctors who welcomed research that vindicated their religious
      customs. "Judaism has made religion the handmaid of science,"
      wrote a leading Jewish doctor and public health researcher.
      "It has utilized piety for the preservation of health." Many
      Jews must have wondered, though, when they read Remondino's
      assertion that circumcision "is the real cause of the
      differences in longevity and faculty for enjoyment of life
      that the Hebrew enjoys in contrast to his Christian brother."
      [<a id="cite36" name="cite36" href="#ref36">36</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Emulating an ancient Hebrew ritual, let
      alone a ritual that involved cutting the penis, might seem to
      have been a strange innovation for a nation as dedicated to
      its image as a Christian people as America was. But it was at
      this point that the medical profession began to draw a sharp
      distinction between ritual and medical circumcision. Starting
      in the early 1890s, as physicians were recommending and
      performing the operation more and more frequently as a
      neonatal routine, they mounted an attack on the Jewish rite
      of Berith Milah or Bris as primitive, unsanitary, and
      potentially dangerous. B. Merrill Ricketts, a Cincinnati
      surgeon who kept careful records of the hundreds of
      circumcisions he performed, quoted one of his fellow doctors
      who lamented the barbarism of "lower class" immigrants. "The
      orthodox Jews have the habit of taking the organ into their
      mouth," he wrote in disgust, "and sucking the blood after the
      operation has been performed." [<a id="cite37" name="cite37"
      href="#ref37">37</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Stories of repulsive ritual practices,
      occasional reports of infection, gangrene, tetanus in a
      Jewish infant who had been circumcised "in a very primitive
      manner," and even reflex irritation <i>caused</i> by a clumsy
      operation stirred a growing chorus of opposition within the
      medical establishment. The procedure should be performed
      "only by medical men and in a surgical manner," contended a
      leading New York physician. Poorly trained and ignorant of
      modern techniques, he wrote, ritual circumcisers frequently
      communicated tuberculosis, syphilis, and other contagious
      microbes to infants. In an effort to constrain irregular
      operators, Ohio doctors organized to introduce a bill into
      the state legislature which would have outlawed ritual
      circumcision entirely. Presumably because it violated the
      First Amendment, the measure never gained enough support to
      come to a vote. Still, in some quarters the prospect of
      regulation - which obviously had the potential to shift a
      good deal of business from unlicensed Mohels to regular
      Jewish physicians continued to hold a certain appeal. In New
      York, for example, Harry Levien proposed a state law
      requiring that "at each and every operation, a duly
      registered and practicing physician shall be present,...
      shall superintend the operation, and shall be the responsible
      party." [<a id="cite38" name="cite38"
      href="#ref38">38</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The aim of proposed restrictions was to make
      surgery safer, as one doctor urged, "by having the operation
      performed by a physician under antiseptic conditions." But
      talk of new laws prompted one prominent Jewish doctor to quip
      that circumcision had become "the b&ecirc;te noire of our
      progressive Hebrew physicians imbued with the spirit of
      Listerism." He insisted that in fact the Mohels were fully
      abreast of modern techniques, their "armamentarium not
      complete without a bottle of carbolic and a strip of idioform
      gauze." If infection were a problem anywhere, he added, "we
      venture to say that in the best modern hospitals, where
      Listerism is carried out in a most rigorous way, sepsis
      occurs a hundredfold more than in the small crowded room
      where the Mohel is surgeon-in-chief." Could the explanation
      be, he asked, that in contrast to most physicians, the Mohel
      was adept at cutting quickly and precisely, suppressing
      bleeding, and dressing the wound before infection had a
      chance to set in?" [<a id="cite39" name="cite39"
      href="#ref39">39</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">While squabbles over ritual circumcision
      gradually faded from the picture, the underlying issue they
      broached concerning the risk of the operation was virtually
      ignored. Occasionally voices were heard calling for
      restraint, but they were surprisingly rare. One doctor in
      Brooklyn, N. M. Shaffer, lashed out at "indiscriminate
      circumcision" performed on infants and children who presented
      no symptoms of disease. Sir Herbert Snow, a prominent London
      cancer surgeon, published a pamphlet which received some
      attention in America condemning "the barbarity of
      circumcision as a remedy for congenital abnormality." And in
      1894 an editorial in the New York <i>Medical Record</i>, the
      Medical Society's official publication, ventured the opinion
      that "circumcision is a relic of barbarous and semicivilized
      times, before soap and water and sanitation had been
      preached.... In these days physicians should cease to preach
      or to impose upon their patients an unnecessary and
      irrational mutilation." But these were distinctly minority
      opinions. Moreover, with the exception of one editorial even
      the <i>Medical Record</i> appears to have been solidly in
      favor of circumcision, publishing dozens of papers extolling
      the benefits of the operation and promoting new surgical
      techniques. [<a id="cite40" name="cite40"
      href="#ref40">40</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">In order to persuade healthy men to submit
      to having their foreskins cut off (or parents to make the
      decision on behalf of their children) surgeons needed to
      convince them that circumcision was a minor procedure,
      neither dangerous nor unduly painful. Two major advances, one
      theoretical and one technological, allowed this case to be
      argued with increasing plausibility.</p>

      <p class="text2">One of these was germ theory and the
      movement toward antisepsis and asepsis it fostered. Lister's
      original work on bacteria was published in the 1860s.
      Nevertheless, it took a generation for his insights,
      cautiously studied and refined by American doctors, to
      produce aseptic surgery. By 1890, with hospital contagion no
      longer the deadly menace it had been just a few years before,
      the medical world was in the early stages of an unprecedented
      boom in surgery. Not incidentally, this boom concentrated
      surgery within the hospital operating room. When Lewis Sayre
      performed his pioneering circumcisions for paralysis in the
      early 1870s at Bellevue there were fewer than 200 hospitals
      in the United States; forty years later there were more than
      4,000, many of them for-profit ventures owned by physicians.
      "To many surgeons," the historian Charles E. Rosenberg has
      remarked, the modern hospital "was beginning to seem the only
      ethical place to practice an increasingly demanding art." [<a
      id="cite41" name="cite41" href="#ref41">41</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The other, perhaps equally important,
      breakthrough was improved anesthesia. Ether had made its
      grand entrance into medicine in the amphitheater of the
      Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846. Through the Civil War
      era, however, anesthetics - ether, nitrous oxide, and
      chloroform, among others - remained dangerously
      unpredictable, and their use was controversial within the
      medical profession. Not until the 1880s did medical
      scientists introduce a variety of new drugs and safer
      techniques. In 1885, for example, William Halstead invented a
      hypodermic cocaine nerve block that could be used as a local
      anesthetic with little or no systemic effect. The result of
      improvements like this was vastly to lower the threshold for
      surgical intervention. [<a id="cite42" name="cite42"
      href="#ref42">42</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Lewis Sayre, an orthopedic surgeon who had
      long experience with anesthesia, chloroformed the patients he
      circumcised without hesitation; and he reported no bad
      outcomes. But many others were leery of general anesthetics,
      especially in cases involving infants and young children. For
      them cocaine, administered locally, appeared to offer the
      perfect answer. C. Knox-Shaw spoke of giving a child "a few
      whiffs of chloroform, and at the same time twelve to fifteen
      minims of four per cent solution of cocaine... injected into
      the prepuce, about the level of the corona, in two or three
      places." Noting that over the years many of his patients had
      backed out of circumcision at the last minute "because I
      could not promise 'that it would not hurt,' " G. W. Overall
      said that by injecting cocaine "now I can promise an
      operation where a child would not even know it until it was
      performed." Indeed, he cited a recent case in which he had
      operated painlessly on a six-year-old boy "while he was
      discussing with his mother the kind of toys he would get for
      Christmas." [<a id="cite43" name="cite43"
      href="#ref43">43</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Others were less fortunate though. Although
      physicians seldom documented the suffering that resulted from
      their actions, and almost never published their failures,
      still, in the shadows of their journal articles one catches
      disturbing glimpses. "The text-books on surgery seem to imply
      that a circumcision is the simplest of procedures," Samuel
      Newman wrote in the <i>Journal of the American Medical
      Association</i>. "The operation, however, is often
      troublesome." Among common postoperative complications he
      listed inflammation, swelling, bleeding and hematoma.
      Jonathan Young Brown remarked that every surgeon who ever
      performed circumcision "has doubtless been struck with the
      fact, that almost invariably after the operation, the loose
      connective tissue lying between the remaining connective
      mucous and skin surfaces, become suddenly edematous, greatly
      swollen and occasionally almost tumefied. This condition
      delays or destroys union by the first intention, disfigures
      the part and renders the patient very uncomfortable."
      Sounding a theme that appears time and time again, Henry
      Simes wrote that as safe as circumcision was, there were
      nonetheless occasional problems. He had witnessed one
      instance where a colleague had used hydrochlorate of cocaine,
      and "although the patient did not die, yet the effect was
      such that the operating surgeon then and there determined
      never to use the drug again for a similar operation." By the
      same token, he also had seen cases "when the surgeon, in
      operating, removed a portion of the glans." [<a id="cite44"
      name="cite44" href="#ref44">44</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">To help prevent surgical mishaps, medical
      journals published dozens of articles on new techniques and
      medical devices designed to render the procedure foolproof.
      Advertising his "circumcision scissors," for example, Simon
      Baruch noted the proliferation of specially-designed "clamps,
      forceps, and scissors" being offered to physicians. Only the
      imagination of surgeons limited the development of new and
      ingenuous methods of performing the operation. John W. Ross's
      description of "An Easy and Ready Method of Circumcision" is
      representative of the trend toward gadgetry. He contrived to
      insert "the glans penis up to the corona into the open mouth
      of a glass tube; tie a strong, small silk cord very tightly
      around the foreskin immediately in front of the flange of the
      tube; amputate the foreskin one-eighth of an inch in front of
      the constricting cord by a circular sweep of the knife; untie
      dressing; and keep the patient in bed, with penis elevated,
      for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours." [<a id="cite45"
      name="cite45" href="#ref45">45</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite physicians' insistence that it was a
      minor procedure, circumcision seems to bear out the old adage
      that the only minor surgery is an operation performed on
      someone else. Understandably, unless they suffered disturbing
      symptoms, most men were reluctant to submit to the scalpel.
      While no reliable statistics have surfaced for estimating the
      rate of medical circumcision at the turn of the century, the
      impression conveyed by dozens of articles in the contemporary
      medical literature is that the patients were mainly
      symptomatic middle- and upper-class children and teenagers.
      B. Merrill Ricketts kept the Cincinnati Medical Society
      apprised of his work in this field. In an 1894 paper, "The
      Last Fifty of a Series of Two Hundred Circumcisions," he
      listed twenty-eight indications for the operation ranging
      from local (phimosis) to systemic ("general nervousness").
      During this period, though, it is evident that physicians did
      not take consumer acceptance for granted. They expected
      skepticism, and refined their arguments to overcome it. [<a
      id="cite46" name="cite46" href="#ref46">46</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Meanwhile they discovered another group of
      patients who had no voice in the matter. From the mid 1880s
      onward physicians and, at their behest, parents, came to
      suppose that the theory and practice of circumcision applied
      most ideally to infants. "Circumcision," performed on babies,
      wrote a New York doctor, "is no more of an operation than
      vaccination." And as the Jews had long since discovered,
      babies needed no chloroform or cocaine. "Infants only a few
      years old may be held down by two assistants and the
      operation done without any anesthetic, Samuel Newman advised.
      For his own part, Newman preferred to bind his young patients
      "to a board after the Indian fashion of strapping the
      papoose... to hold the child firmly in place until the
      operation is ended." [<a id="cite47" name="cite47"
      href="#ref47">47</a>] If one acknowledged the scores of
      benefits that circumcision was supposed to produce, it was
      logical to operate early, before diseases and bad habits had
      a chance to take hold. [<a id="cite48" name="cite48"
      href="#ref48">48</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">This aggressive medical intervention was but
      one aspect of a sweeping change in the medical approach to
      children. Concerned about new statistics published by public
      health agencies which documented shocking rates of infant
      mortality, especially in urban areas, the medical profession
      reorganized itself to combat the diseases of childhood. In
      1880 under President Lewis Sayre's aegis, the AMA instituted
      a new section of pediatric medicine. Four years later the
      first specialist journal devoted to children's medicine
      appeared, the <i>Archives of Pediatrics</i>; and in 1887 the
      American Pediatric Society held it first meeting. The
      hallmark of the new pediatric medicine was medical
      reassessment of all facets of children's minds and bodies,
      and intrusion by physicians into areas that formerly had been
      the private domain of families. Perhaps the best-known
      example of physician activism was the baby feeding
      controversy. Inspired by the hope of saving America's babies,
      many doctors challenged the safety of mother's milk and
      concocted an assortment of new products and techniques to
      replace breast feeding. [<a id="cite49" name="cite49"
      href="#ref49">49</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">What provoked this movement were data
      showing that diarrheal disorders were among the leading
      causes of infant mortality and were responsible for as many
      as one of every four deaths. This finding also supported the
      argument for early circumcision. By eliminating a source of
      irritation on the nervous system - the foreskin - the
      operation was held to aid a baby's digestion, thereby
      improving his chances for survival. In a notable article, J.
      A. Hofheimer reported success in using circumcision to cure
      both fecal incontinence and constipation. Encouraged by his
      results, he recommended operating at once, before symptoms
      had a chance to appear. "An early operation," he wrote, "will
      relieve the child of a great source of irritation, and
      indirectly improve nutrition; changing a fretful, puny baby
      into a thriving, happy infant." Putting this advice to a test
      in the case of a child with urinary and fecal incontinence,
      H. L. Rosenberry confessed that he had no idea why it worked,
      but the patient soon became healthy and robust. "I am at a
      loss to explain the process, but simply relate it as a fact."
      [<a id="cite50" name="cite50" href="#ref50">50</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus, in the formative period of modern
      scientific medicine - "experimental, active, manipulating its
      data by main force, given to speak not of concomitants and
      symptoms but causes of disease, and crowned by success in
      prevention and treatment," as Donald Fleming has portrayed it
      - one finds leading physicians contriving a rationale for
      circumcision based on old-fashioned empiricism. Even as the
      theories of Koch and Pasteur propelled science toward the
      principle of specific causation, doctors defended
      circumcision, using hypotheses which had formerly been used
      to justify practices like bloodletting. In the midst of the
      "therapeutic revolution," one finds that the treatments
      physicians used had little connection with the rigorous
      scientific methods and high standards of scientific proof
      which were the watchwords of academic medical research. Of
      course a clinician like Lewis Sayre, who performed surgical
      experiments of therapeutic intent and tracked the results as
      best he could, would have strenuously argued that his work
      was every bit as scientific as researchers like Paul Ehrlich,
      who worked in laboratories in search of verifiable truths.
      [<a id="cite51" name="cite51" href="#ref51">51</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Then as now, researchers and clinicians held
      competing notions of science. Seen from the cold objectivity
      of the laboratory, clinicians appeared satisfied to treat
      patients on the basis of hypotheses that were very far from
      proven using any reasonable standards of scientific proof. On
      the other hand, from the perspective of the clinic, the most
      important and compelling facts came from observing the
      results of treatments on individual patients. For the average
      physician, knowing what worked to cure patients and being
      able to apply that knowledge in a procedure, was far more
      important than understanding the principles of biology. In
      this respect, circumcision was equally an anachronism and a
      quintessential product of its age. It was an operation whose
      healing power laboratory research could not explain, yet one
      that continued to be supported by abundant medical testimony.
      [<a id="cite52" name="cite52" href="#ref52">52</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">An omnibus procedure, supposedly effective
      against dozens of disorders which were widely feared yet
      poorly understood, circumcision lent itself naturally to
      sexual diagnoses, which in turn helped complete the
      transition to routine care for male infants. Late Victorian
      America was of course notoriously ill at ease with human
      sexuality. The infamous Comstock Act of 1873 captured an
      attitude toward sex, awkward and censorious, which was
      widespread within the middle and upper classes. For a culture
      nervous about sex, manifestations of infant and child
      sexuality seemed especially disturbing, contradictions of
      children's pristine purity. In ages past, the most common
      expression of sexuality in children - masturbation - seldom
      had caused much comment or concern. Amidst a general
      transformation of sexual attitudes in the middle decades of
      the nineteenth century, however, the popular view of
      masturbation darkened. Since the Enlightenment, doctors in
      Western Europe and America had identified masturbation as a
      cause of illnesses. In the course of the nineteenth century
      it was linked to madness, idiocy, epilepsy, and from these to
      a multitude of other psychological, behavioral, and
      pathological conditions. "The most serious forms of disorder
      attributable to this cause are <i>spinal paralysis,
      locomotor-ataxia, and convulsions</i>," declared a physician
      at Virginia's South-Western Asylum. "Besides these,
      masturbation, does occasionally, induce an intractable form
      of insanity." This was so-called "masturbatory insanity," a
      label many American and British physicians used for psychotic
      illnesses they could not otherwise classify. For ages the
      Catholic Church had taught that masturbation, because it
      existed apart from marriage and procreation, was a mortal
      sin. But the medical theory that masturbation caused disease
      presented a more immediate threat. Fittingly in the age of
      Darwin, biology joined God as the punisher of transgression.
      [<a id="cite53" name="cite53" href="#ref53">53</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The evidence for this view, which was
      surprisingly well accepted, was derived in part from
      physicians' experience with mentally ill patients. It was
      unnerving, one doctor wrote, to see that among the feeble
      minded their "hands seem instinctively drawn to those parts."
      So logic seemed to indicate that masturbation somehow led to
      feeblemindedness. As Remondino said, "it may be a question as
      to whether the feeblemindedness be not a reflex condition
      from this excessive morbid irritability of the sexual
      organs." Other commentators, pediatricians prominently among
      them, warned parents that the habit of masturbation was often
      learned in infancy, and that the foreskin was chiefly to
      blame. "The fact that children under two years of age can and
      frequently do contract the habit of masturbation is a
      revelation to many physicians," declared J. P. Wester in a
      paper he read to the Ohio Pediatric Society. He went on to
      profile a typical masturbator: a three-year-old boy who was
      "small, had a scowl on his face, looked wearied and bloated;
      he was nervous and fretful, a poor eater and a very poor
      sleeper." The sickly child had developed his habit before he
      was a year old, according to Webster, evidently "due in the
      first place to the condition of the prepuce." [<a id="cite54"
      name="cite54" href="#ref54">54</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">One physician who described a successful
      circumcision of an infant to cure urinary tract lithuria also
      remembered having detected similar "oxalic acid deposits in
      the urine of masturbators, and <i>offspring-shunning
      husbands</i>, who practice onanism." This observation not
      only reconfirmed the theory that masturbation was connected
      with neurasthenic disease but, more important, implied that
      masturbation was itself less a moral failing than a response
      to a basic physiologic aberration. In the view of many
      practitioners, masturbation became an intermediate link in a
      chain of cause-and-effect that originated in the foreskin.
      Writing in support of this theory in the prestigious
      Philadelphia <i>Medical Bulletin</i>, a physician who
      specialized in treating neurasthenia claimed that in a sample
      group of 192 men with nervous disease, "including
      neurasthenia in all its varieties, epilepsy, etc., there were
      60 cases of phimosis or redundant foreskin." [<a id="cite55"
      name="cite55" href="#ref55">55</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">When in 1896 a popular book, <i>All about
      the Baby</i>, advised mothers that circumcision of baby boys
      was "advisable in most cases," it recommended the operation
      mainly for preventing "the vile habit of masturbation." L.
      Emmett Holt, professor at the College of Physicians and
      Surgeons, and a distinguished expert on pediatric medicine,
      told his fellow physicians that "adherent prepuce... is so
      constantly present that it can hardly be called a
      malformation. It is, however, a condition needing attention
      in every male infant." The perils of neglect, he said,
      included "priapism, masturbation, insomnia, night terrors,
      etc.," and for that matter, "most of the functional nervous
      disease of childhood." Remondino, for his part, was certain
      that "circumcised boys may, in individual cases... be found
      to practice onanism, but in general the practice can be
      asserted as being very rare among the children of circumcised
      races... neither in infancy are they as liable to priapism
      during sleep as those that are uncircumcised." [<a
      id="cite56" name="cite56" href="#ref56">56</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Strange as it may seem in light of their
      using circumcision to suppress masturbation, Remondino, along
      with many other physicians, also endorsed circumcision as
      prophylaxis for impotence. Recently some scholars have argued
      that middle- and upper-class men in late Victorian America
      suffered a sexual crisis typified by fears of impotence and
      lost manhood. [<a id="cite57" name="cite57"
      href="#ref57">57</a>] Whether or not impotence and anxiety
      about impotence became more widespread, and can be correlated
      with broad social changes in the 1890s, remains a point of
      debate. But it is clear that impotence, a condition commonly
      devoid of any specific pathophysiological cause, fit neatly
      into the medical framework that supported circumcision. After
      all, phimosis and paraphimosis (the latter being a condition
      in which, according to one surgical textbook, "the prepuce
      gets behind the corona glandis, threatening the strangulation
      of the organ") were thought to predispose boys to impotence
      and sterility. "Sexual relations are much more to man or
      woman than is generally acknowledged," Remondino declared.
      And he maintained that freeing the male organ from "a
      constricting, unnatural band" would surely enhance sexual
      performance and pleasure. [<a id="cite58" name="cite58"
      href="#ref58">58</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">In the early years of the twentieth century
      circumcision moved steadily toward becoming standard practice
      for well-trained physicians. Statistics are hard to come by,
      but on the eve of World War I a physician making a case for
      "Universal Circumcision as a Sanitary Measure" in the
      <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> estimated
      the number of children who had undergone the procedure in the
      "millions." He surveyed medical opinion around America, and
      in Britain as well, and concluded that "the vast
      preponderance of modern scientific opinion on the subject is
      strongly in favor of circumcision as a sanitary measure and
      as a prophylactic against infection with venereal disease."
      The few objections that lingered were not against removing
      the foreskin, "but against those persons who fail to do it
      properly." Articles published on the subject through the
      1920s support this view. For the most part, the question
      about whether to circumcise was treated as a <i>fait
      accompli</i>. All that remained was to establish the best
      technique. [<a id="cite59" name="cite59"
      href="#ref59">59</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The main goal of perfecting a surgeon's
      technique was to produce an attractive result. Aesthetics
      were not incidental, for a critical aspect of circumcision's
      popularity was that it became a mark of social distinction.
      In the early twentieth century it was the social significance
      of the operation which allowed circumcision to flourish long
      after the sanitary movement had lost its way. While it was
      hardly a topic of discussion in polite society, some leaders
      within the medical profession characterized the procedure
      explicitly in class terms. Reminding his readers that the
      earliest recorded circumcisions occurred among the caste of
      priests in Old Kingdom Egypt, Peter Remondino drew an analogy
      between ancient and modern practice. In the year 1892 he
      declared, although it was far from routine, there was "a
      class which also observe circumcision as a hygienic
      precaution, where, from my personal observation, I have found
      that circumcision is thoroughly practiced in every male
      member of many of the families of the class, - this being the
      physician class." Whether as a result of their medical
      training or of seeing at first hand "the many dangers and
      disadvantages that follow the uncircumcised," he said,
      American physicians were subjecting themselves to the
      procedure. And having done so, "instead of being
      dissatisfied, they have extended the advantages they have
      themselves received, by having those in their charge likewise
      operated upon." According to this view, the trend was
      inspired by a kind of medical priest class who persuaded
      their private patients of what Richard Bushman has called
      "the utility of emulation." [<a id="cite60" name="cite60"
      href="#ref60">60</a>] Class distinctions - particularly a
      distinction bearing connotations of science, health, and
      cleanliness - assumed growing importance around the turn of
      the century. For the new immigration then surging in from
      Southern and Eastern Europe, flooding the industrial centers
      in the Northeast and Midwest, drastically changing the human
      geography of American cities, confronted old-stock Americans
      with a crisis of cultural identity. Shocked by the influx of
      foreigners, the guardians of American purity scorned them as
      racially inferior. Metaphorically, the new immigrants were
      depicted as refuse spewed from the sewers of the old world, a
      human wave of filth and pollution. This lurid rhetoric, which
      was used to support severe restrictions on immigration,
      fueled a national obsession with contamination and,
      alternatively, with sanitation. This filth people eschewed
      was a rich cultural stew. For as anthropologist Mary Douglas
      has shown in her classic study, <i>Purity and Danger</i>,
      pollution beliefs are fraught with symbolism, furnishing
      cultures with "analogies for expressing a general view of the
      social order." Clean and the unclean are, along with
      everything else, expressions of hierarchy and measures of
      social distance. [<a id="cite61" name="cite61"
      href="#ref61">61</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Medical circumcision thus assumed its own
      place in the fin-de-si&egrave;cle search for rank and social
      order. It signified precisely that aversion to dirt - and not
      just dirt, but vulgarity, nasty habits, and diseases - which
      symbolically set one on a higher plane. Undoubtedly this was
      the enduring source of its appeal to patients and parents.
      Outside Judaism, circumcision was exclusively the province of
      doctors and patients with enough money to pay for an elective
      procedure. Physicians privately suggested it to parents
      immediately after the birth of a son. Circumcision, they
      professed, represented state-of-the-art medical knowledge and
      surgical practice. The operation itself was simple, eminently
      safe; moreover, it immediately reduced the infant's chances
      of becoming infected with the deadly diseases of
      childhood.</p>

      <p class="text2">With each passing year maternity care and
      childbirth for the middle and upper classes was shifting from
      a domestic event managed by midwives, relatives, and friends
      into a medical event managed by physicians. Midwives rarely
      performed circumcisions, so having one's foreskin removed was
      necessarily a byproduct of having been delivered by a
      physician. It was a token of the medicalization of
      childbirth; literally a symbol of the rising authority of the
      medical profession over the laity. [<a id="cite62"
      name="cite62" href="#ref62">62</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">On a more mundane level, it promised to
      spare parents the ordeal of someday having to deal with
      masturbation - a concern likely to have elicited
      squeamishness from Victorian mothers. Circumcision meant that
      a boy's parents had given him every chance, providing him
      with proper medical care from the beginning. Conversely, the
      potential for parental guilt should one's son contract any of
      the terrible afflictions that circumcision was supposed to
      prevent was enormous. Frank G. Lydston bluntly emphasized
      this point in his popular 1912 treatise on social hygiene,
      when he wrote, "<i>Parents who do not have an early
      circumcision performed on their boys are almost criminally
      negligent</i>. " [<a id="cite63" name="cite63"
      href="#ref63">63</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">So it happened that the foreskin, despised
      by the medical profession, came broadly to signify ignorance,
      neglect, and poverty. As white middle-class gentiles adopted
      circumcision, those left behind were mainly recent
      immigrants, African Americans, the poor, and others at the
      margins of respectable society. [<a id="cite64" name="cite64"
      href="#ref64">64</a>] Despite notable advances in every
      branch of medicine and surgery during the twentieth century,
      it is this powerful social sanction that has sustained the
      standard practice of circumcision even after the theories on
      which it was founded dropped away. Once the procedure evolved
      to the point of becoming standard practice, it became
      ingrained in the collective medical consciousness, appearing
      too obviously salubrious to warrant formal analysis of
      benefits, harms, costs, and outcomes.</p>

      <p class="text2">Considered in terms of the march of medical
      science, circumcision is an anomaly. But as a synecdoche for
      the history of clinical practice - above all of surgery - it
      is remarkably, not to say disturbingly, comprehensible. For,
      although physicians have only recently begun to recognize it,
      clinical practices have never been closely connected to
      measurable outcomes. The imposing m&eacute;lange of
      textbooks, journal articles, specialty society papers,
      replete with esoteric vocabulary, computer models, and
      awe-inspiring photographic images - all this lends medicine
      and surgery an aura of organization and scientific rigor
      which clinical practice egregiously fails to substantiate.
      According to David M. Eddy, the most astute modern critic of
      clinical decisionmaking, the model for clinical practice
      policies is not the laboratory at all. A more apt metaphor is
      Adam Smith's classic marketplace, an ongoing exchange of
      competing ideas and opinions in which an "invisible hand"
      sets patterns of practice. [<a id="cite65" name="cite65"
      href="#ref65">65</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The visible hands that treat patients are
      not the hands of scientists, but of practitioners whose
      conventions, habits, and modes of practice are molded first
      by watching their teachers, then their peers. This is the
      process of practical medical education, and also of cultural
      transmission.</p>

      <p class="text2">The unscientific results of this process
      have only begun to come under scrutiny, most sharply in
      recent work on "small area variations." Studying patterns of
      surgical practice in different parts of the country,
      researchers have documented enormous fluctuations in rates of
      common operations like hysterectomy and tonsillectomy. These
      variations cannot be correlated with population demographics,
      morbidity, or mortality rates for the areas in question. The
      significant variables for predicting the incidence of a
      procedure, it turns out, have to do with the number of
      physicians operating in a specific locale and their
      deeply-inbred local styles of practice. In the case of
      hysterectomies, for example, surgeons' criteria for operating
      depend not on what is reported in the <i>American Journal of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology</i>, but on what fellow surgeons do
      at the local hospital. [<a id="cite66" name="cite66"
      href="#ref66">66</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">From their residencies onward, most doctors
      discover that pressure to conform to what is considered
      standard within the local medical community is irresistible.
      In turn, these practice standards, imbued as they are with
      medical authority, shape patients' preferences. For patients
      normally presume that what doctors accept as medical policy
      is also the best thing to do. This deference to medical
      authority is especially powerful in questions involving
      medical technology, perhaps because, as Timothy Ferris has
      remarked, "science in principle has to do with knowledge,
      technology with power." [<a id="cite67" name="cite67"
      href="#ref67">67</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">The doctor-patient relationship contains a
      built-in mechanism of mutual reinforcement, encouraging both
      parties to follow the pack. With the passage of time some
      practices harden within medical and popular culture alike, so
      it becomes impossible to sort out how much demand for a
      procedure should be attributed to physicians and how much to
      patients. [<a id="cite68" name="cite68" href="#ref68">68</a>]
      In this respect, the peculiar history of neonatal
      circumcision in the United States exemplifies the process by
      which physicians, despite having no solid science of clinical
      outcomes, succeeded in transforming standard medical practice
      into social custom.</p>

      <p><b>Postscript: Circumcision a Century Later</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Considering that the original intellectual
      framework for medical circumcision in the late nineteenth
      century, was, during the years after World War I, dismantled
      piece by piece, one might have expected circumcision to go
      the way of other surgical fads. Instead it gathered strength.
      During the 1970s it has been estimated that as many as 80
      percent of American males were circumcised in infancy. For
      roughly the first two-thirds of the twentieth century routine
      neonatal circumcision was an unquestioned aspect of ordinary
      pediatric practice. Around the turn of the century, American
      medical textbooks and journals that used illustrations began
      to adopt the convention of depicting the normal penis as
      circumcised - a convention subsequently adopted by publishers
      of medical books for lay readers. [<a id="cite69"
      name="cite69" href="#ref69">69</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">That no scientific research validated the
      theory that circumcision inhibited the spread of venereal
      disease did not keep physicians from continuing to promote
      the view that it did. In the wake of World War II, for
      example, <i>Newsweek</i> magazine quoted Dr. Eugene Hand's
      address to the AMA in which he observed that whereas the
      "promiscuous" and uncircumcised Negro had an incidence of
      venereal infection of "almost 100%,... for the widely
      educated Jew, circumcised at birth, the venereal disease rate
      has remained the same or decreased." [<a id="cite70"
      name="cite70" href="#ref70">70</a>] Meanwhile in 1945,
      England, whose experience with circumcision before World War
      II was roughly similar to America's, instituted a system of
      universal medical coverage under the National Health
      Services. Since British doctors could not agree whether or
      not it was medically efficacious, circumcision was dropped
      from the list of covered services. Henceforth, parents who
      wanted their sons circumcised were required to pay a surgical
      fee. Based on army records, it was estimated that before the
      War 50 percent of working-class and 85 percent of upper-class
      Englishmen had been circumcised. Under the National Health
      Services the rate plummeted. By the early 1960s, the figure
      was thought to be less than one-half of 1 percent. More
      recently there has been a mild resurgence in the popularity
      of circumcision, accountable in part to a large number of
      young boys being diagnosed with phimosis. In an attempt to
      explain this, researchers discovered that in the Mersey
      Region at least, "many boys are circumcised for development
      non-retractability of the prepuce rather than for true
      phimosis and that in consequence some two-thirds of the
      operations are unnecessary." [<a id="cite71" name="cite71"
      href="#ref71">71</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">In the American system of private insurance,
      by contrast, payers automatically covered the costs of the
      procedure based on physician consensus that it was medically
      beneficial. Not until the 1960s, in a period of intense
      challenges to received wisdom and institutional authority,
      did American doctors seriously question the medical
      legitimacy of routine neonatal circumcision. Why was it,
      asked the editors of the <i>Journal of the American Medical
      Association</i> in 1963, that an operation so well accepted
      by practitioners for its power to "'relieve' phimosis, to
      'prevent' infection, to be 'prophylaxis' against carcinoma"
      had attracted no interest from scientists in the medical
      research establishment? The biomedical community remained
      indifferent. Increasingly over the next several years,
      though, practitioners engaged their colleagues in debates
      about the procedure. Their arguments represent a bizarre
      mixture of epidemiology, opinion, prejudice, and cultural
      speculation. For instance, castigating circumcision as "<a
      href="/library/general/morgan/">the rape of the phallus</a>,"
      a physician at the University of Maryland blamed its
      popularity on women. "Perhaps not least of the reasons why
      American mothers seem to endorse the operation with such
      enthusiasm," he wrote, "is the fact that it is one way an
      intensely matriarchal society can permanently influence the
      physical characteristics of its males." [<a id="cite72"
      name="cite72" href="#ref72">72</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">A more thoughtful critique appeared in 1969
      in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. In an article
      titled "Ritualistic Surgery - Circumcision and Tonsillectomy"
      a pediatrician named Robert Bolande insisted that there was
      insufficient evidence to justify any surgery as a preventive
      measure, and that cutting in the absence of disease violated
      the most cherished tenet of medical ethics, <i>primum non
      nocere</i> (first, do no harm). More systematically, the
      following year <a href="/library/general/preston/">another
      pediatrician</a> reviewed the major medical literature on
      circumcision and concluded that none of the substantial
      medical benefits associated with it - primarily prevention of
      sexually transmitted diseases and cancers of the penis and
      prostate - could withstand scrutiny. The best that could be
      said for the operation, he concluded, was that "circumcision
      is a beautification comparable to rhinoplasty." In 1971,
      unable to find compelling data to the contrary, the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> officially concluded that there were no
      medical grounds for routine infant circumcision, a decision
      that it reconfirmed four years later. Meanwhile, Benjamin
      Spock, whose bestselling medical guide for parents had
      originally endorsed circumcision, changed his mind. In light
      of current medical opinion, he reported, the operation seemed
      "unnecessary and at least mildly dangerous." [<a id="cite73"
      name="cite73" href="#ref73">73</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Oddly enough, neither Spock's nor the
      Academy's official positions made much difference in medical
      practice. One reason for this is that the American Academy of
      Pediatrics, concerned about dissent within its own
      membership, did not publicize its decision. Moreover, during
      the same period the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists, a group whose members advised mothers on
      childbirth and themselves performed hundreds of thousands of
      circumcisions, refused to go along with the pediatricians.
      After several years of internecine quarrelling, the <a
      href="/library/general/grimes/"><i>American Journal of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology</i></a> at last issued an opinion,
      albeit sotto voce. Although some studies found that
      circumcision facilitates hygiene, prevents balanoposthitis
      (local inflammation of the glans), and may reduce risk of
      carcinoma of the penis, declared the <i>Journal</i>, other
      factors weighed against the operation. These included
      illogical bases for patient selection, lack of informed
      consent, disregard for pain, the performance of a radical
      technique in many cases by an unskilled surgeon, unclear
      clinical objectives, and no evidence for cost-effectiveness.
      "Clinicians ought to use techniques only when certain that
      they do good," was the reasonable conclusion. "In clinical
      practice physicians should not have to prove that techniques
      are not dangerous." [<a id="cite74" name="cite74"
      href="#ref74">74</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Nevertheless, the debate continues. Old
      arguments about reflex irritation, phimosis and adherent
      prepuce are forgotten, but new theories have arisen to take
      their place. A few widely heralded studies have indicated
      that circumcision may reduce the risk of urinary tract
      infections in infants. [<a id="cite75" name="cite75"
      href="#ref75">75</a>] Other research has purported to
      demonstrate that female sex partners of uncircumcised men
      suffer significantly higher rates of cancer of the uterine
      cervix than those of uncircumcised men. [<a id="cite76"
      name="cite76" href="#ref76">76</a>] Without trying to sort
      out the merits of individual studies, it is worth noting that
      so far the cause and effect relationship between circumcision
      and disease prevention has not been established strongly
      enough to convince physicians in other industrialized
      democracies to incorporate it into their clinical routines.
      It has the distinction of being one of the few instances of
      American exceptionalism.</p>

      <p class="text2">Regardless of what the journals said,
      American doctors in private practice have continued to place
      a high value on clinical autonomy and, in a new age of
      medical marketing, on what they perceive to be the
      preferences of the patients who pay the bills. Surgical fees
      for the five-minute operation range between $50 and $125,
      leading some critics to suggest that the profit motive has
      been the most important factor sustaining circumcision. Yet,
      for those predisposed to circumcise, there has been just
      enough scientific evidence to make it seem reasonable. After
      1900 the demise of reflex theory did not invalidate
      circumcision, but opened the door for other theories. In the
      1990s, masses of freshly available epidemiological data
      enable advocates of circumcision to formulate heretofore
      unimagined hypotheses.</p>

      <p class="text2">Ironically, but predictably in the context
      of the history of medical arguments for circumcision, some
      doctors have conjectured that removing the foreskin may
      protect men from the most dreaded epidemic of the post-modern
      world: the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Using
      retrospective data (the epidemiological equivalent of
      empiricism) from a venereal disease clinic in Kenya, for
      example, researchers observed that there were higher rates of
      HIV infection in the home communities of uncircumcised than
      circumcised men. Ignoring racial, ethnic, and sociocultural
      variables - the chief factors dictating whether or not an
      African boy is circumcised in the first place - they
      hypothesized that circumcision might serve to inhibit the
      transmission of the AIDS virus. One wonders whether this
      theory will endure. But within a medical community desperate
      to find some weapon against AIDS, its appeal is
      understandable. Even a physician who is a sober skeptic of
      the methodologies behind such studies allows that they "do
      suggest that HIV may be more infective during heterosexual
      intercourse if the mate partner is uncircumcised and has a
      mucosal or cutaneous ulcer." [<a id="cite77" name="cite77"
      href="#ref77">77</a>] AIDS, the nemesis of modern science and
      medicine, remains a mystery. By some equally mysterious
      process, it is surmised, circumcision may help.</p>

        national rate of 61 percent. Two sharply critical, although

        <li><a id="ref3" name="ref3" href="#cite3"></a>Circumcision
        is the earliest recorded surgery, clearly portrayed in an
        Egyptian tomb wall carving from around 2400 B.C., yet its
        orgins and ritual meanings remain obscure. See Alexander
        Badawy's, <i>The Tomb of Nyhetep-Ptah at Giza and the Tomb
        of Ankhmahor at Saqqara</i> (Berkeley, 1978), 19. Evidence
        from mummified remains predating the Ankhmahor relief
        indicates that the practice had been established centuries
        earlier. See Aidan and Even Cockburn, eds., <i>Mummies,
        Disease, and Ancient Cultures</i> (Cambridge, 1980), 18,
        42; and Henry E. Sigerist, <i>A History of Medicine</i>,
        Vol. I, <i>Primitive and Archaic Medicine</i> (New York and
        Oxford, 1950), 345. At different times circumcision was
        adopted within the worlds of Judaism and Islam, and quite
        independently within diverse communities of Africans,
        Australian aborigines, Oceanic islanders, and native tribes
        in North and South America. The classic ethnographic
        account remains Felix Bryk's <i>Die Beschneidung bei Mann
        and Weib</i> (1934), translated by David Berger as

        Injuries to Muscles, Nerves, Bones, &amp; Joints</i>
        (London, 1919), 180. A succinct sketch of Sayre's career is
        provided by his son, Reginald H. Sayre, in Howard A. Kelly
        and Walter L. Burrage, <i>Dictionary of American Medical
        Biography: Lives of Eminent Physicians of the United States
        and Canada, for the Earliest Times</i> (New York and
        London, 1928), 1079-80. The esteem in which he was held by
        his contemporaries comes through clearly in the eulogies
        written after his death. See, for example, <i>Medical
        Record</i> (New York) 63 (1900): 505-06; <i>Boston Medical
        and Surgical Journal</i> 163 (1900): 331; <i>Lancet</i> 2
        (1900): 1246. As a student, at the age of nineteen, Sayre
        had already embarked on his public health crusade, issuing
        two pamphlets, <i>Cholera!!! Caution to the Public</i> (New
        York Board of Health, n.d.), and <i>Directions to Prevent
        and Treat the Cholera</i> (New York, 1849). On the cholera
        scare of 1866 see Charles E. Rosenberg, <i>The Cholera
        Years: The United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866</i>
        (Chicago, 1962), 175-225.</li>

        willingness to operate on women aggressively, indeed
        recklessly, stemmed from their anxiety about female
        emancipation. Surgery, he argues, was employed as a
        mechanism of social repression which, because it reflected
        a broad social unease, found ready acceptance among
        middle-class men and those in power. On Battey's operation

        collision of traditional empiricism with new
        bacteriological science is well described in Naomi Rogers'
        <i>Dirt and Disease: Polio before FDR</i> (New Brunswick,
        1992). The extent to which public health became more
        personalized toward the turn of the century than it had
        been earlier, and what a new focus on individuals and
        clinical practice meant, are the subjects of a growing body
        of scholarship. The changing orientation of public health
        historiography may be followed in Barbara G. Rosenkrantz,
        <i>Public Health and the State: Changing Views in
        Massachusetts, 1842-1936</i> (Cambridge, Mass., 1972); John

        of technique and hygiene were raised in Germany and France.
        But physicians in those countries, intrigued by a new wave
        of comparative ethnography, continued to consider
        circumcision primarily as a religious ritual, not as a

        ceremony of circumcision would, according to some, be
        resection of the spermatic cord of the vicious and

        circumcision emerged at the same time physicians were

        section deliveries. See Judith Walzer Leavitt's <i>Brought

        circumcision, as with so many other medical decisions,
        patients conflate social, cultural, and medical issues. For
        instance, on the basis of 190 questionnaires completed by
        women who had their sons circumcised, one study determined
        that the health benefits mothers associated with the
        procedure had little or no medical validity. At the same
        time, few mothers understood the risks of the procedure.
        See J. E. Lovell and J. Cox, "Maternal Attitudes toward
        Circumcision," <i>Journal of Family Practice</i> 9 (1979):
        811-13. More recently, research conducted among parents
        presumably inclined against surgical intervention - a group
        of men and women enrolled in natural childbirth classes -
        found that nearly two-thirds of them had decided to
        circumcise their boys for explicitly social reasons.
        Foremost among these was an expressed fear that being
        uncircumcised would stigmatize their sons because they
        would be different from other boys, as well as from their
        own fathers. See Jay Brodbar-Nemzer, Peter Conrad, and

        <li><a id="ref76" name="ref76" href="#cite76"></a>For the
        most part, the literature linking circumcision to reduced
        incidence of cervical cancer has centered on the
        transmission of certain types of the papillomavirus (along
        with several other sexually transmitted diseases). This
        virus is suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of
        cervical carcinoma. See I. I. Kessler, "Etiological
        Concepts in Cervical Carcinogenesis," <i>Gynecological
        Oncology</i> 12 (1981), Suppl. 2: 7-24; W. C. Reeves, W. E.
        Rawls, and L. A. Brinton, "Epidemiology of Genital
        Papillomaviruses and Cervical Cancer," <i>Review of
        Infectious Diseases</i> 11 (1989): 426-39. As Ronald L.
        Poland points out, though, "studies have correlated
        exposure to uncircumcised sexual partners with the
        incidence of cervical cancer, but the uncircumcised state
        is also associated with the presence of the human
        papillomavirus and other possibly oncogenic viruses" ("<a
