      <h1>History of Circumcision</h1>

      <p>This index page links to material relating to the origin
      and history of male circumcision. Material is indexed in
      chronological order of publication.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The practice of male genital mutilation is far older than
      recorded history. Certainly, it is far older than the
      Biblical account of Abraham (Genesis 17). It seems to have
      originated in eastern Africa long before this time.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p>Many theories have been advanced to explain the origin of
      genital mutilation. One theory postulates that circumcision
      began as a way of "purifying" individuals and society by
      reducing sexuality and sexual pleasure. Human sexuality was
      seen as dirty or impure in some societies; hence cutting off
      the pleasure-producing parts was the obvious way to "purify"
      someone.</p>

      <p>It is now known that the male foreskin, or prepuce, is the
      principal location of erogenous sensation in the human male
      (see <a href="/library/anatomy/">Anatomy</a>.) Removal of the
      prepuce substantially reduces erogenous sensation.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,19</a></sup> Therefore (in the appropriate
      cultural context), circumcision is revealed as a sacrifice of
      "sinful" human enjoyment (in this earthly life), for the sake
      of holiness in the afterlife.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p>The Jews adopted circumcision as a religious ritual<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,13,16,20</a></sup> and preserved this
      prehistoric practice into modern times.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,20</a></sup> The circumcision of Abraham
      removed only the very tip that extended beyond the glans
      penis.<sup><a href="#n11">11,20,26,31</a></sup> Moses and his
      sons were not circumcised. (Exodus 4:25) Although Moses
      apparently prohibited circumcision during the 40 years in the
      wilderness,<sup><a href="#n20">20,21,24</a></sup> (Joshua
      5:5) Joshua reinstituted circumcision at Gilgal after the
      death of Moses.<sup><a href="#n20">20,21,24</a></sup> (Joshua
      5:2-10) It is interesting to note that after the Israelites
      were circumcised, they immediately became soldiers in
      Joshua's army for the conquest of Palestine. (Joshua
      6:1-3)</p>

      <p>In contrast to the Jews, the Greeks and the Romans placed
      a high value on the prepuce..<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> The Romans passed several
      laws to protect the prepuce by prohibiting
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> The laws were applied to everyone
      and were not directed against the Jews. <sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>Much later in the Hellenic period, about 140 C.E., the
      Jewish authorities modified circumcision procedure to make it
      impossible for a Jew to appear to be an uncircumcised
      Greek.<sup><a href="#n10">10,11,20,30</a></sup> A radical new
      procedure called <i>peri'ah</i> was introduced by the priests
      and rabbis. In this procedure the foreskin was stripped away
      from the glans, with which it is fused in the infant (See <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal</a>.) In a painful procedure
      known today as a <i>synechotomy</i>, more foreskin was
      removed than before and the injury was correspondingly
      greater. With the introduction of <i>peri'ah</i>, the glans
      could not easily be recovered, and so no Jewish male would
      easily be able to appear as an uncircumcised Greek.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,11,20,31</a></sup> This radical modified
      procedure eventually was adopted by the medical profession
      and is the circumcision operation used today.</p>

      <p>Although Judaism mandated circumcision, not all Jews
      wanted to be circumcised. Several methods of foreskin
      restoration were devised and practiced.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup><sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup><sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <p>It may have been at this time that the <i>Pondus
      Judaeus</i> (also known as <i>Judaeum Pondum</i>), a bronze
      weight worn by Jews on the residual foreskin to stretch it
      back into a foreskin,<sup><a href="#n11">10,11,25</a></sup>
      gained popularity amongst Jewish males. This lessened the
      ugly appearance of the bare exposed circumcised penis.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>
      This restorative procedure was known by the Greek word
      <i>epispasm</i>,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> or "rolling
      inward."</p>

      <p>The third stage of ritual circumcision, the <i>Messisa</i>
      or <i>Metzitzah</i>, was not introduced until the Talmudic
      period (500-625 C.E).<sup><a href="#n11">11,20,25</a></sup>
      In Metzitzah, the <i>mohel</i> (ritual circumciser) sucks
      blood from the penis of the circumcised infant with his
      mouth.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> This procedure has
      been responsible for the death of many Jewish babies due to
      infection.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> In modern times, a
      glass tube is sometimes used instead.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p>The Reform movement within Judaism considered circumcision
      to be a cruel practice.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> The
      Reform movement at Frankfort declared in 1843 that
      circumcision was not necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20,24</a></sup> Theodor Hertzl, the founder of
      Zionism, refused to have his son circumcised.</p>

      <p>The Christians took a strong stand against circumcision in
      the first century. Christians rejected circumcision at the
      Council at Jerusalem.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> (<a
      href="/pages/cultural/christian.html#ACTS15">Acts 15</a>) St.
      Paul, the apostle to the gentiles, taught parents that they
      should not circumcise their children. (<a
      href="/pages/cultural/christian.html#ACTS21">Acts 21:25</a>)
      In a reference to the old practices of genital mutilation,
      St. Paul warned Titus to beware of the "circumcision group."
      (<a href="/pages/cultural/christian.html#TIT1">Titus
      1:10-16</a>)</p>

      <p>The modern use of Hebrew circumcision as a medicalized
      practice dates from about 1865 in England and about 1870 in
      the US.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The procedure
      accepted for medical use essentially was the Jewish
      <i>peri'ah</i>. Moscucci reports that circumcision was
      imposed in an attempt to prevent masturbation.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/history/gollaher/">Gollaher</a> further
      describes the history of medicalized circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> No scientific studies were carried
      out to determine the efficacy and safety of circumcision
      prior to its introduction into medical practice,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> nor were any studies conducted to
      determine the social effects of imposing genital alteration
      surgery on a large portion of the population.</p>

      <p>South Koreans started to circumcise children during the
      American trusteeship following World War II. The American
      cultural practice of circumcision became nearly universal in
      South Korea after the Korean War of 1950-52.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p>In 1949, <a href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a>
      wrote that circumcision was medically unnecessary and
      non-beneficial, and contraindicated because of complications
      and deaths.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The British
      National Health Service (NHS) deleted non-therapeutic
      neonatal circumcision from the schedule of covered procedures
      in 1950. The incidence of neonatal circumcision in the United
      Kingdom declined sharply to a very low level after
      publication of this article after the procedure was delisted
      by the NHS.</p>

      <p>America waited another 20 years before addressing the
      problem of non-therapeutic circumcision. The <i>Journal of
      the American Medical Association</i> published an influential
      <a href="/library/general/preston/">landmark article</a> by
      Dr. E. Noel Preston, Captain, MC, USAF.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Dr. Preston established that there is
      no therapeutic or prophylactic benefit to circumcision. He
      also cited "undesirable psychologic, sexual, and medico-legal
      difficulties."<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>Influenced by Preston, the American Academy of Pediatrics
      (AAP), in 1971, issued a <a
      href="/library/statements/aap#1971">statement</a> that
      "[t]here are no valid medical indications for circumcision in
      the neonatal period."<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> This
      marked the beginning of the end of America's infatuation with
      male circumcision. The incidence of male neonatal
      circumcision in the U.S. peaked in 1971 and began a slow
      decline that continues to the present day.</p>

      <h3>Recent History</h3>

      <p>The AAP convened an "ad hoc Task Force" under the chair of
      Hugh C. Thompson, M.D., to review the issue of circumcision
      in 1975. <a href="/library/statements/aap#1975">The 1975 Task
      Force reaffirmed the 1971 AAP statement</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> The Canadian Paediatric Society
      (CPS) also took a <a
      href="/library/statements/cps1975/">position in 1975</a> that
      circumcision is medically unnecessary.</p>

      <p>The matter rested there until 1985, when retrospective
      data collected from U.S. Army medical records by Thomas
      Wiswell, M.D. seemed to show a somewhat higher rate of
      urinary tract infection (UTI) in non-circumcised boys.
      Careful examination of Wiswell's methods and data revealed
      many methodological flaws which rendered his conclusions
      questionable and unreliable. This created new controversy
      about the value of neonatal circumcision. The <a
      href="/library/statements/cps3/">Canadian Paediatric Society
      examined Wiswell's data in 1989</a> and found it to be
      "insufficiently compelling" to cause it to change its 1975
      policy statement, which is against circumcision.</p>

      <p>The National Organization of Circumcision Information
      Resource Centers (<a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a>) was formed in 1986.
      The mandate of NOCIRC is to provide accurate information
      regarding male circumcision, to promote children's rights,
      and to shed light on the medical mistakes of the past.
      Professor George C. Denniston, M.D., M.P.H., founded <a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/index.html"
       target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a> (DOC) in
      1995 to promote the health advantages of genital integrity
      within the medical community.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/">Circumcision Information and Resource
      Pages</a> (CIRP) were created in 1995 to provide a source of
      accurate information about circumcision on the World Wide
      Web.</p>

      <p>The development of new information in the medical
      literature since 1975 caused the AAP to revisit the matter of
      circumcision in 1989. A new Task Force under the chair of
      Edgar J. Schoen, M.D., examined new data about neonatal pain,
      behavior changes, and loss of sexual sensitivity secondary to
      neonatal circumcision. New data also conclusively established
      the role of the human papillomavirus (HPV) in the
      pathogenesis of genital cancers. This removed any lingering
      belief that the prepuce somehow caused cancer.</p>

      <p>The Canadian Paediatric Society <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">revisited
      the matter of neonatal circumcision</a> in 1996. A new
      evidence-based policy statement was issued that strengthened
      its 1975 recommendation, stating that circumcision is
      medically unnecessary. The CPS recommended: "Circumcision
      should not be routinely performed."</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/statistics/USA/">incidence of
      neonatal circumcision in the US</a> has continued to decline,
      and stood at only 60% in 1996. In the same year, the
      Australian College of Paediatrics (ACP) reported that the <a
      href="/library/statistics/Australia/">incidence of neonatal
      circumcision in Australia</a> has continued its decline to
      10%. The ACP termed circumcision traumatic, a possible
      violation of human rights, and called for parents to be
      provided with full and complete information about
      circumcision before making a decision.</p>

      <p>John R. Taylor and colleagues published a landmark article
      in 1996 that described original research into the anatomy and
      histology of the foreskin. The research showed that the
      foreskin is highly innervated tissue with the characteristics
      of a sensory organ designed to provide erogenous
      sensation.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), in a joint
      statement, reclassified neonatal circumcision from "routine"
      to "elective" in 1997.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> The
      change in policy was announced the year after the publication
      of Taylor's important <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">article</a> that describes in
      detail the injury inherent in every circumcision. This action
      removes any suggestion that circumcision is beneficial or
      that it is recommended by medical authorities. It may also be
      an attempt to shift legal liability for the injury that is
      inherent in every child circumcision from the doctor to the
      parents.</p>

      <p>Persistent criticism of the obvious flaws of the
      supplemental <a href="/library/statements/aap#1989">1989
      Report of the Task Force on Circumcision</a> has caused the
      AAP to distance itself from its own report. The AAP has
      removed its policy statement from its website. The AAP
      convened a new Task Force under the chair of Carole Marie
      Lannon, MD, in 1997 to develop a new <a
      href="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9850.html">evidence-based
      policy statement</a> which was released in March 1999. After
      fully reviewing the medical evidence, the Task Force
      concluded that routine neonatal circumcision cannot be
      recommended because of lack of any proved benefit. It said
      that the benefits are "potential" (i.e. they are
      unproven).</p>

      <p>The Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical
      Association issued a policy report in December 1999 that
      re-classified neonatal circumcision as a "non-therapeutic"
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> This may have a <a
      href="/library/legal/somerville1981/">medico-legal
      impact</a>.</p>

      <p>The ratio of boys circumcised to boys preserved intact
      continues to decline in America. In 2001, it had further
      declined to a ratio of 55 percent circumcised, while the
      percentage of boys preserved intact had risen to 45
      percent.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Highlights</h3>

      <p>The Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica article from the 9th

      history and archaeology, suggest their genesis in the deserts
      of Northeast Africa and the near East, with a subsequent
