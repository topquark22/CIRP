      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Despite an estimated one-sixth of the
      world's men having been circumcised [<a href="#n1">1,2</a>],
      it has long been forgotten where or why this most intriguing
      operation began. The procedure has been performed for
      religious, cultural and medical reasons, although the last
      has only become fashionable since the rise of modern surgery
      in the 19th century. Accordingly, the indications for surgery
      have surfaced, submerged and altered with the trends of the
      day. In this review we explore the origins of circumcision,
      and discuss the techniques and controversies that have
      evolved since the event has become `medicalized'.</p>

      <p><b>The origins</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Anthropologists do not agree on the origins
      of circumcision. The English egyptologist, Sir Graham Elliot
      Smith, suggested that it is one of the features of a
      `heliolithic' culture which, over some 15 000 years ago,
      spread over much of the world. Others believe that it may
      have originated independently within several different
      cultures; certainly, many of the natives that Columbus found
      inhabiting the `New World' were circumcised. However, it is
      known that circumcision had been practised in the Near East,
      patchily throughout tribal Africa, among the Moslem peoples
      of India and of south-east Asia, as well as by Australian
      Aborgines, for as long as we can tell. The earliest Egyptian
      mummies (1300 BCE) were circumcised and wall paintings in
      Egypt show that it was customary several thousand years
      earlier than that [<a href="#n3">3,4</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">In some African tribes, circumcision is
      performed at birth. In Judaic societies, the ritual is
      performed on the eighth day after birth, but for Moslems and
      many of the tribal cultures it is performed in early adult
      life as a `rite of passage', e.g. puberty or marriage. Why
      the practice evolved is not clear and many theories have been
      proposed. Nineteenth century historians suggested that the
      ritual is an ancient form of social control. They conceive
      that the slitting of a man's penis to cause bleeding and pain
      is to remind him of the power of the Church, i.e. `We have
      control over your distinction to be a man, your pleasure and
      your right to reproduce'. The ritual is a warning and the
      timing dictates who is warned; for the new-born it is the
      parents who accede to the Church: `We mark your son, who
      belongs to us, not to you' [<a href="#n5">5</a>]. For the
      young adolescent, the warning accompanies the aggrandisement
      of puberty; the time when growing strength give independence,
      and the rebellion of youth [<a href="#n6">6</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Psychologists have extended this theory to
      incorporate notions of `pain imprinting'. By encoding
      violence on the brain, child-maternal bonding is interrupted
      and a sense of betrayal is instilled in the infant; these are
      considered requisite qualities that enhance the child's
      ability for survival later in life [<a href="#n7">7</a>].
      Indeed, some components of these psychological theories have
      recently been tested in prospective clinical trials and there
      is now evidence that neonates who are circumcised without
      local anaesthetic do have increased pain responses when 4-
      and 6-monthly vaccinations are administered [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>].</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">Others believe that circumcision arose as a
      mark of defilement or slavery [<a href="#n1">1,9</a>] (fig.
      1). In ancient Egypt captured warriors were often mutilated
      before being condemned to the slavery. Amputation of digits
      and castration was common, but the morbidity was high and
      their resultant value as slaves was reduced. However,
      circumcision was just as degrading and evolved as a
      sufficiently humiliating compromise. Eventually, all male
      descendents of these slaves were circumcised. The
      Phoenicians, and later the Jews who were largely enslaved,
      adopted and ritualized circumcision. In time, circumcision
      was incorporated into Judaic religious practice and viewed as
      an outward sign of a covenant between God and man (Genesis
      XVI, Fig. 2).</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">There are many other reasons why
      circumcision may have evolved. Some have suggested that it is
      a mark of cultural identity, akin to a tattoo or a body
      piercing [<a href="#n3">3</a>]. Alternatively, there are
      reasons to believe that the ritual evolved as a fertility
      rite [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. For example, that some tribal
      cultures apportion `seasons' for both the male and female
      operation, supports the view that circumcision developed as a
      sacrifice to the gods, an offering in exchange for a good
      harvest, etc. This would seem reasonable as the penis is
      clearly inhabited by powers that produce life. Indeed,
      evidence of a connection with darvests is also found in
      Nicaragua, where blood from the operations is mixed with
      maize to be eaten during the ceremony [<a
      href="#n1">1,10</a>]. (Fig. 3). Although the true origins of
      circumcision will never be known, it is likely that the truth
      lies in part with all of the theories described.</p>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>From ancient to mediaeval times</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Whatever religious or cultural forces drove
      this practice, historical clues to the surgical aspects of
      circumcision cane be found by chronicling the medical texts.
      However, this approach has its limitations: techniques and
      practitioners were diverse and studying surgical writing
      alone provides an incomplete reflection of the controversies
      that are endemic to all times. Furthermore, was it always
      doctors who performed the procedure in ancient times?
      Probably not: in biblical times it was the mother who
      performed the ceremony on the newborn. Gradually mohels took
      over; men who had the requisite surgical skill and advanced
      religious knowledge. After prayer, the mohel circumcised the
      infant and then blessed the child, a practice little changed
      today [<a href="#n11">11</a>] (Fig. 4a-d). In ancient
      Egyptian society, the procedure was performed by a priest
      with his thumb-nail (often gold-impregnated) and throughout
      mediaeval times it appears to have been largely kept in the
      domain of religious men [<a href="#n12">12</a>].</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">Few mediaeval medical texts describe the
      procedure, although Theodoric (1267) suggests the need for
      `removal of the end part (penis)' in the treatment of `black
      warts and tubercles' [<a href="#n13">13</a>]. He may indeed
      have been describing circumcision in the context of some
      penile pathology. However, it is likely that doctors did not
      perform circumcision until the latter half of the 19th
      century.</p>

      <p><b>The early 19th century</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Brief descriptions of adult circumcision for
      phimosis start to appear in early 19th century textbooks.
      Although the surgical techniques tend not to be described in
      detail, Abernathy (1928) [<a href="#n14">14</a>] who was a
      reluctant surgeon) does report the use of the bistoury
      (knife) to achieve circumcision in men with `gonoccocal
      phimosis'. He also states that the bleeding should be
      `stanched with iodoform and boric', possibly indicating that
      sutures were not applied. Baillie (1833) [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>] also describes gonococcal phimosis and
      recommends that the initial treatment is `nugatory'
      (inoperative) involving the washing of the penis (and under
      the prepuce with soap and tepid water, followed by the
      application of calomel ointment. Abernathy also warns against
      immediate circumcision in the face of a `morbidly sensitive
      surface' (and declares that Sir Edward Home agrees with
      him!). He advocates that the posthitis (inflamed foreskin)
      should be allowed to `soothe and allay' before surgical
      intervention. We can assume that the complications recognized
      by both Abernathy and Baillie were re-phimosis, re-stricture
      or suppuration; what is clear is that circumcision was not a
      procedure taken lightly at that time. Interestingly, neither
      author mentions circumcision in the neonate, suggesting that
      it had not yet significantly entered the domain of English
      surgeons.</p>

      <p><b>Mid-19th to early 20th century</b></p>

      <p class="text1">By the middle of the 19th century,
      anaesthesia and antisepsis were rapidly changing surgical
      practice. The first reported circumcision in the surgical
      accounts of St Bartholomew's Hospital was in 1865; although
      this comprised only one of the 417 operations performed that
      year, it was clearly becoming a more common procedure [<a
      href="#n16">16</a>]. Indeed, this was a time when surgical
      cures were being explored for all ails and in 1878 Curling
      described circumcision as a cure for impotence in men who
      also had as associated phimosis [<a href="#n17">17</a>]. Many
      other surgeons reported circumcision as being beneficial for
      a diverse range of sexual problems [<a href="#n18">18</a>].
      Walsham (1903) re-iterates the putative association of
      phimosis with impotence and suggests that it may also
      predispose to sterility, priapism, excess masturbation and
      even venereal disease [<a href="#n19">19</a>]. Warren (1915)
      adds epilepsy, nocturnal enuresis, night terrors and
      `precocious sexual unrest' to the list of dangers [<a
      href="#n20">20</a>], and this accepted catalogue of `phimotic
      ills' is extended in American textbooks to include other
      aspects of &nbsp;`sexual erethisms' such as homosexuality [<a
      href="#n21">21,22</a>].</p>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Fig. 5.</b> The scissor technique
        described by Sir Frederick Treves (1903). Reproduced from
        [<a href="#n23">23</a>].</font></p>
      </center>

      <p><b>Surgical technique</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The turn of the 19th century was also an
      important time in laying the foundations of surgical
      technique. Sir Frederick Treves (1903) provides us with a
      comprehensive account of basic surgical principles that
      remain today [<a href="#n23">23</a>]. Like most of his
      contemporaries, he used scissors to remove the prepuce (fig.
      5) and describes ligation of the frenular artery as being
      `mandatory' in the adult. He also warns against the excess
      removal of skin, as this may lead to chordee.</p>

      <p class="text2">Treves also maintains that the oppositional
      sutures of the skin edges must be of interrupted `fine
      catgut'. Other surgeons chose to use horse-hair or silk [<a
      href="#n19">19</a>], but irrespective of variations in
      suturing materials, all were agreed that a continuous stitch
      should not be applied. One notable exception was the Master
      Technician and influential French Surgeon E. Doyen, who
      headed his own Institute of Surgical Excellence in Paris
      (L'Institut Doyen). Many foreign surgical trainees passed
      through his department, and together with his English
      collaborator H. Spencer-Browne, they described their
      antihaemorrhagic triradiate continuous circumcision suture
      line [<a href="#n24">24</a>]. Three circular sutures of no. 1
      silk were applied to achieve `coaptation' of the skin edges,
      each one third of the circumference of the glans. The ends
      were not tied so as to allow expansion of the space between
      the two skin layers if necessary (fig. 6a). A compressing
      piece of sterilized muslim was then wrapped over the entire
      distal penis, with a snug hole to allow for the passage of
      the glans (Fig. 6b). The sutures and the muslin were then
      removed after 3-5 days.</p>

        continuous suture of Doyen (1920). (b) Compressive muslin
        dressing.</font></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Such variations in suture application aimed
      at minimizing the most frequent immediate complication of
      haemorrhage. Indeed, the popular urological text of Charles
      Chetwood (1921) recommended leaving long interrupted
      horse-hair sutures so that compressive strips of iodoform and
      petroleum gauze could be securely tied down over the suture
      line (Fig. 7a). Variations on what became known as
      `chetwood's dressing' appeared as recently as Sir Alec
      Badenorch's Manual of Urology in 1953 (Fig 7b) [<a
      href="#n25">25</a>]. This later text is also interesting in
      that measures to prevent haemorrhage within the first 24 h of
      surgery included the administration of stilboestrol to
      prevent erection of the penis. He recommended that this be
      given at a dose of 5 mg three times daily, beginning one day
      before surgery and continued for several days afterwards. He
      also advocated the use of bromide and chloral for similar
      reasons. It is also interesting that the 1974 edition of
      Badenoch's Manual no longer included this advice.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcision techniques have
      evolved in parallel. It is clear from most surgical texts
      that circumcision of the new-born had become a regular
      request for the surgeon by the later part of the 19th
      century. For instance, Jacobsen (1893) [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>] warns of the importance of establishing a
      familial bleeding tendency from the mother before
      circumcision. He describes the case of four Jewish infants,
      each descended from a different grandchild of a common
      ancestress, all of whom died from haemorrhage after
      circumcision. Treves (1903) [<a href="#n23">23</a>] and most
      other contemporary writers note that ligation of the frenular
      arteries is usually not necessary in the neonate and that
      bleeding can usually be controlled by simple pressure. Indeed
      it seems that `crush' with a clamp followed by preputial
      excision rapidly became the template for the operation in
      babies. As such, the last hundred years has seen the
      evolution of various crushing and clamping instruments to
      facilitate the procedure. Doyen (1920) [<a
      href="#n24">24</a>] developed his &eacute;craseur for use in
      neonatal circumcision. The foreskin was crushed and cut in
      four separate manoeuvres with very little concomitant
      bleeding. He was so impressed with the efficacy of this
      instrument that he frequently used it for adult circumcisions
      without (he claimed) the need for additional sutures (Fig.
      8a-c).</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">By the 1930s, many circumcision clamps were
      available for use in the new-born. Indeed, the use of such
      clamps prompted Thomson-Walker [<a href="#n27">27</a>] to
      painstakingly warn of the dangers of injury to the glans when
      such clamps were used, and not surprisingly, more
      sophiticated tools were introduced to protect the penis. The
      prototype of the `Winkelman' was introduced in 1935 and its
      appearance has changed little today. (Fig. 9). However,
      concern not only over the dangers of neonatal circumcision,
      but also of the risks of neonatal anaesthesia lead to the
      development of the `Plastibell' device by the Hollister
      company in the 1950s (Fig. 10). Its use was first reported in
      1956 [<a href="#n28">28</a>] and several favourable reports
      followed [<a href="#n29">29,30</a>]. With the exception of
      the occasional proximal migration of the ring [<a
      href="#n31">31,32</a>], complications are few and the device
      remains in widespread popular use today. More recently
      plastic clamps with integral stell cutting blades have also
      been introduced [<a href="#n33">33</a>]. These include
      instruments such as the Glansguard<sup>TM</sup> (Fig. 11) and
      many other clamps, e.g. the Gomco, Bronstein and Mogen
      variations, are used in different parts of the world.</p>

      <p><b>Alternative procedures</b></p>

      <p class="text1">More than 2000 years of Jewish persecution
      has led to the development of alternative surgical
      procedures. Indeed, `uncircumcision as a measure to offset
      the oppression of Jews is cited in the Old Testament (I
      Maccabees 1:14-15) and surgical attempts to restore the
      prepuce have been well documented throughout history [<a
      href="#n17">17,34,35</a>]. In modern times, this was no more
      true than during the period of Nazi terror, where clandestine
      recontructions were commonplace in a desperate attempt by
      Jewish men to avoid internment [<a href="#n36">36</a>].
      Relics of anti-Semitism are evident throughout history and
      even the statue of Michelangelo's David (a Jew), which was
      erected in Florence in 1504 was carved uncircumcised [<a
      href="#n37">37</a>] (Fig. 12). Not surprisingly, contemporary
      operations to `stretch' the circumcised foreskin are recorded
      in early Renaissance Europe [<a href="#n34">34</a>]. In more
      recent surgical times, surgeons were urged to develop
      alternative procedures to circumcision for men who required
      surgery for phimosis. Cloquet's `V' excision of the foreskin
      in 1900 was a popular means to retain a `cloak' of prepuce
      over the glans, yet still release the phimosis [<a
      href="#n38">38</a>] In 1926, Young and Davies [<a
      href="#n39">39</a>] described a preputial-plasty whereby a
      constricting band of the foreskin was incised and then closed
      by the Heinecke-Mikulicz principle (Fig. 13). Although not
      widely practised, this procedure has stood the test of time
      and recently was shown to be superior to circumcision in a
      comparative study [<a href="#n40">40</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Recurrent paraphimosis has long been held to
      be an indication for circumcision. In most circumstances, it
      can be reduced by manipulation, and circumcision performed
      electively later. However, Walsham (1903) [<a
      href="#n19">19</a>] recommended an alternative approach
      whereby acute division of the paraphimotic band was all that
      was necessary. He suggested that in the presence of such an
      oedematous prepuce, the phimotic band would heal with less
      constriction, and that delayed circumcision would not be
      required (Fig. 14). Young and Davies also described a similar
      procedure whereby a preputial-plasty was performed on the
      constricting band during the acute oedematous phase; the
      prepuce was reduced and the need for a circumcision negated
      (Fig. 15). It is interesting that a `re-invention' of this
      operation has recently been reported [<a
      href="#n41">41</a>].</p>

      <p><b>Understanding the prepuce</b></p>

      <p class="text1">It is surprising that despite the many
      billions of foreskins that have been severed over thousands
      of years, it is only recently that efforts have been made to
      understand the prepuce. The first adequate embyrological
      description of preputial development was published in the
      1930s [<a href="#n42">42</a>]. It was realized that the
      formation of the preputial space occurred by patch
      desquamation of the epithelial cells which were contiguous
      between the glans and the prepuce, a process not necessarily
      complete by birth [<a href="#n43">43</a>]. Indeed the first
      study to address this question was the influential landmark
      report of Douglas Gairdner in 1949 [<a href="#n44">44</a>].
      He concluded that only 4% of foreskins were fully retractile
      at birth, yet 90% were so by the age of 3 years. Of these
      remaining foreskins, most could be rendered retractile by
      gentle manipulation. Recent studies have suggested that by
      the age of 17 years, only 1% remain unretractile [<a
      href="#n45">45</a>]. However, the importance of Gairdner's
      paper was that he was one of the first people to ascribe a
      function to the prepuce. Previous medical texts are notable
      for their absence of comment and some even describe the
      prepuce as a vestigial structure [<a
      href="#n20">20,21,46</a>]. Gairdner made the astute
      observations that the slow period of preputial development
      corresponded with the age of incontinence. He felt that the
      prepuce had a protective role and noted that meatal
      ulceration only occurred in circumcised boys. Recently, a
      doctor writing anonymously in the BMJ provided an analogy
      suggesting that the prepuce is to the glans what the eyelid
      is to the eye [<a href="#n47">47</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">To date, a more definite function cannot be
      ascribed to the prepuce, but as an accessible and ready
      source of fibroblasts, it has become a favourite tissue
      reservoir for cell-culture biologists and hence basic
      scientific research. From this wealth of disparate
      information, it is clear that the foreskin is an
      androgen-dependent structure [<a href="#n48">48</a>] with
      complex intradermal enzyme systems. These confer upon it a
      wide range of metabolic functions, including the differential
      metabolism of various prostaglandins which are copiously
      produced throughout the male and female genital tract [<a
      href="#n49">49</a>]. Certainly, it can be anticipated that
      many other biochemical functions will be defined in the years
      to come; a vestigal structure it almost certainly is not [<a

      <p><b>The controversies</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Notwithstanding the relative disinterest
      over the function of the prepuce, no other operation has been
      surrounded by controversy so much as circumcision. Should it
      be done, then when, why, how and by whom? Religious and
      cultural influences are pervasive, parental confusion is
      widespread and medical indications shift with the trends of
      the day. Doctors divide into camps driven by self-interest,
      self-righteousness and self-defence. It is not surprising
      that some of the most colourful pages in the medical
      literature are devoted to the debate. For instance in 1950,
      Sir James Spence of Newcastle upon Tyne responded to the
      request from a local GP as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <i>`&hellip;Your patient C.D., aetat 7 months, has the
          prepuce with which he was born. You ask me with a note of
          persuasion in your voice, if it should be excised. Am I
          to make a decision on scientific grounds, or am I to
          acquiesce in a rate which took its origin at the behest
          of that arch-sanitarian Moses?&hellip;If you can show
          good reason why a ritual designed to ease the penalties
          of concupiscence amidst the sand and flies of the Syrian
          deserts should be continued in this England, land of
          clean bed-linen and lesser opportunity, I shall listen to
          your arguments &hellip;&hellip;(do you not) understand
          that Nature does not intend it (the foreskin) to be
          stretched and retracted in the Temples of the Welfare
          Centres or ritually removed in the precincts of the
          operating theatres&hellip;'</i> [<a href="#n51">51</a>].
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Literary assaults such as these have served
      to fuel the debates and even a Medline<sup>&reg;</sup> search
      today reveals that in the last year alone, 155 reviews or
      letters have been published arguing for or against routine
      circumcision. However, studying the evolution of the medical
      indications provides us with a pleasing demonstration of how
      controversy drives scientific enquiry. We have already
      described how the surgeons of 100 years ago advocated
      circumcision for a wide variety of conditions, such as
      impotence, nocturnal enuresis, sterility, excess
      masturbation, night terrors, epilepsy, etc. There can be no
      doubt that a large element of surgical self-interest drove
      these claims. However, most of the contemporary textbooks
      also included epithelioma (carcinoma) of the penis amidst the
      morass of complications of phimosis. Although rare, once this
      observation had been made, it presumably filtered down
      through the textbooks by rote, rather than scientific study.
      A few reports had appeared in the early 20th century
      indicating that carcinoma of the penis was rare in
      circumcised men, but not until the debate over neonatal
      circumcision erupted in the medical press in the 1930s that
      this surgical `mantra' was put to the test. In 1932, the
      editor of the Lancet challenged Abraham Wolbarst [<a
      href="#n52">52</a>], a New York urologist, to prove his
      contention (in a previous Lancet editorial), that
      circumcision prevented penile carcinoma. Wolbarst responded
      by surveying every skin, cancer and Jewish hospital in the
      USA, along with 1250 of the largest general hospitals
      throughout the Union. With this survey, he was able to show
      that penile cancer virtually never occurred in circumcised
      men and that the risk related to the timing of the
      circumcision. Over the years this association has been
      reaffirmed by many research workers, although general
      hygiene, demographic and other factors such as human
      papilloma virus and smoking status are probably just as
      important [<a href="#n53">53</a>]. However, Wolbarst
      established that association through formal scientific
      enquiry and proponents of the procedure continue to use this
      as a compelling argument for circumcision at birth.</p>

      <p class="text2">Almost as an extension to the lack of penile
      cancer in Jews, Handley [<a href="#n54">54</a>] reported on
      the infrequency of carcinoma of the cervix in Jewish women.
      He suggested that this related to the fact that Jewish men
      were circumcised. Not surprisingly, this spawned a mass of
      contradictory studies and over the next 50 years the
      champions of both camps have sought to establish the
      importance or irrelevance of circumcision in relation to
      penile cancer. The pendulum has swung both ways and the
      current evidence suggests that other factors are probably
      more important [<a href="#n55">55,56</a>]. A similar debate
      has raged for 50 years over concerns for the risks of urinary
      tract infections in young boys and currently, any decreased
      risk associated with circumcision remains tentative but not
      proven [<a href="#n56">56</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">However, during the two World Wars,
      governments became increasingly interested in reducing the
      risk of venereal disease amongst their soldiers. Clearly,
      such pathology can have a profound effect on the efficiency
      of fighting armis. Indeed, in 1947 the Canadian Army [<a
      href="#n57">57</a>] found that whereas 52% of their soldiers
      had foreskins intact, 77% of those treated for venereal
      disease were uncircumcised. Persuasive arguments to
      circumcise all conscripts were proposed. Furthermore, it was
      an age-old observation, and indigenous African healers had
      promoted circumcision to prevent the transmission of sexually
      transmitted disease for centuries [<a href="#n58">58</a>]. As
      might be expected, the evidence did not withstand further
      scientific scrutiny and numerous contradictions were provided
      [<a href="#n56">56</a>] However, there has recently been
      startling evidence that HIV infection is significantly
      associated with the uncircumcised status [<a
      href="#n59">59</a>]. Indeed, one author has recently
      suggested routine neonatal circumcision on a world-wide scale
      as a long-term strategy for the control of AIDS [<a
      href="#n60">60</a>]: a whole new chapter opens in this
      ancient debate!</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, controversy has arisen over who
      should perform the procedure. Once circumcision had been
      `medicalized' in the 19th century, many surgeons were keen to
      take paying customers away from the religious men. As such,
      doctors were often quick to highlight the unforseen risks
      attendant on a non-medical procedure. For instance, Cabot
      (1924) [<a href="#n61">61</a>] described tuberculosis of the
      penis occurring when Rabbis with infected sputum sucked on
      the baby's penis to stop the bleeding. However, it has often
      been claimed that the incidence of complications in Jewish
      children is very low and that the final result is usually
      better than any hospital doctor can produce [<a
      href="#n62">62, 63</a>]. Naturally, quality control is
      variable and whereas not all commentators have had such
      respect for the religious men [<a href="#n64">64,65</a>],
      others have been quick to indicate the sub-optimal results
      frequently obtained in hospital [<a href="#n29">29</a>]. Not
      surprisingly, disastrous accounts damning practitioners from
      all quarters have embellished the literature on countless
      occasions. Irrespective, the circumcision of young boys has
      become a thriving business for all parties [<a
      href="#n66">66</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">However, with a healthcare budget of $140
      million per year in the USA (1990) [<a href="#n67">67</a>],
      insurance companies eventually forced closer scrutiny.
      Following such pressure, the first Task Force of Neonatal
      Circumcision from the American Academy of Pediatrics (1n
      1975) concluded that there was no valid medical indication
      for this procedure [<a href="#n68">68</a>]. However, the
      pro-circumcision lobby was strong and the task force was
      forced to re-evaluate. In 1989, they conceded that there may
      be certain advantages to neonatal circumcision, although
      their recommendations did stop short of advising routine
      operation [<a href="#n56">56</a>]. Similar pressures in the
      UK have now resulted in only certain Health Authorities being
      prepared to pay for the procedure. These tend to be in
      regions with large ethnic minorities who otherwise may suffer
      form `back street' circumcisions [<a href="#n62">62,
      64</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus it is clear that medical trends are now
      being driven by financial constraints. Perhaps this is
      reflected by the dramatic decline in the number of
      non-religious circumcisions performed over the last half
      century; in the USA an estimated 80% of boys were circumcised
      in 1976 [<a href="#n69">69</a>] but by 1981 this had fallew
      to 61% [<a href="#n67">67</a>], and recent estimates suggest
      that this decrease continues [<a href="#n70">70</a>]. In the
      UK the decline has been even more dramatic: originally more
      common in the upper classes [<a href="#n44">44</a>],
      circumcision rates fell from 30% in 1939 to 20% in 1949 and
      10% by 1963. By 1975 only 6% of British schoolboys were
      circumcised [<a href="#n71">71</a>] and this may well have
      declined further [<a href="#n63">63</a>]. Whether this
      general trend reflects a tempering of attitudes towards the
      persuasive medical rhetoric that has simmered for the past
      100 years, or whether financial considerations have dampened
      enthusiasm, is unknown. Perhaps the First World cultures are
      witnessing an escape from the medical paternalism that has
      gripped them for so long, or even that the age-old ritual is
      simply no longer fashionable in modern peoples; again, it is
      unknown. However, whatever the current trend, ebbing or
      flowing, we can be sure that the controversies of
      circumcision will continue to colour the medical literature,
      far into the future.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Many historical accounts of circumcision
      have been written and most authors have used their survey to
      form an opinion as to whether the neonatal procedure is
      justified. The weak medical arguments are tempered by the
      importance of cultural and religious factors. In truth, the
      real reasons why circumcision has evolved are much broader.
      Opponents of the ritual draw attention to the `rights' of the
      new-born, which, they argue, mut be upheld [<a
      href="#n66">66</a>]. Others contest that humans are social
      animals and cannot survive alone; they require their parents,
      community and culture to thrive, and, as such, `rights'
      belong to the group, not to the individual. If there is an
      inherent survival advantage to a group of humans who chose to
      maim their young, then this is presumably evidenced by their
      continued survival as a race [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. In
      short, to conclude any historical reflection with a reasoned
      `right' or `wrong', would be like claiming to have fathomed
      human nature itself. Consider this; mankind has developed
      this strange surgical signature that is so pervasive, that in
      the last five minutes alone, another 120 boys throughout the
      world have been circumcised.</p>
