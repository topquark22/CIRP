      <h2>Care of Uncircumcised Penis</h2>

      <p><i>To the Editor</i>.&mdash;</p>

      <p class="text2">The controversy regarding circumcision and
      urinary tract infections following the article by Drs.
      Wiswell and Roscelli has not addressed one important
      factor&mdash;what kind of care is appropriate for an intact
      boy. <span class="yellow">After 40 years of pediatric
      practice, I am firmly convinced that the best hygiene is to
      keep hands off and leave the prepuce alone.</span> I have had
      many infants with problems from inadequate and poorly done
      circumcisions; similarly, I have had many uncircumcised
      infants who got into trouble when a "helpful" nurse, doctor,
      or grandmother forcibly retracted and cleaned a tight
      prepuce. <span class="yellow">In an area where many infants
      are uncircumcised because of culture, I have never seen a
      problem when the mother just left it the way the Lord made
      it&mdash;no retractions, no vigorous cleansing, just left it
      alone.</span> Admittedly, I may have missed some of the
      urinary infections they described. However, in comparing the
      circumcised with the uncircumcised, we need to know what kind
      of care or hygiene was given to the prepuce. Historically,
      many "scientific interventions" have proven to be more
      injurious than helpful. Perhaps vigorous cleaning of the
      prepuce and glans penis are in that category.</p>
