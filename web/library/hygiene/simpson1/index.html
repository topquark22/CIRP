      <h1>The management of the<br />
       paediatric foreskin</h1>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="abs">There are many conflicting opinions among
      health professionals and parents regarding care of the normal
      foreskin in young boys as well as the highly controversial
      subject of circumcision.<br />
       Minor foreskin related complaints are very common in the
      first few years of life. Most of these can be managed
      conservatively with advice and reassurance, or with medical
      treatment alone. Circumcision is very rarely indicated in
      young boys, particularly under the age of 5 years. The issue
      of circumcision for non medical reasons, that is, religious,
      ethnic or personal, remains controversial.</p>

      <p class="author"><span class="name"><b>Errol T
      Simpson,</b></span> <i>MB, ChB, FRACS, is a paediatric
      surgeon at <a
      href="http://www.canberrahospital.act.gov.au/main.htm"
      target="_blank">The Canberra Hospital</a>, ACT</i>. <span

      <br />
       

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">D</span>uring the past 20
      years, there has been a progressive reduction in the number
      of circumcisions performed in Australia for social,
      religious, ethnic or personal reasons.<sup><a href="#n1">1
      2</a></sup> Most Australian males over about 20 years of age
      are circumcised, while only about 20% of boys born in 1995/96
      have been circumcised.<sup><a href="#n1">1 2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As a result of this changing social trend,
      with many adult males circumcised while their sons may not
      be, many parents and health professionals have a degree of
      uncertainty in relation to the anatomy and physiology of the
      foreskin. Consequently, parents frequently receive
      conflicting advice about a perceived problem with their young
      son's foreskin.</p>

      <h4>Normal foreskin anatomy</h4>

      <p class="text1">At birth, the inner layer of the prepuce is
      firmly adherent to the glans and is unable to be retracted at
      all. These adhesions are formed early in foetal development
      and serve to protect the developing glans.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Separation of these adhesions occurs
      slowly over the next few years and there is great variability
      in the timing of this event. It has been classically stated
      that the foreskin should be fully retractable by the age of
      three years. <span class="yellow">However, this can occur as
      early as the first few months in some boys and not until 9 or
      10 years in others.</span><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      Almost all the perceived foreskin problems in young boys
      relate to the existence of subpreputial adhesion.</p>

      <h3>Common foreskin related complaints</h3>

      <h4>Phimosis</h4>

      <p class="text1">The term phimosis is broadly regarded as
      describing a foreskin that is unable to retract. However, it
      is very important to distinguish between true pathologic
      phimosis from the normal anatomic situation where the
      infantile adhesions have not yet separated. In the latter
      situation, the tip of the foreskin is supple and unscarred
      and is likely to retract normally and fully in time
      (<i>Figure 1</i>).</p>

      <center>
        <img src="simpson1-fig1.jpg" width="250" height="198"
        alt="Figure one" /><br />
        <br />
        <img src="simpson1-fig2.gif" width="250"
        alt="Figure two" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">True pathologic phimosis occurs when
      fibrosis, induration and scarring occur in the tip of the
      foreskin usually secondary to inflammation or trauma
      (<i>Figure 2</i>). Phimosis may also be due to lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus.<sup><a href="#n5">5 6</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Ballooning</h4>

      <p class="text1">Ballooning refers to the swelling of the
      subpreputial area as urine becomes temporarily trapped under
      the foreskin during micturition. This probably occurs as a
      result of the stream being diverted by the adhesions. <span
      class="yellow">This phenomenon is not pathologic, usually
      causes no distress or discomfort to the boy and generally
      requires no treatment.</span></p>

      <h4>Smegma collections</h4>

      <p class="text1">Smegma is a creamy yellow sebaceous material
      that is secreted by the glans and often accumulates in clumps
      under the foreskin. These are often mistaken for cysts or pus
      collections, but require no treatment and will release once
      the foreskin retracts naturally.</p>

      <h4>Balanitis</h4>

      <p class="text1">Mild inflammatory changes with redness and
      some discomfort are often encountered in young boys,
      particularly while still in nappies, as a result of ammonical
      dermatitis (<i>Figure 3</i>). True balanitis or posthitis is
      usually staphylococcal in origin and responds well to simple
      cleaning and appropriate oral antibiotics.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="simpson1-fig3.jpg" width="250" height="204"
        alt="Figure three" />
      </center>

      <h3>Management</h3>

      <h4>Normal foreskin</h4>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">No attempt should be
      made to retract a foreskin in a child unless significant
      separation of the subpreputial adhesions has occurred.</span>
      Failure to observe this basic rule may result in tearing with
      subsequent fibrosis and consequent true phimosis. However,
      once the foreskin is able to be retracted, this should be
      performed every time bathing occurs and the penis cleaned as
      part of normal male hygiene.</p>

      <p class="text2">Penile cancer and sexually transmitted
      diseases have been reported as occurring more commonly in
      uncircumcised adults.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>
      However, it seems illogical in the extreme to advocate
      circumcision to prevent these afflictions. Penile hygiene and
      safe sex education are likely to be far more effective in
      this pursuit.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mild redness of the foreskin requires only
      cleaning., while significant ammonical dermatitis may require
      some form of barrier cream.</p>

      <p class="text2">Ballooning and smegma collection require no
      treatment, unless they are responsible for specific
      symptoms.</p>

      <h4>The abnormal foreskin</h4>

      <p class="text1">True <b>pathologic phimosis</b> with
      fibrosis and scarring may result in permanent
      non-retractability, obstruction to urine flow and
      <b>recurrent balanoposthitis</b> and constitutes the only
      reliable absolute indication for circumcision. Lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus is a skin disease of unknown origin
      that affects the genital area of males and causes phimosis,
      glandular scarring and meatal stenosis.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> It is responsible for about 15-20% of
      cases of true phimosis in boys requiring circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In boys over about 5 years of age who have
      delayed separation of subpreputial adhesions, the use of
      topical steroid cream will improve the situation in the
      majority of cases.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Even some
      cases of true phimosis may respond to steroid application and
      this modality is certainly worth attempting for a month or so
      before considering circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Paraphimosis</b> is an acute condition
      that develops when the foreskin is fully retracted but is
      then unable to be returned to its pre-retraction situation
      (<i>Figure 4</i>), with the subsequent onset of swelling and
      discomfort. This condition requires urgent intervention in
      the form of manual reduction by applying sustained gentle
      pressure to the swollen prepuce. This usually requires a
      general anaesthetic, however, in early cases, it can be
      achieved with sedation and analgesia alone. It is unusual for
      paraphimosis to recur and a single episode is not an
      indication for circumcision.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="simpson1-fig4.jpg" width="250" height="198"
        alt="Figure four" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis or balanoposhitis, in the absence
      of true phimosis will usually respond to oral antibiotics or
      topical cleaning. <span class="yellow">A single episode of
      balanitis is certainly not an indication for circumcision and
      recurrent balanitis in the absence of true phimosis can
      usually be managed non-surgically, particularly in boys under
      about 5 years of age.</span></p>

      <h3>Circumcision</h3>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">The Australasian
      Association of Paediatric Surgeons does not support the
      circumcision of normal male neonates, infants or children in
      Australia.</span><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> However,
      many parents still wish to have their boys circumcised for
      religious, ethnic, or personal reasons. If these procedures
      are performed, they should be done after 6 months of age,
      under general anaesthetic in safe, controlled, appropriate
      paediatric facilities.</p>

      <p class="text2">Contraindications to circumcision include
      hypospadias or other congenital conditions of the penis, sick
      and unstable infants and a family history of a bleeding
      disorder.</p>

      <h4>Indications</h4>

      <p class="text1">Phimosis which is not responsive to topical
      steroid application;<br />
      Recurrent symptomatic balanitis in older boys;<br />
      Recurrent paraphimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Virtually the only indication for
      circumcision in boys under 5 years of age are those who have
      major structural urinary tract abnormalities, such as
      posterior urethral valves or significant vesico-ureteric
      reflux. It is well documented that bacteruria is more common
      in uncircumcised boys<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> and
      circumcision in some of these children may prevent some of
      the serious consequences of bacteruria associated with other
      abnormalities of the urinary tract. <span
      class="yellow">However, circumcision is not indicated in boys
      with normal urinary tracts.</span></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: The authors state that
      bacteruria is more common in circumcised boys. However, this
      remains controversial. See <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/">Circumcision and Urinary Tract
      Infection</a> for more information.]</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="text1">It is usual for the foreskin to be
      non-retractable in the early years of life, even up to age
      8-10 years. There is wide variability in terms of the age at
      which retraction occurs. Until complete retraction occurs,
      episodes of redness, smegma collections and ballooning of the
      foreskin are very common and can be managed symptomatically.
      Frequently, reassurance is all that is required.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are very few medical indications for
      circumcision and this is particularly true under 5 years of
      age. <span class="yellow">Circumcision for non-medical
      reasons should be discouraged.</span> However, if parents
      feel strongly about the issue, safe circumcision outside of
      the newborn period should be made available to them. While
      circumcision is regarded as a minor operation, consideration
      should be given to meticulous anaethesia, analgesia and
      surgical technique. With continued social trends away from
      routine non medical circumcision, the general awareness of
      the community relating to the mystique of the foreskin should
      improve.</p>
