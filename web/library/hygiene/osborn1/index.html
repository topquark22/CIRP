      <p><font face="arial"><b>ABSTRACT.</b></font> A written
      questionnaire was used to determine the advice pediatricians
      give concerning hygienic care of uncircumcised infants. A
      telephone survey was conducted in which new mothers were
      asked what they had been told about general hygiene and how
      they were caring for their infants. Pediatricians&rsquo;
      advice concerning hygiene in uncircumcised infants varied
      widely. Most counseled mothers to retract the foreskin and
      clean the child, but few (22%) knew when this could be
      readily accomplished. None of the mothers of uncircumcised
      boys had been told when the foreskin could be expected to
      retract, and only half had been given any advice concerning
      hygiene. Mothers of infants whose foreskins had been
      manipulated by physicians felt this practice was traumatic.
      Both this and the stress of caring for their infants without
      adequate instruction caused 40% of the mothers to state they
      would choose to have their next child circumcised.
      Recommendations for hygienic care of uncircumcised infants
      are given.<br />

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The merits of
      circumcision have been widely debated in the
      literature.<sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> As studies have
      failed to show benefits from the procedure, the value of
      routine circumcision has been questioned.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> In 1975, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics Ad Hoc Committee on Circumcision stated that a
      &ldquo;program of education leading to continuing good
      personal hygiene would offer all of the advantages of routine
      circumcision without the attendant surgical
      risk.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> No such
      educational program was outlined by the committee, and <span
      class="yellow">a review of the pediatric literature revealed
      no information concerning what constituted good hygiene, nor
      what advice mothers of uncircumcised infants should be
      given.</span></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the
      study was to determine what advice pediatricians give and how
      mothers interpret that advice.</p>

      <p><font face="arial"><b>METHODOLOGY</b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A brief questionnaire
      was mailed to all 146 members of the local pediatric society,
      excluding house-staff. Multiple choice questions were asked
      concerning the respondent&rsquo;s opinion about the incidence
      of circumcision, the incidence of infections in uncircumcised
      children, and when the foreskin could first be easily
      retracted. A written response was required to a single
      question concerning the respondent&rsquo;s advice about the
      care of uncircumcised infants.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A telephone survey of
      new mothers was conducted. Contacts were made by reviewing
      the birth announcements of Salt Lake City&rsquo;s two
      newspapers. The names of parents of infants born six months
      prior to the study were then matched with the numbers in the
      local telephone directory. The announcements of consecutive
      days were reviewed. Calls were made both during the day and
      evening hours until 108 mothers were surveyed. An additional
      100 calls were made attempting to survey more mothers of
      uncircumcised infants. When this procedure still failed to
      yield an adequate number of uncircumcised infants, the
      records of a local hospital were reviewed. The parents of
      infants with no record of circumcision were contacted when a
      telephone number was available.</p>

      <p><font face="arial"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 146
      questionnaires mailed to pediatricians, 90 were returned,
      giving a response rate of 62%. Sixty-two percent of the
      respondents stated they counseled routinely about
      circumcision; 38% did not. Several wrote unsolicited comments
      indicating that the obstetrician had already circumcised the
      infants before they had an opportunity to speak with the
      mother. When asked to estimate the incidence of uncircumcised
      males in their practice, most said fewer than 5% were
      uncircumcised (Table 1). Sixty-one percent felt the incidence
      of circumcision over the past five years had remained the
      same; 4% felt it had increased. Seven percent did not
      respond. Most shared the opinion that the incidence of
      infection in uncircumcised males was low (Table 2). In
      response to the question, &ldquo;At what age should the
      foreskin retract easily in most children?&rdquo; 47%
      responded that this would occur by the age of 6 months, while
      an additional 20% said this would occur by the age of 1 year
      (Table 3).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advice given for
      hygienic care varied greatly. Some (10%) felt it was
      necessary to manipulate the foreskin while the child was in
      the newborn nursery. Others (3%) claimed that the foreskin
      should never be retracted. Most stated that they instructed
      the mothers to retract the foreskin and clean the child each
      time he was bathed, but our data showed that few knew when
      this could readily be accomplished. (Table 4).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the phone survey,
      108 mothers were contacted. Of these infants 105 were
      circumcised; three were not. Ninety-two (85%) of the mothers
      of circumcised infants stated that they had been given
      instructions for hygienic care. Of those receiving advice,
      80% had been told specifically to retract the foreskin from
      the glands and clear underneath. The remaining 20% had been
      instructed simply to bathe the penis daily.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty in
      locating uncircumcised infants was surprising. Fifteen
      mothers of uncircumcised infants were eventually contacted.
      The incidence of circumcision in the state of Utah is about
      87% (T. J. Metcalf et al, unpublished observation, 1979), yet
      only three uncircumcised infants were found in more than 200
      telephone contacts. No telephone numbers were listed for
      approximately 75% of the parents whose children had no
      hospital record of circumcision. People with either unlisted
      telephone numbers or no telephone numbers tend to be
      middle-income, young, or transient.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8,9</a></sup> The correlation between
      noncircumcision and the lack of a telephone number suggests a
      corresponding distribution of parents who do not have their
      infants circumcised.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the15 mothers
      whose infants were not circumcised, eight were given no
      advice concerning hygienic care. The remaining seven mothers
      were told to retract the foreskin daily while bathing the
      baby. None was told when the foreskin should retract easily.
      Physicians freed adhesions and retracted the foreskin in
      seven infants, one during the newborn period and an
      additional six prior to the age of 6 months. Six (40%) of the
      mothers were dissatisfied with the outcome. They felt
      hygienic care was difficult, and would choose to have their
      next male infant circumcised.</p>

      <p><font face="arial"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">recommendations</a> of
      the American Academy of Pediatrics have made little impact on
      the incidence of circumcision in the state of Utah; over the
      past five years the number of uncircumcised males has
      remained relatively small (T. J. Metcalf et al, unpublished
      observations, 1979). Thus pediatricians are not often faced
      with the need for giving advice to mothers of uncircumcised
      infants. This study reveals that pediatricians routinely give
      excellent advice to mothers of circumcised infants, and that
      mothers seemed to follow that advice. Few mothers of
      uncircumcised infants, however were given adequate
      information.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">Most pediatricians in our study did not know
      when the foreskin should retract easily</span>. A <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">study</a> by
      Gairdner<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> in 1949 showed that
      the foreskin was retractable in 25% of 6-month-old infants,
      50% of 1-year-old infants, 80% of 2-year-old children, and
      90% of 4-year-old children. A <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">study</a> by Oster<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> supports Gairdner's findings,
      indicating that a tight prepuce or phimosis was rare in
      Danish boys between the ages of 6 and 17. As can be seen in
      Table 4, the percentage of pediatricians correctly estimating
      the age when the foreskin can be retracted increased with the
      number of years in practice, an indication that this
      knowledge was learned empirically rather than during
      pediatric training.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">The seven mothers whose infants&rsquo;
      foreskins were retracted by the physicians expressed concern
      and distress over the practice. In two infants this procedure
      was repeated. These parents stated that even after the
      foreskin had been retracted in the office, it had again
      adhered to the glans despite efforts to clean the infant
      daily.</span> Gairdner's data indicate that this practice is
      unnecessary. The discomfort of the above described procedure
      and the anxiety of providing care without instructions caused
      40% of these parents to state that they would have the next
      male infant circumcised.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only written
      information the authors could find concerning hygienic care
      of uncircumcised infants was this statement found in <i>The
      Parenting Advisor:</i> &ldquo;&hellip;retract the foreskin
      gently and return the foreskin to its normal position to
      prevent constriction and swelling.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As demonstrated in
      this study, <span class="yellow">the need for recommendations
      concerning hygienic care of uncircumcised children is
      indicated by the pediatricians lack of knowledge concerning
      uncircumcised children, parental dissatisfaction stemming
      from the difficulty of caring for their infants without
      adequate advice, and the lack of written information about
      hygienic care in the uncircumcised infant.</span></p>

      <p><font face="arial"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The authors make the
      following recommendations for hygienic care in uncircumcised
      infants:</p>

      <blockquote>
        1. <span class="yellow">The foreskin should not be
        manipulated in the newborn nursery.</span><br />
         2. Parents should be given the above quoted advice found
        in <i>The Parenting Advisor</i>.<br />
         3. When the child is 4 years old, the mother should show
        the child how to retract the foreskin and wash. The child
        can then be expected to care for himself after a period of
        adult supervision.<br />
         4. <span class="yellow">The office practice of freeing
        adhesions and subsequent retraction of the foreskin is
        unnecessary.</span>
