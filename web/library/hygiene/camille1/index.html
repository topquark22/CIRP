      <h2>Caring for the uncircumcised penis:<br />
       What parents (and you) need to know</h2>

      <p><b>By Cynthia J. Camille, FNP, CPNP, Ramsay L. Kuo, MD,
      and John S. Wiener, MD</b></p>

      <p class="abs">A declining circumcision rate means more and
      more parents need to be educated about care of their son's
      foreskin and more pediatricians need to be prepared to manage
      problems associated with an uncircumcised penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although still very common, routine neonatal
      circumcision has been declining in prevalence in the United
      States in recent years.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      Pediatricians are seeing more uncircumcised boys among their
      patients and, in turn, encountering more parents asking for
      advice on care of the prepuce. Many parents&mdash;and many
      physicians&mdash;are unfamiliar with normal development of
      the penis and foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this article, we do not address in depth
      the pros and cons of neonatal circumcision. Rather, we focus
      on the development and routine care of the normal,
      uncircumcised penis, as well as management of common
      associated problems.</p>

      <h3>A change in thinking and in practice</h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision has been a controversial topic
      in both professional and lay circles for a number of years.
      The procedure has historically been performed for cultural,
      religious, and medical reasons. Opposition to routine
      neonatal circumcision has been vocal, and medical indications
      have been revisited over the past three decades. The American
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued several policy
      statements during this period, the most recent in 1999.
      Current AAP recommendations state that while there are
      potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision, the
      data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although accurate data on the prevalence of
      routine circumcision are lacking, it is known that
      approximately 80% of males born in the US in the years after
      World War II were circumcised; that percentage increased with
      the percentage of hospital births.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The number declined slightly when some
      voices in the medical establishment began to question the
      value of the procedure. Most recent estimates of the rate of
      neonatal circumcision are in the range of 60% to 65%, with a
      noted difference across racial and ethnic groups.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> When other variables are controlled,
      data from the National Health and Social Life Survey for the
      years 1933 to 1974 show that the rate of circumcision for
      whites was 81%; for blacks, 65%; and for Hispanics,
      54%.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Despite some convergence
      in the circumcision rate for the three groups across cohorts,
      differences among racial and ethnic groups persist.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> With the Hispanic population in the US
      growing, uncircumcised males are being seen even more often
      in pediatric practice.</p>

      <h3>Penile anatomy</h3>

      <p class="text1">At eight weeks' gestation, the skin of the
      body of the penis begins growing forward over the developing
      glans penis, initially as a ridge of thickened epidermis. The
      prepuce grows more quickly dorsally than ventrally, where
      full development depends on final formation of the glanular
      urethra. This explains why the foreskin is usually deficient
      ventrally in cases of hypospadias.</p>

      <p class="text2">If all proceeds normally, the prepuce is
      complete by 16 weeks' gestation. The squamous epithelial
      lining of the inner prepuce is contiguous with the glans at
      this stage, so that preputial adhesions are a normal part of
      development, not a pathologic state.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> Desquamated skin cells become
      entrapped on the glans beneath the adhered prepuce, leading
      to formation of preputial cysts, also known as keratin
      pearls. The rupture of these cysts allows progressive
      separation of the inner prepuce from the glans. Penile
      growth, along with intermittent erection, aids in the process
      that eventually completely separates the prepuce from the
      glans to form the preputial space (Figure 1). This process
      begins late in gestation and proceeds at varying rates during
      childhood; therefore, the age when the prepuce is completely
      retractable also varies.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup>
      Complete retraction past the corona is possible in at least
      90% of boys by 5 years of age. <span class="cirp">[CIRP
      Comment: The previous statement is based on outmoded
      information. For more information on the age of foreskin
      retraction, see <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal</a>.]</span> In contrast,
      <span class="yellow">some boys will not have complete
      separation of the prepuce circumferentially beyond the corona
      until accelerated penile growth occurs at puberty.</span></p>

      <h3>Advising parents on routine care</h3>

      <p class="text1">Parents of a newly circumcised boy receive
      instructions on care of the infant's penis, but parents whose
      son is not circumcised typically receive no such advice. As a
      result, many parents have misconceptions. <span
      class="yellow">The most common misconception encountered in
      our practice is that the foreskin is completely retractable
      early in life and that complete retraction is necessary to
      keep the penis clean and prevent infection.</span> Many
      consults are prompted by parental concerns about the presence
      of congenital adhesions or by questions about the need for
      circumcision to prevent irritation and infection. Many
      parents and physicians are unaware that preputial adhesions
      are normal and that they resolve on their own at an
      individual pace.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Parents should be
      educated to avoid forcible retraction of the prepuce; the
      tearing that may result could lead to fibrosis and subsequent
      true phimosis (discussed later) or pathologic adhesions, or
      both.</span><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the infant, washing the penis with a
      cloth and water is adequate to keep the penis clean. If a
      mild soap is used, the penis should be rinsed well to avoid
      irritation. However, we typically counsel parents to avoid
      using soap. Once preputial adhesions have separated
      naturally, typically around the age of toilet training, the
      foreskin will be retractable and should be retracted with
      routine bathing. After cleaning, it is helpful to retract the
      foreskin again to dry the glans and prevent irritation from
      moisture trapped under the foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mild redness of the foreskin or glans is
      common, particularly in the infant and young child still in
      diapers, and usually requires only cleaning. Focal erythema
      may occur sporadically as preputial cysts break through
      adhesions to allow separation of the prepuce from the glans.
      These whitish cysts are sometimes mistaken for pus due to
      infection, but they merely represent sterile collections of
      desquamated skin (Figure 2). More significant dermatitis may
      require a barrier cream with zinc oxide.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="figure2.jpg" alt="Figure two" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Some physicians believe that <span
      class="yellow">the foreskin should be left alone until the
      child is old enough to retract it on his own.</span> There is
      no consensus about the appropriate age to teach penile
      hygiene, including regular retraction of the foreskin. We
      recommend teaching the school-age child to retract and clean
      beneath the foreskin at least once a week as part of routine
      hygiene, whether complete retraction is possible or not.
      Others advocate waiting until puberty, when complete
      retraction is readily achieved.</p>

      <h3>History and physical examination</h3>

      <p class="text1">Assessment at well-infant and well-child
      exams should address any concerns about the appearance of the
      genitalia. Retractability of the prepuce should be assessed
      by history as well as on examination. In the infant it is
      usually, but not always, possible to visualize the meatus
      (Figure 3). Rarely, in cases of pathologic phimosis, the
      urinary stream may be blocked, causing ballooning of the
      prepuce with urination or deflection of the urinary
      stream.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="figure3.jpg" alt="Figure three" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Evaluate the degree of foreskin retraction
      and meatal location and size by gentle traction. Avoid
      forcible retraction. As the child grows, the foreskin should
      gradually become more retractable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Trauma or infection of the glans
      (<i>balanitis</i>) can cause erythema and edema. The term
      <i>balanoposthitis</i> refers to inflammation of the glans
      and prepuce. Purulent discharge from the thickened and
      erythematous preputial orifice is the usual sign (Figure 4).
      Patients often complain of dysuria, making the distinction
      between balanoposthitis and true urinary tract infection
      difficult.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> A reliable urine
      specimen cannot be obtained because voided urine or a
      "sterile" collection catheter must pass through the
      contaminated preputial space, which cannot be cleansed
      adequately. A suprapubic tap can obtain a urine specimen
      directly from the bladder without the risk of preputial
      contamination, but is not commonly done. Distinguishing
      between balanoposthitis and urinary tract infection is,
      therefore, often a matter of clinical judgment. Purulent
      drainage from the preputial orifice and preputial swelling
      and erythema are not usually seen with a urinary tract
      infection. The common causative organisms of balanoposthitis
      are coliform, such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Proteus
      vulgaris</i>,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> so empiric
      antibacterial therapy would likely cover a diagnosis of
      either balanoposthitis or urinary tract infection.</p>

        <img src="figure4.jpg" alt="Figure four" />
      </center>

      <h3>Management of phimosis</h3>

      <p class="text1">In caring for the uncircumcised male, <span
      class="yellow">it is necessary to differentiate between
      physiologic phimosis and pathologic phimosis.</span> Phimosis
      refers to a prepuce that is nonretractable, as is usually the
      case in the newborn. <i>Physiologic phimosis</i> is present
      in nearly all newborn males because of congenital adhesions
      of the prepuce to the glans proximal to the urethral meatus.
      As noted, in most infants retraction allows visualization of
      the urethral meatus but not of the remainder of the
      glans.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>True</i>, or <i>pathologic</i>,
      <i>phimosis</i> is defined as the presence of an abnormal
      ring of tissue, which prevents sufficient retraction of
      foreskin to allow visualization of the meatus. The fibrotic
      preputial ring, or cicatrix, of tissue is distal to the glans
      and prevents retraction and routine hygiene. A cicatrix may
      form following scarring from forcible retraction or following
      episodes of balanoposthitis.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      The symptoms of pathologic phimosis include secondary
      unretractability of the foreskin after retractability at an
      earlier age, irritation or bleeding from the preputial
      orifice, dysuria, ballooning of the prepuce upon voiding,
      acute urinary retention, and, rarely, chronic urinary
      retention and obstructive changes in the upper urinary
      tracts.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Ballooning of the
      prepuce with voiding is common in infancy but is usually
      harmless, self-limited, and not indicative of urinary
      obstruction. (Ballooning after infancy is less common and may
      represent pathologic phimosis.)</p>

      <p class="text2">Pathologic phimosis has been traditionally
      treated surgically with circumcision. Although circumcision
      is effective, it is not without complications, particularly
      in older infants and boys who must undergo general
      anesthesia. The risks include anesthetic complications,
      bleeding, infection, meatal stenosis, penile or urethral
      injury, discomfort, and possible psychological consequences.
      These risks, as well as financial considerations, are all
      reasons to pursue nonsurgical alternatives to therapy.
      Parents often made a conscious decision not to circumcise
      their son and are reluctant to give consent for circumcision
      at a later age. <span class="yellow">Recently, the use of
      topical steroid treatment has been shown to be an effective
      and safe alternative to surgical intervention, with success
      rates ranging from 67% to 95% and no reported adverse
      effects.</span><sup><a href="#n5">5&ndash;7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A retrospective review of boys with
      pathologic phimosis seen in our pediatric urology clinic in
      2000 revealed 20 patients, age 8 months to 14 years (mean,
      5.8 years), who were placed on topical steroid
      therapy.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> The parents were
      instructed to retract the foreskin until the phimotic band
      prevented further retraction and to apply betamethasone
      dipropionate 0.05% cream on the constricting band twice a day
      for four to eight weeks. A successful outcome was defined as
      resolution of the phimotic band allowing foreskin retraction
      proximal to the meatus. Partial retraction allowed
      visualization of the meatus and at least 50% of the glans in
      cases with persistent congenital adhesions preventing
      complete retraction proximal to the corona. Of the 20
      patients, 17 (85%) had a successful outcome. Eleven patients
      had a completely retractable foreskin, whereas six became
      partially retractable. Often, a response was seen in less
      than two weeks. (For this reason, we now recommend a
      four-week, rather than eight-week, course of therapy.)
      Patients who were successfully treated have not had
      recurrence of phimosis. Two patients developed temporary
      paraphimosis (in which the retracted prepuce becomes trapped
      proximal to the corona) when their foreskins were left
      retracted, but these were easily reduced by the parents and
      no medical attention was needed. No patient has had any
      apparent side effect from the topical steroid treatment.
      Three patients did not respond to therapy. The mean age of
      patients with fully retractable foreskins following therapy
      was 6.7 years, compared with a mean of 3.8 years for those
      with partially retractable foreskins. These findings
      correlate with the finding of a higher prevalence of glanular
      adhesions in younger patients.</p>

      <p class="text2">The efficacy results of our study correspond
      to those reported previously. The major variable accounting
      for differences in the efficacy rate between studies is the
      definition of successful outcome. Some groups considered any
      result short of complete foreskin retractability a treatment
      failure.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Others have defined
      success as achieving, at minimum, partial retraction to the
      limit of congenital adhesions.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      As expected, those studies adhering to the stricter
      definition for success have lower overall efficacy results.
      Our study chose to include partial retractions as success
      because adhesions of the foreskin to the glans are common in
      young boys, and resolve spontaneously. These proximal
      adhesions should not be considered a contributing factor to
      phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">The cost-effectiveness of therapy for
      phimosis has been reviewed, comparing medical and surgical
      interventions. <span class="yellow">The most cost-effective
      management was topical steroid therapy, which resulted in a
      75% savings compared with circumcision.</span><sup><a
      href="#n9">9,10</a></sup> In our hospital pharmacy, a 15 g
      tube of betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream sells for
      $9.52, and is usually sufficient for the typical four-week
      course of therapy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the proven efficacy of topical
      steroids in treating persistent phimosis, concern exists
      about potential side effects&mdash;specifically, suppression
      of the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis from
      systemic absorption of topical steroids. Systemic absorption
      is enhanced by inflammation, use over a large surface area,
      prolonged use, and use of an occlusive dressing.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Golubovic and colleagues included
      measurement of the morning cortisol level in patients
      receiving betamethasone dipropionate cream for phimosis and
      found no differences in the treatment group vs.
      controls.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Orsola and
      colleagues reported a series of 137 boys treated with
      betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% who had no signs of skin
      atrophy or systemic absorption.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      Four of these subjects were younger than 2 years. We,
      therefore, believe that betamethasone dipropionate can be
      used safely in small amounts for one or two months, despite
      lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration for use
      in persons younger than 16 years. (Instructions for parents
      on treating phimosis with betamethasone dipropionate are
      provided in the "Guidelines for treating phimosis with
      steroid cream" box.)</p>

      <p class="text2">The mechanism of effect of betamethasone
      dipropionate cream on the phimotic ring is thought to be
      local anti-inflammatory action.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      Resolution of the phimotic band then allows the prepuce to
      dilate and slide backward over the glans. Betamethasone cream
      may improve the elasticity of the foreskin and, together with
      the moisturizing effect of the cream, allow for easier
      retractability for hygiene measures, thought to help prevent
      recurrence of acquired phimosis. Whether moisturizing creams
      without an anti-inflammatory agent would have a similar
      efficacy is unknown.</p>

      <h3>Other potential problems</h3>

      <p class="text1">The acute condition <i>paraphimosis</i>
      develops when the prepuce is retracted and then trapped
      proximal to the corona, with subsequent edema, pain, and
      venous congestion. A tight band is created around the penile
      shaft and the prepuce cannot be returned to its normal
      position. Immediate intervention is needed, beginning with
      manual reduction with gentle pressure. Four fingers from each
      hand are placed on each side of the trapped prepuce, and
      upward tension is applied while the two thumbs push the glans
      downward through the preputial opening.</p>

      <p class="text2">Paraphimosis may progress to the point where
      urgent urologic consultation is needed, and surgical
      intervention may be indicated. Reduction under general
      anesthesia is almost always possible without need for a
      dorsal slit, and circumcision should be considered only for
      the unusual case of recurrent episodes.<sup><a
      href="#n9">3</a></sup> Avoiding forcible retraction and
      replacing the prepuce back over the glans after cleansing or
      catheterization can help prevent paraphimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Urinary tract infection and acute
      balanoposthitis</i>. Difficulty obtaining a urine specimen in
      the uncircumcised male makes it challenging to diagnose a
      urinary tract infection with certainty. Uncircumcised boys
      have a higher incidence of urinary tract infection compared
      with circumcised boys younger than 5 years.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> The reason is thought to be enhanced
      preputial bacterial adherence to the inner prepuce, along
      with a higher rate of colonization in the periurethral area
      of uncircumcised boys.<sup><a href="#n9">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis and balanoposthitis are infrequent
      problems in children and rarely lead to bacterial ascent in
      the urethra to initiate a true urinary tract
      infection.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> These conditions
      usually respond to an antibiotic with broad coverage, such as
      a first-generation cephalosporin; the high antibiotic
      concentration in the urine leads to rapid resolution of the
      infection, and a topical antibiotic is usually not needed.
      Only in the most severe cases of infection accompanied by
      urinary retention is acute surgical intervention (a dorsal
      slit) required.</p>

      <p class="text2">An unrelated condition, <i>balanitis
      xerotica obliterans</i> (BXO), also known as <i>lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus</i>, is a chronic atrophic
      mucocutaneous disorder with no known cause. Fortunately, it
      is rare in children.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> BXO may
      affect the glans and the meatus. In its most severe form,
      involvement of the prepuce obliterates the preputial sac with
      dense adhesions, and the urethra may be affected.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Surgery, in the form of circumcision,
      meatotomy, or, in severe cases, urethroplasty, may be
      required.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Penile lymphedema</i> is a rare problem,
      affecting the prepuce and sometimes involving the shaft to
      varying degrees. Inflammatory erythema can make it difficult
      to distinguish lymphedema from balanoposthitis in the initial
      acute phase. Surgical intervention (a dorsal slit) in the
      acute phase may be needed in patients with urinary

      <h2>Guidelines for treating phimosis with steroid cream</h2>

      <p>When betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream is prescribed
      for phimosis, it is generally applied twice a day for four
      weeks. One 15 g tube is usually sufficient. You can provide
      parents with the following instructions.</p>

      <p>Apply the betamethasone dipropionate cream once after your
      son urinates in the morning and once after he urinates in the
      evening, following these guidelines:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Gently pull back the foreskin as much as possible
        without causing significant discomfort.</li>

        <li>Apply a thin layer of cream to the tight ring or band
        only. Do not apply over the entire penis. Do not cover with
        a bandage.</li>

        <li>After five to seven days of treatment, gently pull the
        foreskin back and forth several times after applying the
        cream. Continue to gently pull the foreskin back with
        bathing. You should gradually be able to pull it farther
        back, but do not force it.</li>

        <li>Do not exceed the recommended length of treatment
        unless directed by the physician.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>GUIDE FOR PARENTS</h3>

      <h2>Hygiene for your son's uncircumcised penis</h2>

      <p>Many parents who have chosen not to have their son
      circumcised have questions about how to care for the penis.
      They also want to know what is "normal" for a penis that has
      foreskin&mdash;the skin that covers the head of the
      penis.</p>

      <p>When a boy is born, the foreskin is not usually
      retractable. This means that it can't be pulled back over the
      head of the penis (called the glans). A normal process occurs
      that gradually separates the foreskin from the glans. The
      penis sheds skin cells, which may look like whitish pearls,
      lumps, or bumps under the foreskin. These cells, called
      smegma, are part of the separation process. Erections aid in
      this process, causing the foreskin to retract or loosen up a
      little at a time.</p>

      <p>The foreskin separates from the glans bit by bit until it
      can be retracted (pulled back) without difficulty. This
      occurs in most boys by the time they are 5 years old, but the
      age varies for each child; in some boys, the foreskin may
      stay partially stuck to the head of the penis until puberty.
      <span class="yellow">The foreskin should never be forcibly
      retracted, as this can cause pain and bleeding and may result
      in scarring and trouble with natural retraction.</span></p>

      <h2>Care and cleaning of the penis</h2>

      <p>The foreskin of an infant's penis needs no special care.
      The most important thing to remember is not to force the
      foreskin to retract. Wash the penis regularly when you give
      your son a bath. Avoid most soaps or cleansing agents because
      they can irritate the penis; water is usually sufficient for
      cleansing.</p>

      <p>Frequent diaper changes to keep urine and feces away from
      the skin decrease skin irritation, helping to prevent diaper
      rash, which can occur on just the penis or scrotum or on any
      part of the diaper area. Diaper creams containing zinc oxide
      are useful if a rash does develop, as they create a
      protective barrier.</p>

      <p>Once the foreskin separates easily from the glans, gently
      retract and clean underneath the foreskin with a washcloth
      and water at least once a week. After cleansing, always pull
      the foreskin forward to its normal position. Retract the
      foreskin again after the bath so you can dry the head of the
      penis with a towel; then again pull it back to the normal
      position to cover the head.</p>

      <p>Teach your son to retract the foreskin and clean on a
      regular basis as he takes more responsibility for his own
      bathing, usually during the preschool years. As he gets older
      and bathes alone, verbally remind him about proper penile
      hygiene; the foreskin should be cleaned with each bath or
      shower.</p>

      <h2>Possible problems</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The opening of the foreskin should allow a normal urine
        stream. If you notice that the stream is weak or dribbling
        or your son appears to have difficulty or discomfort when
        urinating, talk to your pediatrician.</li>

        <li>If the foreskin has swelling, redness, or yellow
        pus&mdash;signs of a possible infection&mdash;seek medical
        advice.</li>

        <li>If the foreskin is pulled back and gets stuck behind
        the head of the penis, immediately seek medical treatment.
        This is an unusual problem, which can usually be avoided by
        routinely replacing the foreskin back over the head
        following retraction.</li>

        <li>If the foreskin cannot be retracted at all and the
        opening of the head of the penis cannot be seen by the time
        your son is 5 years old, talk to your pediatrician.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The advice to see one's
      pediatrician if the head of the penis cannot be seen by the
      time the boys is five years old apparently is based on the
      now outmoded and erroneous belief that 92 percent of boys
      should have a retractile foreskin by age 5. Most wrongful
      diagnoses of alleged "pathologic phimosis" in childhood are
      based on outdated beliefs about when the foreskin should
      become retractile. For current correct information on the
      development of retractability, see <a
