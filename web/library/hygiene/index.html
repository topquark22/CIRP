      <h2>Penile hygiene for intact (non-circumcised) males</h2>

      <p>This page offers factual information to help medical
      personnel and parents understand the proper care of the
      natural, complete, intact penis.</p>

      <p>The word <i>hygiene</i> comes from Greek, and means "the
      protection and promotion of health." Keeping the body clean
      is only part of what it takes to be healthful. In some cases,
      excessive washing can actually cause health problems as will
      be explained below.</p>

      <p>This page provides a brief overview of penile hygiene with
      links to library holdings.</p>

      <h4>Why this page is needed</h4>

      <p>Many physicians today are totally ignorant of the care of
      the intact penis, and frequently give inappropriate advice to
      parents. For example, we have received numerous reports of
      incidents in which physicians have improperly attempted to
      retract the foreskin of infants and young boys
      prematurely.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>For the majority of American males, having been
      circumcised at birth, the intact (not circumcised) penis may
      seem strange and mysterious. Many American medical doctors,
      themselves circumcised, are ignorant of the subject<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> because care of the intact penis is
      rarely mentioned in medical school.</p>

      <p>Improper advice and care of the intact penis often leads
      to injury and subsequent circumcision. When this happens, it
      is often turned around and used as reinforcement for the
      claims that "circumcision should have been done in the first
      place!"</p>

      <p>Many individuals within the American medical community
      have been promoting male neonatal circumcision for over a
      century. Circumcising doctors have claimed in many
      publications that the foreskin is the source of all manner of
      illnesses and disease.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Many
      have claimed that "extraordinary precautions" must be taken
      to prevent infection in the intact male. To a large extent
      these claims serve to maintain the status quo by which
      doctors are paid on a fee-for-service basis.</p>

      <p>Today, more and more parents and doctors know that optimum
      emotional and physical health is achieved by avoiding
      circumcision. There are more and more intact non-circumcised
      boys in the North American community, so the intact boy no
      longer stands out in the locker room.</p>

      <h4>Protective functions that contribute to health</h4>

      <p>The foreskin is actually designed by nature to provide
      protection against disease and injury.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> By understanding these protections,
      we allow the foreskin to function in its role of protecting
      the human body from infection and disease. This page will
      serve to increase that understanding.</p>

      <p>The foreskin of the newborn is:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><!--1.-->fused with the underlying glans penis in most
        boys.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> <sup><a
        href="#n7">7</a></sup></li>

        <li><!--2.-->relatively long in many boys in relation to
        the length of the penis as compared with adult
        males.<sup><a href="#n20">20, Fig. 3</a></sup></li>

        <li><!--3.-->usually narrow at the tip.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup></li>

        <li><!--4.-->filled with muscle fibers that keep the
        foreskin opening closed and pathogens out.<sup><a
        href="#n4">4</a></sup> <sup><a
        href="#n17">17</a></sup></li>

        <li><!--5.-->protected from infection by oligosaccarides
        from breast milk.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> <sup><a
        href="#n11">11</a></sup> <sup><a
        href="#n17">17</a></sup></li>
      </ol>

      <p>The fusion of the foreskin with the glans penis<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> means that no sub-preputial space or
      cavity exists in most infant boys.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> Nature intends the glans penis
      (head) to be an internal organ before puberty and a covered,
      protected organ after puberty. The narrow tip of the foreskin
      in most boys cannot be retracted because the diameter is less
      than that of the glans penis. Even if the tip were wider, the
      fusion of the foreskin with the glans would still prevent
      retraction.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> The narrow
      non-retractile foreskin protects the urethral opening from
      foreign matter and infection and from the ammonia that is
      created by chemical action in wet diapers (nappies).<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> The shape of the immature infant
      foreskin does <i>not</i> indicate the appearance of the adult
      foreskin.</p>

      <p>The muscle fibers allow the tip of the foreskin to open to
      allow a stream of urine to flow out but draw the prepuce
      closed again after urination is finished, thereby preventing
      entry of fecal matter that contains pathogens.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p>Breastfed babies excrete oligosaccharides in their
      urine.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> The oligosaccharides prevent
      bacterial adhesion to the foreskin and other uroepithelial
      tissue,<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> so
      if bacterial adhesion is prevented the risk of urinary
      infection is greatly reduced.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p>Boys with an intact foreskin have health advantages over
      those who have been circumcised. The intact foreskin protects
      the glans penis from ammoniacal diapers (nappies) and
      prevents meatitis, meatal ulceration, and meatal stenosis.
      The sub-preputial moisture contains lysozyme, an enzyme that
      attacks and destroys pathogens.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Intact boys don't have an open
      circumcision wound that may become infected and so they have
      fewer infections.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Intact boys
      are not troubled with adhesions or skin bridges, which are
      complications of circumcision.</p>

      <p>Optimum penile health starts before birth when parents
      make a decision to protect their son from circumcision and to
      breastfeed him.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <h4>The separation of the foreskin from the glans penis</h4>

      <p>The separation of the prepuce from the glans penis may
      occur at any age.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Separation
      often starts around age 3-4 but it may not be complete until
      much later.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Ballooning of the
      prepuce while urinating cannot occur until separation is
      underway. The occurence of ballooning indicates that
      separation has started.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Babu
      <i>et al.</i> have proven that ballooning does not interfere
      with urination.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Ballooning is
      a normal developmental stage and is not a cause for concern
      and does not require treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> A
      child temporarily may report some discomfort or pain while
      urinating during this period. This occurs because the
      ballooning may tear at any residual connection to the glans.
      The discomfort will stop when separation is complete. The
      foreskin may still not be retractable at this point because
      the opening is still narrow. With increased growth and
      maturity, the ballooning will end when opening of the
      foreskin widens.</p>

      <h4>Misunderstandings caused by the 1975 AAP statment</h4>

      <p>One misunderstanding was inadvertently fostered by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics in 1975, when it published a
      statement that said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "A program of education leading to continuing good
          personal hygiene would offer all the advantages of
          circumcision without the attendant surgical risk."<sup><a
          href="#n3">3</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The doctors on the <i>ad hoc</i> committee who wrote that
      statement in 1975 knew that poor personal cleanliness is
      associated with development of penile cancer and showed sound
      medical judgment in advising against circumcision. But they
      did not know why because the links between tobacco and penile
      cancer and between human papilloma virus (HPV) and penile
      cancer had not yet been discovered.</p>

      <p>Later discoveries showed that HPV infection often is a
      precondition for penile cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Persons who did not keep their penis
      clean were more likely to have HPV, and more likely to
      develop penile cancer. Also, the use of tobacco in any form
      is a risk factor for the development of penile cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p>The 1975 AAP statement has caused many to believe that
      frequent regular retraction of the foreskin and washing is
      necessary to prevent disease (especially cancer) in
      boys.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> However, this is not
      the case. Boys are not exposed to the risks for penile cancer
      because they usually do not use tobacco or engage in sexual
      intercourse. Penile cancer usually is seen only in elderly
      men. Doctors now recommend that no forcible attempt should be
      made to retract the foreskin of newborns, infants, and young
      boys.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      Premature attempts to retract the foreskin are ill
      advised.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> The natural protections of the
      foreskin<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> work best when the
      foreskin is not disturbed. The foreskin usually is
      non-retractable in the young. Forcible attempts to retract it
      cause pain and trauma, may result in paraphimosis, and should
      be avoided.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p>In the newborn, infants, and children, only the outside of
      the foreskin should be washed.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> The foreskin should never be
      retracted in the bath because retraction stretches the
      foreskin sphincter open, allows dirty bathwater to enter and
      may start infection.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>
      Retraction of the foreskin in dirty bathwater is not
      hygenic.</p>

      <p>After puberty, however, the sexually active male should
      wash his penis before and after sexual intercourse. This
      applies to both circumcised and intact males. Sexually active
      males may contract HPV through sexual intercourse. Men who
      use tobacco have carcinogens circulating in the blood and
      excreted in urine. Washing removes HPV and the carcinogens
      from tobacco and may help to prevent cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Of course, it is far better to not
      use tobacco at all.</p>

      <h4>When does the foreskin become retractable?</h4>

      <p>There is no "right" time for the foreskin to become
      retractable. Two things must happen before the foreskin
      becomes retractable and each usually takes many years.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <ol>
        <li><!--1.-->The fusion between the glans penis and the
        inner surface of the foreskin must become separate.</li>

        <li><!--2.-->The narrow tip that prevents retraction must
        become large enough in diameter to permit retraction.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The time varies widely from individual to individual.
      Complete separation of the foreskin from the glans may not
      occur until after puberty.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> About 44 percent of boys
      have a fully retractable prepuce by age 10, by age 16, 90
      percent, by age 18, 99 percent.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Care before puberty</h4>

      <p>No special care is necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p>The infant male has a non-retractile self-cleaning
      foreskin. In most boys no preputial space exists because the
      foreskin is fused with the glans penis.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> The tip of the foreskin is flushed out
      several times a day by sterile urine. The protective
      functions of the foreskin work best if it is left alone and
      not disturbed.</p>

      <p>Parents and caregivers should wash only the
      outside.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> <i>No</i> attempt should be made to
      retract the foreskin.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      "Leave it alone" is good advice.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Only
      the child will know when his foreskin can be retracted
      without pain and trauma,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> so
      the first person to retract the foreskin should be the child
      himself.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p>The foreskin protects the glans penis from the ammonia
      that is formed by chemical action in the diaper (nappie). One
      may see some redness of the foreskin from exposure to ammonia
      while an infant is still in diapers (nappies).<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Frequent diaper changes may prevent
      this. In severe cases, a protective barrier ointment may be
      necessary.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p>In older boys the foreskin may be retractable. Older
      grammar school boys may be taught to retract their
      foreskin,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      rinse the area, and return the foreskin to its normal forward
      protective position.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> If the foreskin is non-retractile,
      there is no cause for concern. Only the outside needs to be
      washed.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p>When visiting the doctor, the doctor should be instructed
      that the child's foreskin is <i>not</i> to be touched or
      retracted.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Parents should
      remain with the child and physically protect the child from a
      possible forcible premature retraction by the
      physician.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Care after puberty</h4>

      <p>If the foreskin has not been retractable before puberty,
      it usually becomes retractable when puberty is
      complete.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p>The foreskin keeps the mucosal surfaces moist, emolliated,
      and maintains optimum health,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      while preventing drying, and keratinization of the
      mucosa.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> The sub-preputial
      moisture contains pathogen-fighting substances.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p>Washing becomes more important for the sexually active
      adult male.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> After washing, the foreskin should
      be returned to its normal forward protective position.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> If
      the individual is a smoker, washing removes carcinogens that
      may be excreted in urine.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      Also, washing removes any accumulation of HPV, the viral
      carcinogen.</p>

      <h4>Excessive washing and the use of soap</h4>

      <p>Apparently, a few adult males wash under their foreskin
      quite frequently with the use of soap.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> We cannot define excessive washing,
      but over washing can deplete the natural oils from the mucosa
      of the inner lining of the foreskin that covers the glans
      penis.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Depletion of natural
      oils causes non-specific dermatitis (NSD) that may be
      mistaken for balanoposthitis.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      Excessive washing and the use of soap generally should be
      avoided<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> because it may cause
      balanoposthitis or yeast overgrowth. If soap is used, any
      residual soap should be rinsed away before the foreskin is
      returned to its forward protective position.</p>

      <h4>Penile hygiene for the adult male with a non-retractable
      foreskin</h4>

      <p>In one to two percent of males, the foreskin does not
      spontaneously become retractable. The swirling of the sterile
      urine under the foreskin usually keeps that area free of
      smegma buildup.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Nevertheless, a
      non-retractile foreskin is listed as a risk factor for penile
      cancer in the adult male, apparently because removal of HPV
      and tobacco carcinogens may not be fully accomplished.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Adult males who have a
      non-retractile foreskin (phimosis) should consider having
      their foreskin made retractable. See <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">phimosis</a> for options.
      Circumcision should be avoided because of pain, trauma, loss
      of erogenous tissue, and diminished erectile function. If
      desired, adult males with a non-retractile foreskin may
      irrigate and flush the sub-preputial cavity with a rubber
      bulb syringe. Some men healthily and happily live their
      entire lives with a non-retractile foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>
