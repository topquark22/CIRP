      <p class="heading"><b>Informed Consent for
      Circumcision</b></p>

      <p class="text"><i>To the Editor</i>: Binner et al<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> document that material prepared by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics in the brochure,
      <i>Circumcision: Information for Parents</i><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> is inadequate to persuade parents to
      avoid circumcision. This is not surprising, because the
      information provided by the brochure does not satisfy the
      legal criteria for informed consent.</p>

      <p class="text">Binner et al<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      did not show that parents cannot be dissuaded from
      circumcision by sufficient information. Enzenauer et
      al<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> counseled parents of boys
      with videotaped presentations regarding circumcision. The
      videotaped counseling achieved a significant reduction in the
      number of parents who elected to have their child
      circumcised. Thus, with sufficient information, a reduction
      in the high incidence of nontherapeutic circumcision indeed
      is possible and may be achieved.</p>

      <p class="text">Informed consent is governed by court
      decisions. Generally, the doctor must disclose all material
      information that the patient or his proxy representative
      would deem relevant about the benefits, risks, and possible
      outcomes of the proposed treatment and any alternative
      treatments. Medical practitioners who fail to provide
      sufficient information may be liable in negligence.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The American Medical Association says that
      "major factors in parental decision-making are the
      father's circumcision status, opinions of family
      members and friends, a desire for conformity in their
      son's appearance, and the belief that the circumcised
      penis is easier to care for with respect to local
      hygiene."<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Obviously, such
      decisions are not made in the child's best interest.
      The validity of the permission granted for circumcision based
      on such decisions may be challenged on the basis that they
      are made in the parents' interests rather than the
      child's best interest.</p>

      <p class="text">Medical societies are strengthening their
      advice to their fellows regarding informed consent for
      nontherapeutic neonatal circumcision. The American Academy of
      Family Physicians recently issued a new position statement on
      neonatal circumcision. The statement cautions doctors to
      discuss the benefits and risks with parents.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> In Canada, the Saskatchewan College of
      Physicians and Surgeons recently warned its fellows that
      medical practitioners must tell parents that male neonatal
      circumcision is not a recommended procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Thus it is now clear that medical doctors
      must impart all material information to the parents, not only
      about circumcision, but also about the option not to
      circumcise.</span> This information must be far more extensive than
      the scanty information contained in the American Academy of
      Pediatrics brochure. <span class="yellow">In the case of nontherapeutic
      circumcision of a boy, electing not to have circumcision performed is a
      reasonable, practicable, and viable alternative, so patients
      or their proxy representatives must be given all material
      information about circumcision and its risks, potential
      benefits and possible outcomes; they must also be informed
      about the risks, potential benefits, and possible outcomes of
      remaining uncircumcised.</span> No doctor should rely on such
      grossly inadequate material as a handout prepared by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
