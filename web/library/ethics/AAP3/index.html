        <p><b>ABSTRACT. Parents sometimes deny their children the
        benefits of medical care because of religious beliefs. In
        some jurisdictions, exemptions to child abuse and neglect
        laws restrict government action to protect children or seek
        legal redress when the alleged abuse or neglect has
        occurred in the name of religion. <span class="yellow">The
        American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) believes that all
        children deserve effective medical treatment that is likely
        to prevent substantial harm or suffering or death.</span>
        In addition the AAP advocates that all legal interventions
        apply equally whenever children are endangered or harmed,
        without exemptions based on parental religious beliefs. To
        these ends, the AAP calls for the end of religious
        exemption laws and supports additional efforts to educate
        the public about the medical needs of children.</b></p>

      ABBREVIATION. AAP, American Academy of Pediatrics 
      <hr />

      <h4 align="center">THE PROBLEM</h4>

      <p class="text">The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
      recognizes that religion plays a major role in the lives of
      many children and adults in the United States and is aware
      that some in the United States believe prayer and other
      spiritual practices can substitute for medical treatment of
      ill or injured children. Through legislative activity at the
      federal and state levels, some religious groups have sought,
      and in many cases attained, government recognition in the
      form of approved payment for this "nonmedical therapy" and
      exemption from child abuse and neglect laws when children do
      not receive needed medical care. The AAP opposes such
      payments and exemptions as harmful to children and advocates
      that children, regardless of parental religious beliefs,
      deserve effective medical treatment when such treatment is
      likely to prevent substantial harm or suffering or death.</p>

      <p class="text">The US Constitution requires that government
      not interfere with religious practices or endorse particular
      religions. <span>However, these constitutional principles do
      not stand alone and may, at times, conflict with the
      independent government interest in protecting
      children.</span><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Government
      obligation arises from that interest when parental religious
      practices subject minor children to possible loss of life or
      to substantial risk of harm.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup>
      <span class="yellow">Constitutional guarantees of freedom of
      religion do not permit children to be harmed through
      religious practices, nor do they allow religion to be a valid
      legal defense when an individual harms or neglects a
      child.</span><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Acute Illness or Injury</h4>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The AAP asserts that
      every child should have the opportunity to grow and develop
      free from preventable illness or injury.</span><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Children also have the right to
      appropriate medical evaluation when it is likely that a
      serious illness, injury, or other medical condition endangers
      their lives or threatens substantial harm or suffering. Under
      these circumstances, parents and other guardians have a
      responsibility to seek medical treatment, regardless of their
      religious beliefs and preferences. Unfortunately, certain
      groups have obtained exemptions from legal sanctions and
      state child abuse and neglect reporting laws based on the
      child's "treatment" by spiritual means, such as
      prayer.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The overall effect has
      been to limit the government's ability to protect children
      from abuse or neglect.</p>

      <p class="text">The AAP is concerned about religious
      doctrines that urge parents to avoid seeking medical help
      when there children are seriously ill. Each year, some
      parents' religious views lead them to eschew appropriate
      medical care for their children, resulting in substantial
      harm or suffering or death due to treatable conditions such
      as meningitis, bowel obstruction, diabetes mellitis, or
      pneumonia (<i>Boston Globe</i> August 12, 1993:1;
      <i>Pittsburg Post-Gazette</i>, March 16, 1991:B1).<sup><a
      href="#n4">4,7</a></sup> The AAP considers failure to seek
      medical care in such cases to be child neglect, regardless of
      the motivation. The basic moral principle of justice requires
      that children be protected uniformly by laws and regulations
      at the local, state, and federal levels. Parents and others
      who deny a child necessary medical care on religious grounds
      should not be exempt from civil or criminal action that
      otherwise would be appropriate. State legislatures and
      regulatory agencies should remove religious exemption clauses
      from statutes and regulations to ensure that all parents
      understand that they should seek appropriate medical care for
      their children.</p>

      <h4>Preventative Care</h4>

      <p class="text">Some religious tenets hold that members
      should not seek or receive medical care for any condition,
      including pregnancy. These beliefs can result in increased
      perinatal and maternal mortality.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Some religious groups deny children
      the benefits of routine preventative care. For example, some
      parents, acting in accord with state laws, refuse to have
      their children immunized because of religious beliefs. The
      AAP does not support the stringent application of medical
      neglect laws when children do not receive recommended
      immunizations. Although the risk to unimmunized individuals
      is relatively low, serious adverse reactions to vaccination
      are rare and the AAP strongly endorses universal
      immunization. Recent outbreaks of vaccine preventable
      infectious diseases, with consequent serious complications
      and deaths, have been linked to groups that refused
      immunization for religious reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9-12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The AAP therefore supports the use of
      appropriate public health measures, such as mandatory mass
      vaccinations in epidemic situations, when necessary to
      protect communities and their unimmunized members. In
      addition, the AAP is concerned that children unimmunized for
      any reason may expose young children not old enough to be
      protected, to infections such as pertussis or invasive
      <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> disease. The risk is especially
      high in child care facilities. In such situations, all
      parents of children in the facility should be informed of the
      hazards.</p>

      <h4>Mature Minors</h4>

      <p class="text">The weight given to parental beliefs in
      decisions affecting their children's well-being declines with
      the child's increasing age and development. That is, as
      minors mature, their interest in and capacity for
      participating in health care decisions affecting themselves
      increases, as does their ability to make decisions regarding
      their parents' religious views. The law and AAP policy
      recognize the doctrine of the mature minor."<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> This concept acknowledges that many
      children beginning in adolescence, can contribute to or make
      medical decisions, including those about life- sustaining
      treatment. Thus, in selected cases, disputes may be avoided
      when a minor has the capacity to make an independent decision
      in light of religious values and recommended medical
      therapy.</p>

      <h4>Need for Care and Respect</h4>

      <p class="text">The AAP wishes to underscore its recognition
      of the important role of religion in the personal, spiritual,
      and social lives of many individuals and cautions physicians
      and other health care professionals to avoid unnecessary
      polarization when conflict over religious practices arises.
      Pediatricians should seek to make collaborative decisions
      with families whenever possible and should take great care
      when considering authority to override parental preferences.
      Nevertheless, physicians who believe that parental religious
      convictions interfere with appropriate medical care that is
      likely to prevent substantial harm or suffering or death
      should request court authorization to override parental
      authority or, under circumstances involving an imminent
      threat to a child's life, intervene over parental objections.
      When caring for children whose prognoses are grave even with
      treatment, physicians should use restraint in pursuing a
      court order to initiate or continue treatment when parents
      object to it. In such situations, physicians should work with
      the parents and children to assure appropriate palliative
      care. Threatening or seeking state intervention should be the
      last resort, undertaken only when treatment is likely to
      prevent substantial harm or death. Even under those
      circumstances, physicians should respect parental religious
      beliefs and the role of parents in rearing their children. Of
      course, a physician may withdraw from these cases after
      securing acceptable alternative medical care, when continuing
      in the doctor-patient-family relationship would violate the
      physicians's own moral precepts.</p>

      <p class="text">The AAP emphasizes that all children who need
      medical care that is likely to prevent substantial harm or
      suffering or death should receive that treatment. The AAP
      opposes religious doctrines that advocate opposition to
      health care for sick children. Adherence to such views
      precludes appropriate assessment and intervention to protect
      the children. The AAP believes that laws should not encourage
      of tolerate parental activity that prevent implementing
      appropriate medical treatment, nor should laws exempt parents
      from criminal or civil liability in the name of religion.</p>

      <h4 align="center">RECOMMENDATIONS</h4>

      <p class="text">The AAP calls for all those entrusted with
      the care of children to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>show sensitivity to and flexibility toward the
        religious beliefs and practices of families;</li>

        <li>support legislation that ensures that all parents who
        deny their children medical care likely to prevent death or
        substantial harm or suffering are held legally
        accountable;</li>

        <li>support the repeal of religious exemption laws;
        and</li>

        <li>work with other child advocacy organizations and
        agencies and religious institutions to develop coordinated
        and concerted public and professional action to educate
        state officials, health care professionals, and the public
        about parents' legal obligations to obtain and necessary
        health medical care for their children.</li>
