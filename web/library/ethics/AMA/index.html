            <p>The medical profession has long subscribed to a body
            of ethical statements developed primarily for the
            benefit of the patient. As a member of this profession,
            a physician must recognize responsibility to patients
            first and foremost, as well as to society, to other
            health professionals, and to self. The following
            Principles adopted by the American Medical Association
            are not laws, but standards of conduct which define the
            essentials of honorable behavior for the physician.</p>

            <p>I. A physician shall be dedicated to providing
            competent medical care, <span class="yellow">with
            compassion and respect for human dignity and
            rights.</span></p>

            <p>II. A physician shall uphold the standards of
            professionalism, be honest in all professional
            interactions, and strive to report physicians deficient
            in character or competence, or engaging in fraud or
            deception, to appropriate entities.</p>

            <p>III. A physician shall respect the law and also
            recognize a responsibility to seek changes in those
            requirements which are contrary to the best interests
            of the patient.</p>

            <p>IV. <span class="yellow">A physician shall respect
            the rights of patients</span>, colleagues, and other
            health professionals, and shall safeguard patient
            confidences and privacy within the constraints of the
            law.</p>

            <p>V. A physician shall continue to study, apply, and
            advance scientific knowledge, maintain a commitment to
            medical education, make relevant information available
            to patients, colleagues, and the public, obtain
            consultation, and use the talents of other health
            professionals when indicated.</p>

            <p>VI. A physician shall, in the provision of
            appropriate patient care, except in emergencies, be
            free to choose whom to serve, with whom to associate,
            and the environment in which to provide medical
            care.</p>

            <p>VII. A physician shall recognize a responsibility to
            participate in activities contributing to the
            improvement of the community and the betterment of
            public health.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">VIII. A physician shall, while
            caring for a patient, regard responsibility to the
            patient as paramount.</span></p>

            <p>IX. A physician shall support access to medical care
            for all people.</p>

            <p>Adopted June 1957; revised June 1980; revised June
            2001</p>
