      <p>Over the past few decades, many doctors have become aware
      that routine neonatal circumcision is unnecessary and should
      not be performed. In Canada, the rates of circumcision paid
      for by all provincial and territorial health agencies dave
      declined from 44% in 1975 to 4% in 1995.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> In the United States, there has been a
      marked decline in circumcision, but the procedure still is
      done with considerable frequency. According to the National
      Center for Health Statistics, the rate of newborn
      circumcision is now 59%, down from approximately 90% twenty
      years ago.</p>

      <h3><font face="arial, helvetica">The Procedure</font></h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision is the
      act of one person removing a part of the penis of another
      person. If done for religious reasons, it is performed by a
      mohel on male infants of the Jewish faith on the eighth day,
      and by a street surgeon on Moslem boys later in life. In the
      four western countries where it is still done, it is
      performed by doctors of medicine or osteopathy, under the
      supposition of medical necessity.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foreskin is the
      forward continuation of the skin of the penile shaft, which
      covers the head of the penis (glans penis). The inner lining
      of this skin is highly specialized erogenous tissue.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> This foreskin has several known
      functions: it protects the glans penis throughout life; it
      covers the penis during erection, when the shaft enlarges and
      elongates; and it provides great pleasure to its owner, and
      to his partner. As one may who had a circumcision, after he
      had become sexually active, said: "Stimuli that had
      previously aroused ectasy now have relatively little effect."
      Many individuals now claim that its removal has been harmful
      to them.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian physicians
      now will ask whether those circumcisions done by their
      colleagues for "medical necessity" (still reimbursable) are
      legitimate. Since the neonatal circumcision rate in Finland,
      where virtually every male wishes to preserve his foreskin,
      is zero, and since the risk of needing a late circumcision in
      Finland is one in 16,667, it follows that almost all of the
      circumcisions still being done in North America have no
      medical necessity, and in fact, are contraindicated.
      Therefore in Canada, most requests to provincial health
      agencies for payment for circumcisions may be viewed as
      fraudulent.</p>

      <h3><font face="arial, helvetica">Violation of Ethical
      Principles</font></h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, circumcision
      violates the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have
      them do unto you. If the doctor were intact, it may be fairly
      assumed that he would not want anyone to remove his foreskin
      without his permission.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it violates
      a major tenet of medical practice: First do no harm.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least,
      circumcision violates all seven <a
      href="/library/statements/ama/">Principles of Medical
      Ethics</a>. Let us look at each principle in turn (AMA
      1992).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle
      I.&nbsp;&nbsp;A physician shall be dedicated to providing
      competent medical service with compassion and respect for
      human dignity."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Competent medical
      service" implies that each procedure is medically indicated,
      and is done only with fully informed consent. Since 1971,
      both the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1975) have
      stated: "There are no medical indications for routine
      neonatal circumcision,"<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> In
      addition, informed consent is never obtained from these young
      patients, and fully informed consent rarely, if ever, from
      the parents.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision causes
      severe pain.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Does a doctor who
      unnecessarily causes severe pain practice with compassion?"
      Doctors may use a local anesthetic; this does nothing for
      pain and suffering during the healing process. Also, does a
      doctor who removes a normal part of another person's body
      without his consent "respect human dignity?" Every individual
      is entitled to an intact body and to fully informed consent
      before any part of his body is removed. These principles
      apply even more strongly to a healthy normal body part.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle II. A
      physician shall deal honestly with patients and colleagues,
      and strive to expose those physicians deficient in character
      or competence, or who engage in fraud or deception."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physicians do not
      "deal honestly" with patients if they fail to provide fully
      informed consent. For example, some doctors use the threat of
      penile cancer and urinary tract infection to promote
      circumcision and thus misinform the public. Penile cancer is
      so rare that one cannot possible justify a routine surgical
      procedure as a preventative measure. Urinary tract
      infections, also quite rare, are treated with antibiotics,
      not by operation.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle III. A
      physician shall respect the law and also recognize a
      responsibility to seek changes in those requirements which
      are contrary to the best interests of the patient."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law permits a
      doctor to operate on another human being, but only if it is
      in the best interest of that individual. Many men who now
      speak out against the circumcision that was imposed on them
      claim that it was not in their best interests.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle IV. A
      physician shall respect the rights of patients, of
      colleagues, and of other health professionals, and shall
      safeguard patient confidences within the constraints of the
      law."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A patient has the
      right to an intact body, and has the right (and duty) to
      refuse to have a normal, valuable part of his penis removed
      unnecessarily.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle V. A
      physician shall continue to study, apply and advance
      scientific knowledge, make relevant information available to
      patients, colleagues, and the public, obtain consultation,
      and use the talents of other health professionals when
      indicated."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telling the patient
      that circumcision is in any way useful constitutes a failure
      to make "relevant scientific information available to that
      patient." However, even if we could show that some disease is
      more likely to occur in the intact male, it does not follow
      that it is ethical to use this risk as a reason to
      circumcise. In all studies to date, the risks of circumcision
      have always exceeded any alleged benefits, a fact that is
      often not made clear to parents.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle VI. A
      physician shall, in the provision of appropriate patient
      care, except in emergencies, be free to choose whom to serve,
      with whom to associate, and the environment in which to
      provide medical services."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A physician is free
      to choose not remove part of the penis of a male infant,
      especially if it is inappropriate patient care," even if the
      parents "demand" it. Modern medical ethics state that parents
      may make medical decisions for their child, but their actions
      must be in his best interest. Maimonides, the great Jewish
      sage, said, "Circumcision should never be done except for
      reasons of pure faith." In the absence of religious reasons'
      no such claims can be proved. How can physicians continue to
      claim that they must carry out the wishes of the infants'
      parents?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"Principle VII. A
      physician shall recognize a responsibility to participate in
      activities contributing to an improved community."</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States is
      the only country in the world that removes part of the penis
      from a majority of its males for non-religious reasons. Thus
      stopping a procedure that many consider profoundly harmful
      and sexually debilitating will contribute to an improved
      community.</p>

      <h3><font face="arial">Why Does the Practice
      Persist?</font></h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision persists
      because circumcision has produced circumcisers. Many men who
      have been cut have yet to acknowledge that an injury has been
      done to them. As a consequence, they may have their son cut;
      if they become doctors, they may perform this procedure on
      thousands of innocent males. A conspiracy of silence among
      doctors, and in the community, has helped to perpetuate this
      practice, because circumcision could not continue in the
      United States and Canada without the doctors who perform
      it.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually neonatal
      circumcision is performed without anaesthesia. It is
      excruciatingly painful.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Some
      experts recognize it as a betrayal of the trust that an
      infant has in its mother and hence it may interrupt
      maternal-infant bonding. Some scientists postulate that
      circumcision encodes violence into the brain at a highly
      susceptible moment in its development.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Finally, circumcision carries risks of
      infection, bleeding, damage to adjacent tissues and organs
      and death.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides all of the
      harmful aspects, nonreligious circumcision, male and female,
      is a basic human rights violation - a violation by one person
      of the right of another person to an intact body.</p>

      <h3><font face="arial, helvetica">The Solution</font></h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution to this
      ethical and human rights dilemma is simple: Do not perform
      circumcision on infants. By ceasing to perform infant
      circumcision, nothing is lost. Any adult male may, with fully
      informed consent, have circumcision whenever he wishes.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the public becomes
      aware of the accumulating scientific evidence, circumcision
      is declining, and with the current attention to unnecessary
      cost, insurance plans are ceasing to pay for circumcision.
      Most hopefully of all, caring physicians are reviewing this
      operation in the light of their own ethical standards and are
      refusing to perform infant circumcision.</p>
