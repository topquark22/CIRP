      <h2>Short Changed? The Law and Ethics of Male
      Circumcision</h2>
      MARIE FOX AND MICHAEL THOMSON<br />
       <i>Law School, Keele University</i> 

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Routine neonatal male circumcision has
      generally failed to excite medico-legal attention.
      Notwithstanding recent debates in the ethical literature,
      notably in special issues or symposia in the <i>Journal of
      Medical Ethics</i> (2004, 30) and <i>American Journal of
      Bioethics</i> (2003, 3), the law has yet to engage seriously
      with this issue. In a forthcoming contribution to an emerging
      medico-legal debate we have suggested that neglect of this
      issue is partly attributable to the way in which routine
      infant male circumcision (and its attendant effects and
      risks) is typically characterised in opposition to female
      circumcision for rhetorical and political reasons (Fox and
      Thomson, 2005). The result is that, while female circumcision
      is constructed as morally and legally unacceptable within a
      civilised society, male circumcision is characterised as a
      standard and benign medical practice. In this article our
      focus turns to the related failure to engage in a full
      cost/benefit analysis of the practice and the harm it causes
      to boy children.</p>

      <p class="text2">This article starts by outlining, briefly,
      how routine male circumcision has come to be debated in
      contemporary ethical, professional and (the limited) legal
      literature. Particular attention is devoted to the
      privileging of parental choice, notwithstanding documented
      medical risks and the absence of conclusive evidence of
      medical benefit. We suggest that the medico-legal failure to
      take seriously the risks involved is understandable if we
      recognise that the concept of harm is inherently fluid and
      that pain (particularly where it is experienced by infants)
      is often incapable of articulation. This insight means that
      it is crucial to address the ways in which specific harms are
      contextualised. We explore this process of constructing harm
      through a consideration of the law&rsquo;s response to
      circumcision in the leading case of <a
      href="/library/legal/UKlaw/rvbrown1993/"><i>Brown</i></a> and
      in the Law Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on circumcision
      in its report <i>Consent in the Criminal Law</i>. By
      problematising the legal reasoning in these English legal
      texts we seek to contest legal orthodoxy which construes the
      decision to circumcise a male infant as a legitimate parental
      decision.</p>

      <p class="text2">We also suggest that this prevailing legal
      consensus is largely a product of the way in which the
      practice has historically emerged. Thus we trace a brief
      history of neonatal male circumcision, focusing on the early
      justifications for the procedure and interrogating the types
      of harm that were constructed or imagined in these
      justifications. In these medical histories, the emphasis is
      placed on harms risked by <i>not</i> circumcising rather than
      the risks inherent in the procedure. Importantly, such
      justifications are based on matters of hygiene coupled with
      the control of disease, madness and masturbation. Although
      clearly spurious, as we shall highlight, echoes of these
      justifications recur in current debates and continue to carry
      potent symbolic resonance. Our contention is that in order to
      effect a shift in attitudes to the practice, the early
      justifications need to be articulated and challenged, and
      this has to be coupled with an emphasis on the real risks of
      the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before continuing, it is important to
      qualify what bodies we are talking of. In this paper our
      primary concern is with Anglo-American bodies. More
      specifically, we focus on the neonatal body subjected to this
      procedure for social (rather than legitimate medical)
      reasons.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Other
      European/industrialised nations do not share the same history
      of routine neonatal circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> (although Canada and Australia too
      have historically had high rates of neonatal circumcision
      (Waldeck, 2002; Queensland Law Reform Commission, 1993). As
      well as geographical specificity, there is also a chronology
      to note, since the shared history of routine circumcision in
      these countries has not endured. Thus, based on Army records,
      it has been estimated that before World War II 50% of working
      class and 85% of upper class men in England were circumcised
      (Gollaher, 1994: 25; see also Gairdner, 1949). Whilst US
      rates remain high, in the UK the numbers, though significant,
      are now comparatively small. Estimates suggest that
      approximately 30,000 procedures are performed annually in the
      UK, most on young children (Williams and Kapila, 1993a); and
      1993 figures indicate that 5&ndash;6 per cent of British men
      were circumcised (Williams and Kapila, 1993b).<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> With the introduction of the NHS,
      procedures that could not be demonstrated to be clearly
      medically efficacious were no longer to be provided by the
      state.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Whilst this process has
      had mixed success, circumcision was one procedure to be
      dropped early in the life of the NHS. The results under a
      private insurance system have been quite different, although
      available statistics do appear to suggest a decline in the
      recent incidence of circumcision in the US. The American
      Academy of Pediatrics estimated that, in 1999, 85 percent of
      male newborns were circumcised; (American Academy of
      Pediatrics, 1999) while statistics for the following year
      record a rate of around 65 percent (National Center for
      Health Statistics, 2001). Some commentators have argued that
      a downward trend in the statistics points to routine
      circumcision being experienced by only a minority of newborns
      within a generation (Miller, 2002). The picture is, however,
      more complicated that this suggests, since the statistics
      fail to display a linear decline, are affected by under
      reporting, and do not reflect regional and racial differences
      (Waldeck, 2002).</p>

      <p><b>Contemporary Medico-Legal Debates</b></p>

      <p class="blockquote">Ritual circumcision of male infants as
      religious and cultural practice is lawful in this country. .
      . . We allow parents to agree to a relatively minor, albeit
      irreversible procedure, in the interests of observing
      religious freedoms in the upbringing of their male child but
      that freedom stops short at the seriously invasive procedure
      on young girls (Bridge, 2002: 279).</p>

      <p class="text2">Caroline Bridge&rsquo;s statement
      characterises most contemporary legal responses to the issue
      of male circumcision. Bridge constructs a simplified
      oppositional relationship between male and female
      circumcision whereby male circumcision is self-evidently
      different from the practice of female circumcision. As we
      have argued elsewhere, this form of response contributes to
      the negation of male circumcision as an issue within
      medico-legal literature (Fox and Thomson, 2005). Here we want
      to consider a related aspect of the contemporary debate.
      Anotable feature of work on female circumcision is the
      attention paid to the harms and risks inherent in the
      procedure(s). In sharp contrast, and related to the
      rhetorical strategy we have noted above, the harms inherent
      in male circumcision are generally downplayed, as in
      Bridge&rsquo;s essay, with risks being minimised as part of a
      strategy that privileges parental choice and freedoms.</p>

      <p class="text2">A special issue of the <i>American Journal
      of Bioethics</i> in 2003 further illustrates this discursive
      pattern. The issue&rsquo;s lead article &lsquo;Between
      Prophylaxis and Child Abuse&rsquo; purports to offer a third
      way within the polarised circumcision debate (Benatar and
      Benatar, 2003). Stating that &lsquo;the ethics of a surgical
      procedure cannot be assessed independently of whatever harms
      and benefits it does or does not have&rsquo; (Benatar and
      Benatar, 2003: 36), the authors, Michael and David Benatar,
      provide a detailed analysis of the numerous studies that have
      aimed to validate or challenge the various prophylactic
      justifications that have emerged over time. Significantly,
      the authors conclude that none of the scientific evidence
      &lsquo;is anywhere near conclusive&rsquo; (Benatar and
      Benatar, 2003: 42). Yet, notwithstanding their stated
      commitment to a full cost/benefit analysis, the authors
      dedicate just two paragraphs to pain, and only a single
      paragraph to consideration of possible complications (Benatar
      and Benatar, 2003: 38). In relation to costs, they conclude
      that &lsquo;the most significant cost of neonatal
      circumcision is the pain that accompanies it. . . . Where
      [anesthesia] is used, this major cost can be eliminated or at
      least significantly reduced&rsquo; (Benatar and Benatar,
      2003: 42). Other risks involved are even more cursorily dealt
      with. Conversely, the authors argue that scientific opinion
      suggests medical benefits stem from circumcision. For
      instance, they propose that circumcision may offer some
      protection against urinary tract infection (Benatar and
      Benatar, 2003: 39). Yet these proposed benefits are not
      quantified in a way whereby they can be measured against
      quantifiable risks (such as the risks of haemorrhage, sepsis,
      ulceration or laceration of the penis or scrotum,
      psychological complications (Benatar and Benatar, 2003:
      92&ndash;6),<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> or a morbidity
      rate of one in 500,000 (Benatar and Benatar, 2003: 42)).
      Ultimately, then, the Benatars themselves fail to provide an
      adequate cost/benefit analysis and their &lsquo;third
      way&rsquo; amounts simply to an argument for parental choice
      based on minimising the inherent risks of infant
      circumcision. Downplaying the risks permits the authors to
      embrace the cultural and social benefits that might flow from
      its exercise. Thus, they state, &lsquo;if we are correct that
      no clear and significant <i>medical</i> benefits derive from
      circumcision, there still might be <i>other</i> kinds of
      benefits&rsquo; (Benatar and Benatar, 2003: 44). They
      conclude:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">[W]e think that neonatal circumcision
      cannot unequivocally be said to yield a net medical gain or
      loss. In other words, it is not something that can be said to
      be routinely indicated, nor something that is routinely
      contra-indicated. It is a discretionary matter. The decision
      whether or not to circumcise a child should thus be made by
      the parents, who, within certain limits, are entitled to
      employ their own value judgments in the furtherance of their
      child&rsquo;s best interests. These limits are not exceeded
      in most decisions about neonatal circumcision, given the
      nature of the medical evidence (Benatar and Benatar, 2003:
      42).</p>

      <p class="text1">As we have noted, a similar discursive
      strategy characterises the wider circumcision debate, as is
      evidenced by the recently revised BMA guidance to doctors
      (BMA, 2003). It too foregrounds the need for a cost/benefit
      analysis and, signi.cantly, within this it highlights the
      contested nature of the claimed benefits. At various points
      evidence for the supposed beneficial effects of circumcision
      is described as &lsquo;equivocal&rsquo;(BMA, 2003: 2, 4)
      &lsquo;inconclusive&rsquo;(BMA, 2003: 4), &lsquo;not
      convincingly proven&rsquo; (BMA, 2003: 5),
      &lsquo;contradictory&rsquo; causing &lsquo;significant
      disagreement&rsquo;, lacking consensus and, ultimately,
      &lsquo;insufficient&rsquo;, leading to the conclusion that
      &lsquo;evidence concerning the health benefit from
      non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone
      to be justification&rsquo; (BMA, 2003: 7). Yet, while this is
      coupled with a recognition that there are inherent
      &lsquo;medical and psychological&rsquo; risks in the
      procedure (BMA, 2003: 5), the dominant message remains that
      parental beliefs should be respected, despite not being
      grounded in claims to health benefits:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">The medical harms or benefits have not
      been unequivocally proven but there are clear risks of harm
      if the procedure is done inexpertly. The Association has no
      policy on these issues. Indeed it would be difficult to
      formulate a policy in the absence of unambiguously clear and
      consistent medical data on the implications of the
      intervention. As a general rule, however, the BMA believes
      that the parents should be entitled to make choices about how
      best to promote their children&rsquo;s interests, and it is
      for society to decide what limits should be imposed on
      parental choices (BMA, 2003: 3).<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">As such, while the BMA&rsquo;s recognition
      of both the equivocal nature of the claimed benefits and the
      clear risks of harm (although this is subsequently minimised)
      may be interpreted as a progressive position, it nonetheless
      continues to construct male circumcision as an expression of
      parental privilege. This downplays both the pain experienced
      by the neonate (see Benatar and Benatar, 2003: 37&ndash;8 and
      accompanying references; Warnock and Sandrin, 2004) and the
      fact that while complication rates from routine circumcision
      are low, the chances of these complications being mutilatory,
      infective or haemorrhagic are high (Willliams and Kapila,
      1993b; Gerharz and Haarmann, 2000). Indeed, complications are
      potentially catastrophic, since death, gangrene, and total or
      partial amputation are known adverse outcomes (Hodges <i>et
      al.</i>, 2002). This pattern of reasoning is also evident in
      <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/"><i>Re J (Re
      J (A Minor) (Prohibited Steps Order: Circumcision)</i></a>,
      and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/2000.html"><i>Re
      J (Specific Issue Orders: Muslim Upbringing &amp;
      Circumcision)</i></a> [2000] 1 FLR 571; (2000) 52 BMLR 82,
      the only case where UK courts have directly considered
      circumcision). Asimilar conclusion has been reached in the
      Court of Appeal in <i>Re S (children) (Specific Issue:
      Religion: Circumcision)</i> [2005] 1 FLR 236. The case
      concerned a five year old boy &ndash; &lsquo;J&rsquo; &ndash;
      who following his parents&rsquo; separation lived with his
      mother, a non-practising English Christian. His father was a
      non-practising Turkish Muslim, who wanted J to be circumcised
      so as to identify him with his father and confirm him as a
      Muslim. Having considered the factors relevant to J&rsquo;s
      upbringing, the Court of Appeal concluded that J should not
      be circumcised because he was not, and nor was he likely to
      be, brought up in the Muslim religion. Instead he had
      &ldquo;a mixed heritage and an essentially secular
      lifestyle&rdquo; and was unlikely to have such a degree of
      involvement with Muslims as to justify circumcising him for
      social reasons. In these circumstances, Wall J held that the
      boy was unlikely to derive any social or cultural benefit
      from circumcision:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">[T]he mother, as J&rsquo;s primary
      carer, would find it extremely difficult to present the
      question of circumcision to J in a positive light, and unlike
      ritual circumcision occurring in the context of a Muslim
      family . . . J&rsquo;s circumcision would be likely to be
      surrounded by tension and stress. . . . The strained
      relationship between the parents, and the fact that as a
      circumcised child J would be unlike most of his peers,
      increases the risk that J will suffer from adverse
      psychological effects from being circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text1">Having reached this conclusion, the court
      was able to avoid squarely confronting the legality of
      non-therapeutic circumcision, and could simply state that,
      for such a procedure, the consent of both parents would be
      desirable. On appeal Thorpe LJ reaffirmed that the judge had
      correctly balanced the father&rsquo;s right to manifest his
      religion against the welfare of the child and the rights of
      the mother. However, the more fundamental issue of
      <i>why</i>, in the event of agreement, this should be a
      familial decision is not addressed by either court. For our
      purposes the interest of the case lies in how it reveals
      law&rsquo;s reluctance to calculate the (admittedly
      complicated) risks of circumcision, and its readiness to set
      the social, religious or cultural benefits believed to flow
      from the practice against medical harms. Implicit in the
      judgements in this case is the assumption that the
      socio-religious benefits accruing in cases where a child is
      brought up in a Muslim or Jewish environment would be
      sufficient to outweigh the medical risks &ndash; a conclusion
      endorsed by a number of leading medico-legal commentators.
      For instance Margot Brazier notes that:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">The child suffers momentary pain.
      Although medical opinion may not necessarily regard it as
      positively beneficial, it is in no way medically harmful if
      properly performed. The community as a whole regards it as a
      decision for the infant&rsquo;s parents (Brazier, 1992:
      350).<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In the Court of Appeal, Thorpe LJ seems more
      cautious but does cite with approval Wall J&rsquo;s view
      that:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">[C]ircumcision is an effectively
      irreversible surgical intervention which has no medical basis
      in J&rsquo;s case. It is likely to be painful and carries
      with it small but de.nable physical and psychological risks.
      For it to be ordered there would accordingly have to be clear
      benefits to J which would demonstrate that circumcision was
      in his interests notwithstanding the risks (at 574).</p>

      <p class="text1">Yet, although he summarily dismisses the
      contrary view of the father&rsquo;s counsel that any
      considerations against circumcision were either transient or
      speculative, it is noteworthy that there is no explication of
      the precise nature of these physical and psychological risks.
      This is curious in an age when judges in health care cases
      appear to require ever more detailed quantifications of risks
      prior to authorising medical interventions.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Although a potential disadvantage is
      that reducing cost benefit analyses to statistical
      calculations may be very contested and may render judges
      especially susceptible to medical evidence if it is framed in
      quantifiable terms, we would argue that it is important that
      some attempt is made to quantify the nature of risks,
      especially when the purpose is non therapeutic, as in the
      contexts of research and vaccination, as well as
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">As well as minimising risks, commentators
      are equally prone to exaggerate putative benefits of infant
      circumcision. As noted above, Caroline Bridge reads <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/">Re J</a> as
      authority for the proposition that doctors must embrace
      cultural pluralism by recognising and acting upon religious
      wishes, even if this involves a medically unnecessary
      procedure which interferes with the bodily integrity of the
      child, provided both parents agree and to the extent that the
      child benefits (Bridge, 2002: 282). However, in weighing
      these benefits, she not only characterises the practice as
      not causing significant harm, but also includes highly
      contested protective benefits against sexually transmitted
      diseases which are said to flow from male circumcision.
      Bridge&rsquo;s conclusion in facilitated by the rhetorical
      strategies we have outlined:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Male circumcision is relatively
      harmless albeit, like tattooing, irreversible. The risks are
      minimal, the cultural and religious significance very great
      to large number of people, and it is now reported as having
      long term protective effects. This enhances its rational
      basis. Just as significantly, it is not a practice belonging
      to the fringes of society but is almost part of the
      mainstream. Female circumcision is the reverse (Bridge, 2002:
      284).</p>

      <p class="text1">Though conceding that this is &ldquo;an
      arguably medically unnecessary and irreversible invasive
      procedure on male infants&rdquo; and that it is
      &ldquo;arguably, unnecessary mutilation for religious or
      cultural reasons&rdquo;, Bridge concludes that
      &ldquo;[a]rguably the long term protective benefits of
      circumcision, coupled with its religious significance,
      contribute to the child&rsquo;s overall welfare and is in his
      best interests&rdquo; (Bridge, 2002: 281). The repeated
      qualifier &lsquo;arguably&rsquo; signals how much scope there
      is for debate over the alleged benefits and risks of the
      practice, while construing male circumcision as &ldquo;almost
      part of the mainstream&rdquo; signals a reluctance to
      challenge cultural norms.</p>

      <p><b>The process of down-playing medical risks</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Addressing the question of why such risks
      continue to be routinely denied or downplayed, thus casting
      this as a non-issue for law, pulls in several directions.
      Responses &ndash; or rather the failure to respond &ndash; to
      risk may be partly attributable to a widespread unwillingness
      to recognise certain forms of harm, especially those which
      are child specific. Below we address the ambivalent and
      contested nature of harm and pain. However, notwithstanding
      the historical and continuing cultural devaluation of the
      risks posed by male circumcision, it is impossible for
      commentators to ignore them completely and they are now
      beginning to be acknowledged in ethics and law.</p>

      <p class="text2">Turning first to professional ethical
      guidance issued to physicians. The American Paediatric
      Association guidance concedes that the infant experiences
      pain, with the resulting wound taking approximately ten days
      to heal. However, provided it is performed properly it
      concludes that there are generally no acknowledged
      ramifications (American Pediatric Association, 1995). As we
      have noted, the British Medical Association&rsquo;s advice on
      circumcision focuses on potential benefits rather than risks,
      although it acknowledges that, whereas &ldquo;the practice of
      circumcision has previously been considered to be morally
      neutral&rdquo;, it is now increasingly open to challenge. The
      BMA advises that:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Individual doctors approached by
      parents requesting circumcision for their sons must counsel
      the parents about the implications of the procedures,
      including the health risks involved. Any surgical procedure,
      including one of a minor nature, carries with it risks, and
      parents must be made aware of these in order to give valid
      consent to the operation. In addition, doctors usually
      consider appropriate anaesthesia a requirement and this also
      carries an element of risk.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Yet, notwithstanding this tacit
      acknowledgement of its inherent risks, the practice is
      clearly to be tolerated. There seems little will on the part
      of the medical profession, whether institutionally or at the
      level of the individual practitioner, to challenge the
      acceptability of the procedure. In this respect attitudes to
      male circumcision may usefully be contrasted with other areas
      of health care law, where the ethics and legality of exposing
      infants to risk has generated considerable controversy and
      debate. We would suggest that a more productive comparison
      than female circumcision is to draw analogies with enrolment
      of infants in clinical research or vaccination programmes. In
      these contexts children are clearly vulnerable to being used
      for the benefit of others, raising similar concerns about the
      limits, if any, to parental powers to consent to
      controversial and invasive procedures on very young children.
      Yet, despite the possibility of real benefit to the
      individual child or other children, an extensive literature
      debates the ethics of engaging children in such practices
      (see, for instance, Nicolson, 1985; Bridgeman, 2002). The
      lack of tangible individual or societal benefit accompanying
      circumcision makes it surprising that the routine nature of
      this practice has escaped similar legal controversy.
      Law&rsquo;s failure to scrutinise adequately the risky nature
      of this practice is particularly indefensible, since tort
      actions have forced law to confront and quantify the damage
      that has resulted from negligently performed
      circumcisions.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One glaring example of UK law&rsquo;s
      failure is an influential Law Commission consultation paper,
      whose reasoning forms the basis for the BMA&rsquo;s guidance.
      In <i>Consent in the Criminal Law</i> the Law Commission
      addressed the limits that law should impose on the degree of
      injury to which a victim might lawfully consent. Its
      conclusion &ndash; that English law should permit the causing
      of intentional consensual injury provided that it fell short
      of being &ldquo;seriously disabling&rdquo; (Law Commission,
      1995: para 4.51) &ndash; would represent a significant
      liberalisation of English law in relation to a range of
      consensual practices, such as sado-masochism, branding,
      piercing and tattooing. In adopting this position, the
      Commission was highly critical of the landmark House of
      Lords&rsquo; decision in <i>R v. Brown (R v. Brown</i> [1993]
      2 All ER 75), which criminalised the infliction of injury
      during consensual sado-masochistic practices.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> However, the notable feature of the
      practices considered by the Law Commission in Part IX of this
      report is that, aside from male circumcision, all of them are
      consensual actions engaged in by adults. To place infant male
      circumcision in this context seems bizarre, and explicable
      only by the Commission&rsquo;s implicit endorsement of an
      <i>obiter</i> comment by Lord Templeman in <i>Brown</i>,
      categorising male circumcision as a deliberately inflicted,
      but apparently lawful injury:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Surgery involves intentional violence
      resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm but
      surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities carried on
      with consent by or on behalf of the injured person have been
      accepted as lawful notwithstanding that they involve actual
      bodily harm or may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual
      circumcision, tattooing, ear piercing and violent sports
      including boxing are lawful activities.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In the single paragraph which it
      subsequently devotes to circumcision the Commission simply
      states, without reference to any legal authority, that
      &ldquo;[m]ale circumcision is lawful under English common
      law.&rdquo; There is no discussion of what the practice
      involves, and, crucially, harms occasioned are downplayed or
      wholly ignored in the following statement:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">It is generally accepted that the
      removal of the foreskin of the penis has little if any effect
      on a man&rsquo;s ability to enjoy sexual intercourse, and
      this act is not, therefore, regarded as a mutilation (Law
      Commission, 1995: para 9.2).</p>

      <p class="text1">There is no acknowledgement that this
      position is heavily disputed in the medical literature, given
      that &ldquo;[t]he prepuce plays an important role in the
      mechanical functioning of the penis during sexual acts, such
      as penetrative intercourse and masturbation&rdquo; (Warren,
      1997: 89). Moreover, the Law Commission omits any
      consideration of the greater risks inherent in circumcision.
      The elision of these risks leads it to propose that:
      &lsquo;[I]t would be useful to put the lawfulness of ritual
      male circumcision beyond any doubt&rsquo; (Law Commission,
      1995: 9.3).</p>

      <p class="text2">In relation to body piercing of young
      children the Law Commission is equally tolerant of parental
      preferences (Law Commission, 1995: 11.22) and Jo Bridgeman
      suggests this may be rooted in our cultural unwillingness to
      recognise young children as possessors of bodily integrity
      (Bridgeman 2002: 111). Moreover, not only does the Commission
      fail to support its position on these interferences with
      bodily integrity, but David Ormerod and Michael Gunn have
      highlighted the inconsistencies underpinning its reasoning.
      Elsewhere it takes the view that female circumcision should
      remain completely banned, yet suggests that adults should be
      allowed to consent to even seriously disabling injury
      occasioned by gender reassignment or cosmetic surgery
      (Ormerod and Gunn, 1996).<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> We
      would argue that in its failure to engage fully with a
      risk/benefit assessment of these various practices, the
      consultation document, like the <i>Brown</i> decision itself,
      is characteristic of legal reasoning. <i>Brown</i> has
      attracted a wealth of critical comment, one strand of which
      centres on the way in which it grossly exaggerated the risks
      of the sexual practices involved.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> In the case of circumcision a
      reversal of this process may be traced in law&rsquo;s
      willingness to downgrade risks of harm. This allows the Law
      Commission to ignore the fundamental challenges posed by male
      circumcision, including whether it can be categorised as a
      seriously disabling injury, whether the practice should be
      banned or limited to specific religious groups and whether it
      can be regarded as in the best interests of the child
      (Ormerod and Gunn, 1996: 703).</p>

      <p class="text2">It is significant that a range of different
      ethico-legal texts, from court decisions, to professional
      guidance, to law reform proposals, reveal a similar
      understanding of and response to circumcision. Together these
      texts form an influential discourse according to which infant
      male circumcision is perceived as low risk and hence a matter
      of parental choice, notwithstanding the lack of scientific
      justification for the practice. Only limited consideration is
      given to the seemingly obvious fact that circumcision is the
      excision of healthy tissue from a child unable to give his
      consent for no demonstrable medical benefit. In the rest of
      this article we wish to explore why this might be the case.
      It is necessary in doing so to address the reasons why and
      conditions in which this discourse and legal norms have
      emerged. The next section offers a brief genealogy of the
      emergence and routinization of the practice of circumcision
      in order to reframe male circumcision by rebutting
      contemporary medico-legal complacency as to its
      justifications. This also serves to highlight the way in
      which the historical justifications foreground the idea of
      marking and managing the sexed infant body and male
      sexuality.</p>

      <p><b>Historical medical narratives</b></p>

      <p class="text1">In February 1870 the highly respected and
      influential orthopaedic surgeon Dr John Lewis A. Sayre
      visited a young patient suffering paralysis. Initially he was
      unable to ascertain the cause, but soon discovered that the
      five year old boy&rsquo;s penis, whilst otherwise normal, had
      &lsquo;very small and pointed&rsquo; glans &lsquo;tightly
      imprisoned in the contracted foreskin. In an effort to
      escape, the meatus urinarius had become puffed out and red as
      in a case of severe granular urethritis.&rsquo; As he
      concluded:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">An excessive venery is a fruitful
      source of physical prostration and nervous exhaustion,
      sometimes producing paralysis, I was pleased to look upon
      this case in the same light, and recommended circumcision as
      a means of relieving the irritated and imprisoned penis
      (Sayre, 1870: 206).</p>

      <p class="text1">The circumcision led to almost immediate
      improvements in the boy&rsquo;s health and before long he was
      walking with normal limbs. Sayre went on to perform a number
      of such operations. Subsequently he informed his colleagues
      that circumcision was the answer to a range of ailments:
      &lsquo;Many of the cases of irritable children, with restless
      sleep, and bad digestion, which are often attributed to
      worms, is [sic] solely due to the irritation of the nervous
      system caused by an adherent or constricted prepuce&rsquo;
      (Sayre, 1870: 210). This marked the beginning of the rise and
      rise of Phimosis, an ill-defined and fluid pathology (Hodges,
      1999) and the recoding of the foreskin as pathological.
      Beyond the ailments of children, circumcision came to be seen
      as a cure for more problematic and elusive illnesses, as
      Miller notes:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Within fairly short order, circumcision
      was promoted as a remedy for alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma,
      gout, rheumatism, curvature of the spine and headache . . .
      paralysis, malnutrition, night terrors, and clubfoot; eczema,
      convulsions and mental retardation; promiscuity, syphilis,
      and cancer (Miller, 2002: 527).</p>

      <p class="text1">Medical circumcision developed during a
      well-documented period of experimentation in genital surgery.
      This experimentation was motivated in part by the theory of
      reflex neurosis, a belief that &lsquo;there was an intricate
      web of nervous affinity running through the spine of every
      organ of the body and that, in turn, each organ had its own
      sphere of influence on physical and mental health&rsquo;
      (Gollaher, 1994). On this understanding, circumcision emerged
      as a cure for a range of mental as well as physical
      illnesses. It was promoted as a cure for the related
      Victorian scourges of masturbation and insanity, and the more
      amorphous neurasthenia, a condition entailing:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">morbid fears, fear of society, of
      solitude, or travelling, of places, of disease, or morbid
      impulses, to kill oneself or others, mental depression,
      wakefulness, headache, impaired memory, [and] deficient
      mental control (Beard, 1882).</p>

      <p class="text1">Importantly, at the same time that
      circumcision emerged in a therapeutic context for a growing
      number of problems, clitoridectomies and other medical
      treatment of the clitoris were enthusiastically revived for
      the alleviation of psychological symptoms (Gollaher,
      1994).</p>

      <p class="text2">As with this form of female circumcision, a
      belief emerged that male circumcision cured masturbation, a
      &lsquo;well known&rsquo;cause of degeneracy and insanity. The
      role played by the emerging fear of the masturbating child in
      the history of the normalisation of circumcision needs to be
      acknowledged. Circumcision allowed the Victorians to manage
      cultural anxieties regarding masturbation,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> which had prompted an extensive
      campaign against masturbation and spermatorrhoea (&lsquo;wet
      dreams&rsquo;) (Miller, 2002: 534). It was forcefully argued
      that circumcision diminished the incidence of masturbation by
      removing or preventing adhesions which would otherwise lead
      to the penis being handled and &ndash; almost invariably
      &ndash; to self-abuse (Miller, 2003: 527). Arguably, curing
      masturbation was understood as the most important health
      benefit of circumcision (Miller, 2002: 527).<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> Peter Charles Remondino&rsquo;s
      polemical and misleadingly titled <i>History of
      Circumcision</i> provides an indication of the role played by
      the spectre of the masturbating child, and illustrates the
      ultimate status that the &lsquo;tight-constricted,
      glans-deforming, onanism-producing, cancer-generating&rsquo;
      foreskin attained:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">The prepuce seems to exercise a malign
      influence in the most distant and apparently unconnected
      manner; where, like some of the evil genii or sprites in the
      Arabian tales, it can reach from afar the object of its
      malignity, striking him down unawares in the most
      unaccountable manner; making him a victim to all manner of
      ills, sufferings, and tribulations; unfitting him for
      marriage or the cares of business; making him miserable and
      an object of continual scolding and punishment in childhood,
      through its worriments and nocturnal enuresis; later on,
      beginning to affect him with all kinds of physical
      distortions and ailments, nocturnal pollutions, and other
      conditions calculated to weaken him physically, mentally and
      morally; to land him perchance, in jail or even in a lunatic
      asylum (Remondino, 1891: 187, 255&ndash;6).</p>

      <p class="text2">Associated with the &lsquo;war&rsquo; on
      masturbation was the more general desire to curb or tame
      masculine sexuality. Thus, in the <i>British Medical
      Journal</i> in 1935, R.W. Cockshut argued that a (further)
      benefit of removing the foreskin was the diminishment of the
      libido:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">I suggest that all male children should
      be circumcised . . . Civilization . . . requires chastity,
      and the glans of the circumcised rapidly assumes a leathery
      texture less sensitive than skin. Thus the adolescent has his
      attention drawn to his penis much less often . . .
      (Cockshut).<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The efficacy of circumcision was so widely
      accepted that it was enthusiastically advocated as a
      prophylactic, and by 1910 had become the most common
      operation in the United States (Miller, 2002: 532).<sup><a
      href="#n19">18</a></sup> The case for prophylactic
      circumcision was forcefully made by J.M. McGee, though he
      remained unconvinced by Sayre&rsquo;s dramatic claims:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">I would favor circumcision . . .
      independent of existing disease, as a sanitary precaution
      [because] . . . (1.) The exposure of the glans to friction
      etc., hardens it, and renders it less liable to abrasion in
      sexual intercourse, and consequently venereal ulcer. (2.) It
      is acknowledged to be useful as a preventative of
      masturbation. (3.) It certainly renders the accident of
      phymosis and paraphymosis impossible. (4.) It prevents the
      retention of sebaceous secretion and consequent balanitis.
      (5.) It probably promotes continence by diminishing the
      pruriency of the sexual appetite (McGee, 1882, cited in
      Gollaher, 1994).</p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, within this history it is important
      to note the class and race dynamic that emerged. The fact
      that routine male circumcision long out lasted the sanitary
      movement may be explained in part through the recognition of
      how circumcision status became a signifier of social standing
      or distinction. Within this period childbirth for the middle-
      and upper-classes moved from the domestic setting to a
      medical moment subject to the management of physicians. As
      midwives rarely performed the procedure, to be circumcised
      was literally a marker of the child&rsquo;s birth rite/right.
      Similarly, it also existed as a barometer of the
      medicalisation of childbirth and the social status of the
      profession (Gollaher, 1994). In 1949, on the eve of the
      decline in circumcision rates in the UK, one study of
      university entrants noted that 84 percent of students coming
      from the &lsquo;best-known public schools&rsquo; were
      circumcised, in comparison to only 50 percent from other
      schools (Gairdner, 1949: 1433&ndash;37). This worked through
      from the association between health and morals and also
      through the association with the physician
      &lsquo;class&rsquo;. Gollaher notes that: &lsquo;the trend
      was inspired by a kind of medical class who persuaded their
      private patients of . . . the utility of emulation&rsquo;
      (Gollaher, 1994). This emulation of class was of growing
      importance within the changing demographics of turn of the
      century America. With the in.ux of immigrants from Southern
      and Eastern Europe a racist discourse of pollution and
      contagion emerged. Circumcision status as a social marker
      flourished within this. As Gollaher concludes:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">So it happened that the foreskin,
      despised by the medical profession, came to broadly signify
      ignorance, neglect, and poverty. As white middle-class
      gentiles adopted circumcision, those left behind were mainly
      recent immigrants, African Americans, the poor, and others at
      the margins of respectable society (Gollaher, 1994:
      22&ndash;23).</p>

      <p class="text1">The distribution across class continues to
      the present day (Miller, 2002: 532), and may be a material
      factor in the persistence of the procedure. As Sarah Waldeck
      has argued, &lsquo;norms that are rooted in concerns about
      esteem and reputation often work to lock in
      inefficiencies&rsquo;(Waldeck, 2002).</p>

      <p><b>Constructing harm to boy&rsquo;s bodies</b></p>

      <p class="text1">In the more recent medical narratives
      surrounding circumcision that we examined above the discourse
      of risks and harms looms large. Significantly, however, the
      preoccupation in this literature is again with harms that are
      portrayed as flowing from a failure to circumcise, rather
      than those potentially or directly inflicted by the practice
      of circumcision itself. We would argue that this is a typical
      feature of law, which as we have noted, tends differentially
      to construct harms, attaching weight to some, while
      downplaying others. In a society characterised by a
      proliferation of risks, the notion of
      &lsquo;harm&rsquo;remains conceptually fluid. As Beck, Wells
      and others have argued, societal perceptions of risk are
      culturally speci.c and dependent on contemporary notions of
      what harms are acceptable (see, for instance, Beck, 1992;
      Wells, 1998). Medicine and law function as key social
      institutions to not only manage risks, but to produce
      knowledge about them. Ideally, this should translate into
      some forum for disseminating and debating the legal and moral
      issues raised, but in the context of male circumcision, we
      would argue that current ethical guidance and law fails to do
      this.</p>

      <p class="text2">We would suggest that a number of factors
      facilitate the downplaying of risks and harm this context. It
      is worth noting that the notion of harm is inherently
      subjective and open to manipulation. The texts we have
      analysed above demonstrate Carol Smart&rsquo;s contention
      that &lsquo;harm&rsquo; is not &ldquo;a transcendental notion
      which is automatically knowable and recognisable at any
      moment in history by any member of a culture&rdquo; (Smart,
      1999: 392).<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Moreover, the
      notion of harm to children is particularly open to
      manipulation given the inability of a young child to
      articulate his pain and the contradictions which are evident
      in law&rsquo;s understanding of children. As Katherine
      O&rsquo;Donovan has argued, law routinely denies the
      subjectivity of children, and has structured the parent/child
      relationship in terms of parental responsibility
      (O&rsquo;Donovan, 1993). Of course, this general construction
      of the child as a legal object rather than subject is
      re.ective of a broader confusion in our society about the
      status of children. Throughout the twentieth century Valerie
      Zelizer has traced a profound cultural transformation in our
      attitudes to children, which she terms the
      &lsquo;sacrilization&rsquo; of children&rsquo;s lives. This
      process involves a shift from viewing children as an object
      of utility to valuing them as an object of sentiment
      (Zelizer, 1985: Chapter 1). These competing constructions of
      the child &ndash; as expendable property and as a sentimental
      object of concern &ndash; can both be tracked in the history
      of circumcision we have outlined. Although the latter
      construction is now dominant, in the Victorian era children
      were much more readily deemed expendable &ndash; as
      exemplified by high rates of infant mortality, and even new
      born child murder (Jackson, 1998). Thus, it is scarcely
      surprising that &ldquo;[c]hildhood has lurched from privacy,
      non regulation and minimal legal protection into regulation
      by a phalanx of specialist agencies&rdquo; (Evans, 1993:
      392). Yet, as exemplified by the circumcision debates, such
      regulation remains partial, as certain decisions pertaining
      to children remain unchallenged in the private zones of
      family and religion. Thus, although they may indeed be cast
      as objects of concern, frequently this does not translate
      into benefits or protection for the child.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our discussion of how the Law Commission
      discounted risks to children at pp. 164&ndash;5 above, we
      noted Bridgeman&rsquo;s argument that we remain culturally
      unwilling to recognise the bodily integrity of young
      children. She argues persuasively that &ldquo;within law,
      children&rsquo;s bodies are constructed as potential and what
      is permitted by the law is determined by consideration of the
      future which the child embodies and without consideration of
      the present reality of the child&rdquo; (Bridgeman, 202:
      103). We would suggest that, in the circumcision context,
      this construction of the child results in undue priority
      being accorded to parental assessments of his best future
      interests and a concomitant downplaying of harms in.icted in
      the present. The harm which we would particularly flag up in
      this context is the pain inflicted on the child. As Elaine
      Scarry has argued in her influential consideration of the
      topic, it is inherently difficult to make sense of pain.
      Unlike any other state of consciousness it lacks a
      referential context &ndash; &ldquo;it is not <i>of</i> or
      <i>for</i> anything. It is precisely because it takes no
      object that it, more than any other phenomenon, resists
      objectification in language&rdquo; (Scarry, 1985: 5). Scarry
      suggests that pain&rsquo;s resistance to, or active
      destruction of language, results in it being radically
      unshareable:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">[F]or the person in pain, so
      uncontestably and unnegotiably present is it that
      &lsquo;having pain&rsquo; may come to be thought of as the
      most vibrant example of what it is to &lsquo;have
      certainty&rsquo;, while for the other person it is so elusive
      that &lsquo;hearing about pain&rsquo; may exist as the
      primary model of what it is &lsquo;to have doubt&rsquo;. Thus
      pain comes unshareably into our midst as at once that which
      cannot be denied and that which cannot be confirmed (Scarry,
      2002: 4).</p>

      <p class="text1">Clearly such difficulties in communicating
      and sharing the experience of pain are compounded in the case
      of young children since they have no language at all in which
      to attempt to communicate their experience. In this regard we
      would argue that the medical profession have been culpable in
      their failure to articulate the pain inherent in
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Indeed, as Miller points out, doctors took
      advantage of the fact that performing the procedure on
      neonates who were incapable of resisting made it considerably
      easier to practise (Miller, 2002: 530). Furthermore, then
      prevailing beliefs that neonates did not experience pain
      allowed physicians to argue that surgical interventions at
      this early stage carried reduced risks, since they could be
      accomplished without anaesthetic and with less invasive
      cutting than would be necessary with an older child.
      Additionally, even physicians who acknowledged that the
      procedure in.icted pain could justify this by pointing to a
      salutary association thereby created between pain and
      masturbation, thus reinforcing the campaign against
      masturbation.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> Miller notes
      that a further practical advantage of early circumcision was
      that bad results, even death, were easily explicable in an
      era where neonatal death was unremarkable (Miller, 2002:
      530&ndash;1). It is more surprising that modern
      understandings of children as objects of intense concern
      (Evans, 1993: 209), coupled with significantly reduced rates
      of infant mortality, and growing evidence of the capacity
      even of late foetuses to feel pain (Fitzgerald, 1995), have
      not conspired to make doctors more conscious of the need to
      underline the infant capacity for pain and to contest
      practices which inflict it unnecessarily. As Scarry notes,
      &ldquo;the success of the physician&rsquo;s work will often
      depend on the acuity with which she can hear the fragmentary
      language of pain, coax it into clarity and interpret
      it&rdquo; (Scarry, 1985: 7). In this regard we argue that the
      medical profession have failed children.</p>

      <p class="text2">We would also suggest that gender is
      crucially implicated in this failure. In health care, as in
      other legal disciplines, male bodies have functioned as the
      norm and therefore tended to be less politically contentious
      than other bodies. Thus, feminist critiques of health care
      law have done much to foreground harms that are specific to
      women&rsquo;s bodies, while foetal rights advocates have
      argued strenuously for foetal protection policies that avert
      harm to the foetus. Debates concerning these bodies have
      often focused on their vulnerability to harm &ndash; as is
      evident in the framing of debates around female circumcision.
      By contrast, male bodies are typically constructed as safe,
      bounded and impermeable.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> We
      would argue that this construction is problematic in a number
      of ways. Within the immediate context it fits somewhat
      uneasily with law&rsquo;s rather vexed construction of
      children&rsquo;s bodies, rendering the construction of the
      boy&rsquo;s body in law inherently contradictory. We would
      suggest that this may make it more difficult to uncover harms
      to boys &ndash; a contention which seems to be borne out by
      the tendency of Anglo-American legal commentators to minimise
      the harms inflicted on boys by circumcision with a
      concomitant propensity to exacerbate the risks occasioned by
      less invasive forms of female circumcision. Our suggestion is
      that within law the role of abuse victim is feminised, so
      that the discursive construction of victims may produce a
      greater acknowledgment of harms perpetrated against girls. As
      Carol Smart has noted, boys were seemingly &ldquo;not
      constituted as part of the historical story of child sexual
      abuse&rdquo; (Smart, 1999: 395).</p>

      <p class="text2">On this view gender is an important
      component of the subjective construction of harm. This
      contention is also borne out by the historical medical
      narratives outlined above, which continue to be implicated in
      contemporary reluctance to acknowledge male circumcision as
      harm. Moreover, we would tentatively flag up here an argument
      that, for boys, the pain inflicted by circumcision may even
      be seen as beneficial in fostering a necessary training in
      masculinity. In aesthetic terms it serves to medically
      enhance his body, thereby conferring important social
      benefits through signalling his membership of privileged
      religious, racial or social groupings. We would argue that
      understanding circumcision as an initiation into masculinity
      underpins the deeprooted cultural preference for male
      circumcision in Anglo-American world and is useful both in
      accounting for the persistence of the practice and in
      suggesting ways to eradicate it.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

      <p class="blockquote">Although the sensation of pain is
      entirely subjective, how it is perceived, configured,
      communicated and, explained, relieved or amplified, and its
      effect upon a person&rsquo;s relationship to others and
      themselves, are shaped inter-subjectively by cultural beliefs
      and social practices, including, not least by prevailing
      medical categories and beliefs (Morgan, 2002: 88).</p>

      <p class="text1">This paper has aimed to question the general
      legal and social acceptance of the practice of routine male
      circumcision. Contesting current legal approaches to issues
      of harm, risk and the rights of children, we have argued that
      the dominant permissive approach to male circumcision is
      indefensible. Historically law has tolerated male
      circumcision as a benign practice, but we hope to have
      demonstrated that many of the underlying reasons for
      construing it as harmless need to be re-assessed. Doing so
      would, we argue, help to challenge the view that simply
      because a practice is perceived as mainstream in our society
      (Bridge, 2002: 282) it is to be legally tolerated in the
      absence of a compelling case that its medical benefits
      outweigh its clear harms. We concur with Sarah
      Waldeck&rsquo;s position that imposing legal reforms will not
      work unless the social norms which underpin them and parental
      motivations for circumcising their children are understood
      and subjected to challenge. Consequently we suggest that
      further consideration is needed of the specific form which
      legal regulation might take, on this and other issues where
      parents are entrusted with deciding in the best interests of
      their children. Any legal reform proposals must be coupled
      with a clear demonstration of their rationale, and we would
      argue that the medical profession has a key role to play in
      education. As was the case with child sexual abuse, we
      suggest that the contested nature of key conceptions in the
      circumcision debate &ndash; such as &lsquo;child&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;harm&rsquo; and &lsquo;pain&rsquo; &ndash; combined
      with the fact that such pain is inflicted within the sanctity
      of the family account for law&rsquo;s resistance to attempts
      to regulate the practice or fully evaluate its risks. In this
      context, as with the uncovering of child abuse, we would
      argue that there is a need for law to be alert to its power
      in defining risks and manipulating the concept of harm, and
      to interrogate why parents should be entrusted with decisions
      about their children&rsquo;s best interests. For so long as
      children continue to function as the repository of various
      contradictory meanings, concerns that they evoke will often
      speak more to the implications for adults of issues
      surrounding the child, than child protection.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> Our contention is that in cases of
      demonstrable harm, such as the unnecessary and painful
      excision of healthy tissue, law and professional guidance
      should be motivated by child protection until that child can
      make his or her autonomous decisions.</p>

      <p><b>Notes</b></p>

      <p class="notes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="n1"
      name="n1"></a><sup>1</sup> Circumcision is a legitimate
      medical treatment primarily for Phimosis. Phimosis refers to
      a constricted or adherent foreskin. Most male infants are,
      however, born with an adherent foreskin that only
      subsequently becomes fully functioning. The vast majority of
      male children will have fully retractable foreskins by the
      age of five. In addition, many persistent problems can be
      remedied manually without having to rely on circumcision.
      Medical understandings of Phimosis have been
      &lsquo;elastic&rsquo; and overly inclusive (See Rickwood
      <i>et al.</i> 2000; Hodges, 1999: 37).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n2"
      name="n2"></a><sup>2</sup> Other developed Western European
      nations have a cumulative national circumcision rate of only
      c 1.6% for boys under 15 years of age (See Warren, 1997: at
      86; Frisch <i>et al.</i>, 1995).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n3"
      name="n3"></a><sup>3</sup> In 1995 the rate was reported as
      &lsquo;less than 10%&rsquo; (Rangecroft, 1995). Warren
      suggests that &lsquo;since 1950 the cumulative circumcision
      rate in boys has dropped from about 30% to about 6 or
      7%&rsquo;(Warren, 1997).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n4"
      name="n4"></a><sup>4</sup> It is interesting to note that the
      recent substantial cuts in state government budgets have lead
      to the termination of public funding for circumcision in a
      number of states. (Skipp, 2002).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n5"
      name="n5"></a><sup>5</sup> Bleeding is a particularly common
      complication because of the vascular structure of the
      prepuce, while infection is estimated to occur in 10 per cent
      of cases. (See also Williams and Kapila, 1993b.) Miller is
      more graphic:<br />
       Memories of the pain may impair his intellectual or
      emotional development. And the procedure, although safe as
      surgeries go, is not risk free. Boys experience haemorrhage,
      infection and ulceration; the urethral opening narrows due to
      scarring; and the penis may be bent, deformed, split,
      perforated, amputated or burned off (Miller, 2002:
      574).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n6"
      name="n6"></a><sup>6</sup> This echoes the similar position
      defended by Benatar and Benatar, 2003.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n7"
      name="n7"></a><sup>7</sup> Interestingly in the later edition
      of her text, having discussed <i>Re J</i>, and then female
      circumcision, Brazier poses the question &ldquo;If ritual
      male circumcision is permissible, why not female circumcision
      if carried out by surgeons in aseptic conditions&rdquo;
      (Brazier, 2003: 359).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n8"
      name="n8"></a><sup>8</sup> See, for instance, the discussions
      in <i>Re MB (An Adult: Medical Treatment)</i> [1997] 8 Med.
      LR 217 and <i>St George&rsquo;s HealthCare NHS Trust v S</i>
      [1998] 3 All ER 673 and <i>Pearce v. United Bristol
      Healthcare NHS Trust</i> (1998) 48 BMLR 118 on the risks
      involved in refusing caesarean sections for the pregnant
      woman and foetus.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n9"
      name="n9"></a><sup>9</sup> This acknowledgment of risks makes
      Lord Templeman&rsquo;s position on male circumcision in
      <i>Brown</i> still more puzzling given his stress on all the
      potential risks which did not materialise in that case.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n10"
      name="n10"></a><sup>10</sup> The American cases include:
      <i>Doe v Raezer</i> 664 A.2d 102 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1995);
      <i>Felice v. Valleylab, Inc.</i>, 520 So. 2d 920 (La. Ct.
      App. 1987). (See further Miller, 2002; and more generally and
      from an Australian perspective, see Graycar, 2002.) In the
      UK, see <i>Iqbal v. Irfan</i> [1994] CLY 164; <i>B (A
      Child)</i> v. <i>Southern Hospital NHS Trust</i> [2003]
      3.Q.R. 9.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n11"
      name="n11"></a><sup>11</sup> Perhaps significantly one of the
      charges laid in the <i>Brown</i> case was the
      following:<br />
       Count 28 (Malicious wounding . . . The victim . . . had his
      penis hit and rubbed with sandpaper, then his scrotum was
      clamped and pinned to a board with three pins. His foreskin
      was nailed to a board. Matthew Weait notes the similarities
      between these injuries and forms of punishment which the
      courts used to sanction, noting the ritual degradation and
      humiliation present in both (Weait, 1996: pp.
      166&ndash;7).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n12"
      name="n12"></a><sup>12</sup> At pp. 78&ndash;9. In this,
      <i>Brown</i> echoes the earlier unreported decision in <i>R
      v. Adesanya</i> (1974) which was the first case to consider
      the issue of circumcision. A Nigerian woman was convicted of
      assault occasioning actually bodily harm (s. 47 OPA1861)
      having scarred her 14 and 9 year old sons by making incisions
      with a razor on cheeks in accordance with ritualistic customs
      practiced by the Yoruba tribe to which she belonged.
      King-Hamilton J. held that this practice carried a real
      potential for serious injury to the eyes if the child had
      moved his head. He suggested that this distinguished the
      practice from the ritual circumcision, which he accepted was
      lawful.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n13"
      name="n13"></a><sup>13</sup> On the illogical manner in which
      existing law treats female circumcision and cosmetic surgery,
      see Sheldon and Wilkinson, 1998.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n14"
      name="n14"></a><sup>14</sup> See Stychin, 1995: Chapter 7;
      Moran, 1996, chapter 8; Weait, 1996.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n15"
      name="n15"></a><sup>15</sup> For a comprehensive analysis of
      transatlantic anxiety regarding masturbation see Miller,
      2000&ndash;2001. Whilst this was a transatlantic phenomenon,
      it should be noted that anxieties ran higher in the United
      States. As Hodges notes:<br />
       American doctors saw sexuality as more of a threat to public
      health and social stability than did their European
      contemporaries. The American medical profession&rsquo;s
      intense focus on sexuality was due in part to economic
      pressures, the lack of a rigidly defined class system, the
      rise of the middle class, the rise of immigration, and other
      sources of social tension (Hodges <i>et al.</i> 2002).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n16"
      name="n16"></a><sup>16</sup> This assertion is better
      understood if we look at the construction of masturbation as
      at the root of nearly all illness. (See, Miller,
      2000&ndash;2001: 244.)<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n17"
      name="n17"></a><sup>17</sup> This theory was also supported
      by E. Harding Freeland in his call for universal circumcision
      as a means to prevent syphilis:<br />
       But it has been urged as an argument against the universal
      adoption of circumcision that the removal of the protective
      covering of the glans tends to dull the sensibility of that
      exquisitely sensitive structure and thereby diminishes sexual
      appetite and the pleasurable effects of coitus. Granted that
      this is true, my answer is that, whatever may have been the
      case in days gone by, sensuality in our time needs neither
      whip nor spur, but would be all the better for a little more
      judicious use of curb and bearing-rein. (Freeland,
      1900).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n18"
      name="n18"></a><sup>18</sup> It was still the most frequently
      performed operation in 1977 (Miller, 2002: 501).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n19"
      name="n19"></a><sup>19</sup> See also Miller, Aside from
      child abuse, another clear example of law&rsquo;s discursive
      construction of harm occurs in relation gay sado-masochistic
      sex in the <i>R v. Brown</i> case considered below.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n20"
      name="n20"></a><sup>20</sup> In this vein J.H. Kellogg
      suggested &lsquo;the pain attending the operation will have a
      salutary effect on the mind, especially if it be connected
      with the idea of punishment&rsquo; (Kellogg, 1888:
      295).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n21"
      name="n21"></a><sup>21</sup> See for instance, Sally
      Sheldon&rsquo;s discussion of foetal protection policies in
      the workplace, which she use to demonstrate how &ldquo;the
      negation of male reproductive capacity has been harmful to
      individual men in the same way as women&rsquo;s reduction to
      nothing more than reproductive capacity has been harmful to
      women&rdquo; (Sheldon, 2002: 26&ndash;7; see also Thomson,
      2002).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n22"
      name="n22"></a><sup>22</sup> For instance, in the case of
      circumcision, for many fathers the key motivation for
      circumcising their child has been a desire that their son
      physically resemble them (see, Hutson, 2004).</p>
