<h3>   Introduction</h3>

<p>
   It is the mission of the physician to safeguard the health of the
   people. His or her knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the
   fulfilment of this mission.

<p>
   The <A HREF="/library/ethics/geneva/">Declaration of Geneva</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.who.int/ina-ngo/ngo/ngo178.htm">World Medical Association</A> binds the
   physician with the words, "The health of my patient will be my first
   consideration,"and the <A HREF="/library/ethics/intlcode/">International Code of Medical Ethics</A> declares
   that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when
   providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the
   physical and mental condition of the patient. "

<p>
   The purpose of biomedical research involving human subjects must be to
   improve diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic procedures and the
   understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease.

<p>
   In current medical practice most diagnostic, therapeutic or
   prophylactic procedures involve hazards. This applies especially to
   biomedical research.

<p>
   Medical progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in
   part on experimentation involving human subjects. In the field of
   biomedical research a fundamental distinction must be
   recognised between medical research in which the aim is essentially
   diagnostic or therapeutic for a patient, and medical research the
   essential object of which is purely scientific and without implying
   direct diagnostic or therapeutic value to the person subjected to the
   research.

<p>
   Special caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may
   affect the environment, and the welfare of animals used for research
   must be respected.

<p>
   Because it is essential that the results of laboratory experiments be
   applied to human beings to further scientific knowledge and to help
   suffering humanity, the World Medical Association has prepared the
   following recommendations as a guide to every physician in biomedical
   research involving human subjects. They should be kept under review in
   the future. It must be stressed that the standards as drafted are only
   a guide to physicians all over the world. Physicians are not relieved
   from criminal, civil and ethical responsibilities under the law of
   their own countries.

<p>
<h3>   I. Basic Principles</h3>

<ol>
<p>
<li> Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to
   generally accepted scientific principles and should be based on
   adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation and on a
   thorough knowledge of the scientific literature.

<p>
<li> The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving
   human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental
   protocol which should be transmitted to a specially appointed
   independent committee for consideration, comment and guidance.

<p>
<li> Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted
   only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of
   a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the
   human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and
   never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has
   given his or her consent.

<p>
<li> Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be
   carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to
   the inherent risk to the subject.

<p>
<li> Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should
   be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison
   with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. Concern for the
   interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of
   science and society.

<p>
<li> The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity
   must always be respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect
   the privacy of the subject and to minimize the impact of the study on
   the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of
   the subject.

<p>
<li> Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects
   involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards
   involved are believed to be predictable. Physicians should cease any
   investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential
   benefits.

<p>
<li> In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician
   is obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of
   experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in
   this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.

<p>
<li> In any research on human beings, each potential subject mustbe
   adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and
   potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or
   she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from
   participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw
   visor her consent to participation at any time. The physician should
   then obtain the subject's freely given informed consent, preferably
   inheriting.

<p>
<li> When obtaining informed consent for the research project the
   physician should be particularly cautious if the subject is in
   dependent relationship to him or her or may consent under duress. In
   that case the informed consent should be obtained by a physician who
   isn't engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent
   of this official relationship.

<p>
<li> In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained
   from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where
   physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed
   consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the
   responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with
   national legislation. Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give
   a consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the
   consent of the minor's legal guardian.

<p>
<li> The research protocol should always contain a statement of the
   ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the
   principles enunciated in the present declaration are complied with.
</ol>

<h3>II. Medical Research Combined with Professional Care (Clinical
   Research)</h3>

<ol>
<li> In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to
   use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her
   judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or
   alleviating suffering.

<p>
<li> The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method
   should be weighed against the advantages of the best current
   diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

<p>
<li> In any medical study, every patient- including those of a control
   group, if any- should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and
   therapeutic method.

<p>
<li> The refusal of the patient to participate in a study must never
   interfere with the physician-patient relationship.

<p>
<li> If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed
   consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in
   the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent
   committee (1, 2).

<p>
<li> The physician can combine medical research with professional care,
   the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge,only to
   the extent that medical research is justified by its potential
   diagnostic or therapeutic value for the patient.
</ol>

<h3> III. Non-Therapeutic Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects
   (Non-Clinical Biomedical Research)</h3>

<ol>
<li> In the purely scientific application of medical research carried
   out on a human being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the
   protector of the life and health of that person on whom biomedical
   research is being carried out.

<p>
<li> The subjects should be volunteers- either healthy persons or
   patients for whom the experimental design is not related to the
   patient's illness.

<p>
<li> The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the
   research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be
   harmful to the individual.

<p>
<li> In research on man, the interest of science and society should
   never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of
   the subject.
