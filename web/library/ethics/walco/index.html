      <p class="text2">It has long been recognized that patients
      receive less relief from pain than they should <sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>. A recent review concluded that pain
      can be relieved effectively in 90 percent of patients but is
      not relieved effectively in 80 percent of patients <sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup>. <span class="yellow">The tendency
      toward undermedication for pain is even more pronounced in
      children than in adults.</span><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      <span class="yellow">There are large discrepancies between
      the amounts of postoperative analgesia ordered for and
      administered to adults and those ordered for and administered
      to children who have the same diagnoses and have undergone
      the same procedures.</span><sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Interest in pain control in children has
      blossomed over the past decade, but there remains an
      incongruity between what is available technologically and
      what is practiced clinically.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      Possible reasons for this disparity include incorrect
      assumptions about pain and its management, individual and
      social attitudes toward pain, the complexity of assessing
      pain in children, and inadequate research and
      training.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> In each of these
      areas, one must ask whether the apparent undertreatment of
      pain in children is ethically justifiable.</p>

      <p class="text2">The fundamental principle of responsible
      medical care is not ``do not hurt'' but ``do no harm.'' Harm
      occurs when the amount of hurt or suffering is greater than
      necessary to achieve the intended benefit. Here lies the
      basic ethical challenge to care givers: Since pain seems
      harmful to patients, and care givers are categorically
      committed to preventing harm to their patients, not using all
      the available means of relieving pain must be justified.
      Possible justifications can be divided into three types:
      revisionist, comparative, and pragmatic.</p>

      <h4>The Revisionist Justification</h4>

      <p class="text2">Usually, medical decision making relies on
      objective data. Pain is a subjective experience, however, and
      a direct quantitative assessment of it is difficult.
      Therefore, physicians rely on behavioral observations and
      knowledge of the specific pathophysiologic processes
      involved, as well as patients' own reports, to make judgments
      about children's experience of pain.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> The fact that pain is undertreated in
      children suggests that the final assessment tends to minimize
      the level of pain.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One possible reason for this tendency is the
      mistaken notion that there is a ``correct'' amount of
      pain.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> The error results from
      the assumption that there is (or should be) a uniform
      response to a given pathophysiologic condition or pain
      stimulus. Despite studies showing the individual nature of
      children's experience of pain,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,12</a></sup> many care givers continue to
      ignore the individual child and provide treatment based on
      their idea of the ``appropriate'' child.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Adults are often considered more reliable in
      reporting children's pain than are children. The concern that
      children may feign or exaggerate suffering to obtain some
      secondary gain may cause adults to discount children's
      reports of pain.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Furthermore,
      because pain is sometimes difficult to treat, care givers may
      diminish the seriousness of children's suffering and
      alleviate their own frustration by blaming children for
      protesting too much.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Many myths about pain in children have been
      discredited. One myth was the belief that very young infants
      do not have the neurologic capacity to experience pain.
      Neuroanatomical studies, however, have shown that by 29 weeks
      of gestation, pain pathways and the cortical and subcortical
      centers involved in the perception of pain are well
      developed, as are the neurologic systems for the transmission
      and modulation of painful sensations <sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup>. Behavioral<sup><a
      href="#n16">16,17</a></sup> and physiologic<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> studies have shown that even very
      young infants respond to painful stimuli. Premature infants
      undergoing surgery with minimal anesthesia, which was once
      standard practice, have significantly higher stress responses
      (by hormonal and metabolic measures) and significantly higher
      rates of complications and mortality than those given deeper
      anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n19">19,20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A related misunderstanding is the belief
      that even if very young children experience pain, they have
      no memory of it, and therefore it has no lasting effect.
      However, recent studies have concluded that pain and
      distress, such as those associated with circumcision, can
      endure in memory, resulting, for example, in disturbances of
      feeding, sleeping, and the stability of the state of
      arousal.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Preliminary data
      even suggest that early experiences of pain may produce
      permanent structural and functional reorganization of
      developing nociceptive neural pathways, which in turn may
      affect future experiences of pain.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Another belief that has been dispelled is
      that children's pain cannot be measured accurately. Pain in
      children can be assessed through physiologic indicators,
      systematic observation of behavior, and reports by the
      children themselves.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> The key
      psychometric properties are reliability, validity, clinical
      sensitivity, and utility, and the consensus is that from the
      age of about five years, children are very reliable reporters
      of their own experience of pain. If there are discrepancies
      between a child's report of pain and the observation of a
      parent or physician, it is best to defer to the child's
      perspective.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Even very young children feel pain and can
      communicate that response in a number of ways. The care
      giver's job is to use the available strategies to observe the
      child sensitively, assess his or her condition objectively,
      and treat it effectively. Denial of relief from pain that is
      proportionate to the expressed need for such relief must be
      judged an unjustified harm, unless such deprivation serves a
      substantially greater good.</p>

      <h4>The Comparative Justification</h4>

      <p class="text2">Even if we accept children's self-reported
      pain as reality, we still have to weigh the benefits and
      risks of unrelieved pain against those of pain relief. A
      responsible conclusion may be that the harm of unrelieved
      pain is less severe than the harm of pain relief. In arriving
      at such a conclusion, one must consider the physiologic state
      of the child, the disease causing the discomfort, and the
      analgesics themselves, as well as how an analgesic will be
      administered and its potential side effects and long-term
      consequences. Once again, recent data indicate that many
      concerns about analgesia may no longer be valid.</p>

      <p class="text2">The traditional management of
      moderate-to-severe acute pain in children has involved the
      parenteral administration of opioids, often intramuscularly.
      Particularly among young children, fear of the needle often
      causes substantial anxiety and distress, sometimes resulting
      in the decision to withhold potent analgesics. Recent
      technological advances and a better understanding of the
      pharmacokinetics of opioids offer some help.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> Opioids should be administered
      orally. If this is not indicated, essentially painless
      intravenous access can be obtained through the use of local
      anesthetic cream. Potent opioids can then be administered by
      means of a bolus dose or continuous infusion.
      Patient-controlled analgesia has been used successfully in
      children as young as six years, with a high degree of
      satisfaction reported by the children and their
      parents.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> Transmucosal,
      transdermal, and epidural routes of administration can also
      be used.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> These innovations
      have eliminated the need for repeated injections, thus
      considerably reducing the child's distress.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another concern is the possibility of side
      effects of analgesic medications, particularly respiratory
      depression or arrest associated with opioids<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup>. Although the potential for these
      difficulties is not disputed, in deciding whether the risk
      outweighs the potential benefit to the patient, one must
      consider several relevant facts. The risk of narcotic-induced
      respiratory depression in adults is about 0.09
      percent,<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> whereas in children
      it ranges between 0 percent<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup>
      and 1.3 percent.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> In the study
      by Dilworth and MacKellar,<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> a
      dose reduction corrected the problem in all but one case.
      There are no data to support the notion that children are
      more susceptible to respiratory depression than are
      adults<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>. A better
      understanding of opioid pharmacokinetics allows more accurate
      predictions of the peak time of respiratory depression in
      children receiving opioids by various routes (although there
      may be substantial individual variation).<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> Especially with a continuous
      infusion, respiratory slowing occurs long before notable
      respiratory depression or arrest.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> Thus, with adequate monitoring and
      adherence to appropriate guidelines for dosages, respiratory
      depression should be a rare event in children. In addition,
      because agents are available to reverse the effects of
      opioids, the condition can be treated if it occurs.<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Respiratory depression and arrest
      nevertheless remain of concern. Inevitably, some deaths are
      associated with the administration of opioids, despite
      optimal monitoring. In medicine and in our daily lives, we
      make decisions knowing that despite every precaution, there
      remains some level of risk. In this instance, parents (and
      patients) should be informed of the potential risk, however
      small, associated with opioid administration, as well as the
      possible advantages of adequately controlled pain over
      uncontrolled pain (earlier mobilization, deeper breathing,
      less potential for atelectasis, and less suffering).</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, concern about addiction causes
      substantial apprehension about the administration of
      analgesics. Survey data indicate that 39 percent of
      physicians are concerned about the risk of addiction
      resulting from the use of narcotic analgesics in young
      patients,<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> and this concern
      may be reinforced by parents' objections to giving narcotics
      to their children.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> It is
      essential to distinguish between physical dependence (a
      physiologically determined state in which symptoms of
      withdrawal would occur if the medication were not
      administered) and addiction (a psychological obsession with
      the drug). Addiction to narcotics is rare among adults
      treated for disease-related pain and appears to depend more
      on psychosocial factors than on the disease or medically
      prescribed administration of narcotics.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> Studies of children treated for pain
      associated with sickle cell disease<sup><a
      href="#n38">38,39</a></sup> or postoperative recovery<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup> have found virtually no risk of
      addiction associated with the administration of narcotics.
      There are no known physiologic or psychological
      characteristics of children that make them more vulnerable to
      addiction than adults.</p>

      <p class="text2">An overestimation of the risk of
      analgesic-induced addiction leads to an underestimation of
      the harm of untreated pain. When analgesics are administered
      properly, the risk of addiction is minimal. As Angell
      declared, ``I can't think of any other area in medicine in
      which such an extravagant concern for side effects so
      drastically limits treatment. We are used to a closer balance
      between risks and benefits''.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>
      In summary, any comparative justification for withholding
      pain relief must be rigorously judged on the basis of the
      comparative risks and benefits and empirical data, not
      speculation or undocumented lore.</p>

      <h4>The Pragmatic Justification</h4>

      <p class="text2">The comparative justification recognizes
      that pain is bad but concludes that it is not as bad as the
      risks associated with the relief of pain. The pragmatic
      justification acknowledges that unrelieved pain is bad but
      asserts that such pain may be necessary to achieve a greater
      goal. Pain may be seen as useful to monitor an illness. For
      example, the patient's response to palpation of the abdomen
      may be an important aid in diagnosis. Pain may also indicate
      the ineffectiveness or limits of treatment, such as
      discomfort during rehabilitation after orthopedic surgery.
      Masking such pain could obscure physical signs and actually
      harm the patient. One must therefore weigh the benefit of
      immediate relief against that of long-term recovery.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another goal, character development, is
      based on a moral view that champions traits such as courage,
      self-discipline, independence, and self-sacrifice. Although
      in principle encouraging such virtues may be ethically
      defensible, imposing the burden of character development on a
      child already encumbered by sickness and suffering reflects a
      lack of compassion and is ethically questionable, at best.
      When the total eradication of pain is not possible (as in the
      case of chronic pain associated with chronic illness),
      strengthening the child's capacity to cope with the pain is
      beneficial and may be justifiable. However, to withhold
      analgesics from a suffering child in the hope of influencing
      character development ignores the child's real, present need
      for relief from pain.</p>

      <p class="text2">The ethical responsibility of clinicians is
      to provide full treatment of pain in children unless
      otherwise justified by defined therapeutic benefits. Three
      specific tests should be applied. First, is the pain useful?
      Is it the means to achieving an important goal? Second, is
      the pain necessary? Are there other, less hurtful means of
      achieving that goal? Third, is the pain at the lowest
      possible level? If there is a therapeutic benefit from a
      child's pain, one must be exquisitely economical with it.</p>

      <h4>Conclusions</h4>

      <p class="text2">There are now published guidelines for the
      management of pain in children, which are based on recent
      data.<sup><a href="#n41">41-44</a></sup> However, guidelines
      and continuing medical education do not necessarily alter
      physicians' behavior.<sup><a href="#n45">45,46</a></sup>
      Specific administrative interventions are required. For
      example, hospitals may include standards for the assessment
      and management of pain as part of their quality-assurance
      programs.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> The Joint
      Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has
      established standards for pain management.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> To meet such standards,
      multidisciplinary teams must develop specific treatment
      protocols with the goal of reducing children's pain and
      distress. In addition, pressure from parents and the legal
      community is likely to affect clinical practice.</p>

      <p class="text2">All health professionals should provide care
      that reflects the technological growth of the field. <span
      class="yellow">The assessment and treatment of pain in
      children are important parts of pediatric practice, and
      failure to provide adequate control of pain amounts to
      substandard and unethical medical practice.</span></p>
