          <p>Bioethics committees have issued guidelines that
          medical interventions should be permissible only in cases
          of clinically verifiable disease, deformity, or injury.
          Furthermore, once the existence of one or more of these
          requirements has been proven, the proposed therapeutic
          procedure must reasonably be expected to result in a net
          benefit to the patient. As an exception to this rule,
          some prophylactic interventions might be performed on
          individuals "in their best interests" or with the aim of
          averting an urgent and potentially calamitous public
          health danger. In order to invoke these exceptions, a
          stringent set of criteria must first be satisfied.
          Additionally, where the proposed prophylactic
          intervention is intended for children, who are unlikely
          to be able to provide a meaningfully informed consent, a
          heightened scrutiny of any such measures is required. We
          argue that children should not be subjected to
          prophylactic interventions "in their best interests" or
          for public health reasons when there exist effective and
          conservative alternative interventions, such as
          behavioural modification, that individuals could employ
          as competent adolescents or adults to avoid adverse
          health outcomes. Applying these criteria, we consider the
          specific examples of prophylactic mastectomy,
          immunisations, cosmetic ear surgery, and
          circumcision.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p><span class="c3"><b>T</b></span>he use of prophylactic
      interventions in children has traditionally been justified on
      two grounds:<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Best interest of the
      child.</i> The benefits of the intervention to the child
      outweigh the harms to the child posed by the procedure.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Public health.</i>
      The benefits of the intervention accrue primarily to the
      general society rather than to the individual, who is left
      with the burden of the harms generated by the
      intervention.</p>

      <p class="2">Some interventions are justified on both
      grounds, but, in every case, prophylactic medical
      interventions raise some difficult questions, pitting an
      individual's right to freedom from interference either
      against public health considerations or against often
      arbitrary assessments of his or her best interest. A number
      of interrelated criteria have evolved in response to the need
      to determine when prophylactic interventions will be
      permissible. We propose a formulation of these requirements,
      which we believe facilitates an analysis of all relevant
      factors and clarifies their interrelationship. These criteria
      are then applied to four illustrative examples taken from
      current practice: prophylactic mastectomy, immunisations,
      cosmetic ear surgery, and circumcision.</p>

      <p class="2">Children are uniquely vulnerable due to
      inability to provide informed consent.</p>

      <p class="2">The issue of informed consent relative to the
      care of children has recently generated much discussion among
      ethicists.<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> Children, and
      especially infants, are uniquely vulnerable in terms of
      prophylactic procedures because they are legally incompetent
      to give fully informed consent for medical procedures, are
      frequently unable to understand the implications of a
      proposed treatment, are more susceptible to coercion, and are
      often powerless to refuse treatment. Previously, doctors and
      parents were assumed to have the right to make all health
      care decisions for children. As society increasingly
      recognises that children have rights to autonomy and deserve
      special legal protections,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> the
      institutionalised medical routines and assumptions involving
      children have been called into question. For instance,
      according to current guidelines,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> proxy consent-that is, informed
      permission, of the parents of infants and young children is
      valid only in the presence of immediate, life-threatening,
      clinically verifiable disease, deformity, or injury.</p>

      <p class="2">Conditions under which prophylactic medical
      interventions in "the best interest" of the child are
      permissible: we propose that medical interventions performed
      "in the best interest" of the child are permissible only
      provided that:</p>

      <p>1. <!--1.-->Clinically verifiable disease, deformity, or
      injury are present or are highly likely to be present in the
      future.</p>

      <p>2. <!--2.-->The proposed intervention must be the least
      invasive and most conservative treatment option.</p>

      <p>3. <!--3.-->Despite any harm that may be foreseen, there
      must be a reasonable expectation that the procedure will
      result in a net benefit to the patient while having at most a
      minimal negative impact on the patient's health.</p>

      <p>4. <!--4.-->The patient is competent to consent to the
      procedure and provides fully informed consent. Where a
      patient cannot provide informed consent, the procedure must
      be required by medical urgency, thereby excusing a lack of
      consent. Since reasonable and competent adults would normally
      refuse to give consent to medically unnecessary interventions
      (especially those that alter normal appearance and/or
      function), it must be assumed that children would also refuse
      if they had the capacity to understand their situation,
      formulate their wishes, and express them.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6-8</a></sup></p>

      <p>5. <!--5.-->The intervention is part of standard practice,
      and its imposition is sanctioned by society for valid,
      urgent, and potentially calamitous health reasons that
      justify failure to obtain individual consent.</p>

      <p>6. <!--6.-->There is also a reasonable expectation that
      without the intervention the individual will be at high risk
      of developing the disease. A high risk for an untreated
      individual is not defined as a higher risk than a treated
      individual but an absolute vulnerability to disease-that is,
      an individual's chance of ever being diagnosed with the
      disease is close to 1 in 1. To put this in perspective, an
      American woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer
      is 1 in 8 (12.6%), yet this figure is not said to justify
      prophylactic intervention-that is, routine neonatal
      mastectomy.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>PROPHYLACTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR
      PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT</b></span><br />
       Prophylactic medical interventions are frequently performed
      on healthy individuals who have given informed consent.
      Provided certain stringent requirements are satisfied, they
      may also be performed without consent on incompetent minors.
      Under this exception to the usual consent requirement,
      procedures that fail to satisfy both the informed consent and
      the medical emergency requirements may nevertheless be
      permissible because of a countervailing, urgent, and
      significant benefit to the public health, or if they are in
      the interest of the child.</p>

      <p class="2">The most common example arises when the patient
      is at significant risk of contracting a life- and public
      health-threatening illness for which the proposed prophylaxis
      is a proven preventive. In order to safeguard individual
      liberties, the situations in which such procedures may be
      undertaken for public health benefit must meet the following
      requirements:</p>

      <p>1. <!--1.-->The danger to public health must be
      substantial.</p>

      <p>2. <!--2.-->The condition must have serious consequences
      if transmitted.</p>

      <p>3. <!--3.-->The effectiveness of the intervention in
      safeguarding the majority of the public against the
      particular malady must be well established.</p>

      <p>4. <!--4.-->The intervention must be the most appropriate,
      least invasive, and most conservative means of achieving the
      desired public health objective.</p>

      <p>5. <!--5.-->The individual must be provided with
      appreciable benefit not dependent on speculation about
      hypothetical future behaviours of the patient.</p>

      <p>6. <!--6.-->The burden to the individual's human rights
      and health must be balanced against and found to be
      substantially outweighed by the benefit to society in helping
      prevent a highly contagious disease or other potentially
      calamitous condition from affecting the public health.</p>

      <p class="2">These requirements are a necessary but not a
      sufficient basis for intervening. Due to a general
      presumption in favour of protection of individual freedoms,
      there are situations in which interventions satisfying these
      criteria will not be implemented.</p>

      <p><span class="head2"><b>Specific
      applications</b></span><br />
       In order to illustrate the analysis of prophylactic
      interventions on children, we present four examples of the
      application of these principles to analyses of particular
      fact situations. These examples have been chosen because they
      are controversial and problematic.</p>

      <p><span class="head2">Application 1: Prophylactic mastectomy
      in `high-risk' females</span><br />
       While highly controversial,<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      this category of prophylactic intervention falls under the
      rubric of procedures justified by an appeal to the "best
      interest of the individual". As far as we know, prophylactic
      neonatal removal of the breast buds has not yet been carried
      out on young girls, but as the trend in research today is
      towards developing genetic screening for "breast cancer
      genes",<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> this situation may
      only be temporarily hypothetical. Also, the strong advocacy
      of prophylactic mastectomy being voiced by some doctors may
      put some women and genetically targeted families at high risk
      of coercion and undue influence.<sup><a
      href="#n">11</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>1. Presence of clinically
      verifiable disease, deformity, or injury</i></span><br />
       Clearly, a procedure can only be considered prophylactic in
      the absence of disease, deformity, injury, or medical
      urgency. Thus, prophylactic interventions of this nature fail
      to meet the primary requirement for medical interference.
      Even if a young girl were born into a family with a history
      of breast cancer, or if genetic testing were to reveal that
      she carried the "breast cancer gene" no prophylactic
      intervention would be permissible until the individual
      reached the age of majority and could decide for herself,
      unless, of course, the patient could be shown to be at high
      risk of developing a rare cancer of the breast while still a
      child. Nevertheless, it is a modern fallacy that complex
      human diseases such as cancer can be caused by a single gene
      and that environmental and behavioural factors play no role
      in either the production or the prevention of diseases. A
      genetic predisposition to any particular disease is not the
      same thing as being at high risk of developing that disease.
      All children deserve special protections against supposedly
      prophylactic procedures imposed as a result of assessments of
      genetic predisposition.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>2. Least invasive and most
      conservative treatment option</i></span><br />
       Mastectomy is severely invasive. If, however, an effective
      and safe form of immunisation were invented to prevent breast
      cancer, its routine use in infant females might be justified
      on the grounds that breast cancer is common and affects women
      indiscriminately. If behavioural factors were eventually
      established in the aetiology of breast cancer, such as
      avoiding postmenopausal obesity and regular physical
      activity,<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> routine neonatal
      immunisation would lose its validity.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>3. Net benefit to the patient and
      minimal negative impact on the patient's
      health</i></span><br />
       A woman genetically at high risk for developing breast or
      ovarian cancer can expect an extra 2.9 to 5.3 years of life
      following removal of her breast and ovaries.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Given the evident, albeit marginal
      benefit to the patient, the operation is permissible after
      fully informed consent is obtained. Potential patients must
      be provided with the crucial information that such a gain
      comes at the expense of major surgery, with its side effects,
      mutilation, and risks. For most women, however, a lifetime of
      disfigurement is too high a price to pay for a <i>chance</i>
      of having a few extra years of life.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>4. Competence to consent to the
      procedure</i></span><br />
       After providing fully informed consent, an adult female at
      high risk of breast cancer may agree to prophylactic
      mastectomy. The prophylactic removal of the breasts from a
      minor female, however, would be impermissible because a minor
      cannot provide informed consent. Proxy consent would be
      invalid because the breasts of the minor are healthy and no
      medical emergency justifies the procedure.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>5. Standard
      practice</i></span><br />
       Prophylactic mastectomy fails to qualify as a standard
      practice because it is highly controversial. Furthermore, its
      prophylactic use has not been sanctioned by society.
      Mastectomy is usually only employed as an extreme form of
      treatment for established cases of breast cancer.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>6. Individual at high risk of
      developing the disease</i></span><br />
       A high risk for an untreated individual is not defined as a
      <i>higher</i> risk than a treated individual but an absolute
      vulnerability to disease. An individual's chance of ever
      being diagnosed with the disease must be close to 1 in 1. To
      put this in perspective, an American woman's chance of being
      diagnosed with breast cancer is 1 in 8 (12.6%), yet this
      figure does not justify prophylactic intervention-that is,
      routine neonatal mastectomy. There must also be a net benefit
      to the patient or to public health, and, at most, a minimal
      negative impact.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>Assessment</i></span><br />
       Prophylactic mastectomy is problematic and has a number of
      grey areas. The best one can say is that it may be acceptable
      for competent adults who have given informed consent, free of
      any force, coercion, manipulation, or undue influence from
      any source. Prophylactic mastectomy cannot be sanctioned on
      infants or children who have not yet attained legal
      competence or the age of majority.</p>

      <p><span class="head2">Application 2: Routine
      immunisation</span><br />
       As a prophylactic intervention performed in the interest of
      public health rather than in the "best interest" of the
      individual, routine immunisation may be urged by society
      under the belief that it prevents the transmission of
      contagious diseases. While somewhat controversial, the
      practice is none the less widely believed to be a legitimate
      prophylactic medical procedure.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>1. The danger to public health must
      be substantial</i></span><br />
       Any programme of prophylactic immunisation must address a
      substantial public health danger. Practically speaking, this
      criterion will generally be satisfied only in the case of
      diseases that are highly contagious, are spread through the
      air or through casual, impersonal, non-sexual contact, and
      have high morbidity and mortality.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>2. The condition must have serious
      consequences if transmitted.</i></span><br />
       This requirement is only satisfied in the cases of diseases
      that have a high rate of morbidity or mortality. There are,
      however, grey areas. Although administration of the varicella
      vaccine to minors has been recommended by professional
      societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics
      (AAP),<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> one could question its
      advisability in light of the low morbidity and mortality of
      chickenpox and the unknown long term efficacy of the vaccine.
      The low acceptance rate of the varicella vaccine by both
      physicians and parents may reflect the impression that the
      minimal individual health benefits do not justify the trauma,
      immune system interference, and costs associated with an
      additional injection.</p>

      <p class="2">Also, in a majority of Western European
      countries, children are now routinely immunised against
      hepatitis B, a disease that is spread through sexual contact
      and intravenous (IV) drug use.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Hepatitis B is the most important
      infectious occupational disease for health care
      workers,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> yet the high risk of
      being infected is proportional to the prevalence of virus
      carriers in the assisted population. Rather than immunise
      everyone in a population where hepatitis B is rare and
      concentrated in the small population of IV drug users and
      those who engage in unsafe sex, health and human rights can
      be better protected through focused intervention, that is, by
      offering immunisation to all health care workers in high-risk
      areas and by offering or even compelling immunisation to
      high-risk populations, such as IV drug users, prostitutes,
      and immigrants or refugees from areas where hepatitis B is
      either endemic or epidemic.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      Forcing immunisation on the majority of a population that is
      not at risk of acquiring or transmitting such sexually
      transmitted diseases (STDs) constitutes a human rights
      burden.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>3. Effectiveness of the
      intervention</i></span><br />
       The effectiveness of many vaccinations in safeguarding the
      majority of the public against the diseases in question is
      well established. The vaccine against smallpox, for instance,
      was responsible for eradicating this disease from human
      populations on a global scale.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>4. Invasiveness of the
      intervention</i></span><br />
       At present, immunisation is the least invasive and most
      conservative means of preventing the contraction and
      transmission of those highly contagious diseases for which
      children are routinely vaccinated. There are, however,
      recognised and much debated complications following measles
      immunisation, especially the combined mumps, measles, rubella
      (MMR) vaccine, which, although unusual, can be very
      serious.<sup><a href="#n18">18,19</a></sup> Still,
      immunisation does not normally result in the loss,
      diminishment, alteration, or change in the appearance of any
      body part. Improvements in delivery and design of
      immunisation, however, is to be encouraged to reduce the
      risks.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>5. Appreciable benefit and
      speculation about hypothetical future
      behaviours</i></span><br />
       Virtual immunity to the diseases for which children are
      vaccinated is an appreciable benefit. Still, this analysis
      will clearly bar involuntary neonatal prophylactic procedures
      calculated to prevent STDs, which are normally contracted
      only by adults as a result of lifestyle choices, because it
      is unethical to base decisions on a speculation about a
      child's future lifestyle choices. For example, an
      immunisation against HIV for an adult who chooses to engage
      in high-risk sexual behaviour might permissibly be compelled,
      under certain circumstances. Yet, it would be impermissible
      to immunise forcibly an adult who is without a history of
      high-risk sexual behaviour based on a speculation that the
      adult might enter into such activities in the future. If,
      however, a very effective and safe HIV vaccine were
      developed, compulsory neonatal immunisation might be argued
      to prevent accidental exposures during childhood from
      needlestick injuries or from transfusion with HIV-infected
      blood. These situations, however, are rare and preventable.
      Improving standards of hygiene, waste disposal, and
      maintaining an HIV-free blood bank are all achievable goals,
      and, indeed, such standards are supposed to be maintained in
      all hospitals.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>6. Benefit to society must outweigh
      the individual's human rights burden</i></span><br />
       There is a definite human rights burden posed by compulsory
      vaccination. The targeted individual's autonomy and right of
      refusal have been violated. Still, as vaccination does not
      alter the structure, appearance, or function of any body
      part, its human rights burden is minimal.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>Assessment</i></span><br />
       Immunisation satisfies most of the requirements for
      intervention, but the infliction of risk on a minor is
      unacceptable when the disease in question can be reasonably
      avoided through behavioural choices. Educational programmes
      designed to assist adults to make choices that preserve them
      from contracting avoidable diseases are the most ethical
      means available for reducing the incidence of those diseases
      while simultaneously respecting human rights.</p>

      <p><span class="head2">Application 3: Cosmetic ear
      surgery</span><br />
       Cosmetic surgery may be defined as surgery performed in
      compliance with personal motivations of the patient that are
      not based on any objective medical need. As there is no
      public health benefit to cosmetic surgery, this intervention
      falls into the category of procedures that are said to be in
      the "best interest" of the individual, although such a
      justification for intervention is difficult to prove in many
      cases.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>1. Presence of clinically
      verifiable disease, deformity, or injury</i></span><br />
       A cosmetic procedure is permissible on an incompetent child
      only where intended for the correction of clinically
      verifiable disease, deformity, or injury, such as hare-lip,
      clubfoot, or any unequivocal congenital or trauma-related
      defect. For this reason, cosmetic surgery to "correct" the
      facial features of Down's syndrome, which involves
      substantial surgery and no proven benefit, has drawn sharp
      criticism.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">As in many ethical debates, however, there are a
      number of "grey areas" where absolute pronouncements are
      difficult to make. For instance, parents may seek surgery on
      behalf of their children for "bat ears". Surgery of this type
      is often claimed as being "in the best interest of the child"
      because, allegedly, a child with protruding ears will be
      prone to teasing in school. This argument, however, is
      specious and represents a projection onto the child of
      parental anxieties over conformity. Teasing is not a medical
      problem. Likewise, such surgery has no medical value, and, if
      performed, necessarily violates the human rights of the
      child.</p>

      <p class="2">It must be acknowledged that ears naturally come
      in a variety of shapes and sizes. They also stick out at a
      wide variety of angles. Furthermore, it cannot be predicted
      how a child will feel about his own ears. He may prefer ears
      that stick out. Similarly, there is no guarantee that a child
      with such ears will be teased and, in the event he is, that
      he will care. A child who suffers from the compulsion to
      tease will always find something to tease another child
      about. In any event, teasing is more appropriately handled by
      discipline and psychological counselling for the teaser
      rather than by ill-conceived attempts at pre-emptive surgery
      for the potential victim of teasing.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>2. Least invasive and most
      conservative treatment option.</i></span><br />
       It is in the patient's best interest to be spared radical
      cosmetic surgical procedure when a more conservative surgical
      technique would accomplish the same goals. In the case of bat
      ears, the most conservative treatment option is to do nothing
      because the surgery can always be performed later, should a
      child with bat ears express a desire to undergo it and as
      long as he is made aware of the surgical risks involved.</p>

      <p class="2">Nevertheless, little can be said against parents
      taking matters into their own hands and handling the issue
      non-surgically by taping the infant's ears back to the scalp
      to encourage them to grow in a way that conforms to societal
      standards. This measure is effective, avoids the imposition
      of surgical risk on an unconsenting minor, does not violate
      bodily integrity, and respects human rights. Likewise, the
      alteration of the body resulting from this non-surgical
      intervention is minimal because the result is consistent with
      natural appearance and configuration of the ears of a
      significant number of people.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>3. Net benefit to the patient and
      minimal negative impact on the patient's
      health</i></span><br />
       All surgery entails risks, drawbacks, and mutilation to
      various degrees. The replacement of bat ears by a scar may
      not be acceptable to many competent adults. Since it is
      difficult to predict how a child might feel, when he grows
      up, about having had a scar imposed on him in exchange for
      such a minor cosmetic gain, any decisions that can be delayed
      without endangering the health of the child should be delayed
      until the child can make a decision for himself upon
      attaining the legal age of consent or the age of
      majority.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>4. Competence to consent to the
      procedure</i></span><br />
       Cosmetic surgery may be validly performed on adults who have
      freely given informed consent when the surgery may be
      reasonably expected to result in a net benefit to the
      patient, even though that benefit may be largely subjective.
      Parental permission on behalf of a minor or even an
      incompetent minor's own assent is clearly invalid in cases of
      non-therapeutic cosmetic surgery.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>5. Standard
      practice</i></span><br />
       There are a variety of surgical techniques for changing the
      angle at which ears protrude from the head. One technique may
      be best suited to a particular conformation of the ear.
      Clearly, it is in the patient's best interest to undergo the
      surgery that best corrects his particular condition and best
      achieves his cosmetic goals. For this reason, it is
      particularly important that an incompetent child's autonomy
      be respected until which time he can express an opinion on
      how he wants his ears to look following the surgery.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>6. Individual at high risk of
      developing the disease</i></span><br />
       This is a potential grey area. Bat ears do not place the
      individual at risk of contracting any disease, but some
      congenital malformations that cosmetic surgery can correct do
      cause health problems.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>Assessment</i></span><br />
       In conclusion, cosmetic surgery is a grey area that requires
      specific application of the above criteria for individual
      cases. In all situations, however, heightened scrutiny must
      be placed on any decisions involving incompetent minors in
      order to protect them from needless interference stemming
      from the projected anxieties of parents. Any non-therapeutic
      cosmetic procedure must be delayed until the child can be
      involved in the decision making process. Issues of
      body-image, conformity, and self confidence are deeply
      personal and individualistic. Children are also especially
      susceptible to force, coercion, manipulation or undue
      influence. For this reason, children deserve special
      protections against anyone else, especially parents,
      projecting onto them anxieties and aesthetic preferences
      which the child may not necessarily share. Consequently,
      surgery to "correct" protruding ears should only be
      contemplated if the child has explicitly and freely expressed
      a desire for it.</p>

      <p><span class="head2a">Application 4: Neonatal
      circumcision</span><br />
       Another example of an allegedly prophylactic medical
      procedure is routine neonatal male circumcision. Despite the
      obvious ethical problems they pose, the ritual circumcision
      practices of Muslims, Jews, and various indigenous African
      tribes are not under consideration here, as these rituals
      neither have medical objectives nor usually take place within
      the provenance of the health care system. Where medical
      involvement does take place in these rites, or where medical
      justifications are proffered as an additional defence for
      religious blood rites, the following discussion must
      necessarily apply.</p>

      <p class="2">Despite its ubiquity in the US, routine neonatal
      circumcision is a highly controversial procedure that has
      drawn sharp criticism from ethicists and medicolegal
      experts.<sup><a href="#n21">21-28</a></sup> Advocates of
      neonatal circumcision have claimed that the amputation of the
      healthy foreskin from male neonates is a legitimate
      prophylactic procedure that is akin to immunisation and is
      performed on public health grounds.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> It is similarly claimed that
      circumcision is in the best interest of the individual
      affected. As a procedure whose supporting rhetoric bridges
      both categories of prophylactic intervention, it deserves
      special analysis. It also deserves special consideration
      because of its ubiquity in the US and because of the
      unbelievably long list of diseases it has traditionally been
      claimed to prevent.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>Prophylactic circumcision: The
      `best interest' of the individual argument</i></span><br />
       Since its introduction as a medical procedure in the 19th
      century, the orthodox medical profession has most frequently
      employed male circumcision as a cure and preventive for such
      "diseases" as masturbation, epilepsy, insanity, hip-joint
      disease, enuresis, involuntary nocturnal seminal emissions,
      phimosis, redundant prepuce, prolapse of the rectum,
      tuberculosis, feeble-mindedness, strabismus, convulsions,
      prostate cancer, and night terrors, to name just a
      few.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> On these and similarly
      questionable grounds, it was introduced as a routine and
      quasi-compulsory procedure during the Cold War era. The
      allegedly medical rationale for mass circumcision are
      continuously shifting, and, as a reflection of this, the 1999
      American Academy of Pediatrics policy report on circumcision
      lists urinary tract infection (UTI), penile cancer, and
      phimosis as being among the diseases for which circumcision
      is supposed to be preventive.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup>
      Advocates of mass circumcision claim that the supposed
      decrease in the rate of these diseases among circumcised
      males renders circumcision as being in the best interest in
      the individual, irrespective of all other medical and ethical
      considerations.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>1. Presence of clinically
      verifiable disease, deformity, or injury</i></span><br />
       Routine circumcision is, by definition, performed on a
      healthy organ in the absence of disease, deformity or injury.
      It is not in the best interest of the individual to undergo
      surgery for a disease he does not have and is not likely to
      develop. Therefore, routine circumcision fails to meet the
      primary requirement for intervention.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>2. Least invasive and most
      conservative treatment option</i></span><br />
       Circumcision is attended by risks, disadvantages, dangers,
      and drawbacks. Although the complication rate from routine
      circumcision is low,<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> the
      potential for these complications to be catastrophic,
      mutilatory, infective or haemorrhagic is very high.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> The tragedy of death, gangrene, or
      total and partial amputation of the penis are some of the
      possible complications of routine circumcision that cannot be
      justified on any grounds, either in terms of public health
      gains or the best interest of the child.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>3. Net benefit to the patient and
      minimal negative impact on the patient's
      health</i></span><br />
       Cost-utility analyses have determined that neonatal
      circumcision results in an overall negative impact on
      health.<sup><a href="#n34">34,35</a></sup> Also, circumcision
      advocacy has traditionally been based on ambiguous and
      unimpressive data, opinions, and the exclusion of contrary
      evidence. It ignores the large literature demonstrating the
      unique anatomical and physiological benefits offered by the
      prepuce and intact penis. For instance, anatomical
      investigations have confirmed the rich erogenous innervation
      and concomitant sexological functions of the prepuce.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36-38</a></sup> Thus, because of the loss of a
      protective, sensory, and functional structure, the impact on
      the individual's health and human rights is significantly
      negative.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>4. Competence to consent to the
      procedure</i></span><br />
       An infant is unable to provide informed consent. Proxy
      consent is invalid because of the lack of medical necessity.
      Also, the US Department of Health has stated that a competent
      "patient has a fundamental right to grant or withhold consent
      prior to examination or treatment" and "refusal must be
      respected".<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> As an infant's
      state of incompetence is temporary, it is unethical to take
      advantage of his inability to refuse and to submit him to a
      medically unnecessary surgery that a competent adult might
      refuse.</p>

      <p class="2">Parental anxieties that a genitally intact son
      may be teased by his peers in school are illegitimate grounds
      for overriding the individual's right to autonomy. Parents
      are usually projecting onto their children their own
      remembered traumas suffered as a result of obsolete
      institutionalised humiliations, such as compulsory communal
      showering in school-a practice that has largely been
      abandoned, even though parents may be unaware of this change.
      Parents have responsibilities towards, not rights over, their
      children.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Thus, in the absence
      of urgent medical necessity, they have no right to arrange
      the amputation of a healthy part of their child's body. As
      the one who must live with the consequences of the surgery,
      the child must be accorded the dignity of a choice over the
      appearance and function of such an intimate part of his body.
      Also, since there is no guarantee that an individual would be
      glad that his foreskin had been amputated during infancy or
      childhood, the ethical default position must be to protect
      him from circumcision until he reaches adulthood, when he can
      make an informed and uncoerced decision for himself. A
      genitally intact adult can always elect to be circumcised: a
      circumcised individual, however, has had his autonomy and
      sovereignty violated in this respect and has been left
      without any options.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>5. Standard
      practice</i></span><br />
       Routine neonatal circumcision may be common practice in the
      US, but it is not a standard practice, as it is highly
      controversial, and has been rejected by the health care
      systems of all other Western countries. It is not a standard
      of practice to subject healthy patients to surgeries for
      diseases they do not have or cannot be reasonably expected to
      contract. The standard of optimal health goals must be
      derived from the natural and intact human body and not from a
      body that has been artificially reconfigured, surgically
      diminished, or structurally altered in any way.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>6. Individual at high risk of
      developing the disease</i></span><br />
       Failure to obtain individual consent cannot be warranted
      because an individual who has been protected from
      circumcision is at extremely low risk of developing the
      diseases in question. Even according to the controversial
      studies used to rationalise neonatal circumcision as a means
      of reducing the incidence of UTI, the rate of UTI for intact
      infants is only 0.154% as opposed to 0.034% for circumcised
      infants.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> Although the
      difference in rates is only 0.12 percentage points, it has
      been made to appear significant by being stated in terms of a
      3.7% increase. Objective studies, however, have established
      causative links between UTI and poor perineal hygiene,<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup> lack of breast feeding,<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> forced retraction of the immature
      foreskin,<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> and use of soap in
      the preputial pouch.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> Thus,
      UTI can be more conservatively prevented by improvements in
      parenting skills. The standard of care is to treat UTI with
      readily available antibiotics. Allegedly prophylactic surgery
      cannot be justified.</p>

      <p class="2">Phimosis, defined as a juvenile prepuce that is
      not yet developmentally ready to retract, is not a disease at
      all, and its effect on health has been greatly exaggerated,
      deriving from 19th century phobias about masturbation.<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> Genuine cases of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans (BXO) that cause non-retractability due to
      cicatricial preputial stenosis are exceedingly rare,
      affecting only 0.6% of boys by their 15th birthday.<sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup> Most importantly, these can be
      pharmacologically treated with a high rate of success.<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup> Circumcision, thus, is an
      inappropriate treatment for BXO/phimosis.</p>

      <p class="2">Penile cancer is one of the rarest male cancers
      and is strongly associated with lifestyle choices, such as
      smoking, poor hygiene, a history of STD infection, human
      papilloma virus, and multiple sex partners.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> Furthermore, the lifetime risk of a
      US male, who is likely to be circumcised, ever being
      diagnosed with penile cancer is 1 in 1,437,<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> yet the rate is even lower in
      Denmark (1 in 1,694),<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup> where
      neonatal circumcision is not practised. These risks are
      strikingly smaller than the 1 in 8 lifetime risk for breast
      cancer among US females. Thus, only an insignificant fraction
      of adult males are at risk of developing the diseases for
      which circumcision is either supposed to be preventive
      (penile cancer) or for which circumcision is wrongly
      considered to be the best means of treatment (BXO/phimosis).
      Finally, the proven behavioural factors involved in the
      aetiology of penile cancer indicate that this disease can be
      reasonably avoided by cultivating healthful behaviours, such
      as avoiding smoking, multiple sex partners, poor hygiene, and
      STD infections.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>Prophylactic circumcision as a
      public health measure</i></span><br />
       Here, we will only consider those infectious and contagious
      diseases associated with circumcision that concern public
      health, such as HIV and other STDs, listed by the AAP policy
      report.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>1. The danger to public health must
      be substantial</i></span><br />
       The danger to public health posed by the STDs for which
      circumcision is supposed to be useful is insubstantial.
      Because the sexual transmission of HIV and other STDs is
      usually dependent upon adult lifestyle choices, a programme
      of amputating a healthy part of the penis from an
      unconsenting minor as a means of reducing the incidence of
      STDs is unethical. In marked contrast, the contraction of the
      diseases for which children are routinely immunised, such as
      polio and measles, is independent of lifestyle choices and is
      determined by such accidental, unforeseeable, and casual
      situations as unknowingly breathing the same air as an
      infected person.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>2. The condition must have serious
      consequences if transmitted</i></span><br />
       With the current exception of HIV, the STDs whose incidence
      circumcision is supposed to reduce have few serious
      consequences if transmitted. Antibiotics are very effective
      at treating most STDs. Genital herpes, may be incurable, but
      its morbidity is negligible at best, and it is more common
      among circumcised than genitally intact US males.<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>3. Effectiveness of the
      intervention</i></span><br />
       The effectiveness of circumcision in safeguarding public
      health is either negligible or non-existent. The routine
      circumcision experiment, which has been conducted since the
      1950s in the US has failed to prevent the US from achieving
      the dubious distinction as the developed country with the
      highest rates of STDs<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> and
      HIV.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> The allegations of
      efficacy are based on poorly designed and poorly executed ad
      hoc studies performed by circumcision advocates whose bias
      and conflict of interest alone should disqualify such
      "studies" from serious consideration. Moreover, objective
      scientists have also cast serious doubts upon the genuineness
      of the surgery's alleged medical benefits.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54-58</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>4. Invasiveness of the
      intervention</i></span><br />
       Amputating part of the penis is the most invasive method of
      attempting to achieve the desired public health objective.
      Circumcision desensitises the penis and immobilises whatever
      shaft skin remains, thereby destroying the natural and normal
      means of erotic stimulation.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup>
      The stated public health objectives could be achieved by more
      conservative means, such as improved sex education, making
      condoms freely available, or regulating prostitution.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>5. Appreciable benefit and
      speculation about hypothetical future
      behaviours</i></span><br />
       The alleged benefits of circumcision are not appreciable to
      the individual because to reap the alleged benefits of the
      procedure, the individual would have to disregard safe sex
      warnings and deliberately engage in unsafe sexual practices
      with infected individuals. Even then, because the claimed
      benefit of circumcision under these circumstances is not
      statistically significant,<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>
      there is no meaningful way to calculate the alleged benefits
      from circumcision to an irresponsible individual. Most
      importantly, the public health rational for neonatal
      circumcision is rooted in the unjustifiable speculation that
      the child will grow up to be sexually irresponsible.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>6. Benefit to society must outweigh
      the individual's human rights burden</i></span><br />
       No substantial benefit to public health has been
      demonstrated for neonatal circumcision. Also, the human
      rights burden to the individual posed by circumcision is
      severe because it violates the human right to autonomy and
      bodily integrity, entails the loss of a normal part of the
      body, alters the appearance of the penis, and impairs sexual,
      protective, and immunological functions.</p>

      <p><span class="topic"><i>Assessment</i></span><br />
       <span class="yellow">Routine circumcision fails to satisfy
      the criteria necessary to justify it either as a public
      health measure or a procedure performed in the best interest
      of the individual. The human rights burden posed to the
      individual is severe and is not outweighed by any appreciable
      public health gain.</span></p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>CONCLUSION</b></span><br />
       Prophylactic procedures may be permitted where the danger to
      public health is substantial, the condition has critical
      consequences if transmitted, the proposed procedure's
      effectiveness is well established, the proposed procedure is
      an appropriate means of achieving the desired public health
      objective, some tangible and non-speculative health benefit
      is provided to the individual patient by the treatment, and
      the public health benefit outweighs the individual burden
      posed by the procedure. Allegedly prophylactic interventions
      therefore are impermissible if they are performed on minors
      without informed consent or when the human rights burden of
      the intervention clearly exceeds the risk to public health
      posed by an untreated individual. Furthermore, prophylactic
      interventions on children are unethical when contraction of
      the disease in question can be reasonably avoided through
      appropriate adult behavioural choices.</p>
