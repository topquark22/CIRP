          <p>Despite global and local attempts to end genital
          mutilation, in their various forms, whether of males or
          females, the practice has persisted throughout human
          history in most parts of the world. Various medical,
          scientific, hygienic, aesthetic, religious, and cultural
          reasons have been used to justify it. In this symposium
          on circumcision, against the background of the other
          articles by Hutson, Short, and Viens, the practice is set
          by the author within a wider, global context by
          discussing a range of rationalisations used to support
          different types of genital mutilation throughout time and
          across the globe. It is argued that in most cases the
          rationalisations invented to provide support for
          continuing the practice of genital
          mutilation&mdash;whether male or female&mdash;within
          various cultural and religious settings have very little
          to do with finding a critical and reflective moral
          justification for these practices. In order to question
          the ethical acceptability of the practice in its
          non-therapeutic forms, we need to focus on child rights
          protection.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p><span class="c3">D</span>espite global and local attempts
      to end genital mutilations, in their various forms, whether
      of males or females, the practice has persisted throughout
      human history in most parts of the world. Today both male and
      female genital mutilation are particularly common in poor,
      developing countries with wide traditional communities, but
      these practices have also been maintained in many modern
      Western multicultural societies. This is particularly the
      case with male circumcision, which in many parts of the
      Western world is still practised almost routinely, as the
      articles by Hutson, Short, and Viens on the justification of
      male circumcision in this journal, show.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a> <a href="#n2">2</a> <a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Short and Hutson focus more on scientific,
      medical, and public health aspects while Viens discusses the
      issue of religious freedom and identity. More precisely,
      Hutson analyses whether the public health argument holds
      water in justifying male circumcision as a routine operation
      in relation to its health related consequences (whether these
      are negative or positive). Short's commentary on Hutson
      defends male circumcision on the basis of medical evidence
      that the procedure (on males) has been scientifically proven
      to improve both male and female reproductive health. Short
      goes as far as suggesting that we might have some kind of
      duty to develop better procedures to make the operation the
      ``kindest cut of all''. Viens, on the other hand, argues for
      the justification of male circumcision on the basis of
      individual freedom. Rather than speaking for the right of an
      individual to make his or her own autonomous choices,
      however, Viens draws his arguments from the parents' right to
      decide what is best for their children as well as from the
      parents' religious freedom to choose the (religious) identity
      of, and for, their children. While Hutson is the most
      hesitant of these three authors to defend the general
      benefits of the operation, none of these articles directly
      argues against male genital mutilation. While Viens is most
      sensitive to religious freedom and cultural identity, none of
      the authors discuss in detail the different cultural,
      social,and economic contexts of these values and practices
      across the globe. Instead, all the above mentioned authors
      keep their discussion almost exclusively within the framework
      of Western medicine and a pluralist society. While, albeit
      briefly, supporting other cultures' rights to maintain their
      religious identities, Viens is even willing to offer Western
      assistance in developing less painful and medically safer
      practices for the operation on children elsewhere in the
      world. In this symposium, and against the background of the
      articles by these three authors, I have taken it as my task
      to set this discussion on the justification of male
      circumcision within a wider, global context. I want to
      discuss how we find a range of rationalisations to support
      various types of genital mutilation and to evaluate whether
      these rationalisations have anything to do with a critical
      and reflective moral justification of these practices.</p>

      <p class="2">I shall pay attention to the following issues.
      Firstly, I find it disturbing that even within the Western
      medical community, there is evidently still a wide consensus
      on such an intrusive and violent procedure as male
      circumcision,albeit that this consensus is evidently based on
      very different ``moral'' justifications, which vary from
      public health, to scientific proof, to religion and to a
      diversity of Western values. More worrying is the fact that
      there appears to be a general agreement that this violent
      procedure (as therapeutic and non-therapeutic one) can (and
      according to Viens,even should) be carried out on infants
      and/or very small children. In addition, male genital
      mutilation (MGM) should not be considered in isolation from
      the issue of female genital mutilation (FGM). In this
      symposium only Viens recognises the existence of ``female
      genital cutting''. He, however, regards it as part of the
      same tradition which encourages MGM&mdash;that is, a
      tradition based on religious freedom/cultural
      identity&mdash;without making any attempt to distinguish the
      different nature of the medical and moral reasons put forward
      in favour of FGM.</p>

      <p class="2">Secondly, I find that both the medical and the
      value based arguments presented by these three authors lack
      either plausible evidence or logical consistency. Instead of
      discussing each article separately, however, I shall describe
      a wider global framework that provides false reasons in
      defence of genital mutilation, rather than providing any
      truly plausible moral justification for this practice.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, PAIN, AND
      CHILDREN'S RIGHTS</b></span><br />
       Throughout history human beings have mutilated and harmed
      their bodies (and minds)in the name of culture, tradition,
      religion, and concepts of beauty, health, normality, or
      social status. One of the most persistent forms of these
      physical violations is mutilation of human genitalia. This
      practice has been related to:taboos about human sexuality;
      children's initiation to adulthood, maturity, and
      reproductive age;aesthetic values; the demands set by various
      religions, and to hygienic,individual,and public health
      medical beliefs. (See the articles by Hutson, Short and Viens
      in this journal, and also those by Aldeeb Abu-Salieh,Bigelow,
      and by an anonymous author in <i>Echo</i> ).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1&ndash;7</a></sup> All in all, mutilation of
      human sexual organs reflects our fears about human biological
      needs&mdash;and even deeper fears about human sexual
      needs&mdash;as well as fears to do with the maintenance of
      established social hierarchies in a society.</p>

      <p class="2">In this symposium we are discussing the most
      common form of genital mutilation, male circumcision. In its
      mildest form, this means the cutting of the foreskin of the
      penis. (For more detailed explanations see the articles by
      Hutson, Short, and Viens).<sup><a href="#n1">1</a> <a
      href="#n2">2</a> <a href="#n3">3</a></sup> It is important to
      note, however, that the same term, ``circumcision'' is also
      used in relation to women's genital mutilation, where it
      refers to the cutting of the tip or the whole of the
      clitoris. There are, however, various other, more radical and
      more harmful mutilations of human genitalia, which can be
      relatively minor or extremely serious. Female genital
      mutilation&mdash;for example, includes a wide range of ritual
      and non-medical operations undertaken on women's genital
      organs, which include their total or partial removal and
      amputation or incisions in the interior of the vagina.
      According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) female
      genital mutilation can be classified into three major types:
      type I or clitoridectomy&mdash;removal of the tip of the
      clitoris; type II&mdash;cutting of the clitoris and all or
      part of the labia minora, and type III or infibulation or
      pharaonic circumcision, in which the clitoris is cut together
      with part or the whole of the labia minora and incisions are
      made on the labia majora. When this latter operation is
      performed, the edges of the wound are often tied up again
      leaving a small opening through which body liquids such as
      urine or menstrual blood can flow. The resulting mass of scar
      tissue which covers the urethra and the upper part of the
      vagina, completely closes the vulva. If the opening is wide
      enough, sexual intercourse may occur after a gradual
      dilatation, which can take days, weeks or even months. When
      the opening is too small to allow sexual intercourse, it must
      be widened with a razor or knife on the wedding night. Given
      the severity of cuts and stitches occurring during initial
      and repeated interventions, infibulation is the most harmful
      form of genital mutilation, both to reproductive health and
      to health in general. Other practices which prevail in
      certain countries of Central, Southern, and South Africa,
      consist in pulling the labia and introducing substances and
      minerals into the vagina to dry it and to increase men's
      sexual pleasure (Anonymous,<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> p
      5). Male genital mutilation can vary from body piercing
      through a range of various other modifications to
      amputation,and castration.</p>

      <p class="2">While the moral justification for any type of
      genital mutilation has been challenged from time to time, its
      continuation for both men and women has been rationalised
      over and over again via various medical,legal,moral,and
      cultural arguments. The campaigns against MGM have not been
      as vigorous as those against FGM since FGM is in general
      considered to be a more violent and socially suppressive
      practice than MGM. In addition FGM has more serious and
      damaging physical, as well as psychological or social,
      implications. On the other hand, the operation itself has no
      medical justification, whereas a medical justification is
      still put forward for MGM, as the articles by Hutson, Short,
      and Viens show. Thus, male circumcision has been easier to
      accept as a minor harm that can be justified, or at least
      tolerated, if not sometimes encouraged (see Short's paper in
      this journal) as a part of a particular religious or cultural
      tradition or as a measure promoting individual or public
      health.</p>

      <p class="2">In general, the arguments against MGM or FGM
      claim that both practices violate the physical integrity of
      children and cause avoidable pain. In the worst cases they
      can lead to irreversible physical or psychological harm, as
      noted by Huston in his contribution to this symposium. It
      appears, however, that while neither, Hutson, Viens, nor
      Short recommend male circumcision as a public health measure,
      in individual cases they all accept male circumcision either
      on medical or on religious grounds, as long as it does not
      cause pain. Thus, they recommend better pain management
      measures and more refined procedures to perform the
      operation. This is particularly true of Viens's argument,
      which defends, the practice in the name of religious freedom
      but denies the fact that the operation is&mdash;or should
      be&mdash;painful. This position appears to be contradictory,
      since as a religious or cultural practice, the endurance of
      pain is often an essential part of the ritual, showing the
      readiness of individuals to transit from childhood to
      adulthood, from boy to man, in the case of MGM, and from girl
      to woman in the case of FGM. The other problem with Viens's
      argument for religious freedom in relation to male
      circumcision is that it supports male circumcision being
      carried out on infants and small children at the request of
      their parents, rather than waiting for the children to be
      ``old'' enough to give their ``informed consent'' and to
      understand the real significance of the ritual and ``the need
      to tolerate pain''.</p>

      <p class="2"><span class="yellow">From a human rights
      perspective both male and female genital mutilation,
      <i>particularly</i> when performed on infants or defenceless
      small children,and for non-therapeutic reasons can be clearly
      condemned as a violation of children's rights whether or not
      they cause direct pain. Parents' rights cannot override
      children's rights.</span> If we allow parents to decide what
      is best for their children on the basis of the children's
      religious or cultural identity, we would have no
      justification for stopping them cutting off their children's
      ears, fingers, or noses if their religious and cultural
      beliefs demanded this. Also, if we allow parents' rights to
      override children's rights, we could not then forbid them
      from making any other physical and spiritual sacrifices,
      (such as ``cannibalism'' or ``human sacrifice'' as extreme
      examples), particularly if we follow Viens's recommendation
      and manage to develop techniques that minimise or abolish
      pain.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>TRADITION OF GENITAL MUTILATION AND
      GENDER</b></span><br />
       This article focuses on male circumcision, but I do not want
      to disregard the importance of mentioning female genital
      mutilation in the same context. Some advocates of women's
      rights who emphasise FGM as a sign of gender based violence
      which springs from the patriarchal oppression of women, tend
      to be reluctant to allow any comparison between male and
      female genital mutilation and may disagree with my
      comparisons.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> In this article,
      however, parallels between FGM and MGM are drawn only in
      respect of the implications of performing any potentially
      harmful non-therapeutic, non-consensual procedure that in the
      end is, in one way or another, a social issue rather than a
      medical one. My purpose is not to diminish the ethical,
      social, and medical dangers involved in FGM, but to widen the
      scope of the discussion in this symposium. Focusing merely on
      male circumcision&mdash;and leaving it almost exclusively
      within a medical context&mdash;may make us forget that what
      we are discussing here is a historical tendency to look for
      rationalisations that allow us to practise genital mutilation
      in one form or another, across geographical, cultural, and
      religious boundaries.</p>

      <p class="2">I believe that examining the traditions of
      genital mutilation from the point of view of both sexes may
      reveal more clearly the irrationality involved in the
      justifications that are made for continuing the practice of
      mutilating human genitals. Thus, while there is a need to pay
      special attention to the elements of social and political
      oppression involved in FGM, it is also important to note that
      throughout time men, as well as women, have learned to accept
      that there are good reasons for the mutilations of human
      genitalia. Usually these reasons raise false hopes that
      undergoing the operation somehow improves people's
      lives&mdash;and the lives of their children&mdash;whether
      this be in the context of social status or of a medical
      condition, while the true reasons for the practice may lie
      elsewhere.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>AUTONOMY V CULTURAL
      RIGHTS&mdash;UNTANGLING THE DICHOTOMIES OF CULTURAL
      TRADITIONS</b></span><br />
       When the justification of genital mutilation is
      discussed,the disputes are usually tangled around issues
      about the universality and relativity of our value systems,
      and can often centre on the conflict between the different
      rights that might be involved. In most cases, the debates for
      and against genital mutilation are set within the framework
      of collective cultural rights v individual rights. The
      arguments against the practice of genital mutilation tend to
      appeal to the promotion of individual autonomy and universal
      human rights to various freedoms, while those who defend the
      practice draw support for their claims from demands to
      respect a person's particular cultural identity and/to
      protect the rights of minorities,(minority cultures) as for
      instance is argued by Veins.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      (See also Mills <sup><a href="#n9">9</a> <a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> and in connection with genital
      mutilation my own paper of 1999.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup>)</p>

      <p class="2">In fact, Veins' argument further complicates
      this debate between individualism and collectivism by
      supporting male circumcision not only via an appeal to
      (religious) freedom and identity as such, but also by
      defending parents' rights to decide what is the best for
      their children. He supports MGM further by going on to defend
      our autonomy to decide what is our concept of the good life
      and wellbeing, while simultaneously refuting children's
      rights as not being real ``rights'' of autonomous and fully
      rational persons. This sets ``autonomous'', ``adult'' rights
      against children's rights. While children's rights tend to
      create a problem for the defence of autonomy and informed
      consent in general, Veins' view presents a rather
      contradictory rationalisation for male genital mutilation by
      championing parents' ``cultural identity'' against their
      children's physical integrity. There is always a danger in
      combining cultural and religious identity. The issue of
      religion and religious identity in the context of culture is
      in itself very complex: different cultures have different
      influences on the interpretations of religious norms,
      practices, and identities. Whether we talk about Islam,
      Christianity, Hinduism or any other world religion, each is
      followed very differently, depending on the original culture
      and the historical changes that have affected it: Islam and
      Christianity&mdash;for example, are practised very
      differently in Saudi Arabia, in Uganda, and in the UK.</p>

      <p class="2">On the other hand, Veins' argument provides a
      good example of how the dichotomy between individualism and
      collectivism presents a rather black and white picture of the
      cultural history of our world: individualism is tied
      inseparably to universalism and the universal promotion of
      human rights, while collectivist lifestyles are related
      directly to relativism, which allows social suppression. This
      polarisation of the positions simply overlooks the fact that
      individualistic values and lifestyles can also fall into
      relativist reasoning that rejects any interference with
      individuals' ``autonomous'' choices. This position clearly
      disregards the fact that most of our choices are made in a
      social context and may often be influenced by social
      pressures, or even by some refined forms of social
      coercion.</p>

      <p class="2">Also, an individualist culture, in the name of
      tolerance and freedom, may justify extremely violent and
      irrational practices, and ``autonomous'' parents can ask for
      their children to be physically mutilated in the name of
      their preferred collective identity. Collectivist value
      systems and cultural traditions, for their part, rely on a
      universal demand for the protection of religious and/or
      cultural rights and identities.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a> <a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Reconsidering descriptive and prescriptive
      senses of value systems can help us overcome normative
      cultural dichotomies and to avoid culturally biased
      discussions about genital mutilation and other harmful
      practices. In order to curb injurious practices we need to
      acknowledge that what makes some of these harmful customs so
      persistent is the tendency to see them as essential,
      integral, and identifying parts of particular cultures or
      belief systems. If, however, we recognised openly that the
      same or similar practices tend to appear
      universally&mdash;that is, the same or similar practices
      exist in one form or another in most parts of the world but
      with different rationalisations&mdash;we could see more
      easily the smokescreen that tends to blur moral argumentation
      around these practices. The best way to curtail any harmful
      and violent custom is to find a way to raise resistance to it
      within the communities themselves,by revealing the
      irrationality and dishonesty of the reasons put forward to
      maintain such customs as genital mutilation, and so their
      irrelevance to any cultural identity.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>MEN AND CIRCUMCISION IN THE
      ``WILD'' WEST</b></span><br />
       Arguing about conflicting rights and cultural identities may
      lead us astray, if we do not invalidate some of the central
      fallacies that persist as part of the rationalisation process
      of genital mutilation. Firstly, if we are to have a serious
      ``moral debate'' on the persistent existence of genital
      mutilation, we need to recognise the various rationalisations
      used to defend it throughout human history,not merely in any
      particular time or age. Secondly, we need to further evaluate
      these rationalisations to see how they are successfully
      shaped to fit their local traditions and social
      environments.In most cases, these rationalisations are full
      of inconsistencies and act as a mere smokescreen to cover up
      the actual social, political, or economic reasons that are
      behind the preservation of genital mutilation in any given
      cultural context. Thirdly, recognising the complexity of the
      cultural and ethical issues involved in the justification
      process of genital mutilation may help us to find new ways to
      get rid off the false reasons for the practice and better
      ways to combat this violent practice worldwide.</p>

      <p class="2">Since the practice of genital mutilation has
      existed in almost all known civilisations at some time or
      another in various forms, we cannot say genital mutilation is
      a tradition that is unique to a particular culture or
      religion as such; and therefore we cannot say that defending
      the practice means defending the right of that culture to
      exist and defending the rights of its members to maintain
      their cultural identities. Since genital mutilation has
      appeared in a number of cultures and is related to various
      belief systems, it is not important whether these cultures or
      belief systems themselves are (more) individualist or (more)
      collectivist in their value structure: what is important is
      to pay more attention to the differences in the types of
      rationalisation put forward to support them within different
      types of cultural frameworks. In most cases it appears that
      whether the practice withers away or remains an integral part
      of that culture's identity, depends on the strength of the
      rationalisations and the availability of education in that
      culture.</p>

      <p class="2">Since genital mutilation is not alien to
      individualist cultures, we can look at the medical
      rationalisation of male circumcision in the Western
      individualist tradition. Within Western medical history
      cutting off or extracting the male foreskin has been believed
      to cure insanity, masturbation, epilepsy, cancer of the
      penis, and even cancer of the cervix of the future wives of
      the circumcised boys as well as sexually transmitted diseases
      and particularly <i>phimosis</i> (either as a disease or as a
      cause of other diseases such as cancer). Even today the
      relation between male circumcision and HIV/AIDS is still
      extensively studied and debated,as the articles by Hutson,
      Short, and Viens show.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a> <a
      href="#n2">2</a> <a href="#n3">3</a></sup> In particular, the
      claim that male circumcision is able in fact to prevent
      HIV/AIDS, can have negative consequences,especially in parts
      of the world where medical hygiene is poor and/or relevant
      health education is not readily available.</p>

      <p class="2">The claim that being circumcised helps to
      prevent HIV/ AIDS may in fact lead to triple jeopardy in the
      fight against AIDS. Firstly, where there is a lack of medical
      facilities for the operation the knives and other utensils
      used for the procedure might actually fuel the spread of
      AIDS. This further complicates Viens's argument for religious
      freedom, because he also recommends that the operation be
      carried out in modern medical facilities with more advance
      pain management. If this requirement is set in a global
      context, a logical, but nevertheless contradictory,
      consequence would be, that (male or female) circumcision
      should be allowed in the name of religion only in those parts
      of the world were hygiene and advanced medical treatments and
      technology are readily available. From the point of view of
      religious freedom this is a rather restrictive
      requirement.</p>

      <p class="2">Secondly, the fact that people believe they are
      somehow protected against HIV by being circumcised may cause
      them to be somewhat careless or dismissive about the need for
      other protection, to have promiscuous sex, and in general to
      feel they are now immune to the virus. Thirdly, the fact that
      male circumcision is seen to be medically related to the
      prevention of HIV/AIDS may lead onto a slippery slope that
      ultimately leads to it being culturally required that FGM is
      practised for the same purpose. This would be even more
      counterproductive, since there is medical evidence that women
      are more vulnerable to the virus to start with. Whatever
      medical indication there might be that male circumcision
      actually prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS, the effect of this
      in stopping the spread of the virus would be undermined if,
      as a result, more women were infected because of unsafe, and
      maybe also forced, sex.</p>

      <p class="2">All this shows that while opinions about the
      diseases that male circumcision is to be used to prevent or
      to cure have changed throughout time, male circumcision as
      such has persistently maintained its place as a medically
      justifiable practice in Western countries, and is gaining
      further justification as the papers by Hutson, Short, and
      Viens show. In addition, male circumcision has also had a
      longstanding religious rationalisation in the Western
      cultural context within Judaism, Islam, and even
      Christianity, as explicated by Viens; it has medical
      rationalisation to the level of being almost routinely
      practised in the United States and in Australia, as discussed
      by Hutson and Short; and in most cases it has an individual
      justification which is based on alleged medical conditions,
      as noted by Short. The medicalisation of this operation in
      the West has given the practice a stronger ``rational''
      justification in a modern society than even traditional and
      religious demands can provide.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a> <a
      href="#n15">15</a> <a href="#n16">16</a> <a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Whether the rationalisations of genital
      mutilation are cultural, aesthetic, religious, hygienic,
      medical, or scientific, the truth behind the practice of
      genital mutilation might still be a very different story.
      Even a medical rationalisation may cover up other more hidden
      purposes. If we compare the persistent continuation of male
      circumcision in the United States with the same phenomenon in
      Europe we find rather interesting results. The studies by
      Fletcher,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> and Fleiss<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> show how in the United States, where
      the routine circumcision of newborn males has been common
      until rather recently, because of the widespread diffusion of
      the scientific myths about its benefits, the medical data
      with counter results were deliberately ignored or
      misinterpreted in order to maintain the practice. For
      instance, the latest reports from European medical research
      on the issue were neglected in order to maintain the practice
      in the USA even when it was already rapidly disappearing in
      Europe, as also noted by Hutson.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Behind the disguise of alleged medical
      benefits we can find more gruesome reasons for the
      maintenance of the practice. In a modern, American, market
      oriented society male circumcision became a form of
      commercial exploitation of children when physicians, in
      cooperation with transnational biotechnology corporations,
      looked for the sales of marketable and economically
      profitable products made from harvested human foreskins that
      could further be used in the pharmaceutical industry
      (Fletcher,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> pp 259&ndash;71),
      (Sorrells,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> pp
      331&ndash;7).<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>MALE CIRCUMCISION IN AFRICA AND
      BEYOND</b></span><br />
       The practice of genital mutilation plays a central role in
      social hierarchies and personal relationships (not only
      between the different genders, but also between men
      themselves and between women themselves). Whether the
      rationalisation for male circumcision is a religious,
      cultural, medical or hygienic one, those men who remain
      uncircumcised in the societies in which the practice is
      common, are made to feel somehow abnormal and/or not equal to
      those who have undergone the operation. Just to take a few
      local examples: in East Africa, for instance, men of the
      Masai tribe see uncircumcised men as adolescent, spineless,
      and timid cowards who do not have full male qualifications
      (whether we talk about the uncircumcised men of their own
      community, or those of other tribes or races). Within the
      Cameroonian Nso tribe the three main rationalisations for
      male circumcision have been firstly, the belief that
      circumcision prepares the penis, puts it in a state of
      readiness for coitus and procreation, secondly that it tests
      the courage and endurance of a boy at the threshold of
      adulthood, and thirdly, but rather in contradiction of the
      first claim, it is thought to tame and moderate the sexual
      instinct thereby helping a man to act more
      responsibly.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The Tanzanian Chagga tribe, for its part,
      circumcises young boys in different age groups (thus the age
      for circumcision may vary from 4 to 18). In cases where the
      circumcision is postponed for a long time, for one reason or
      another, by the parents and relatives, many of the boys seek
      a way to go through the operation on their own, endurance of
      pain being a central element of the ritual. Before having the
      operation done to them they feel socially and physically
      immature. With the modern Chagga, many of whom are now
      Catholics by religion, the rationalisation for circumcision
      is nowadays hygienic rather than traditional. The Islamic
      Chagga, for their part, can appeal to the demands of their
      religion, for circumcision. In reality, however, the practice
      is clearly based on peer pressure and the community's social
      expectations. Uncircumcised men in many African communities
      are seen as undeveloped or ``child like'' and are thought to
      be inclined to poor sexual or reproductive performance.</p>

      <p class="2">Social pressures are also typical in the
      societies in which the rationalisation is more purely based
      on religious demands. It may seem inconsistent to require
      genital mutilation on a religious basis since this is
      perfecting the work of God by cutting off,modifying or
      redesigning any part of a human body which has been created
      by God. The human ability to find the needed false reasons,
      however, is boundless; in the case of genital mutilation the
      attempt to reduce sexual pleasure and to maintain chastity is
      seen not only as an improvement of God's work, but also as
      showing obedience to whatever is believed and interpreted to
      be God's will in any given culture. In traditional Judaism,
      for instance, male circumcision is a means to moderate the
      sexual pleasure of men and their attraction to women. Similar
      views, to do with reducing the sexual pleasure rather than
      fully suppressing it, have been presented in Islam. In Islam
      the argument linking pleasure to circumcision, however, is
      used more frequently in the case of female genital
      mutilation. In most religions (as for Jews and Muslims)
      circumcision is also a mark that distinguishes the believer
      from the non-believer. The fact that circumcision has,
      throughout history, been practised also within traditional
      belief systems&mdash;for example, by Australian Aborigines,
      the Mayas of Borneo, various Native American tribes, the
      ancient Aztecs and Mayas, etc&mdash;is not taken as
      undermining the claim that this practice is seen as a sign
      that distinguishes a believer from a non-believer in such
      world religions as Islam or Judaism.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a>
      <a href="#n5">5</a> <a href="#n20">20&ndash;23</a></sup> In
      general then when the justification of genital mutilation is
      based on traditional or religious grounds, whether in Arab,
      Eastern, Western or Southern cultures, the emphasis has been
      on God's will as well as the purity of body and mind.</p>

      <p class="2">All in all, the inconsistencies between sexual
      performance and religious identity in relation to genital
      mutilation do not seem to reduce the power of the false
      reasons put forward to support the practice. In some cultures
      circumcision is justified as a means to control men's and
      women's sexual desires, while in others it is used for
      precisely the opposite purpose, that is to prove the sexual
      virility and endurance of men. In yet other cultures it is
      used to enforce traditional and natural cultural identity and
      social order, and in others it is used to mark religious
      affiliation and God's will.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND
      GENDER EQUALITY</b></span><br />
       Female genital mutilation, for its part, is usually seen as
      part of traditional and collectivist cultures with
      patriarchal social structures. It is not, however, fully
      alien to the more individualist Western cultural tradition.
      Female genital mutilation used to be practised in Western
      civilisations as a cure for various medical conditions while
      the actual social reasons for its maintenance may have lain
      elsewhere in Western history. Clitoridectomy was, for
      instance, used both in Europe and in America for hygienic
      reasons, as a medical cure for masturbation, and for mental
      disorders such as hysteria. Since in the West both male and
      female circumcision were practised by qualified doctors for
      allegedly legitimate medical indications, they were not
      considered to be the same brutal and intervening mutilations
      of the human body as they were seen to be elsewhere in so
      called ``more primitive'' societies. This shows that science
      can be a double edged sword that readily lends itself as an
      alibi for strongly held preferences and cultural biases. In
      particular, the medicalised nature of the Western culture
      itself can give legitimisation to even violent and
      unnecessary physical interventions on the human body in the
      name of science, progress, normality, and health while the
      actual reasons for such interventions may remain
      hidden.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Today, female genital mutilation, now called
      traditional circumcision, no longer exists openly in the
      Western cultural mainstream, but it persists in the
      developing world. With the relatively recent emphasis on
      pluralist values, tolerance, and respect for personal
      autonomy, however, practices of genital mutilations have
      recurred in the West. Body piercing and other rather
      extremist forms of sexual (pleasure seeking) subcultural
      practices have introduced new, less openly condemned, forms
      of genital mutilation. These contemporary forms of genital
      mutilation are taken to be more acceptable since they are
      thought to have come about as a result of one's autonomous
      choice and free will. Thus, the main ethical battle against
      genital mutilation in Western culture still focuses more on
      preventing the traditional forms of FGM, which also is
      practised (though mostly in secret) within various immigrant
      communities in multicultural Western societies. Here again,
      we can note that the culture itself introduces the same
      practice (in different forms) over and over again,succeeding
      always in finding a culturally fitting justification for it,
      while being simultaneously more than ready to reject the same
      or similar custom in other cultures.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a>
      <a href="#n8">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">While, however, many traditional communities
      where FGM is practised remain clearly more patriarchal and
      use female genital mutilation to control women's sexual
      behaviour, economic factors should not be ignored. Those
      performing the operation earn a good income out of it and
      thus, the practice provides livelihoods for many. Also,
      circumcised girls guarantee better bride prices and higher
      social status for their families. This may help us to
      understand why not only men, but also women themselves, while
      victims of the practice of FGM, are often its strongest
      proponents. It is true that the more traditional types of
      female genital mutilation clearly have more devastating
      medical consequences for their victims, particularly in poor
      environments and in unhygienic conditions. In addition, they
      are usually performed on vulnerable and defenceless children.
      Thus, evidently there is an urgent need to find a ways to
      curtail the practice. Additionally, as noted, female genital
      mutilation tends to persist in societies that have a more
      traditional, a more patriarchal social structure, thus its
      maintenance is more directly related to the low social status
      of women. Female genital mutilation in traditional
      environments is said to be harder to combat, since its
      persistent maintenance is usually based on women's lack of
      education and decision making power in their communities.
      Thus, the abolition of FGM is not merely in hands of its
      direct victims. It is also in the hands of the society as a
      whole, and particularly in the hands of those in social and
      political or religious power. Power relations between the
      sexes, however, are difficult to change and thus, the
      practice persists and is justified in a manner that makes
      women themselves adopt it as a part of their cultural
      identity and of their social pride through history. In
      Africa, for instance, the history of female genital
      mutilation dates back to 4000 years BC. Even today in Africa
      FGM is still practised in at least 27 countries and every
      year two million girls at least are exposed to sexual
      mutilation. These mutilations constitute one aspect of a
      series of traditional practices harmful to women's health and
      welfare&mdash;that is,forced marriages and early pregnancies,
      force feeding, tattooing, scarification, and nutritional
      taboos. Also, although some people consider the practice of
      FGM to be recommended by Islam, Christianity, and traditional
      religions, there are non-believers who practise this as well.
      These practices are also found in Egypt as well as in the
      majority of Arab Muslim countries of the Middle and Near East
      as well as in Islamic societies in the Far East.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a> <a href="#n8">8</a> <a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> Finally, it should not be overlooked
      that women are also involved in the maintenance of male
      genital mutilation.In the case of MGM, setting aside
      religious or traditional rationalisations or social pressures
      from the community, women (those who themselves have not
      undergone any genital mutilation, as in the US&mdash;for
      example) may prefer circumcised men as sexual partners,
      either because their performance in sexual intercourse lasts
      longer or because they consider a circumcised penis to be
      more hygienic and/or more aesthetic than an uncircumcised
      one.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>CONCLUSION</b></span><br />
       Human sexuality and the attempts to control it, particularly
      to reduce or add sexual pleasure, have been, in one way or
      another, a part of all known cultures and civilisations.
      While sometimes this fact is acknowledged openly as the main
      purpose for genital mutilation, in most cases other
      rationalisations are put forward for the practice. These
      false reasons have varied from religious and cultural demands
      to a number of medical ``explanations'', depending on the
      wider cultural tradition within which the practice has
      appeared. These different rationalisations for the
      maintenance of the practices in various cultures show that no
      matter what the cultural differences are in beliefs and
      lifestyles, genital mutilation is a universal sign of human
      civilisation&mdash;or maybe the lack of it. All societies
      have found the arguments that best fit their local cultural
      traditions and environments in order to introduce or maintain
      genital mutilation in its various forms. In the Western,
      rather individualist tradition, these rationalisations are
      based on benefit to the individual and/or autonomy; in the
      Southern and Eastern cultures their support is drawn more
      directly from social values and ties, or from the need to
      protect one's unique cultural identity against Western
      cultural imperialism. Thus, in this regard one cultural
      tradition cannot be said to be better than another. Rather,
      with further education and knowledge the cultural smokescreen
      around the real reasons for the maintenance of the practice
      can be overcome in all societies no matter what their
      cultural background.</p>
