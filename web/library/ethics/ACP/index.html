<h2>Australian College of Paediatrics<br>
Policy Statement on Circumcision (1983)</h2>
</p>

<ol>
<li>
      The ACP should continue to discourage the practice of
      circumcision in the newborn male infant.
<p>
<li>
      Educational material on the topic of circumcision should be
      available to parents before the birth of their baby and
      also in maternity hospitals.  This will facilitate informed
      discussion with the medical attendant.

<p>
<li>
      Some parents after considering medical, social, religious
      and family factors will opt for circumcision of their male
      child.   It is then the responsibility of the medical
      attendant to recommend that this circumcision be performed
      at an age and under medical circumstances that reduce the
      hazards to a minimum.
