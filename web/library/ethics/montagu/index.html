        END THE GENITAL MUTILATION OF CHILDREN WORLDWIDE:
         A PETITION TO THE WORLD COURT, THE HAGUE (1996)

      The Ashley Montagu Resolution, named in honor of the
distinguished anthropologist and author, Dr. Ashley Montagu, was
adopted by the Fourth International Symposium on Sexual
Mutilations that was held in Lausanne, Switzerland in August
1996.

      This resolution addresses the human rights violations
inherent in genital mutilation of non-consenting children worldwide.

      The resolution will be published in its entirety in Sexual
Mutilations: A Human Tragedy, the proceedings of the Fourth
International Symposium on Sexual Mutilations, which will be
released this Spring by Plenum Publishing Corporation.  For
