      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The <i>Universal Declaration of

      enunciates certain fundamental human rights of every human
      being which are which are of special interest in the study of
      the ethics of circumcision. They are the rights to security
      of person, to freedom from torture and other cruel and

      <h2>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2>

      <h3>Preamble</h3>

      <p class="text">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity
      and of the equal and unalienable rights of all members of the
      human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace
      in the world,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas disregard and contempt for human
      rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged
      the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which
      human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and
      freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest
      aspiration of the common people,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be
      compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion
      against tyranny and opression, that human rights should be
      protected by the rule of law,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas it is essential to promote the
      development of friendly relations between nations,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas the peoples of the United Nations
      have in the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-charter/">Charter</a>
      reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the
      dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights
      of men and women and have determined to promote social
      progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas Member States have pledged themselves
      to achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the
      promotion of universal respect for and observance of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas a common understanding of these
      rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the
      full realization of this pledge,</p>

      <p class="text">Now, therefore, The General Assembly,
      Proclaims this <i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i>
      as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all
      nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of

      rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and
