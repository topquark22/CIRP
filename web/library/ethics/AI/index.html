      <h3>Appendix 3</h3>

      <p><b>Amnesty International Declaration on the Role of Health
      Professionals in the Exposure of Torture and
      Ill-treatment</b></p>

      <p><b>Preamble:</b> Human rights and medical ethics standards
      have evolved in recent years and, currently, strong legal and
      ethical prohibitions on torture and other human rights
      violations exist. These include the United Nations (UN) <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a>, the Declaration on the Protection of all
      Persons from Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
      Treatment or Punishment (Declaration against Torture), the
      Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
      Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Body of Principles for
      the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or
      Imprisonment, regional human rights treaties and a number of
      statements adopted by doctors' and nurses' organizations.
      Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,
      however, continues and the need for positive action by health
      professionals to expose these abuses is as great as ever. The
      following declaration articulates the steps implicit in the
      ethics of medicine and nursing which Amnesty International
      believes should be taken by health professionals to fulfil
      their role as protector of the vulnerable, particularly those
      deprived of liberty.</p>

      <h2 align="center">DECLARATION</h2>

      <p><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/" target="_blank">Amnesty
      International</a></p>

      <p>Recalling that the <a
      href="/library/ethics/tokyo/">Declaration of Tokyo</a> of the
      <a href="http://www.who.int/ina-ngo/ngo/ngo178.htm">World
      Medical Association</a> (1975) obliges doctors not to
      condone, countenance or participate in torture;</p>

      <p>Recalling that the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-medical-ethics/">United Nations
      Principles of Medical Ethics Relevant to the Role of Health
      Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of
      Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel,
      Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1982)</a>
      states that it is a gross contravention of medical ethics for
      health personnel, particularly physicians, to assist,
      actively or passively, in acts of torture;</p>

      <p>Further recalling that the <a href="http://www.icn.ch/"
      target="_blank">International Council of Nurses</a> has
      declared in The Role of the Nurse in the Care of Detainees
      and Prisoners (1975) that nurses having knowledge of physical
      or mental ill-treatment must take appropriate action
      including reporting the matter to appropriate national and/or
      international bodies;</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Noting the fundamental obligation
      stemming from the <a
      href="/library/ethics/hippocrates/">Hippocratic Oath</a> and
      the World Medical Association's <a
      href="/library/ethics/intlcode/">International Code of
      Medical Ethics (1949)</a> for doctors to practice for the
      good of their patient and never to do harm;</span></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Recalling the important role of
      health professionals in protecting particular vulnerable
      individuals such as children through exposing instances of
      serious abuses coming to their attention;</span></p>

      <p>Recalling that torture and other cruel, inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment are contrary to
      international law;</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Calls on health professionals
      witnessing torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment or punishment, or the effects of such violations,
      to report their observations to their immediate manager and
      to their professional association. In the event of inaction
      by the persons so informed (or where, in the judgment of the
      health professional, it would be too dangerous to report to
      these persons), the health professional should report his or
      her observations to an international professional,
      humanitarian or human rights organization.</span></p>

      <p>Declares that the health professional making such a report
      should be given support by individual colleagues and by their
      national and international professional associations. Such
      associations should take firm action when a health
      professional is disciplined in any way or otherwise
      victimised for reporting human rights violations, including
      making strong representations to the authorities to quash
      such disciplinary measures and to provide legal assistance to
      the threatened individual.</p>

      <p>Calls on national professional associations to adopt and
      publicise statements opposing professional involvement in
      human rights violations and to ensure that their members know
      of their ethical responsibility to report torture and
      ill-treatment and of the commitment of the association to
      support members reporting abuses.</p>

      <p>Calls on international professional associations and the
      United Nations and its relevant agencies to publicise the
      ethical responsibility of health professionals to report
      human rights violations inflicted on their patients.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Calls on international professional
      bodies to make clear statements about the serious breach of
      professional ethics occasioned by a health professional's
      purposely omitting, modifying, or falsifying relevant
      information in the medical history of an alleged victim of
      torture or ill-treatment, such as to preclude or to make
      difficult the treatment of the patient, to prevent redress
      for the victim or to impede the bringing to justice of those
      responsible for the torture or ill-treatment.</span></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Further calls on international
      professional bodies to investigate, and where appropriate,
      impose sanctions on, national associations which collude in
      the infliction of human rights violations in their
      countries.</span></p>

        "The doctor shall not countenance, condone or participate
        in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman
        or degrading procedures, whatever the offence of which the
        victim of such procedures is suspected, accused or guilty,
        and whatever the victim's beliefs or motives, and in all
        situations, including armed conflict and civil strife."

      Association: International Code of Medical Ethics</a></p>

      <blockquote>
        "A physician shall, in all types of medical practice, be

      <p>United Nations: <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-medical-ethics/">Principles of

      <blockquote>
        "It is a gross contravention of medical ethics, as well as
        an offence under applicable international instruments, for
        health personnel, particularly physicians, to engage,
        actively or passively, in acts which constitute
        participation in, complicity in, incitement to or attempts
        to commit torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
        treatment or punishment."
