      <h3>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</h3>

      <p><b>The framework of human rights law</b></p>

      <p>In September 1990, ten months after being adopted by the
      UN General Assembly, the United Nations Convention on the
      Rights of the Child came into force. Those countries which
      pledged themselves to abide by the provisions of the
      Convention now have a legally binding obligation to ensure
      that their domestic law and other relevant administrative
      arrangements satisfy its requirements.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Convention is one of the most recent additions to a growing
      international code of human rights law. Amongst the many
      instruments that comprise this code are the two principal UN
      covenants, the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-human/"
      target="_blank">International Covenant on Civil and Political
      Rights</a> and the <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b2esc.htm"
      target="_blank">International Covenant on Economic, Social
      and Cultural Rights</a>. Both treaties contain an agreed
      catalogue of rights which each state adhering to the treaty
      pledges itself to recognise. The catalogue thus becomes an
      authoritative standard by which to judge the behaviour of
      governments toward the people they govern. The rights are
      possessed equally by all human individuals `without
      distinction of any kind'; they are `inherent' and
      `inalienable' human rights.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken as a pair,
      the two principal UN covenants aim to provide some kind of
      comprehensiveness in their catalogue of 'basic rights' and
      fundamental freedoms'. Other instruments specify particular
      rights in more detail than a general catalogue would allow,
      or they deal with a particular category of person such as
      refugees. <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">The UN
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> stands somewhere
      between these two types of international human rights
      instrument. Though it deals with a particular category of
      person - children - it nonetheless aims to `incorporate the
      whole spectrum of human rights'.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1924 the
      League of Nations adopted a <i>Declaration on the Rights of
      the Child</i>. Coming in the aftermath of the suffering and
      economic dislocation caused by the First World War, the
      Declaration stressed the material needs of children; they
      should have 'by right' the means necessary for their normal
      development, including `food for the hungry, nursing for the
      sick, help for the handicapped, and shelter and succour for
      the orphan and waif'. In 1959 the United Nations General
      Assembly adopted its own <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</a>. The preamble states that `the child,
      by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs
      special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal
      protection', and that `mankind owes the child the best it has
      to give'.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these
      earlier instruments are formal treaties; they are
      'declarations of intent' or 'proclamations of general
      principle'. Like the more famous <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a>, the 1959 <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">UN Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</a> proclaims a 'common standard of
      achievement'. By this means the international community
      signals its acceptance of a standard which is then used as a
      basis for mutual exhortation and criticism. And the
      acceptance of a standard confers upon it a kind of authority
      that cannot be possessed by a disputed standard.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN
      Convention differs from these previous instruments not only
      in respect to its legal standing - it is a formal treaty and
      not `merely' a proclamation of general principle - but also
      in respect of its content. It goes beyond a statement of what
      is owed to children by virtue of their `physical' and mental
      immaturity', and incorporates some of the rights and freedoms
      listed in the more general human rights treaties.</p>

      <p><b>Universal rights and special rights</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `inherent
      right to life', the right to freedom of expression and the
      freedom of conscience, thought and religion, the right to
      social security and the various rights recognized by the
      Convention which are already listed in the principal human
      rights treaties. There are, however, some notable but
      unsurprising omissions from the two UN International
      Covenants. Not all of the rights said to be possessed by
      everyone `without distinction of any kind' are expressly
      extended to children by the Convention. Children do not, for
      instance, have the right to work, to choose their place of
      residence or to take part in the conduct of public
      affairs.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the
      rights children possess, they possess in common with all
      human individuals. Others they possess because they are
      children. And there are yet others which they do not possess
      for the same reason, because they are children. If only those
      rights which are possessed by everyone can be properly
      considered as universal human rights, then rights possessed
      only by children (if there are any such) are not universal
      human rights. And by the same reasoning, rights which are not
      possessed by children are not universal human rights.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the
      provisions in the Convention specify rights which children
      possess because they are children. As with the 1959
      Declaration, the usual explanation for ascribing such special
      rights to children arise out of their incapacity to provide
      for themselves or to protect themselves. They cannot survive,
      let alone flourish, without the assistance of others.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things
      however are needed either for human survival or for
      flourishing can only be provided through social cooperation.
      In these respects no-one, neither children nor adults, can
      provide for themselves. Not only are children incapable (more
      or less) of providing for themselves by their own unaided
      efforts (like adults), but they are also incapable (more or
      less) of contributing to these cooperative endeavours by
      means of which individuals provide for themselves and each
      other. This incapacity is a basic ground for recognizing the
      claims of children to be provided for by others. They should
      be provided for both because of and in spite of their
      `economic' incapacity. Other groups of similarly incapable
      individuals, such as the severely mentally handicapped, have
      an identically grounded claim. If anything is special or
      distinctive about children, it is therefore not that they
      need to be provided for; it is that with which they need to
      be provided.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 27 of
      the Convention requires that 'States Parties recognise the
      right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the
      child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social
      development'. Whereas the <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b2esc.htm">International
      Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights</a>
      recognises a 'right to an adequate standard of living', the
      Convention recognises a right to a standard of living
      adequate for the child's development. More generally,
      children have a claim on others to provide the nurturing and
      care that they need in order to develop beyond childhood. The
      idea of development or maturation is fundamental to our
      understanding of the nature of childhood. Childhood comes to
      an end when some specified developmental process is complete.
      A `thin' idea of this would include only the capacity for
      sexual reproduction and a basic economic capacity. A `rich'
      idea of this development would include whatever capacities
      are required for human flourishing. As Article 27 makes
      clear, the Convention adheres to a `rich' idea of the process
      of child development. (no aspect of human flourishing is to
      be neglected) whilst refraining from detail in specifying the
      capacities that are to be developed. This choice of a `rich'
      idea of child development (which reflects a `rich' idea of
      human flourishing) is one of the most significant underlying
      themes of the Convention. It is important not least because
      it entails the rejection of a `thin' idea of child
      development. Children have a right to be provided for beyond
      the age of sexual maturity or the development of their
      capacity to be economically productive.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 33
      provides that `State Parties shall take all effective and
      appropriate measures ... to protect children from the illicit
      use of narcotic drugs ... and to prevent the use of children
      in the illicit production and trafficking of such
      substances'. Several provisions in the Convention, like
      Article 33, require that special measures be taken to protect
      children from specified harms including sexual abuse, sexual
      exploitation and exploitation at work. In some, or perhaps
      even all, of these cases it seems reasonable to say that the
      harm against which children should be protected is one
      against which adults should also be protected. For example,
      the laws of most countries `recognise the right' of everyone
      to be protected against the harm caused by narcotic drugs.
      How is it that children have special rights to protection
      against harms to which everyone is vulnerable? If the
      measures taken to protect adults from these harms are deemed
      inadequate for the protection of children, then special
      measures are required in order that children may be equally
      protected from this kind of harm. It is usually said however
      not only that children have a claim to special kinds of
      protection, but also that they have a special claim to
      protection, a claim grounded in an incapacity analogous to
      their economic incapacity. And just as economic incapacity is
      not a characteristic possessed only by children, nor is this
      second kind of incapacity (an inability to recognise a threat
      of harm for what it is?); there are others who are in he same
      way especially vulnerable to harms. If children are
      distinctive in this respect, it is perhaps because they may
      be described as `doubly' vulnerable. Harms against which they
      are especially vulnerable by virtue of incapacity expose them
      to an additional harm - the hindering or distortion of their
      development as children.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1959 <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</a> stated that the `child shall in all
      circumstances be among the first to receive protection and
      relief' and that `mankind owes to the child the best it has
      to give'. The clear implication is that children have
      priority when their claims compete with those of others under
      conditions of scarcity. The special rights of children are
      special not only by virtue of being different from those of
      others, but also because they give rise to claims which are
      stronger than those of others. Two very different types of
      reason may be offered in support of this widely shared view.
      There are reasons which rest on some version of a principle
      of equality. Children are usually entitled with adults to
      have their needs met. The fair application of this principal
      requires that those with greater needs should receive more of
      what is to be provided. Under condition of scarcity the more
      needy go `to the head of the queue'. These considerations are
      internal to the idea of individual human rights; they are
      claims which children exert `in their own right'. An
      altogether different argument for recognising stronger claims
      in children is that the present recognition of these claims
      contributes to the future well-being of society. This line of
      reasoning does not sit well with the idea that individual
      human rights have a basic role to play in moral argument.
      More weight is assigned to the satisfaction of children's
      needs or the alleviation of their suffering because of the
      benefits this brings, not to them individually but to society
      as a whole.</p>

      <p><b>Liberty rights</b></p>

      <p>Those rights whose function is to ensure that children
      receive the special protection and care to which they are
      morally entitled by virtue of being children correspond to
      the principles adumbrated in the 1959 <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</a>. There are two main respects in which
      the Convention can fairly claim to 'chart new territory' and
      go beyond the earlier document. Firstly, some of these rights
      which the Convention explicitly extends to children even
      though they are said in other instruments to be possessed by
      everyone fall into the category sometimes knows as 'liberty
      rights'. This type of right protects the freedom to take
      untrammelled choices of some kind or another (eg the freedom
      of thought, conscience and religion), and therefore
      presupposes the capacity to make the kinds of choice in
      question. Secondly, the Convention 'establishes the right of
      the child to be an actor in his or her own development'.
      <span class="yellow">More specifically, Article 12 declares
      that 'States Parties shall ensure to the child who is capable
      of forming his or her own views the right to express those
      views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of
      the child being given due weight in accordance with the age
      and maturity of the child'.</span></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
      significance is to be ascribed to these two steps? The
      extension to children of liberty rights already said to be
      possessed by every one is significant is so far as 'everyone'
      was previously understood to include children. For as long as
      children have a right to be provided for (because of their
      economic incapacity), they also have a special right to be
      protected from harm. And this right to protection implies a
      general lack of liberty rights. So the argument goes. The
      possession of liberty rights is supposed to entail the
      exercise of that very same capacity in which the child must
      be judged defective in order that he or she may justifiably
      receive special protection from harm. Behind this
      conservative position on children's rights lies a particular
      conception of the transition from childhood to adulthood as a
      move from complete tutelage to full and equal liberty. The
      Convention repudiates the view, implicit in such
      conservatism, that the transition from childhood to adulthood
      depends on the development of a single or unitary capacity
      (the ability to recognise a threat of harm for what it is)
      which the child either does on does not possess in sufficient
      measure.</p>

      <p><b>Immediate and progressive rights</b></p>

      <p>Article 4 of the Convention declares that `with regard to
      economic, social and cultural rights, States Parties shall
      undertake such measures to the maximum extent of their
      resources, and where needed, within the framework of
      international cooperation'. Obligations accepted by States
      under the various human rights treaties are usually described
      as either `absolute and immediate' or 'relative and
      progressive'. Those which are either explicitly or implicitly
      qualified by the `resources' permitting proviso belong to the
      latter category. Rights which are not relative and
      progressive are absolute and immediate; they come into force
      for each state from the moment it becomes bound by the
      treaty.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative and
      progressive' rights correspond to what political philosophers
      have tended to call `welfare rights'. They represent an
      individuals claim to some portion of the products of social
      cooperation irrespective of the extent of that individual's
      contribution to their production. By describing the right as
      `relative' the point is made that the size of the portion
      which the individual is owed must depend on the size of the
      whole from which it is taken. By describing it as
      'progressive' it is implied that someone who now receives
      what is in one sense his `fair share' of the whole may yet be
      receiving less than he ought. It is possible to say this
      because human needs determine a standard by which the
      adequacy of a portion may be judged; people should not
      receive less than adequate to their needs (see Article 27
      above).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether welfare
      rights are truly moral rights is a question that has received
      a great deal of recent philosophical attention. The
      controversy has turned largely on the sense that moral rights
      are peculiarly peremptory and insistent in their claim to be
      fulfilled, qualities which have sometimes been considered
      incompatible with the `relative and progressive' nature of
      welfare rights.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">Article 24 of the Convention recognises `the
      right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
      standard of health and to facilitate for the treatment of
      illness and rehabilitation of health'.</span> Scepticism over
      the status of relative and progressive rights, such as the
      right to health care provision, is often justified by arguing
      the necessity of deciding between competing claims under
      conditions of scarcity. How is it to be decided whether or
      not someone is entitled to a particular form of medical
      treatment? One way of settling the question is by using (in
      the style of the Convention) the language of human needs.
      There is a sense in which someone who needs a given form of
      treatment is entitled to receive it. But if those charged
      with satisfying medical needs can justifiably say `resources
      do not permit', then such a right is of no use to its bearer
      in determining what this individual should receive under
      conditions of scarcity, it will be necessary to take account
      of the level of available resources together with competing
      claims on its use. We may choose to say that he is morally
      entitled (ie has a right) to receive whatever it is decided
      that he should receive once these factors have been taken
      into account. But this second rights is determined by
      deciding what health care he should receive, and not vice
      versa. And what sense is attached to a recognition of a right
      which is of no use to its bearer in securing what he should
      receive?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
      commentators on human rights law circumvent this challenge to
      the idea of welfare rights by casting them in a more modest
      role, one which stresses the importance of remedies against
      the unequal or discriminatory recognition of such rights. In
      so far as welfare rights, such as the right to health care,
      are rights possessed equally by all, then they can be used to
      ensure that no-one is unjustly excluded from that to which
      others have access. The equal right to health care, so
      conceived, acts as a constraint on the types of factor that
      may be taken into account under the `resources permitting'
      proviso. It is, for example, impermissible to give one
      individual priority over another in the provision of care on
      the grounds of ethnic origin.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is anything lost
      by accepting such a trimmed down conception of welfare
      rights? Article 6.2 of the Convention requires `States
      Parties to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival
      and development of the child'. Children are incompletely
      protected in their rights to `survival and development' as
      long as they do not receive enough of whatever is needed for
      survival and development. By saying that the right is
      progressive the Convention acknowledges that it may not yet
      be enforceable. To recognise the right is nonetheless to
      accept a present obligation, the obligation to work towards a
      state of affairs in which they do receive enough of whatever
      is needed. One of the most important rhetorical functions of
      welfare rights is to assert the existence of obligations of
      this kind, notwithstanding the difficulty of specifying
      criteria for determining when someone has failed in his
      performance of the obligation.</p>

      <p><b>The UN Convention and the medical profession</b></p>

      <p>It is an important feature of treaties like the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> that they are result of negotiation
      between states whose conventional moralities will almost
      certainly differ on many matters relating to the treatment of
      children. Moral rights are meant to have a force which is
      independent of any particular conventional morality. Since
      the outcome of a truly international agreement on human
      rights will have this `trans-cultural' quality, it may appear
      to have a moral force beyond that which it possesses by
      virtue of its legal status alone. Such a catalogue of human
      rights can claim to represent the moral consensus of the
      international community. And many people would argue that
      this is as good a method derived from abstruse philosophical
      speculations. A consensus approach must be conceded to have
      its drawbacks however. The contents of the catalogue of
      rights will lack the specificity to decide contested cases.
      Agreement is usually reached not by settling controversies,
      but by moving beyond them to a higher level of
      generality.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pediatric
      medicine abounds with examples of issues which the Covenant
      could not settle without further interpretation as to the
      scope and force of its various provisions. <span
      class="yellow">There are, for example, the many types of
      cases which concern the respective powers of parents and
      children to grant or withhold consent to medical
      treatment.</span></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the relevance
      of the Convention to the medical profession were thought to
      depend upon its capacity to shed light on these hard cases,
      then it would be a document with only a slight claim upon the
      attention of doctors in liberal democracies. (And if this
      deficiency were made good by supplementing the Convention
      with an adjunctive institution empowered to apply its
      provisions to the settlement of hard cases, it would be
      questions of legal rights, not moral rights, that would be
      settled.)</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps then the
      strongest basis for the Convention's claim on the attention
      of the medical profession in general, and paediatricians in
      particular, is in the opportunity it provides for an
      appraisal of the broader implications and limitations of
      appeals to <span class="yellow">children's rights in medical
      ethics</span>. What kind of priority should children have in
      matters of resource allocation? Do children's rights to
      `survival and development' exert their claims across national
      boundaries? To what extent does the <span
      class="yellow">right of children to special protection</span>
      oblige paediatricians with their specialist knowledge of the
      needs of the developing child for protection and care, to
