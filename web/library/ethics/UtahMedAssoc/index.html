  <PRE>UMA ECONOMIC CODE OF MEDICAL ETHICS FOR UTAH PHYSICIANS

   The physicians of Utah hold to their work in the practice
   of medicine and surgery in all of their branches to be
   that of an ancient and honored profession, the goals of
   which are to alleviate suffering, to cure sickness and
   disease insofar as it is humanly possible, and to
   prolong meaningful life.  We acknowledge that the cost of
   medical care recently has risen faster than the general
   rate of inflation and that it is reaching a level which
   society may not be able or willing to afford without the
   sacrifice of other necessary goods and services.  We
   further acknowledge that, because the practice of
   medicine and surgery is an art as well as a science,
   there are neither dogmas nor certain formulae for
   delivering simultaneously the optimum and most cost
   effective care in every case.  We realize, however, that
   it now behooves every physician to conduct his or her
   practice so as to reduce waste and over-utilization.
   Therefore, in order to deliver the highest quality care
   at the lowest cost to society, we the physicians of the
   Utah Medical Association, do hereby affirm the following
   precepts:

    1. We will deliver only indicated medical care. We will
   neither make referrals, perform tests or diagnostic
   procedures, perform operations, give medications or
   prescriptions for medications, nor give opinions to
   support delivery of such medical care unless it is
   specifically indicated.

    2. We will distinguish clearly between necessary and
   elective care or procedures and convey such distinction
   to each patient.

    3. We will encourage our patients to receive necessary
   health care in an economically competitive setting
   consistent with high quality medical care.

   4. We will, after having admitted a patient to a hospital
   or other health care facility, make every effort to
   discharge the patient as soon as it is possible to do so,
   provided the quality of medical care is not compromised.
   We will encourage administrators of hospitals and other
   health facilities to be cooperative in this endeavor.

    5. In any case where we are not certain as to whether
   medical care is necessary we will seek advice and/or
   consultation from peers before delivering said medical
   care unless the delay of seeking consultation would
   compromise necessary emergency care.

    6. We consider it our duty to society and to other
   members of the medical profession to point out any
   physician or other individual or institution which may
   be, in our opinion, delivering unnecessary medical care.

    7. We invite review by our peers of our practices of
   health care delivery.

    8. We will fully discuss with our patients or their
   legal guardians the expected cost of any procedure,
   tests, operations, medications, or other aspects of
   health care insofar as it is possible.  We will also
   fully explain to patients or their legal guardians the
   known substantial and serious risks of alternative
   treatments, procedures and therapies before
   their undertaking insofar as it is possible. We urge all
   health care providers to do the same.  We invite the
   participation of all patients in the
   decision-making process of his or her health needs as
   regards cost of care and the options open to them.  We
   expect the patient to do his or her part in controlling
   costs by this discussion.

    9. We will be fair in our professional charges for our
   services.  We will relate these charges to the community
   in which we practice and the financial resources
   available for health care.  We will not withhold
   necessary medical care from the needy regardless of their
   ability to pay.

   10. We will not exploit third-party payors by charging
   more or performing more services for insured patients
   than we would for patients who are not insured.
