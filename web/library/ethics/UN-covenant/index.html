        <h3>CIRP Introduction</h3>
        The <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political
        Rights</i> (ICCPR) was adopted by the United Nations
        General Assembly on 16 December 1966. The ICCPR was to take
        effect ten years later in all nations that had become state
        parties. A sufficient number of states had become parties
        so the ICCPR took effect as planned in 1976.<br />
        <br />

        <p>The United States Senate ratified the ICCPR in June
        1992. The Senate took exceptions to this treaty. Amongst
        those exceptions are the provision that the human rights
        recognized by this treaty shall not be enforcable in courts
        in the United States. Thus the United States Senate denied
        Americans the legal power to secure and enforce the human
        rights recognized by this international covenant.</p>

        <p>CIRP presents selected articles. The full unabridged
        text is available elsewhere on the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>The ICCPR contains important articles which appear to
        protect the child from involuntary circumcision. Article 24
        provides a right of every child to special protection. This
        is to be applied without regard to race, color, sex,
        religion, social orgin or birth. The right is universal and
        protects every child without exception. Article 9 provides
        a right of security of person. Article 7 provides a right
        to freedom from torture, and cruel or degrading treatment.
        Article 26 provides a right to the equal protection of the
        law for all persons. Read together it appears that a child
        would have a right to special protection of the security of
        his body, freedom from torture, and cruel and degrading
        treatment. The special protection of the law is to be
        applied universally for all persons. This would seem to
        mean that the child is entitled to protection from
        circumcision by law.</p>

        <p>Article 18 provides that everyone has a right to adopt a
        religion. This means that children may adopt a different
        religion from their parents. A circumcision may interfere
        with this right of free choice of religion.</p>

        <p>These articles may be enforcable in court in some
        nations other than the United States.</p>

      <h3 align="center">INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND
      POLITICAL RIGHTS</h3>

      <p>The States Parties to the present Covenant,</p>

      <p>Considering that, in accordance with the principles
      proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition
      of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
      rights of all members of the human family is the foundation
      of freedom, justice and peace in the world,</p>

      <p>Recognizing that these rights derive from the inherent
      dignity of the human person,</p>

      <p>Recognizing that, in accordance with the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a>, the ideal of free human beings enjoying
      civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want
      can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby
      everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as
      his economic, social and cultural rights,</p>

      <p>Considering the obligation of States under the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-charter/">Charter of the United
      Nations</a> to promote universal respect for and observance
      of, human rights and freedoms,</p>

      <p>Realizing that the individual, having duties to other
      individuals and to the community to which he belongs, is
      under a responsibility to strive for the promotion and
      observance of the rights recognized in the present
      Covenant,</p>

      <p>Agree upon the following articles:</p>

      <p>3. The States Parties to the present Covenant, including
      those having responsibility for the administration of

      <p><b>Article 2</b></p>

      <p>1. Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to
      respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory

      opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other
      status.</p>

      <p>2. Where not already provided for by existing legislative
      or other measures, each State Party to the present Covenant
      undertakes to take the necessary steps, in accordance with
      its constitutional processes and with the provisions of the
      present Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures
      as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized
      in the present Covenant.</p>

      <p>3. Each State Party to the present Covenant
      undertakes:</p>

      <blockquote>

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognized are violated
        shall have an effective remedy,<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notwithstanding that the
        violation has been committed by persons<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acting in an official
        capacity;<br />
        <br />


        <p>(b) To ensure that any person claiming such a remedy
        shall have his right<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thereto determined by
        competent judicial, administrative or<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legislative authorities, or
        by any other competent authority provided<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for by the legal system of
        the State, and to develop the<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibilities of judicial
        remedy;</p>

        enforce such remedies when granted.</p>

      their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in

      any of the fundamental human rights recognized or existing in
      any State Party to the present Covenant pursuant to law,
