        <h2>CONSENT</h2>

        <p class="author"><b>Rowine H. Brown, M. D., author for the
        Task Force.</b></p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
         

        <p class="text2">A long-established legal principle holds
        that a person has a right not to have his body touched by
        another. If a physician touches any part of the patient's
        body with or without instruments during treatment - without
        authority - he may be prosecuted criminally or sued for
        damages in a civil action. Court decisions to this effect
        go back beyond the present century. <span
        class="yellow">Historically, the law has always required
        specific consent by the patient to all operative
        procedures. The greater the potential risk, the greater the
        duty of the physician to inform the patient concerning
        them, so the patient can decide which risks he wants to
        assume.</span> The patient makes the final decision about
        whether to take a chance with the treatment or operation
        recommended by the physician or risk the consequences.</p>

        <p class="text2">Generalities concerning consent are
        difficult to define when the involved patients are infants
        or minors, who may be incompetent and are not legally
        empowered, without guardian consent, to make serious
        decisions regarding their bodies. In such instances, the
        parent, next of kin, or guardian is legally required to
        give consent. The physician should also be aware of the
        ever increasing numbers of state statutes which empower
        some classes of minors - or minors in some specific
        situations - to give their consent.</p>

        <p class="section"><b>INFORMED CONSENT</b></p>

        <p class="text2">One rapidly changing and expanding law
        which is currently inflicting a massive impact on medical
        professional liability is informed consent. Approximately
        ten years ago, the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas in
        one of its opinions coined the phrase "informed consent,"
        which is a facet of the newly discovered basic human right
        termed "the right to know." The patient must now be given
        an opportunity to be informed of matters which are relevant
        to the care he is about to receive. This means explanation
        of risks, alterative procedures, and other related matters,
        including the benefits to be derived and the hazards to be
        endured if the patient refuses to undergo the recommended
        treatment. <span class="yellow">The pediatrician now has a
        duty to explain to patients and parents the nature and
        risks of procedures which he feels are essential to the
        health and welfare of the child.</span> He should make an
        entry on the medical record that such an explanation was
        made, and how the child (if old enough to understand) and
        the parent responded.</p>

        <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Informed consent is a
        rule of law which adds another legal burden to the practice
        of medicine and as such results in more exposure to
        liability.</span> Because the doctrine of informed consent
        is of recent origin, guidelines have not yet been developed
        by court decisions or by statute, but, they are slowly
        evolving and should be reported in medical media.</p>

        <p class="text2">Recommendations for the "protection of
        human subjects" are being considered by the Department of
        Health, Education, and Welfare. Its proposed guidelines
        recommend that no research be conducted without informed
        consent, and that consent committees be developed to
        monitor this requirement.</p>

        <p class="text2">Consent forms have been developed and are
        use in many private offices and hospitals. When a multitude
        of specific forms have been devised, searching for the
        correct form and getting it properly signed and witnessed
        may become burdensome and outside the realistic function of
        the physician. Regardless of any inconvenience or
        annoyance, the correct consent form must be obtained. <span
        class="yellow">Titling a form "informed consent form" and
        having it signed and even witnessed, does not always
        indicate to he judge and/or jury that "informed consent"
        was actually obtained. Signatures on such a document may
        carry little weight when the significance of the document
        is challenged in court.</span> Therefore, a dated entry on
        the medical record is good defensive evidence.</p>

        <p class="section"><b>MINORS</b></p>

        <p class="text2">As a general rule, treatment of a minor
        requires the consent of the parent or guardian, except in
        an emergency when effective treatment is imperative and
        delay would involve serious risk to the life or limb of the
        patient. In such an emergency situation, a minor may
        usually give his own consent. The rule of thumb in applying
        for parental consent is the feasibility of obtaining such
        consent, weighed against the necessity of urgent treatment
        for the child. The physician is the sole judge of this.
        Documentation about the state of the emergency must be
        available; and the physician should enter appropriate
        justification on the medical record. A concurring opinion
        by a second physician would be beneficial.</p>

        <p class="text2">Minors in need of treatment who are
        married, pregnant, or emancipated (which here means living
        on their won) may give valid consent for their medical or
        surgical care under some statutes. These minors may also
        consent to treatment for their children.</p>

        <p class="text2">Some courts have held that a minor's
        consent is sufficient if he is mature enough to understand
        the full significance of the contemplated treatment. Age is
        not always a true criterion of maturity or intelligence.
        There seems to be no sound justification for denying a
        minor who is mature enough to comprehend the nature and
        consequences of the procedure the right to accept or reject
        treatment. Court rulings have permitted minors of mature
        judgment to give their consent to therapy, even for
        nonemergency conditions including "nose- bobbing" and
        removal of disfiguring lesions (such as those of Von
        Recklinghausen's disease).</p>

        <p class="section"><b>STATUTORY LAW REGARDING
        MINORS</b></p>

        <p class="text2">In recent years many statutes have been
        enacted in which the rights of minors to treatment on their
        consent have been specified. This trend will continue. For
        example, the legislatures in 25 states have enacted
        specific statutes which permit minors over the age of 12
        years to give consent for treatment of venereal disease
        and/or drug abuse. Notification to their parents is not
        required. By statutory provisions, at least 40 other states
        now permit medical examination and medical treatment of
        "certain categories of minors without parental consent." In
        addition, 11 states have broadened the rights of minors and
        allow them to give consent to obtain contraceptive services
        without parental consent. These last-mentioned court
        decisions and statutes demonstrate the judicial and
        legislative trends toward freeing understanding minors to
        obtain medical assistance on their own and allowing
        physicians to provide assistance without fear of a possible
        malpractice action because of lack of consent. These court
        rulings and legislative acts also demonstrate the
        flexibility of the law makers when there is a specific
        goal, such as eradication of venereal disease or drug
        abuse.</p>

        <p class="text2">Considering the diversity of statutory law
        in the various states, the paucity of appellate and supreme
        court decisions, and rapidly evolving local changes, a
        reasonable safeguard for physicians in all elective cases
        would be to get written consent for surgery or treatment
        from any minor 13 years of age or older in addition to that
        of the parent.</p>

        <p class="text2">It is suggested that consent to research
        procedures should be obtained from all children over the
        age of 7 years (the earliest age the law considers that a
        child could form a specific intent). It is also wise to
        include a provision that the procedure will be verbally
        explained to the minor and his wishes respected. His
        consent form may assure the parent that a study not
        specifically essential to the child will be discontinued if
        the child exhibits fear or resistance.</p>

        <p class="text2">No reported legal cases indicate that
        consent of both parents is required prior to treating a
        minor. <span class="yellow">If a controversy exists between
        the parents relative to the treatment, the physician should
        attempt to secure the consent of both.</span> When the
        parents are separated or divorced, the physician should
        obtain the consent of the parent with the legal custody, or
        one in loco parentis (acting as parent).</p>

        <p class="section"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>

        <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Consent must be
        obtained prior to the institution of medical or surgical
        treatment.</span> Pediatricians should be kept informed
        concerning court decisions and statutes relative to consent
        and minors.</p>
