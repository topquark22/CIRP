      <h2>Informed Consent, Parental Permission, and Assent in
      Pediatric Practice</h2>

      <h3>Committee on Bioethics</h3>
    </center>

    <div class="intro">
      <p class="text"><i>The statement on informed consent,
      parental permission, and patient assent has a long and
      extraordinary history. The first draft of this document,
      prepared by William G. Bartholome, MD, was presented to the
      original American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on
      Bioethics in 1985. Bill put his soul into the manuscript and
      has watched over it carefully ever since. Now, a decade
      later, those who have worked on its continued development and
      urged its adoption as Academy policy applaud its publication.
      No one is more gratified than its primary author and
      champion. Those who have had the privilege to know Dr
      Bartholome share his sense of accomplishment, but cannot help
      but experience a cruel sense of irony. Just as the work Bill
      considers his most important contribution has become
      available for public appreciation, Dr Bartholome suffers from
      a serious illness that threatens his life.</i></p>

      <p class="text"><i>Bill always wanted "the experience,
      perspective, and power of children" to be taken most
      seriously. Through the years of the statement's revisions and
      re-presentation within the Academy, Bill "had faith in the
      power of the text and the ideas it contained, ... that its
      time would come." The statement embodies Bill Bartholome's
      dedication to children. Throughout his career, he worked to
      make medicine and medical research safer and more friendly
      for children. The AAP and its Committee on Bioethics, on
      behalf of all our colleagues, extend heartful thanks to Dr
      William G. Bartholome for helping us more fully appreciate
      that children are in the process of becoming, in his words,
      "intelligent, observant, capable, and responsible persons"
      who deserve our utmost respect.</i></p>

        <h4>AN OVERVIEW</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">Since the 1976 publication of an AAP policy
      statement on the legal concept of informed consent in
      pediatric practice, the concept has evolved and become more
      formal.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> A better understanding
      now exists as to how physicians should collaborate with
      patients and parents in making these decisions. Patients
      should participate in decision-making commensurate with their
      development; they should provide assent to care whenever
      reasonable. <span class="yellow">Parents and physicians
      should not exclude children and adolescents from
      decision-making without persuasive reasons.</span> Indeed,
      some patients have specific legal entitlements to either
      consent or to refuse medical intervention. Although
      physicians should seek parental permission in most
      situations, they must focus on the goal of providing
      appropriate care and be prepared to seek legal intervention
      when parental refusal places the patient at clear and
      substantial risk.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> In cases of
      serious conflict, physicians and families should seek
      consultative assistance and only in rare circumstances look
      to judicial determinations.</p>

      <p class="text">We now realize that the doctrine of "informed
      consent" has only limited <i>direct</i> application in
      pediatrics. Only <b>patients</b> who have appropriate
      decisional capacity and legal empowerment can give their
      <b>informed consent</b> to medical care. In all other
      situations, <span class="yellow">parents or other surrogates
      provide <b>informed permission</b> for diagnosis and
      treatment of children with the <b>assent</b> of the child
      whenever appropriate.</span></p>

      <p class="text">In this statement, the AAP provides an
      updated analysis of 1) the concept of informed consent; 2)
      the ethics of informed consent and the concept of the right
      to refuse treatment; 3) the concept of "proxy consent"; 4)
      the concepts of parental permission and child assent; and 5)
      informed consent of adolescents.</p>

      <center>
        <h4>CHANGES IN MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">The authority to make medical decisions used
      to lie squarely in the hands of physicians. However, complex
      social changes have resulted in acceptance of the idea that
      patients have a right to know about their health, to know
      about available diagnostic and treatment options and their
      risks and probable benefits, and to choose among the
      altematives.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Many now regard
      traditional practices based on the theory that ``doctor knows
      best'' as unacceptably paternalistic.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Society recognizes that patients or
      their surrogates have a right to decide, in consultation with
      their physicians, which proposed medical interventions they
      will or will not accept. Decision-making power or authority
      is increasingly seen as something to be shared by equal
      partners in the physician-patient or physician-surrogate
      relationship. For many patients and family members, personal
      values affect health care decisions, and physicians have a
      duty to respect the autonomy, rights, and preferences of
      their patients and their surrogates.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <h4>ETHICS AND INFORMED CONSENT</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">The doctrine of informed consent reminds us
      to respect persons by fully and accurately providing
      information relevant to exercising their decision-making
      rights. Experts on informed consent include at least the
      following elements in their discussions of the
      concept:<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Provision of information: patients should have
        explanations, in understandable language, of the nature of
        the ailment or condition; the nature of proposed diagnostic
        steps and/or treatment(s) and the probability of their
        success; the existence and nature of the risks involved;
        <span class="yellow">and the existence, potential benefits,
        and risks of recommended alternative treatments (including
        the choice of no treatment).</span></li>

        <li>Assessment of the patient's understanding of the above
        information.</li>

        <li>Assessment, if only tacit, of the capacity of the
        patient or surrogate to make the necessary
        decision(s).</li>

        <li>Assurance, insofar as is possible, that the patient has
        the freedom to choose among the medical alternatives
        without coercion or manipulation.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text">The goals of this consent process include the
      development of the patient's comprehensive understanding of
      the clinical situation, and the timely exercise, by the
      patient, of active choices regarding the
      circumstances.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <h4>INFORMED CONSENT AND THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">Health care providers should engage in the
      process of informed consent with patients before undertaking
      any medical intervention. Patients generally have a moral and
      legal right to refuse proposed medical intervention, except
      when the patient has diminished decision-making capacity or
      must undergo legally authorized ``involuntary'' treatment.
      Respect for competent patients' autonomy ordinarily extends
      even to the refusal or discontinuation of their own
      life-sustaining treatment.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <h4>PROBLEMS WITH THE CONCEPT OF ``CONSENT'' BY PROXY</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">In attempting to adapt the concept of
      informed consent to pediatrics, many believe that the child's
      parents or guardians have the authority or "right" to give
      consent by proxy. Most parents seek to safeguard the welfare
      and best interests of their children with regard to health
      care, and as a result proxy consent has seemed to work
      reasonably well.</p>

      <p class="text">However, the concept encompasses many
      ambiguities. Consent embodies judgments about proposed
      interventions and, more importantly, consent (literally "to
      feel or sense with") expresses something for one's self: a
      person who consents responds based on unique personal
      beliefs, values, and goals.</p>

      <p class="text">Thus "proxy consent" poses serious problems
      for pediatric health care providers. <span
      class="yellow">Such providers have legal and ethical duties
      to their child patients to render competent medical care
      based on what the patient needs, not what someone else
      expresses.</span> Although impasses regarding the interests
      of minors and the expressed wishes of their parents or
      guardians are rare, <span class="yellow">the pediatrician's
      responsibilities to his or her patient exist independent of
      parental desires or proxy consent.</span><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <h4>PARENTAL PERMISSION AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">Decision-making involving the health care of
      young patients should flow from responsibility shared by
      physicians and parents. Practitioners should seek the
      informed permission of parents before medical interventions
      (except in emergencies when parents cannot be contacted). The
      informed permission of parents includes all of the elements
      of standard informed consent, as outlined previously.</p>

      <p class="text">Usually, parental permission articulates what
      most agree represents the ``best interests of the child.''
      However, the Academy acknowledges that this standard of
      decision-making does not always prove easy to define. In a
      pluralistic society, one can find many religious, social,
      cultural, and philosophic positions on what constitutes
      acceptable child rearing and child welfare. The law generally
      provides parents with wide discretionary authority in raising
      their children.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">Nonetheless, the need for child abuse and
      neglect laws and procedures makes it clear that parents
      sometimes breach their obligations toward their
      children.</span> Providers of care and services to children
      have to carefully justify the invasion of privacy and
      psychologic disruption that come with taking legal steps to
      override parental prerogatives.</p>

      <center>
        <h4>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD AS PERSON AND THE CONCEPT
        OF ASSENT</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">Decision-making involving the health care of
      older children and adolescents should include, to the
      greatest extent feasible, the <b>assent of the patient</b> as
      well as the participation of the parents and the physician.
      Pediatricians should not necessarily treat children as
      rational, autonomous decision makers, but they should give
      serious consideration to each patient's developing capacities
      for participating in decision-making, including rationality
      and autonomy. If physicians recognize the importance of
      <b>assent,</b> they empower children to the extent of their
      capacity.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Even in situations
      in which one should not and does not solicit the agreement or
      opinion of patients, involving them in discussions about
      their health care may foster trust and a better
      physician-patient relationship, and perhaps improve long-term
      health outcomes.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Assent</b> should include at least the
      following elements:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Helping the patient achieve a developmentally
        appropriate awareness of the nature of his or her
        condition.</li>

        <li>Telling the patient what he or she can expect with
        tests and treatment(s).</li>

        <li>Making a clinical assessment of the patients
        understanding of the situation and the factors influencing
        how he or she is responding (including whether there is
        inappropriate pressure to accept testing or therapy).</li>

        <li>Soliciting an expression of the patient's willingness
        to accept the proposed care. Regarding this final point, we
        note that no one should solicit a patient's views without
        intending to weigh them seriously. In situations in which
        the patient will have to receive medical care despite his
        or her objection, the patient should be told that fact and
        should not be deceived.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text">As children develop, they should gradually
      become the primary guardians of personal health and the
      primary partners in medical decision-making, assuming
      responsibility from their parents.</p>

      <p class="text">Just as is the case with informed consent,
      the emphasis on obtaining assent should be on the interactive
      process in which information and values are shared and joint
      decisions are made. The Academy does not in any way recommend
      the development of new bureaucratic mechanisms, such as
      ``assent forms,'' which could never substitute for the
      relational aspects of consent or assent.</p>

      <center>
        <h4>THE PATIENT'S REFUSAL TO ASSENT (DISSENT)</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">There are clinical situations in which a
      persistent refusal to assent (ie, dissent) may be ethically
      binding.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> This seems most
      obvious in the context of research (particularly that which
      has no potential to directly benefit the patient).<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> <span class="yellow">A patient's
      reluctance or refusal to assent should also carry
      considerable weight when the proposed intervention is not
      essential to his or her welfare and/or can be deferred
      without substantial risk.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Medical personnel should respect the wishes
      of patients who withhold or temporarily refuse assent in
      order to gain a better understanding of their situation or to
      come to terms with fears or other concerns regarding proposed
      care. Coercion in diagnosis or treatment is a last
      resort.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <h4>ETHICAL CONFLICT AND ITS RESOLUTION</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">Social forces tend to concentrate authority
      for health care decisions in the hands of physicians and
      parents and this tendency diminishes the moral status of
      children.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Thus, those who
      care for children need to provide for measures to solicit
      assent and to attend to possible abuses of ``raw'' power over
      children when ethical conflicts occur. This is particularly
      important regarding the initiation, withholding, or
      withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16,17</a></sup> Examples of mechanisms to resolve
      ethical conflicts include additional medical consultation(s);
      short-term counseling or psychiatric consultation for patient
      and/or family; ``case management'' or similar
      multidisciplinary conference(s); and/or consultation with
      individuals trained in clinical ethics or a hospital-based
      ethics committee. In rare cases of refractory disagreement,
      formal legal adjudication may be necessary.</p>

      <center>
        <h4>LEGAL EMANCIPATION AND INFORMED CONSENT</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">The traditional notion of informed consent
      clearly applies to patients who have reached the legal age of
      majority, except when the patient has been determined to be
      incompetent. In addition, laws designate two settings in
      which minors have sole authority to make health care
      decisions.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> First, certain
      minors are deemed ``emancipated'' and treated as adults for
      all purposes. Definitions of the emancipated minor include
      those who are: 1) self-supporting and/or not living at home;
      2) married; 3) pregnant or a parent; 4) in the military; or
      5) declared to be emancipated by a court. Second, many states
      give decision-making authority (without the need for parental
      involvement) to some minors who are otherwise unemancipated
      but who have decision-making capacity (``mature minors'') or
      who are seeking treatment for certain medical conditions,
      such as sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and drug or
      alcohol abuse.<sup><a href="#n17">18</a></sup> The situations
      in which minors are deemed to be totally or partially
      emancipated are defined by statute and case law and may vary
      from state to state.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Legal
      emancipation recognizes a special status (eg, independent
      living) or serious public and/or individual health problems
      that might not otherwise receive appropriate attention (eg,
      sexually transmitted disease).</p>

      <center>
        <h4>PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">The following illustrations may help
      practitioners when applying the concepts developed above.
      These examples are intended to provide a focus for discussion
      and clarification and do not suggest new legal standards for
      pediatric practice.</p>

      <p class="text">In cases involving the following kinds of
      medical care for infants and young children, the Academy
      encourages physicians to seek the <b>informed permission of
      the parents</b> before: 1) providing immunizations; 2)
      performing invasive diagnostic testing for a congenital
      cardiac defect; 3) beginning long-term anticonvulsant therapy
      to control a seizure disorder; 4) initiating serial casting
      to correct congenital ``clubfoot''; or 5) undertaking
      surgical removal of a ``suspicious'' neck mass.</p>

      <p class="text">Even in pressing situations, informed
      permission should be sought for actions such as performing a
      lumbar puncture to evaluate the possibility of meningitis.
      (In this situation, if parents deny permission for the
      procedure, one should obtain permission from the parents to
      initiate treatment based on reasonable clinical judgment,
      rather than delaying care or risking liability for performing
      the lumbar puncture without appropriate authorization).</p>

      <p class="text">In cases involving the following kinds of
      medical care for older school-age children, the Academy
      encourages physicians to seek the <b>assent of the
      patient</b> as well as the <b>informed permission of the
      parents:</b> 1) venipuncture for a diagnostic study in a
      nine-year-old; 2) diagnostic testing for recurrent abdominal
      pain in a 10-year-old; 3) psychotropic medication to control
      an attention-deficit disorder in a third grader; 4) an
      orthopedic device to manage scoliosis in an 11-year-old; 5)
      an ``alarm'' system to treat nocturnal enuresis in an
      eight-year-old; or 6) surgical repair of a malformed ear in a
      12-year-old. In some cases, treatment may proceed over the
      objection of the patient. However, physicians and parents
      should realize that overruling the child may undermine their
      relationship(s) with the child.</p>

      <p class="text">In situations such as the following that
      involve adolescents and young adults, the Academy encourages
      physicians to obtain the <b>informed consent</b> of the
      patient, in most instances: 1) performance of a pelvic
      examination in a 16-year-old; 2) diagnostic evaluation of
      recurrent headache in an 18-year-old; 3) a request for oral
      contraceptives for fertility control in a 17-year-old; 4)
      proposed long-term oral antibiotics administration for severe
      acne in a 15-year-old; or 5) surgical intervention for a bone
      tumor in a 19-year-old. Such patients frequently have
      decision-making capacity and the legal authority to accept or
      reject interventions, and, in that event, no additional
      requirement to obtain parental permission exists. However,
      the Academy encourages parental involvement in such cases, as
      appropriate.</p>

      <p class="text">Review of the limited relevant empirical data
      suggests that adolescents, especially those age 14 and older,
      may have as well developed decisional skills as adults for
      making informed health care decisions.<sup><a
      href="#20">20-22</a></sup> Ethical and legal factors, (ie,
      confidentiality and/or privacy), suggest that the physician
      involve parents after appropriate discussion with the
      adolescent elicits his or her permission to do so. In some
      cases in which the patient has no legal entitlement to
      authorize treatment, the physician may have a legal
      obligation in some jurisdictions to obtain <b>parental
      permission</b> or to notify parents in addition to obtaining
      the patient's consent. An adolescent's refusal of consent in
      cases such as these may well be legally (and ethically)
      binding. If ``conflict resolution'' fails, formal, legal
      adjudication may be needed.</p>

      <center>
        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text">A re-analysis of informed consent leads to
      the identification of important limitations and problems in
      its application to pediatric practice. Two additional
      concepts are needed: <b>parental permission</b> and
      <b>patient assent.</b> The American Academy of Pediatrics
      believes that in most cases, physicians have an ethical (and
      legal) obligation to obtain <b>parental permission</b> to
      undertake recommended medical interventions. In many
      circumstances, physicians should also solicit a <b>patient
      assent</b> when developmentally appropriate. In cases
      involving emancipated or mature minors with adequate
      decision-making capacity, or when otherwise permitted by law,
      physicians should seek <b>informed consent</b> directly from
