      <h1>Circumcision: A Medical or a Human Rights Issue?</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>

      <p>American parents and health care professionals are faced
      with medical/ethical dilemmas regarding whether or not to
      respect the natural integrity of the male newborn's body. In
      the English- speaking countries,, where circumcision of
      infants was initially adopted to prevent masturbation,
      medical "reasons" were postulated to justify a practice most
      of the world has never considered. This resulted in a
      spectrum of medical recommendations for surgical removal of
      normal genital tissue in all male newborns to prevent
      diseases (foreskin inflammation, urinary tract infections,
      and sexually transmitted diseases) that could be effectively
      treated medically without the risks of surgery. Only by
      denying the existence of excruciating pain, perinatal
      encoding of the brain with violence, interruption of
      maternal-infant bonding, betrayal of infant trust, the risks
      and effects of permanently altering normal genitalia, the
      right of human beings to sexually intact and functional
      bodies, and the right to individual religious freedoms can
      human beings continue this practice.</p>

      <blockquote>
        These, then, are the human genitals. Considering their
        great delicacy, complexity and sensitivity, one might
        imagine that an intelligent species like man would leave
        them alone. Sadly, this has never been the case. For
        thousands of years, in many different cultures, the
        genitals have fallen victim to an amazing variety of
        mutilations and restrictions. For organs that are capable
        of giving us an immense amount of pleasure, they have been
        given an inordinate amount of pain.-- Desmond Morris (<a
        href="#n1">1</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p>While some researchers believe that circumcision was
      practiced as early as 6,000 years ago on the west coast of
      Africa, the earliest record of circumcision, an Egyptian bas
      relief, dates back to 2800BC (<a href="#n2">2</a>). Theories
      suggest that circumcision was practiced for religious
      reasons, as a punitive measure, as a puberty or premarital
      rite, as an absolution against the feared toxic influences of
      vaginal (hymenal) blood, and as a mark of slavery. Written
      documentation of circumcision first appears in the Bible.
      Both Jews and Moslems circumcise in accordance with Abraham's
      covenant with God <a
      href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Gen+17">(Genesis
      17:10),</a> which historians date to 1713 BC (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>). Moslems also perform female circumcision
      (genital mutilation that often includes clitoridectomy), a
      practice probably of African origin (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>).</p>

      <h3>From myth to medicine</h3>

      <p>Circumcision evolved from a religious ritual or puberty
      rite into routine surgery for "health" reasons in the
      English-speaking countries during the nineteenth century when
      the etiology of most diseases was unknown: "Within the miasma
      of myth and ignorance, a theory emerged that masturbation
      caused many and varied ills. It seemed logical to some
      physicians to perform genital surgery on both sexes to stop
      masturbation" (<a href="#n5">5</a>). In 1891, P. C.
      Remondino, MD, advocated circumcision to prevent or cure
      alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, hernia, gout, rheumatism,
      curvature of the spine and headaches (<a href="#n6">6</a>).
      His book was last printed in 1974, the same year that one
      physician, writing in <i>Medical Aspects of Human
      Sexuality</i>, called the book "pertinent and carefully
      thought out" (<a href="#n7">7</a>).</p>

      <p>As scientific advancements found legitimate pathologic
      etiologies for diseases previously believed to be prevented
      or cured by circumcision, new excuses were adopted to
      substantiate this elective genital surgery. Since the turn of
      the century, one excuse after another has been used to
      perpetuate a practice most of the world has never
      considered.</p>

      <p>Hygiene and prevention of venereal diseases became popular
      excuses for circumcision during World War I (<a href="#n8">8,
      9</a>). The erroneous fear during the 1930s of foreskins
      causing penile cancer (<a href="#n10">10, 11</a>) and during
      the 1950s of foreskins causing cervical cancer (<a
      href="#n12">12-14</a>) helped champion the practice of
      prophylactic circumcision. The most recent justifications for
      routine neonatal circumcision of boys include protecting
      infants from urinary tract infections (UTIs) during the first
      year of life (<a href="#n15">15, 16</a>) and decreasing the
      risk of AIDS in the sexually active male (<a
      href="#n17">17</a>). While the American medical community was
      presenting one pathology after another to support amputation
      of the foreskin, its European counterpart began to research
      the normal structure and function of the external male
      genitalia.</p>

      <h3>Anatomy and physiology offer new insight</h3>

      <p>Medical enlightenment began in 1949 with publication in
      the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of Dr. Douglas Gairdner's
      classic article, <a href="/library/general/gairdner/">"The
      Fate of the Foreskin"</a> (<a href="#n18">18</a>). Gairdner
      declared that the foreskin is normal, healthy tissue, and its
      adherence to the glans (head of the penis) by a common
      epithelium (synechia) serves the important function of
      protecting the glans penis from urine and feces in infancy
      and early childhood. Subsequently, the British National
      Health Service discontinued payment for the surgery and the
      practice ceased.</p>

      <p>Following this study, <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Dr. Jacob Oster</a>, a Danish
      medical officer who conducted a longitudinal study with
      nearly 10,000 observations, reported that the continuous,
      shared epithelium of the foreskin and glans penis separates
      spontaneously during childhood. He stressed that this natural
      process, should never be interfered with, and is usually
      complete by the age of 18 (<a href="#n19">19</a>). In his
      published study, he quoted Sir James Spence:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The anatomists have not studied the form and the evolution
        of the preputial orifice...they do not understand that
        Nature does not intend it to be stretched or
        retracted...What looks like a pinpoint opening at 7 months
        becomes a wide channel of communication at 17."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Not until the national circumcision rate had reached 85%
      to 90% (26 years and millions of circumcised babies later)
      did the American medical community finally issue an official
      statement regarding circumcision. In 1975, the American
      Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Ad Hoc Task Force Committee on
      Circumcision declared "There is no absolute medical
      indication for routine circumcision of the newborn" (<a
      href="#n20">20</a>). By the end of the 1970s, the American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had concurred (<a
      href="#n21">21</a>).</p>

      <p>A 1984 AAP pamphlet, "Care of the Uncircumcised Penis,"
      shed new light on the subject. The section on the function of
      the foreskin read:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by
        urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with
        circumcision, this protection is lost. In such cases, the
        glans and especially the urinary opening (meatus) may
        become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis
        (inflammation of the meatus), and meatal stenosis (a
        narrowing of the urinary opening). Such problems virtually
        never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects
        the glans throughout life. (<a href="#n22">22</a>)
      </blockquote>
      This pamphlet was, in fact, damning of a medical community
      that, after having made an oath to "do no harm," was
      admittedly causing problems in boys with normal penises. But,
      rather than respond to the apparent need to cease performing
      a surgery that was responsible for identifiable iatrogenic
      disorders, in 1986 the AAP revised its publication, excluding
      this litigiously provocative paragraph. Information important
      for helping parents make informed choices had been deleted. 

      <h3>From informed consent to human rights issues</h3>

      <p>Informed consent and self-determination for childbearing-
      childrearing health care were an essential component of the
      cataclysmic changes brought about by the Women's Movement.
      American women who had struggled to achieve these rights for
      themselves were now beginning to consider rights for their
      babies as well. The need to defend the baby's right to a
      peaceful beginning was brought to light by Dr. Frederick
      Leboyer in his landmark work, Birth Without Violence (<a
      href="#n23">23</a>). This French obstetrician acknowledged
      the importance of a nonviolent birth coupled with a gentle
      newborn experience because he recognized the long-term impact
      that these early experiences have on emotional and
      psychological development. Many healthcare providers,
      including certified nurse-midwives (CNMs), responded to this
      need by performing gentle births.</p>

      <p>The obvious contradiction of a gentle birth versus a
      painful newborn circumcision placed health care providers in
      a precarious position. With informed consent an issue, words
      that were once used euphemistically to describe circumcision
      now left parents feeling betrayed (<a href="#n24">24,
      25</a>). Parents who watched their newborns being circumcised
      were horrified and considered themselves deceived by the
      dishonest portrayal of a surgery they had been led to believe
      was minor, necessary, and minimally painful (<a
      href="#n26">26</a>). Health care providers themselves were
      often uninformed and unaware of the findings or proclamations
      of their own professional organizations. Those who questioned
      the ethics of circumcision and wanted to provide adequate
      information for an informed choice were often intimidated by
      employers who endorsed the practice.</p>

      <h3>National and international organizations are born</h3>

      <p>In response to consumer demand for accurate information,
      the National Organization of Circumcision Information
      Resource Centers (NOCIRC) was founded in 1985. This
      organization serves as a clearinghouse for information on all
      aspects of male and female circumcision. In 1989, NOCIRC
      sponsored the First International Symposium on Circumcision
      (ISC), which was held in Anaheim, California. International
      experts from the diverse fields of cultural anthropology,
      theology, psychology, medicine, midwifery, law, and ethics
      gathered to discuss male and female genital mutilations and
      their human rights implications.</p>

      <p><a href="/pages/intactivist/declaration/">The Declaration
      of the First ISC was unanimously adopted by the general
      assembly on March 3, 1989.</a> The first tenets of this
      declaration read:</p>

      <blockquote>
        We recognize the inherent right of all human beings to an
        intact body. Without religious or racial prejudice, we
        affirm this basic human right. 

        <p>We recognize the foreskin, clitoris and labia are
        normal, functional body parts.</p>

        <p>Parents and/or guardians do not have the right to
        consent to the surgical removal or modification of their
        children's normal genitalia.</p>

        <p>Physicians and other health-care providers have a
        responsibility to refuse to remove or mutilate normal body
        parts.</p>

        <p>The only persons who may consent to medically
        unnecessary procedures upon themselves are the individuals
        who have reached the age of consent (adulthood), and then
        only after being fully informed about the risks and
        benefits of the procedure.</p>

        <p>We categorically state that circumcision has
        unrecognized victims.</p>
      </blockquote>
      The last tenet states: 

      <blockquote>
        Physicians who practice routine circumcision are violating
        the first maxim of medical practice, "PRIMUM NON NOCERE,"
        "First Do No Harm," and anyone practicing genital
        mutilation is violating Article V of the United Nations
        Declaration of Human Rights: "NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECTED TO
        TORTURE OR TO CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING TREATMENT..."
        (<a href="#n27">27</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p>Representatives from nine nations attended the Second ISC
      in San Francisco in the Spring of 1991. Dr. Benjamin Spock,
      one of America's best-known pediatricians, was honored with
      and accepted the first Human Rights Award of the ISC for
      reversing his position on this issue: "My own preference, if
      I had the good fortune to have another son, would be to leave
      his little penis alone" (<a href="#n28">28</a>). The practice
      of genital mutilation of females in Africa was addressed by
      Dr. Asha Mohamud, an African pediatrician. Today, 100 million
      females, including young girls and infants, suffer the
      effects of this debilitating surgery. And now, with increased
      African immigration, American health care providers are faced
      with clinically caring for infibulated women (<a
      href="#n29">29</a>) and requests to infibulate their
      daughters.</p>

      <p>The ISC is an international forum, networking with Women's
      International Network News (WIN News) and the Inter-African
      Committee to abolish the myths of genital mutilation of both
      males and females in defense of body ownership rights of all
      the world's children. The greatest tool of the ISC and
      related international groups is truth because of the many
      myths which still prevail.</p>

      <h3>Biases influence interpretation of scientific data
      base</h3>

      <p>Circumcision has a strong irrational bias that seeks
      validation, and many parents and health care providers
      continue to believe the old myths or to conjure up new ones.
      After reviewing current studies, which admittedly were
      "retrospective," "may have methodologic flaws," and often
      contain "conflicting evidence," the AAP broadened its 1975
      policy. Their new 1989 position statement, ironically
      released just three days after the adoption of the
      Declaration of the First ISC, states "Newborn circumcision
      has potential medical benefits and advantages as well as
      disadvantages and risks" (<a href="#n30">30</a>). And, it
      went on to say, "...parents should be fully informed of the
      possible benefits and potential risks..." But, the AAP failed
      to mention that the health benefits of maintaining the
      normal, intact male genitalia far outweigh any "potential"
      benefits or the known risks of neonatal circumcision. Left
      with this meager AAP guideline, health care providers must
      take it upon themselves to become educated in order to
      provide legally correct and accurate information.</p>

      <p>To teach the parameters of normal genitalia adequately and
      effectively, health care professionals must first recognize
      and overcome personal bias regarding intact genitalia and the
      myths of circumcision. Dr. James DeMeo's broad cultural
      perspective gives insight:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Simply put, all forms of male genital mutilation to include
        infant circumcision, are ancient blood rituals associated
        with primitive religion and absolution of the male...The
        ritual has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with
        medicine, health, or science in practically all cases. The
        fact that so many circumcised American men, and mothers,
        nurses, and obstetricians are ready to defend the practice
        in the face of contrary epidemiological evidence is a
        certain give-away to hidden, unconscious motives and
        disturbed emotional feelings about the penis and sexual
        matters in general. This is not a small point, as before
        such painful and traumatic mutilations can be perceived as
        "good" and be championed by both high caste priests and
        average people alike, certain other antisexual and
        antichild social factors must already be present and
        thriving.(<a href="#n2">2</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <h3>From medicine to myth</h3>

      <p>Addressing the myths used to "defend the practice in the
      face of contrary epidemiological evidence" may not convince
      those with "unconscious motives and disturbed emotional
      feelings about the penis and sexual matters in general," but
      it will serve to educate those who are brave enough to face
      personal bias and seek to have the myths demystified. These,
      then, are the most prevalent myths of the day.</p>

      <p>MYTH: A circumcised penis is cleaner.</p>

      <p>FACT: Personal hygiene is a major justification for
      circumcision, yet the experience of 85% of the world's men
      who are intact indicates that the intact penis is easily
      cared for. Cleansing the intact penis is similar to cleansing
      intact labia and is simply a matter of common sense. During
      infancy, when the foreskin and glans are attached to one
      another, external washing with only warm water is all that is
      required. Once the foreskin and glans separate, retraction of
      the foreskin and washing with warm water are all that are
      necessary.</p>

      <blockquote>
        After the age of reason, one hopes that a boy who has
        already learned to tie his shoes can be cajoled into
        washing behind his ears and directed to clean his penis. It
        is painless, takes only a few seconds, and when it takes
        any longer is probably associated with a smile.--Leonard J.
        Marino, MD (<a href="#n31">31</a>)
      </blockquote>
      The AAP itself refuted this myth by saying, "...good personal
      hygiene would offer all the advantages of routine
      circumcision without the attendant surgical risk" (<a
      href="#n32">32</a>). 

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision is minor surgery.</p>

      <p>FACT: "Minor surgery is one that is performed on someone
      else," says Stanford University Medical School Professor, Dr.
      Eugene Robin. Circumcision, like all surgery, has inherent
      risks, which include hemorrhage, infection, mutilation, and
      death. And, although neonatal circumcision is the most
      commonly performed routine surgical procedure in America
      today, we have no accurate statistics on the resultant
      complications or deaths. In 1985, two Atlanta boys lost their
      penises and, adding insult to injury, doctors subjected one
      boy to a sex reassignment. He will live the remainder of his
      life as a female (<a href="#n33">33</a>). That same year, two
      other boys were victims of staphylococcal infections, the
      port of entry was the circumcision wound. One boy died seven
      days after his birth from "scalded skin syndrome," the other
      is a blind, spastic quadriplegic (<a href="#n">34</a>).
      Circumcision is not a minor procedure and there are many
      unrecognized victims. Dr. Robin recommends, "If it ain't
      broke, don't fix it!" (<a href="#n35">35</a>).</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision prevents penile cancer.</p>

      <p>FACT: Penile cancer, which has been documented in both
      circumcised and intact men, is a rare disease of elderly men
      and one of the least common malignancies. It represents 0.5%
      of all cancers in men and occurs at "...a rate of less than
      one case per 100,000 per year in the United States" (<a
      href="#n36">36</a>). Dr. James Snyder, past President of the
      Virginia Urological Society, notes that the low incidence of
      penile cancer in the United States is not due to circumcision
      because "...the population of American men born before 1940,
      now in the group at risk for this cancer, is a group of
      predominantly UNCIRCUMCISED men" (<a href="#n36">36</a>).
      Research indicates that good hygiene prevents penile cancer
      and, according to Dr. Sydney Gellis, "It is an incontestable
      fact...there are more deaths from circumcision each year than
      from cancer of the penis" (<a href="#n37">37</a>).</p>

      <p>MYTH: Women with circumcised partners have a lower
      incidence of cervical cancer.</p>

      <p>FACT: Inaccurate studies of the 1950s are to blame for the
      erroneous idea that cervical cancer occurs in women because
      their sexual partners are intact (<a href="#n12">12-14</a>).
      According to Wallerstein, "Jewish women have a relatively low
      rate of cervical cancer, but Moslem women, whose husbands are
      circumcised in infancy, have a much higher rate. Parsis of
      India, who do not circumcise, have a lower cervical cancer
      rate than their Moslem neighbors, who do circumcise" (<a
      href="#n13">13</a>). According to the most recent AAP report,
      "...evidence linking uncircumcised men to cervical carcinoma
      is inconclusive. The strongest predisposing factors in
      cervical cancer are a history of intercourse at an early age
      and multiple sexual partners" (<a href="#n38">38</a>).</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision will decrease the risk of sexually
      transmitted diseases, including AIDS.</p>

      <p>FACT: There is an epidemic of sexually transmitted
      diseases, including AIDS, in the United States, where the
      majority of sexually active men are circumcised. It is not
      the foreskin that causes these diseases, and circumcision
      will not prevent them. "It is relatively more important to
      alter exposure to infectious agents than male susceptibility
      to them," wrote D. W. Cameron, MD, FRCP (personal
      correspondence to NOCIRC, January 7, 1991). Cameron's AIDS
      research (<a href="#n17">17</a>) was erroneously and
      alarmingly reported by newspapers across the country with
      headlines that read, "Circumcision decreases risk of AIDS."
      Obviously, it is contact with specific organisms that causes
      specific diseases, and it is education about safe sex, not
      amputation of healthy body parts of newborns, that is sane
      preventative medicine for sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision prevents urinary tract infection.</p>

      <p>FACT: The AAP reported that studies reflecting an increase
      in UTIs among intact boys are "retrospective," may have
      "methodologic flaws," and "may have been influenced by
      selection bias" (<a href="#n38">38</a>). The more recent
      research of statistician and pediatrician, Dr. Martin
      Altschul, refutes the earlier UTI studies (<a
      href="#n39">39</a>). New York pediatrician, Dr. Leonard J.
      Marino, agrees with Altschul:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Since one fourth of my male infant patients are not
        circumcised, and if the frequency of UTI in the
        uncircumcised is as high as it is said to be, I should be
        seeing many UTIs in male infants. If I'm missing the
        diagnosis, they somehow are getting better without
        treatment. My experience reinforces the practice of
        discouraging routine circumcision, a cause of more
        morbidity than benefit (<a href="#n40">40</a>).
      </blockquote>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision prevents phimosis.</p>

      <p>FACT: Phimosis (when the opening of the foreskin is so
      small that the foreskin cannot be retracted over the head of
      the penis) is normal in infancy (<a href="#n18">18, 19</a>)
      and is not an appropriate diagnosis before the age of 18 (<a
      href="#n19">19</a>). Furthermore, some men live their entire
      lives without being able to retract their foreskin, and
      "...it appears to conclude that the (preputial) space is kept
      moist and also clean in those with preputial stenosis by the
      secretions of the prostate, supplemented by the seminal
      secretion and the mucin content of the secretion of the
      urethral glands" (<a href="#n41">41</a>). The normal
      accumulation of sloughed epithelial cells (smegma) are lysed
      by these secretions. ("Smegma is probably the most maligned
      body substance. It is a normal, natural body product no more
      harmful than ear wax. It is definitely not a
      carcinogen...Adult smegma serves as a protective, lubricating
      function for the glans, just as adult smegma in women
      protects the clitoris" (<a href="#n41">42</a>). Some men with
      phimosis, who prefer to have a retractile foreskin, employ
      nonsurgical measures, i.e., gentle stretching, to achieve the
      desired goal as described below:</p>

      <blockquote>
        My parents let my foreskin loosen at its own slow rate. I
        was about 12 before my urethral meatus was visible and 16
        before I saw the corona of my glans. Even with this slow
        loosening of the foreskin, I never experienced irritation
        or inflammation. Before becoming sexually active, I spent a
        few minutes each day over a period of several months
        gradually stretching the foreskin by hand until it would
        easily retract.--(Personal correspondence to NOCIRC, March
        28, 1991).
      </blockquote>
      When scar tissue has formed at the preputial opening
      secondary to premature retraction or ammoniacal burns, there
      are surgical techniques (Y-V-plasties and Z-plasty) (<a
      href="#n43">43, 44</a>), which can be employed to make the
      foreskin retractable without amputating it. And if phimosis
      has been caused by a rare pathologic condition such as
      balanitis serotica obliterans, only the afflicted area need
      be removed. 

      <blockquote>
        Using the surgical treatment of circumcision to prevent
        phimosis is a little like preventing headaches by
        decapitation. It works but it is hardly a prudent form of
        treatment.--Eugene Robin, MD (<a href="#n35">35</a>).
      </blockquote>

      <p>MYTH: Intact boys will be teased in the locker room.</p>

      <p>FACT: Although this may have been an issue for a few boys
      when the circumcision rate in America was at its peak, the
      incidence of circumcision in the United States is steadily
      decreasing. The National Center for Health Statistics reports
      the national circumcision rate at less than 60%. In the
      western states, where 60% of the boys are now intact, the
      locker room scene has reversed. Circumcised boys have already
      begun to ask "Why am I different?" and "Why did you let them
      cut off part of my penis?" One man asked a friend if he felt
      "different" when he was the only intact guy in the shower,
      and he said, "Yes--gloriously different" (personal
      correspondence to John A. Erickson, Director, Gulf Coast
      Circumcision Information Center).</p>

      <p>MYTH: A boy should look like his dad.</p>

      <p>FACT: Ironically, this argument was never used when
      medical circumcision was initiated just a hundred years ago.
      Nor has it been used by Western feminists working to stop
      female circumcision in Africa. A simple explanation is all
      that is needed for children to understand that there are
      individual differences, and to help them feel good about
      themselves. A response something like this usually suffices:
      "People thought circumcision was important for health reasons
      when your dad (or brother) was born, but now we know better.
      Your body is perfect just the way it is. You did not need to
      be circumcised." In reality, children tend to feel bad when
      they learn that part of their father's or brother's body was
      cut off. More to the point, a father may be worried about
      being different from his son. One man wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        What was so difficult in leaving my son intact was not that
        my son would feel different in a locker room, but that I
        would feel different from him. I would then have to accept
        that I'm an amputee from the wars of a past generation (<a
        href="#n45">45</a>).
      </blockquote>

      <p>MYTH: An intact penis looks funny.</p>

      <p>FACT: To whom does an intact penis look funny? Certainly
      not to the baby, nor to most of an intact world. While
      circumcised African women consider intact female genitalia
      unacceptable, American health care professionals would find
      this inappropriate, if not repugnant, justification for
      performing female circumcision. Considering the potential
      physical and psychological harm of neonatal circumcision, as
      well as the infant's right to his own body, we must take
      responsibility for educating ourselves and overcoming our
      cultural bias with regard to the appearance of the intact
      penis. A review of classical art at a local library will
      illustrate what is normal.</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision prevents foreskin infections.</p>

      <p>FACT: Yes, it does, in both males and females, and
      removing all the teeth would prevent cavities. Where does
      this argument end? Infections are caused by invading
      organisms and can be treated effectively with antibiotics.
      Fear of infection is no reason to routinely amputate a
      tonsil, an appendix, or a foreskin.</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision won't hurt if anesthesia is used.</p>

      <p>FACT: To administer a penile dorsal nerve block for
      circumcision, injections must be made at the base of the
      penis. When the effect wears off, if the block was effective
      at all, the baby will feel pain at the site of the wound. The
      pain will intensify every time he urinates, defecates, has
      his diaper changed, or is held too tightly during the 10 days
      to two weeks it takes for the wound to heal. And, he will
      suffer the physical and psychological consequences of
      circumcision for the rest of his life. Most importantly, if
      we were amputating labia, would the use of lidocaine be the
      issue?</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision doesn't hurt, my son slept through
      it.</p>

      <p>FACT: Cutting off any part of a body hurts! Some babies
      respond to the trauma by going into a semicomatose state.
      They only appear to be sleeping. The physiologic and
      behavioral changes associated with the pain of circumcision
      have been well documented by Anand and Hickey (<a
      href="#n46">46</a>).</p>

      <p>MYTH: It's better to circumcise babies because they won't
      remember the experience.</p>

      <p>FACT: Quite the contrary. Overwhelming evidence indicates
      that experiences during the preverbal period affect the human
      being throughout life.</p>

      <blockquote>
        An infant does retain significant memory traces of
        traumatic events. When a child is subjected to intolerable,
        overwhelming pain, it conceptualizes mother as both
        participatory and responsible regardless of mother's
        intent. When in fact mother is truly complicit, as in
        giving permission for unanesthetized surgery, i.e.,
        circumcision, the perception of the infant of her
        culpability and willingness to have him harmed is indelibly
        emplaced. The consequences for impaired bonding are
        significant.--Rima Laibow, MD (<a href="#n">47</a>).
      </blockquote>
      Clearly, circumcision of an infant does interfere with
      maternal- infant bonding, is perceived by the baby as
      betrayal by the mother, prohibits successful completion of
      the first developmental task of establishing trust, encodes
      the brain with the experience of violence inflicted on a part
      of the body that should be experiencing pleasure (<a
      href="#n">48</a>), and occurs during the preverbal period
      when memory is locked into the emotions. Leboyer expresses
      his concern about the life-long consequences of circumcision:
      

      <blockquote>
        Once we remember that all that takes place during the first
        days of life on the emotional level, shapes the pattern of
        all future reactions, we cannot but wonder why such a
        torture has been inflicted on the child. How could a being
        who has been aggressed in this way, while totally helpless,
        develop into a relaxed, loving, trusting person?--Frederick
        Leboyer, MD (<a href="#n49">49</a>).
      </blockquote>
      Retrieval of this subconscious information requires
      commitment and dedication to a therapeutic process destined
      to uncover early traumatic experience. In personal reports,
      men who have done this work describe their circumcision as
      both terrifying and excruciatingly painful. 

      <p>MYTH: Better to do it now because it would hurt more
      later.</p>

      <p>FACT: This first erroneously assumes that a postnewborn
      circumcision will be necessary. Wallerstein reports:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The question of an uncircumcised child requiring later
        circumcision is used as a scare tactic--only in the United
        States. The question is not foreskin problems, but the
        attitude of the American medical profession in pushing what
        most physicians throughout the world consider unnecessary
        surgery. Worldwide, foreskin problems are treated
        medically, rarely surgically. (<a href="#n50">50</a>)
      </blockquote>
      Even if a circumcision were required later in life, the male
      would be able to understand the health problem, give an
      informed consent, and have the benefits of anesthesia and
      pain medication. 

      <p>Researchers Anand and Hickey report that "...neonates were
      found to be more sensitive to pain than older infants" (<a
      href="#n46">46</a>).</p>

      <p>MYTH: Circumcision improves sexual staying power.</p>

      <p>FACT: Following circumcision, changes occur to the
      sensitive mucous membrane of the glans penis that one
      researcher describes as the formation of a cornified layer.
      He explains this is "an additional outer covering of
      compressed, dead cells," with a depth of "about half the
      thickness of Saran Wrap" (<a href="#n51">51</a>). Due to this
      scarification process, circumcision does render the penis
      less sensitive. However, premature ejaculation continues to
      be the most common sexual complaint of American men, most of
      whom are circumcised, so that this rationale seems, at best,
      dubious.</p>

      <p>MYTH: It didn't hurt me, my penis is fine.</p>

      <p>FACT: When normal, healthy, sexually functioning tissue is
      removed, it interferes with normal sexual functioning.
      Although circumcised men have no way of personally knowing
      what they are missing, men circumcised as adults can
      articulately describe the difference. In a letter to NOCIRC,
      a 37 year old laments:</p>

      <blockquote>
        My newly naked, sensitive glans penis was protected from
        irritation with bandages. Slowly the area lost its
        sensitivity and as it did I realized I had lost something
        rather vital. Stimuli that had previously aroused ecstasy
        had relatively little effect. There was a short period of
        depression, but acceptance of the situation developed, as
        it had to. The acute sensitivity never
        returned...circumcision destroys a very joyful aspect of
        the human experience for both males and females.
      </blockquote>
      Another man wrote: 

      <blockquote>
        I was deprived of my foreskin when I was 26. I had had
        ample experience and was happy with the pleasure I could
        experience as an intact male. After my circumcision, that
        pleasure was utterly gone. Let me put it this way: On a
        scale of 10, the intact penis experiences pleasure that is
        at least 11 or 12; the circumcised penis is lucky to get to
        3. If American men who were circumcised at birth could know
        the deprivation of pleasure that they would experience,
        they would storm the hospitals and not permit their sons to
        undergo this unnecessary loss.
      </blockquote>

      <p>MYTH: Christians should be circumcised like Jesus.</p>

      <p>FACT: Circumcision became a controversy in the early
      Church because the first Christians were Jews. These
      Christians debated whether or not the Christian gentiles
      needed to be circumcised in order to be saved. Peter
      proclaimed that Christians were saved only through the grace
      of Jesus Christ (<a href="#n52">52</a>). Paul later
      reaffirmed the concept: "For in Jesus Christ neither
      circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision; but faith
      which worketh by love" (<a href="#n53">53</a>).</p>

      <p>MYTH: Jews don't question circumcision.</p>

      <p>FACT: A reexamination of circumcision (brit milah) is
      occurring within the Jewish community itself (<a
      href="#n54">54, 55</a>).</p>

      <blockquote>
        Like it or not, the American medical community has begun an
        intense reevaluation that eventually will reduce the
        frequency of nonreligious circumcision. The Jewish
        community cannot remain aloof from this development. For
        Orthodox Jews, who accept brit milah solely as a religious
        (not a health) practice, the medical discussion is
        irrelevant. But for all other Jews, who take some comfort
        in the health attributes, a profound soul-searching may be
        anticipated. The answer will not be found in the epithet
        "anti-Semite" (<a href="#n">56</a>).
      </blockquote>
      Jewish writings of the last decade illustrate this process:
      "A Mother Questions Brit Milah" (<a href="#n">57</a>),
      "Letter to Our Son's Grandparents: Why We Decided Against
      Circumcision" (<a href="#n58">58</a>), "A Baby-Naming
      Ceremony, Rochester Society for Humanistic Judaism" (<a
      href="#n59">59</a>), and "Jesse's Circumcision" (<a
      href="#n60">60</a>). Health care providers who are aware of
      resources will be able to provide information to Jewish
      parents who are grappling with this difficult issue. The <a
      href="http://www.fathermag.com/health/circ/bris/">Alternative
      Brit Support Group</a> is one such resource. 

      <p>MYTH: Parents have the right to decide whether or not to
      circumcise their son(s).</p>

      <p>FACT: The consumer of a neonatal circumcision is the
      infant who is circumcised, not the parent(s) who requested
      and/or paid for the circumcision. Body ownership rights are
      now being introduced as an issue in circumcision lawsuits
      that claim that every human being has an inherent,
      inalienable right to his own intact body (<a href="#n61">61,
      62</a>). These cases assert that the only person who can
      consent to a circumcision is a person making this personal
      decision for himself. And, with American men now expressing
      anger over what they believe was a violent violation of their
      bodies, we can no longer ignore the voices of the
      victims:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I think I could have accepted a deformity that was an
        accident of nature, but I can't accept that someone did
        that to me.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I have never been able to accept the fact that when I was a
        baby someone cut part of my penis off. The sheer
        monstrousness of it haunts every waking moment of my life.
        Sometimes I think I'm beginning to adjust to it, but then I
        see an unmutilated man in a shower or magazine and I become
        overwhelmed by uncontrollable feelings and disbelief that I
        was made the victim for life of something so sick.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        My feelings about the doctor who circumcised me are too
        violent to describe.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was just a baby...I couldn't stop them (<a
        href="#n">63</a>).
      </blockquote>

      <p>MYTH: All circumcised men are happy that they were
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>FACT: <a href="/pages/restore.html">Support groups such as
      RECAP (RECover a Penis) [now called NORM] and an information
      network, UNCIRC (Uncircumcising Information and Resources
      Center), are rapidly uniting men who perceive themselves as
      victims of a sexual assault inflicted upon them during their
      earliest days of life and against which they were unable to
      defend themselves.</a> How does circumcision affect their
      lives? One man explained:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I have even gone so far as to use condoms, cut and placed
        in a tedious, time-consuming task on myself to simulate a
        foreskin; so strong the desire to know what all of my
        original parts would feel like. (Personal correspondence to
        NOCIRC, April 3, 1987)
      </blockquote>

      <p>There are thousands of American men who are in the process
      of foreskin restoration, a practice dating back to the first
      century, AD (<a href="#n64">64</a>). Techniques for
      restoration, presented at the Second ISC, are as individual
      and varied as the men who employ them (<a
      href="#n65">65</a>). Some men are manufacturing devices that
      gently stretch the foreskin remnant to recover the glans
      penis. Others are willing to subject their penises to
      surgical reconstruction in order to repair their shattered
      body images and/or dysfunctional sex organs. Often, when a
      man recovers the glans penis, not only is his self-esteem
      restored, so is lost sexual sensitivity and/or function. The
      newly protected glans regains its smooth, glistening
      appearance, normal coloration, and heightened sensitivity.
      Often, as sensation returns, men become acutely aware of what
      was taken from them. Perhaps health care professionals will
      hear in the articulate voices of the victims what they have
      failed to hear in the screams of babies. It's what any man
      with a knife held at his penis would say: "I don't want you
      to cut any of it off!"</p>

      <p>Knowing that men who have realized their loss would prefer
      to have their normal bodies intact, and in light of the fact
      that conclusive evidence for circumcision as an effective
      health measure has never been established, health care
      professionals are ethically and morally obligated to put
      their scalpels down (<a href="#n27">27</a>).</p>

      <h3>In conclusion</h3>

      <p>To overcome the American double standard of the acceptance
      of circumcision for men but not for women, consider this: If
      it could be unequivocally proven that women had a decreased
      incidence of UTIs, sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS,
      vulvitis, vulvar cancer, and/or increased sexual staying
      power as a result of performing neonatal labiectomy, would
      the American medical and nurse-midwifery communities approve
      routine, unanesthetized neonatal labial amputation as a
      prophylactic measure? Of course not! If we wouldn't do this
      to our newborn females, we must take a hard look at why we
      condone and perform "prophylactic" foreskin amputations upon
      our newborn males. Women have struggled to achieve rights to
      body ownership for themselves. It is imperative that mutual
      respect for these inalienable human rights be extended, not
      only to the women in Africa with whom we can identify, but
      also to men, male children, and male newborns.</p>

      <p>Consider further: The foreskin is normal, healthy,
      functioning tissue. Circumcision has inherent risks,
      including hemorrhage, infection, mutilation, and death.
      Circumcision is painful, even when an anesthetic is used.
      Circumcision causes both physical and psychological scars.
      Most importantly, every human being has an inherent,
      inalienable right to his own body.</p>

      <p>Lawsuits have been filed to challenge circumcision as a
      violation of the basic right of every person to his or her
      own body. Circumcision violates many constitutional rights of
      infants and children, including the right to religious
      freedom, which is denied when an infant or child's body is
      marked. Health care professionals do, in fact, have a legal
      basis for claiming conscientious objector status with regard
      to participation in newborn male circumcision (<a
      href="#n66">66</a>).</p>

      <p>While this human rights issue is being addressed within
      the American legal system, it becomes urgent for the American
      College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) to consider the legal and
      the ethical implications of performing newborn circumcision.
      The ACNM is faced with ethical dilemmas unique to midwifery
      1) that of genitally intact women, CNMs, performing permanent
      surgical alteration o the intact sex organs of nonconsenting
      newborn boys, and 2) that of CNMs, who as a group
      philosophically claim to be "guardians of the normal," not
      protecting normal male genitalia while protecting the
      integrity of normal female genitalia.</p>

      <p>These ethical dilemmas warrant an ACNM review of its
      advocacy role on behalf of newborns. Regarding the ACNM
      advocacy role, the Journal of Nurse-Midwifery's Associate
      Editor, Jeanne Raisler, CNM, MPH, wrote "...from time to
      time, national policy issues arise that challenge our deepest
      sense of what is important and necessary for maternal-child
      health. We need a mechanism to discuss and debate these
      topics" (<a href="#n67">67</a>). In the case of circumcision,
      a task force committee would provide that mechanism. And,
      until ACNM policy is established, a moratorium on the
      performance of routine newborn circumcision would protect
      CNMs as well as newborns.</p>

      <p>As the ACNM ponders its advocacy role, CNMs will find
      guidance in the words of human rights activists, Fran P.
      Hosken:</p>

        Human rights are indivisible, they apply to every society
        and culture, and every continent. We cannot differentiate
        between black and white, rich and poor, or between male and
