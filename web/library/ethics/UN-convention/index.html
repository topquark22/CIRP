      <p><a id="Top" name="Top"></a><em>The General Assembly</em>,
      Recalling its previous resolutions, especially resolutions
      33/166 of 20 December 1978 and 43/112 of 8 December 1988, and
      those of the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and
      Social Council related to the question of a convention on the
      rights of the child,</p>

      <p>Taking note, in particular, of Commission on Human Rights
      resolution 1989/57 of 8 March 1989, by which the Commission
      decided to transmit the draft convention on the rights of the
      child, through the Economic and Social Council, to the
      General Assembly, and Economic and Social Council resolution
      1989/79 of 24 May 1989,</p>

      <p>Reaffirming that children's rights require special
      protection and call for continuous improvement of the
      situation of children all over the world, as well as for
      their development and education in conditions of peace and
      security,</p>

      <p>Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in
      many parts of the world remains critical as a result of
      inadequate social conditions, natural disasters, armed
      conflicts, exploitation, illiteracy, hunger and disability,
      and convinced that urgent and effective national and
      international action is called for,</p>

      <p>Mindful of the important role of the United Nations
      Children's Fund and of that of the United Nations in
      promoting the well-being of children and their
      development,</p>

      <p>Convinced that an international convention on the rights
      of the child, as a standard-setting accomplishment of the
      United Nations in the field of human rights, would make a
      positive contribution to protecting children's rights and
      ensuring their well-being,</p>

      <p>Bearing in mind that 1989 marks the thirtieth anniversary
      of the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration
      of the Rights of the Child</a> and the tenth anniversary of
      the International Year of the Child,</p>

      <dl>
        <dd>1. Expresses its appreciation to the Commission on
        Human Rights for having concluded the elaboration of the
        draft convention on the rights of the child;<br />
        <br />
        </dd>

        <dd>2. Adopts and opens for signature, ratification and
        accession the Convention on the Rights of the Child
        contained in the annex to the present resolution;<br />
        <br />
        </dd>

        <dd>3. Calls upon all Member States to consider signing and
        ratifying or acceding to the Convention as a matter of
        priority and expresses the hope that it will come into
        force at an early date;<br />
        <br />
        </dd>

        <dd>4. Requests the Secretary-General to provide all the
        facilities and assistance necessary for dissemination of
        information on the Convention;<br />
        <br />
        </dd>

        <dd>5. Invites United Nations agencies and organizations,
        as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental
        organizations, to intensify their efforts with a view to
        disseminating information on the Convention and to
        promoting its understanding;<br />
        <br />
        </dd>

        <dd>6. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the
        General Assembly at its forty-fifth session a report on the
        status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child;<br />
        <br />
        </dd>

        <dd>7. Decides to consider the report of the
        Secretary-General at its forty-fifth session under an item
        entitled "Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of
        the Child".<br />

        PREAMBLE
      </center>

      <p><em>The States Parties to the present Convention</em>,
      Considering that, in accordance with the principles
      proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition
      of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
      rights of all members of the human family is the foundation
      of freedom, justice and peace in the world,</p>

      <p>Bearing in mind that the peoples of the United Nations
      have, in the Charter, reaffirmed their faith in fundamental
      human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human
      person, and have determined to promote social progress and
      better standards of life in larger freedom,</p>

      <p>Recognizing that the United Nations has, in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a> and in the International Covenants on Human
      Rights, proclaimed and agreed that everyone is entitled to
      all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without
      distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language,
      religion, political or other opinion, national or social
      origin, property, birth or other status,</p>

      <p>Recalling that, in the Universal Declaration of Human
      Rights, the United Nations has proclaimed that childhood is
      entitled to special care and assistance,</p>

      <p>Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of
      society and the natural environment for the growth and
      well-being of all its members and particularly children,
      should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so
      that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the
      community,</p>

      <p>Recognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious
      development of his or her personality, should grow up in a
      family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and
      understanding,</p>

      <p>Considering that the child should be fully prepared to
      live an individual life in society, and brought up in the
      spirit of the ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United
      Nations, and in particular in the spirit of peace, dignity,
      tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity,</p>

      <p>Bearing in mind that the need to extend particular care to
      the child has been stated in the Geneva Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child of 1924 and in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</a> adopted by the General Assembly on 20
      November 1959 and recognized in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a>, in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-covenant/">International Covenant on
      Civil and Political Rights</a> (in particular in articles 23
      and 24), in the International Covenant on Economic, Social
      and Cultural Rights (in particular in article 10) and in the
      statutes and relevant instruments of specialized agencies and
      international organizations concerned with the welfare of
      children,</p>

      <p>Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</a>, "the child, by reason of his
      physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and
      care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well
      as after birth",</p>

      <p>Recalling the provisions of the Declaration on Social and
      Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of
      Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and
      Adoption Nationally and Internationally; the United Nations
      Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile
      justice (The Beijing Rules); and the Declaration on the
      Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed
      Conflict,</p>

      <p>Recognizing that, in all countries in the world, there are
      children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and
      that such children need special consideration,</p>

      <p>Taking due account of the importance of the traditions and
      cultural values of each people for the protection and
      harmonious development of the child,</p>

      <p>Recognizing the importance of international co-operation
      for improving the living conditions of children in every
      country, in particular in the developing countries,</p>

      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>

      <h2><a id="Part_1" name="Part_1"></a>PART I</h2>

      <h3><a id="Article_1" name="Article_1"></a>Article 1</h3>

      disability, birth or other status.</p>

      <p><a id="A2P2" name="A2P2"></a>2. States Parties shall take
      all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is

      members.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_3" name="Article_3">Article 3</a></h3>
      <a id="A3P1" name="A3P1"></a> 

      <p>1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken
      by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of

      consideration.</p>
      <a id="A3P2" name="A3P2"></a> 

      <p>2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such
      protection and care as is necessary for his or her

      responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all
      appropriate legislative and administrative measures.</p>

      <p><a id="A3P3" name="A3P3"></a>3. States Parties shall

      authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in
      the number and suitability of their staff, as well as
      competent supervision.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_4" name="Article_4"></a>Article 4</h3>

      <p>States Parties shall undertake all appropriate
      legislative, administrative, and other measures for the
      implementation of the rights recognized in the present
      Convention. With regard to economic, social and cultural
      rights, States Parties shall undertake such measures to the
      maximum extent of their available resources and, where
      needed, within the framework of international
      co-operation.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_5" name="Article_5"></a>Article 5</h3>

      <p>States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights
      and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of

      for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the
      evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and
      guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights
      recognized in the present Convention.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_6" name="Article_6">Article 6</a></h3>
      <a id="A6P1" name="A6P1"></a> 

      <p>1. States Parties recognize that every child has the
      inherent right to life.</p>

      <p><a id="A6P2" name="A6P2"></a>2. States Parties shall
      ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and
      development of the child.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_7" name="Article_7"></a>Article 7</h3>
      <a id="A7P1" name="A7P1"></a> 

      <p>1. The child shall be registered immediately after birth
      and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to

      know and be cared for by his or her parents.</p>

      <p><a id="A7P2" name="A7P2"></a>2. States Parties shall
      ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with
      their national law and their obligations under the relevant
      international instruments in this field, in particular where
      the child would otherwise be stateless.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_8" name="Article_8">Article 8</a></h3>
      <a id="A8P1" name="A8P1"></a> 

      <p>1. States Parties undertake to respect the right of the
      child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality,
      name and family relations as recognized by law without
      unlawful interference.</p>

      <p><a id="A8P2" name="A8P2"></a>2. Where a child is illegally
      deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her
      identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance
      and protection, with a view to speedily re-establishing his
      or her identity.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_9" name="Article_9"></a>Article 9</h3>
      <a id="A9P1" name="A9P1"></a> 

      <p>1. States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be
      separated from his or her parents against their will, except
      when competent authorities subject to judicial review
      determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures,
      that such separation is necessary for the best interests of
      the child. Such determination may be necessary in a
      particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the
      child by the parents, or one where the parents are living
      separately and a decision must be made as to the child's
      place of residence.</p>

      <p><a id="A9P2" name="A9P2">2.</a> In any proceedings
      pursuant to <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/#A9P1">paragraph 1</a> of
      the present article, all interested parties shall be given an
      opportunity to participate in the proceedings and make their
      views known.</p>

      <p><a id="A9P3" name="A9P3">3.</a> States Parties shall
      respect the right of the child who is separated from one or
      both parents to maintain personal relations and direct
      contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is
      contrary to the child's best interests.</p>

      <p><a id="A9P4" name="A9P4">4.</a> Where such separation
      results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as
      the detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death
      (including death arising from any cause while the person is
      in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the
      child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the
      parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the
      family with the essential information concerning the
      whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the
      provision of the information would be detrimental to the
      well-being of the child. States Parties shall further ensure
      that the submission of such a request shall of itself entail
      no adverse consequences for the person(s) concerned.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_10" name="Article_10">Article 10</a></h3>
      <a id="A10P1" name="A10P1"></a> 

      <p>1. In accordance with the obligation of States Parties
      under <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/#A9P1">article
      9, paragraph 1,</a> applications by a child or his or her
      parents to enter or leave a State Party for the purpose of
      family reunification shall be dealt with by States Parties in
      a positive, humane and expeditious manner. States Parties
      shall further ensure that the submission of such a request
      shall entail no adverse consequences for the applicants and
      for the members of their family.</p>
      <a id="A10P2" name="A10P2"></a> 

      <p>2. A child whose parents reside in different States shall
      have the right to maintain on a regular basis, save in
      exceptional circumstances personal relations and direct
      contacts with both parents. Towards that end and in
      accordance with the obligation of States Parties under <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/#A9P2">article 9,
      paragraph 2</a>, States Parties shall respect the right of
      the child and his or her parents to leave any country,
      including their own, and to enter their own country. The
      right to leave any country shall be subject only to such
      restrictions as are prescribed by law and which are necessary
      to protect the national security, public order (ordre
      public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms
      of others and are consistent with the other rights recognized
      in the present Convention.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_11" name="Article_11">Article 11</a></h3>
      <a id="A11P1" name="A11P1"></a>

      Parties shall promote the conclusion of bilateral or
      multilateral agreements or accession to existing
      agreements.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_12" name="Article_12">Article 12</a></h3>
      <a id="A12P1" name="A12P1"></a> 

      <p>1. States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable
      of forming his or her own views the right to express those
      views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of
      the child being given due weight in accordance with the age
      and maturity of the child.</p>

      <p><a id="A12P2" name="A12P2"></a>2. For this purpose, the
      child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be
      heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings
      affecting the child, either directly, or through a
      representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent
      with the procedural rules of national law.</p>

      <a id="A13P1" name="A13P1"></a>

      national security or of public order (ordre public), or of
      public health or morals.</p>

      <h3><a id="Article_14" name="Article_14">Article 14</a></h3>
      <a id="A14P1" name="A14P1"></a> 

      <p><span class="yellow">1. States Parties shall respect the
      right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and
      religion.</span></p>

      <p><a id="A14P2" name="A14P2"></a>2. States Parties shall
