    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Children sometimes die or become disabled when they fail
      to receive medical treatment because of the strongly held
      religious views of their parents. The numbers of such
      incidents of neglect are hard to ascertain reliably, but
      there are increasingly frequent reports in the mass media. We
      believe the reported cases represent the most extreme
      examples of a larger problem. According to some newspaper
      reports, the following are some specific cases that have come
      to recent attention: <b>(1)</b> a 4-year old girl in
      Sacramento, CA, died of bacterial meningitis; her only
      treatment was spiritual healing by a Christian Science
      practitioner (Sacremento Bee, April 21, 1984). <b>(2)</b> Two
      children died of pneumonia and meningitis in Indiana. Both
      sets of parents were prosecuted for withholding medical care
      from their children. The parents belonged to the Faith
      assembly, a sect that relies exclusively on faith healing
      (Medical World News, Oct 4, 1984). <b>(3)</b> A 2
      1/2-year-old boy died in Boston of bowel obstruction in April
      1986 following five days of treatment by a Christian Science
      practitioner. (Boston Globe, April 10, 1986). <b>(4)</b> A
      16-month-old Santa Monica, CA boy died of bacterial
      meningitis; his only treatment was prayer by a Christian
      Science practitioner. (Los Angeles Times, April 30, 1984).
      <b>(5)</b> Parents of a 13-month-old boy in Coshocton, Oh,
      who died with bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae)
      pericarditis were tried and released because of religious
      exemption protection. The child had received no medical care
      because the parents were members of the Christ Assembly, a
      group that believes in healing by prayer (Columbia
      Citizen-Journal, June 15, 1984). 6) A 23-month-old girl died
      of bronchopneumonia in Celina, OH, in April 1986. The parents
      have claimed that their religious beliefs prevented them from
      seeking medical care. Although the parents were prosecuted,
      charges were dismissed because of the religious exemption
      clause <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> (Akron Beacon-Journal, May 6,
      1986).</p>

      <h3>Ethical and Legal Issues</h3>

      <p class="text">Religion plays an important role in the
      growth and development of many children and families.
      However, when parental practices potentially harmful
      consequences, state intervention may be warranted.</p>

      <p class="text">The boundary between parental freedom in
      child rearing and the interest&mdash;or even basic rights of
      the child is unclear. The limits to parental decision making
      for children are uncertain, but it is widely accepted that
      parents generally will make decisions that do not directly
      threaten the welfare of their children. Tradition, social
      forces, and belief systems shape the limits of acceptable
      nurturance, parental imperatives and privileges, and even of
      physical force used in the discipline of children. These, of
      course, change with time. <span class="yellow">However, the
      constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not
      sanction harming another person in the practice of one's
      religion, and they do not allow religion to be a legal
      defense when one harms another.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Because the efficacy or necessity of many
      medical practices are arguable, those who claim that much of
      common medical practice can be replaced or improved by
      various forms of non-medical intervention or "faith healing"
      will inevitably find some basis for their claims. Although
      there will always remain areas of legitimate debate, it is
      the intent of this Committee to exclude from that debate for
      the purpose of defining medical neglect: medical
      interventions of clear efficacy that can prevent, ameliorate,
      or cure serious disease, incapacity, or loss of life and
      interventions that will clearly result in prevention of
      future handicaps or disability of the child.</p>

      <p class="text">Recognition of the prevalence and serious
      consequences of child abuse and neglect has led society to
      develop increasingly comprehensive systems for its detection
      and reporting and to the establishment of legislation and
      procedures by each of the states. Federal rules, in addition
      to mandating that certain procedures be adopted for each
      state also confirm the inclusion of standard medical
      treatment in the category of those rights assured to children
      and establish the withholding of medical treatment in some
      circumstances as a form of child abuse or neglect.</p>

      <p class="text">In the United States, the constitutional
      guarantee of protection of religious practice from intrusion
      by government has been used by some religious groups to seek
      exemption from legislative or regulatory requirements
      regarding child abuse and neglect, including medical neglect
      in more than three quarters of the states. There are now
      statutes in 44 states which contain a provision stating that
      a child is not to be deemed abused or neglected merely
      because he or she is receiving treatment by spiritual means,
      through prayer according to the tenets of a recognized
      religion. Although these exemptions take different forms and
      interpretations in different state jurisdictions, the overall
      effect has been to limit the ability of the state to
      prosecute parents for abuse or medical neglect of children
      when such occurrences may be the result of "religious
      practice." Severe (even fatal) physical discipline, failure
      to seek medical care, or refusal of a proven efficacious
      treatment of a critically ill child may be protected from
      remedy because of the so called religious exemption clauses
      now found in a majority of state codes.</p>

      <p class="text">Two important sets of interests are in
      apparent opposition - those of children in the benefits of
      proven medical and health care and those of parents in making
      a decision about their children's well-being. Some parents
      believe that a constitutionally protected freedom of religion
      allows them to deny their children some or all of the
      benefits of standard medical intervention. However, this
      interpretation of the US constitution is in contradiction to
      important court rulings to the effect that parents may not
      martyr their children based on parental beliefs <a
      href="#ref2">[2]</a> and that children cannot be denied
      essential health care. <a href="#ref3">[3,</a><a
      href="#ref4">4]</a></p>

      <h3>Statement</h3>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The Committee on
      Bioethics asserts that <b>(1)</b> the opportunity to grow and
      develop safe from physical harm with the protection of our
      society is the right of every child;</span> <b>(2)</b> the
      basic moral principles of justice and of protection of
      children as vulnerable citizens require that all parents and
      caretakers must be treated equally by the laws and
      regulations that have been enacted by state and federal
      governments to protect children; <b>(3)</b> all child abuse,
      neglect, and medical neglect statutes should be applied
      without potential or actual exemption for religious beliefs;
      <b>(4)</b> no statute should exist that permits or implies
      that denial of medical care necessary to prevent death or
      serious impairment to children can be supported on religious
      grounds; <b>(5)</b> state legislatures and regulatory
      agencies with interests in children should be urged to remove
      religious exemption clauses from statutes and
      regulations.</p>

      <p class="text">It is not the intent of the Committee to
      encourage the development of separate legal systems to
      respond to parents who abuse or neglect their children for
      religious or philosophical reasons. The usual procedures of
      detection, reporting, and remediation by established civil or
      criminal court processes are, in most jurisdictions,
      sufficiently developed and functional. Rather, it is the
      Committee's concern that those procedures designed to help
      children who are victims of their caretakers and to prevent
      neglect should be applied equally to all caretakers. Claims
      of exemption from responsibility of care&mdash;as defined
      above&mdash;should not be honored on religious or
      philosophical grounds, and offending parents or caretakers
      should not be treated more or less stringently than those who
      make no such claim. The Committee does not intend by this
      statement to advocate punishment of offending parents as a
      solution to the problem of child abuse and neglect, but
      rather, we are calling for equal treatment of all abusive
      parents.</p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>

      <p class="text">The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
      that all pediatricians, pediatric surgeons, and AAP state
      chapters vigorously take the lead to <b>(1)</b> increase
      public awareness of the hazards to children growing out of
      religious exemptions to child abuse and neglect legislation;
      <b>(2)</b> support legislation in each state legislature to
      correct statutes and regulations that permit harm to children
      under the shield of religious exemption; <b>(3)</b> work with
      other child advocacy organizations and agencies to develop
      coordinated and concerted public and professional actions for
      exemption of religious exemptions.</p>

      <p class="text">The Academy must unequivocably defend the
      rights of all children to the protection and benefits of the
      law and medicine when physical harm&mdash;or life it
      self&mdash;is in the balance.</p>
