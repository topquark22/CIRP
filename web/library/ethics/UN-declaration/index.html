      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: This file contains the text of
      the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. This declaration
      was drafted by the UN Commission on Human Rights and adopted
      by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 November
      1959.</p>

      <p class="cirp">The special rights of the child were first
      enunciated in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights (1948)</a> which provided in Article 25(2)
      "Motherhood and Childhood are entitiled to special care and
      assistance."</p>

      <p class="cirp">This document expands and amplifies that
      theme.</p>

      <p class="cirp">Non-therapeutic circumcision of male children
      violates Principles 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10 of this document.</p>

      <p class="cirp">This document is a non-binding resolution of
      the United Nations General Assembly. It should not be
      confused with the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">International
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> which was adopted
      by the UN General Assembly on the thirtieth anniversary of
      this document, 20 November 1989. That document is a binding
      treaty to which 176 nations have become "states
      parties".]</p>

      <h3>Preamble</h3>

      <p class="text">Whereas the peoples of the United Nations
      have, in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-charter/">Charter</a>, reaffirmed
      their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity
      and worth of the human person, and have determined to promote
      social progress and better standards of life in larger
      freedom,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas the United Nations has, in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/"><i>Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</i></a>, proclaimed that everyone is entitled to
      all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without
      distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language,
      religion, political or other opinion, national or social
      origin, property, birth or other status,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas the child, by reason of his physical
      and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care,
      including appropriate legal protection, before as well as
      after birth,</p>

      <p class="text">Whereas the need for such special safeguards
      has been stated in the <a
      href="http://www.iin.org.uy/breve_cronologia_de_algunos_hechos_ingles.htm"
       target="_blank"><i>Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the
      Child</i></a> of 1924, and recognized in the <i>Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights</i> and in the statutes of
      specialized agencies and international organizations
      concerned with the welfare of children,</p>

      <p>Whereas mankind owes to the child the best it has to
      give,</p>

      <p>Now therefore,</p>

      <h3>The General Assembly</h3>

      <p>Proclaims this <i>Declaration of the Rights of the
      Child</i> to the end that he may have a happy childhood and
      enjoy for his own good and for the good of society the rights
      and freedoms herein set forth, and calls upon parents, upon
      men and women as individuals, and upon voluntary
      organizations, local authorities and national Governments to
      recognize these rights and strive for their observance by
      legislative and other measures progressively taken in
      accordance with the following principles:</p>

      <p><b>Principle 1</b></p>

      <p class="prin"><span class="yellow">The child shall enjoy
      all the rights set forth in this Declaration. Every child,
      without any exception whatsoever, shall be entitled to these
      rights, without distinction or discrimination on account of
      race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
      opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other
      status, whether of himself or of his family.</span></p>

      <p><b>Principle 2</b></p>

      <p class="prin"><span class="yellow">The child shall enjoy
      special protection, and shall be given opportunities and
      facilities, by law and by other means, to enable him to
      develop physically, mentally, morally, spiritually and
      socially in a healthy and normal manner and in conditions of
      freedom and dignity. In the enactment of laws for this
      purpose, the best interests of the child shall be the
      paramount consideration.</span></p>

      <p><b>Principle 3</b></p>

      <p class="prin">The child shall be entitled from his birth to
      a name and a nationality.</p>

      <p><b>Principle 4</b></p>

      <p class="prin">The child shall enjoy the benefits of social
      security. He shall be entitled to grow and develop in health;
      to this end, special care and protection shall be provided
      both to him and to his mother, including adequate pre-natal
      and post-natal care. The child shall have the right to
      adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical
      services.</p>

      <p><b>Principle 5</b></p>

      <p class="prin">The child who is physically, mentally or
      socially handicapped shall be given the special treatment,
      education and care required by his particular condition.</p>

      <p><b>Principle 6</b></p>

      <p class="prin">The child, for the full and harmonious
      development of his personality, needs love and understanding.
      He shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under
      the responsibility of his parents, and, in any case, in an
      atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security; a
      child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional
      circumstances, be separated from his mother. Society and the
      public authorities shall have the duty to extend particular
      care to children without a family and to those without
      adequate means of support. Payment of State and other
      assistance towards the maintenance of children of large
      families is desirable.</p>

      <p><b>Principle 7</b></p>

      <p class="prin">The child is entitled to receive education,
      which shall be free and compulsory, at least in the
      elementary stages. He shall be given an education which will
      promote his general culture and enable him, on a basis of
      equal opportunity, to develop his abilities, his individual
      judgement, and his sense of moral and social responsibility,
      and to become a useful member of society.</p>

      <p class="prin">The best interests of the child shall be the
      guiding principle of those responsible for his education and
      guidance; that responsibility lies in the first place with
      his parents.</p>

      <p class="prin">The child shall have full opportunity for
      play and recreation, which should be directed to the same
      purposes as education; society and the public authorities
      shall endeavour to promote the enjoyment of this right.</p>

      <p><b>Principle 8</b></p>

      <p class="prin"><span class="yellow">The child shall in all
      circumstances be among the first to receive protection and
      relief.</span></p>

      <p><b>Principle 9</b></p>

      <p class="prin"><span class="yellow">The child shall be
      protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and
      exploitation. He shall not be the subject of traffic, in any
      form.</span></p>

      <p class="prin">The child shall not be admitted to employment
      before an appropriate minimum age; he shall in no case
      becaused or permitted to engage in any occupation or
      employment which would prejudice his health or education, or
      interfere with his physical, mental or moral development.</p>

      <p><b>Principle 10</b></p>

      <p class="prin"><span class="yellow">The child shall be
      protected from practices which may foster racial, religious
      and any other form of discrimination.</span> He shall be
      brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance,
      friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood,
      and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should
      be devoted to the service of his fellow men.</p>
