        <h3><font face="arial, helvetica">Declaration on the
        Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture
        and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
        Punishment</font></h3>
      </center>

      <center>
        <h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Adopted by General
        Assembly resolution 3452 (XXX) of 9 December
        1975</font></h3>
      </center>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      1</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1. For the purpose of this
      Declaration, torture means any act by which severe pain or
      suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally
      inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a
      person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third
      person information or confession, punishing him for an act he
      has committed or is suspected of having committed, or
      intimidating him or other persons. It does not include pain
      or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to,
      lawful sanctions to the extent consistent with the Standard
      Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.</font></p>

      <p><font face="arial, helvetica">2. Torture constitutes an
      aggravated and deliberate form of cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment or punishment.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      2</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Any act of torture <span
      class="yellow">or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment</span> or punishment is an offence to human dignity
      and shall be condemned as a denial of the purposes of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-charter/">Charter of the United
      Nations</a> and as a violation of the human rights and
      fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a>.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      3</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No State may permit or
      tolerate torture <span class="yellow">or other cruel, inhuman
      or degrading treatment</span> or punishment. Exceptional
      circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war,
      internal political instability or any other public emergency
      may not be invoked as a justification of torture or other
      cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
      punishment.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      4</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each State shall, in
      accordance with the provisions of this Declaration, take
      effective measures to prevent torture and other cruel,
      inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment from being
      practised within its jurisdiction.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      5</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The training of law
      enforcement personnel and of other public officials who may
      be responsible for persons deprived of their liberty shall
      ensure that full account is taken of the prohibition against
      torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
      punishment. This prohibition shall also, where appropriate,
      be included in such general rules or instructions as are
      issued in regard to the duties and functions of anyone who
      may be involved in the custody or treatment of such
      persons.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      6</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each State shall keep under
      systematic review interrogation methods and practices as well
      as arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons
      deprived of their liberty in its territory, with a view to
      preventing any cases of torture or other cruel, inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      7</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each State shall ensure that
      all acts of torture as defined in article 1 are offences
      under its criminal law. The same shall apply in regard to
      acts which constitute participation in, complicity in,
      incitement to or an attempt to commit torture.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      8</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Any person who alleges that
      he has been subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment by or at the instigation of
      a public official shall have the right to complain to, and to
      have his case impartially examined by, the competent
      authorities of the State concerned.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      9</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Wherever there is reasonable
      ground to believe that an act of torture as defined in
      article 1 has been committed, the competent authorities of
      the State concerned shall promptly proceed to an impartial
      investigation even if there has been no formal complaint.
      Article 10</font></p>

      <p><font face="arial, helvetica">If an investigation under
      article 8 or article 9 establishes that an act of torture as
      defined in article 1 appears to have been committed, criminal
      proceedings shall be instituted against the alleged offender
      or offenders in accordance with national law. If an
      allegation of other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment or punishment is considered to be well founded, the
      alleged offender or offenders shall be subject to criminal,
      disciplinary or other appropriate proceedings.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      11</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where it is proved that an
      act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
      or punishment has been committed by or at the instigation of
      a public official, the victim shall be afforded redress and
      compensation in accordance with national law.</font></p>

      <h4><b><i><font face="arial, helvetica">Article
      12</font></i></b></h4>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Any statement which is
      established to have been made as a result of torture or other
      cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may not
      be invoked as evidence against the person concerned or
      against any other person in any proceedings.</font></p>
