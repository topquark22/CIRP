<B>To the Editor:</B>
<P>
The editorial by Bloom and Koo (<I>Clin Pediatr</I> 1999;38:243-244) describes the practice of male circumcision as
"purposeful surgical intervention...nearly as old as the human species".  In
appealing to the antiquity of the procedure, they speculate that "there must have
been some pervasive reasons for its durability".  They acknowledge however the
cosmetic damage of circumcision which lead Celsius to develop an operation to
restore the prepuce to men dissatisfied with its non-consensual amputation.
<P>
Male circumcision predates the <A HREF="/library/ethics/hippocrates/">Hippocratic oath</A>, the <A HREF="/library/ethics/nuremberg/">Nueremberg Code</A> and the
<A HREF="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the Rights of the Child</A>.  Each of these international standards
ought to have led the medical profession to cease the non-therapeutic
disfigurement of the normal, healthy penis.  Yet the medical profession cling
tenaciously to a practice which clearly breaks the standards they claim for
themselves.  The best excuse Bloom and Koo can offer for this is that some males
will need later surgery to the foreskin.  They claim that the solution is likely to be
circumcision.  This merely shows that they lack the vision to see the object of
health care as being to restore the foreskin to health rather than cut it off.
<P>
Bloom and Koo appeal to the antiquity of circumcision as if that justified continuing
this ancient and primitive operation.  Perhaps it is time to ask why contemporary
medicine is still so reliant on an ancient religious mutilation?
