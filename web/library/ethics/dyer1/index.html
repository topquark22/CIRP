<H2>Guide to ethics of treating children published</H2>
<B>Clare Dyer</B> <I>legal correspondent, BMJ</i><P> 
A guide to help doctors treating children to avoid pitfalls such as those highlighted by
inquiries into children's heart surgery at Bristol, organ retention at Alder Hey hospital
in Liverpool, and research on babies at North Staffordshire hospital was published by the
BMA's ethics committee this week. <P>
The 267-page guide comes from a steering group chaired by the child law expert Allan Levy,
QC. Other members included child psychiatrist Sir Michael Rutter; Michael Wilks, chairman
of the BMA's medical ethics committee; and Dr Vivienne Nathanson, BMA's head of health
policy research.<P> 
The book maps a route through what can be a legal and ethical minefield for doctors.
Mr Levy said its aim was to "ease the path of doctors and other professionals who are
often involved in controversial decisions about whether, and to what extent, children
should receive particular medical treatment."<P> 
Competent adults have an absolute right to refuse treatment, but issues of consent are
much more complex where children are concerned. Parents can consent to treatment on
behalf of their children but not if the treatment is against the child's best interests.<P> 
Older children, if they can understand the treatment proposed, can consent on behalf of
themselves. But what if the parent disagrees? Then the position is legally complex, and
the law of Scotland differs from that in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. For
patients aged under 18, the courts may also take treatment decisions.<P> 
The law is constantly developing through court cases---making it clear recently, for
example, that consent by one parent alone is insufficient for non-therapeutic procedures,
such as <A HREF="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/cases/Re_J.htm">male
infant circumcision</A>. And the
<A HREF="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs">Human Rights Act</A>,
which came into force in October, is expected to produce a whole new line of cases.<P> 
Research is a particularly fraught area. Parents can consent to treatment that is in
the child's best interests, but research generally benefits not the individual child
but children in general.<P> 
The <A HREF="http://www.gmc-uk.org/">GMC</A> advised in 1991 that, strictly speaking,
parents could not give consent to procedures that were of no benefit to the particular
child and might carry some risk of harm. The BMA's new guide says: "It is now widely
accepted that from an ethical perspective research can be carried out on children, when
there is no expected benefit for them individually, provided there is minimal risk,
strict safeguards and no objection from either the child or parents."<P> 
Reinforcing the message from the Bristol heart surgery debacle, the guide says that
doctors carrying out innovative treatment "must monitor closely whether the outcomes
from new procedures and from their mastery of them fall below the success rate gained
by other practitioners."<P>
