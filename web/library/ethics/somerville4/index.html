    <P>A common error made by those who want to justify infant male circumcision 
    on the basis of medical benefits is that they believe that as long as some 
    such benefits are present, circumcision can be justified as therapeutic, in 
    the sense of preventive health care. This is not correct. A medical-benefits 
    or "therapeutic" justification requires that <I>overall</I> the medical 
    benefits sought outweigh the risks and harms of the procedure required to 
    obtain them, that this procedure is the only reasonable way to obtain these 
    benefits, and that these benefits are necessary to the well-being of the 
    child. None of these conditions is fulfilled for routine infant male 
    circumcision. If we view a child's foreskin as having a valid function, we 
    are no more justified in amputating it than any other part of the child's 
    body unless the operation is medically required treatment and the least 
    harmful way to provide that treatment. <BR><SMALL>(pp. 204-205.)</SMALL>

    <P>It is very difficult to believe that a person, especially a physician, 
    could understand the new knowledge about circumcision and believe that it 
    did little or no harm to the baby boys on whom it is carried out. And yet my 
    experience has been that many physicians, especially those who are older and 
    have performed very large numbers of circumcisions, are unwilling to accept 
    this evidence or, it seems, even to give it open-minded consideration. In by 
    far the majority of cases, this resistance is not connected with physicians' 
    own religious beliefs, although it could, of course, be connected with 
    concern that recognizing the harms involved in infant male circumcision 
    could interfere with others' religious beliefs or traditional or cultural 
    practices. This concern probably influences politicians and leaders of 
    medical professional societies. When approached about the ethics and 
    legality of infant male circumcision, they frequently fail to respond. If 
    they do respond, either they state that the practice does not raise any 
    ethical or legal issues or, if they recognize that it does raise these 
    issues, they often justify the practice with statements that are ethically 
    and legally wrong. I have spent many hours replying to letters signed by 
    ministers of justice or of health, or presidents of colleges of physicians 
    and surgeons. In these letters, I give the same arguments that I discuss in 
    this chapter to explain why, in my opinion, they are ethically and legally 
    wrong. Sometimes, I do not receive any reply, but I have found that when I 
    do receive a response, it rarely addresses the ethical and legal issues I 
    have raised and often simply repeats the same statements as those in the 
    letter to which I replied that I argued were wrong. I assume that these 
    statements are made in good faith. Probably the people making them are 
    acting out of a concern not to distress their constituents or members of the 
    colleges who would be deeply dismayed by recognizing the harms involved in 
    infant male circumcision that are not compensated for by medical benefits, 
    and therefore the practice's ethical and legal unacceptability. No doubt 
    they are also dismayed to realize that as parents who consented to routine 
    circumcision, they may have inflicted harm on their sons or, as physicians 
    who carried it out, on other people's sons.<BR><SMALL>(pp. 206-207)</SMALL>

    <P>The assault provisions in the current [Canadian] Criminal Code could be 
    used to stop infant male circumcision, but this route is probably neither 
    the most ethical nor the most effective way to approach a situation that 
    involves long-standing, deeply held social, cultural and religious beliefs. 
    In particular, we have to start from a basis of deep respect for religious 
    belief and a requirement of very strong justification for any interference 
    with the expression of this belief. <BR><SMALL>(pp. 209-210)</SMALL> <BR>

    <P>Under the <A 
    href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/loireg/charte/const_en.html">Canadian 
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</A>---as is true under most codes of human 
    rights---discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited. Legislatures must 
    not pass laws that protect people of one sex but not the other when both are 
    in similar situations. People who oppose infant male circumcision argue that 
    the provision in the Canadian <A 
    href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/STABLE/EN/Laws/Chap/C/C-46.html">Criminal 
    Code</A> that specifically prohibits genital mutilation only on females is 
    discriminatory in that it protects the "right to security of the person" of 
    girls but not of boys and that this failure to protect boys is 
    unconstitutional. In all likelihood, we will see this issue addressed by the 
    courts in the not too distant future, probably in the context of a man suing 
    a physician on the grounds that in circumcising him as a child, a legal 
    wrong was done to him, and that governmental action, in either formulating 
    or applying the law in such a way that he was not protected, was 
    unconstitutional.<BR><SMALL>(pp. 210-211)</SMALL>

    <P>Physicians who undertake infant male circumcision could be legally liable 
    for medical malpractice (civil liability in battery or negligence), which 
    can result in an award of damages simply for carrying out the circumcision 
    even if it was competently performed. They could also, as explained, be 
    charged with criminal liability for assault. In both ethics and law, a 
    physician has a primary obligation of personal care to the patient. This 
    obligation requires the physician both to place the patient first and to 
    first do no harm. Physicians who undertake surgery on patients must prove 
    that it is justified. The usual justification is that the surgery is 
    necessary therapy and that the patient---or if incompetent, the patient's 
    legal representative---gave informed consent to the surgery. In general, 
    parents cannot authorize non-therapeutic interventions---that is, routine 
    circumcision---on their children. A competent adult man could consent to 
    non-therapeutic circumcision on himself, but this does not mean he may 
    consent to it on his son. If the parents' consent to the circumcision of 
    their son was held to be legally inoperative, the physician would be liable. 
    Moreover, if, in the light of new medical evidence, a reasonably careful and 
    competent physician would not consider it medically necessary to undertake 
    circumcision on a child, to do so could result in legal liability regardless 
    of the parents' consent. Such liability is even more likely if a reasonably 
    careful and competent physician would consider it not just unnecessary but 
    contrary to a reasonable standard of medical care to undertake circumcision 
    on a particular child in given circumstances. A long-recongnized example of 
    such a situation is when the child suffers from haemophilia, a condition 
    that could cause him to bleed to death from circumcision. But as our 
    knowledge of the risks and harms of circumcision expands, the range of 
    circumstances in which undertaking routine circumcision on any child is a 
    breach of a reasonable standard of medical care also expands. To summarize, 
    it seems to me clear that, certainly outside the religious context, recent 
    medical research on routine infant male circumcision shows that this 
    operation cannot be ethically or legally justified on the basis of its 
    potential medical benefits.<BR><SMALL>(pp. 211-212)</SMALL> 
    <HR width="25%" color=black SIZE=1>

    <P>There has been some confusion about the ethical and legal effect of this 
    lack of a medical justification for routine infant male circumcision, 
    particularly on the part of medical associations who seem to be concerned 
    not to speak out against the practice. For instance, the <A 
    href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of 
    Pediatrics</A> recognizes that the potential medical benefits of this 
    procedure do not outweigh its risks to a degree that it can be recommended 
    to parents as a routine procedure. But they then conclude that the decision 
    about circumcision should be left to the parents in consultation with their 
    physician. In my opinion, this conclusion is wrong both ethically and 
    legally. Unless the potential and actual medical benefits of a surgical 
    intervention on a child unable to consent for himself clearly outweigh its 
    risks (and the academy has found that in the case of routine infant male 
    circumcision they do not), then it cannot be ethically or legally justified 
    just on the basis of the parents' consent and, therefore, the physician must 
    not undertake it unless he or she has some other justification for doing so. 
    The question therefore is how should we balance respect for baby boys' 
    rights to physical integrity and parents' responsibilities and rights with 
    regard to their children and to their freedom of conscience and religion?
