    <h2>International Code of Medical Ethics of the World Medical
    Association - 1949</h2>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Adopted by the Third General Assembly of the <a
      href="http://www.wma.net/" target="_blank">World Medical
      Association</a> at London in October 1949. (World Medical
      Association Bulletin, vol. 1, no. 3, October 1949, pp.109,
      111).</p>

        <p class="cirp"><small>[CIRP Note: The two most important
        parts of this code for the study of the ethics of child
        circumcision may be 1) the statement "Any act, or advice
        which could weaken physical or mental resistance of a human
        being may be used only in his interest", 2) the requirement
        to be "loyal" to his patient, 3) the requirement to
        "observe the principles of <a
        href="/library/ethics/geneva/"><i>The Declaration of
        Geneva</i></a>", because that document requires that a
        doctor must not use "medical knowledge contrary to the laws
        of humanity", and 4) the requirement that a doctor must
        "practice his profession uninfluenced by motives of
        profit."]</small></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Duties of Doctors in General</h3>

      <p>A doctor must always maintain the highest standards of
      professional conduct.</p>

      <p>A doctor must practice his profession uninfluenced by
      motives of profit.</p>

      <p>The following practices are deemed unethical:</p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Any self advertisement except such as is expressly
        authorized by the national code of medical ethics;</li>

        <li>Collaborate in any form of medical service in which the
        doctor does not have professional independence;</li>

        <li>Receiving any money in connection with services
        rendered to a patient other than a proper professional fee,
        even with the knowledge of the patient.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Any act, or advice which could weaken physical or mental
      resistance of a human being may be used only in his
      interest.</p>

      <p>A doctor is advised to use great caution in divulging
      discoveries or new techniques of treatment.</p>

      <p>A doctor should certify or testify only to that which he
      has personally verified.</p>

      <h3>Duties of Doctors to the Sick</h3>

      <p>A doctor must always bear in mind the obligation of
      preserving human life from conception. Therapeutic abortion
      may only be performed if the conscience of the doctors and
      the national laws permit.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">A doctor owes to his patient complete
      loyalty and all the resources of his science.</span> Whenever
      an examination or treatment is beyond his capacity he should
      summon another doctor who has the necessary ability.</p>

      <p>A doctor shall preserve absolute secrecy on all he knows
      about his patient because of the confidence entrusted in
      him.</p>

      <p>A doctor must give emergency care as a humanitarian duty
      unless he is assured that others are willing and able to give
      such care.</p>

      <h3>Duties of Doctors to Each Other</h3>

      <p>A doctor ought to behave to his colleagues as he would
      have them behave to him.</p>

      <p>A doctor must not entice patients from his colleagues.</p>

      <p>A doctor must observe the principles of <a
      href="/library/ethics/geneva/"><i>The Declaration of
      Geneva</i></a> approved by The <a href="http://www.wma.net/"
      target="_blank">World Medical Association</a>.</p>
