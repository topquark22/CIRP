   Guidelines for Medical Doctors concerning Torture and Other Cruel,
   Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in relation to
   Detention and Imprisonment
<P>
   Adopted by the 29th World Medical Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October
   1975<P>
<CENTER><B>
                              PREAMBLE</B>
</CENTER><P>
     It is the privilege of the medical doctor to practice medicine in
     the service of humanity, to preserve and restore bodily and
     mental health without distinction as to persons, to comfort and
     to ease the suffering of his or her patients. The utmost respect
     for human life is to be maintained even under threat, and no use
     made of any medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.
<P>
     For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the
     deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental
     suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of
     any authority, to force another person to yield information, to
     make a confession, or for any other reason.
<P><CENTER><B>
                             DECLARATION</B></CENTER>
<P>
     The doctor shall not countenance, condone or participate in the
     practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading
     procedures, whatever the offence of which the victim of such
     procedure is suspected, accused or guilty, and whatever the
     victim's belief or motives, and in all situations, including
     armed conflict and civil strife.
<P>
     The doctor shall not provide any premises, instruments,
     substances or knowledge to facilitate the practice of torture or
     other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to
     diminish the ability of the victim to resist such treatment.
<P>
     The doctor shall not be present during any procedure during which
     torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
     are used or threatened.
<P>
     A doctor must have complete clinical independence in deciding
     upon the care of a person for whom he or she is medically
     responsible. The doctor's fundamental role is to alleviate the
     distress of his or her fellow men, and no motive whether
     personal, collective or political shall prevail against this
     higher purpose.
<P>
     Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the
     doctor as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgement
     concerning the consequences of such voluntary refusal of
     nourishment, he or she shall not not be fed artificially. The
     decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a
     judgement should be confirmed by at least one other independent
     doctor. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be
     explained by the doctor to the prisoner.
<P>
     The World Medical Association will support, and should encourage
     the international community, the national medical associations
     and fellow doctors to support the doctor and his or her family in
     the face of threats or reprisals resulting from a refusal to
     condone the use of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or
     degrading treatment.
