<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If competent to understand the consequences should a child
be able to consent, and more importantly, refuse to consent
to treatment?  Some recent rulings in the English law courts
have apparently disenfranchised children, and the debate has
resurfaced on their rights to self determination.   The
issue has a tremendous impact on paediatric practice, and
all those who care for children should have a clear
understanding of the legal and ethical consensus.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       From the late 1960s to the early 1990s changes in the
law on consent progressively increased the rights of those
under 18 to self determination - always dependent on their
capacity to understand the implications of their decisions.
The case of <A HREF="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/cases/853_0402.htm">Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health
Authority</A> established that children under 16 years could
give legally effective consent to medical treatment,
independent of their parents wishes, provided they had
sufficient understanding and intelligence. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       The position was reversed in 1992 in the case Re W,
an orphaned girl in a children's home who refused to eat.
she was forcibly tube fed until her 16th birthday, when she
applied to the courts to allow her the adult right to refuse
treatment.  Lord Donaldson ruled that no one under 18 years
has an absolute right to make his or her own decisions on
medical, treatment especially when that treatment is
refusal. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>  Many commentators pointed to the "Catch 22"
created - patients whose competence is in question are found
rational and able to give consent if they accept the advice
of the doctor; but are judged incompetent if they reject the
same advice.  Re W may have been an extraordinary case, but
the ruling could be viewed as a licence to bulldoze children
into treatment regardless of their personal wishes, fears,
or capacity to understand the implications of their decision.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Children do have some rights from international and
national legislation.  The <A HREF="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child</A> advocates the right of every child to
self determination, dignity, respect, non-interference, and
the right to make informed decisions.  The <A HREF="../alderson/">European charter
for children in hospital</A> states that "children and parents
have a right to informed participation in all decisions
involving their health care.  Every child should be
protected from unnecessary medical treatment and
investigation."<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>  The <A href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/statutes/ca89.htm">Children Act 1989</A> states that
children's wishes and feelings should be incorporated into
the decision making concerning them. In theory, the
pronouncements of the United Nations and the European
Charter are at variance with the current English law.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       In practice in almost all circumstances this apparent
conflict will not matter.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Clearly those rare life or death decisions in which
the minor refuses treatment must be resolved in the courts.
This does not eliminate the medical professionals'
responsibility carefully to consider the views of the child
in conjunction with those of the parents or guardians.  If
there is an impasse, however, it is law that is equipped to
judge whether a child fully understands the implications of
such a decision in which case the opinion of doctors or
parents could be overturned.  Only when a decision is so
urgent that it calls for immediate action might it fall to
the parents or doctors to go ahead with treatment regardless
of the child's wishes.  In all but these most extreme cases,
however, it should be mandatory to secure a child's consent
to treatment in addition to that of the parents, provided
that the child has the capacity to understand the
implications of assent or refusal.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       The crucial question is, then, when does the child
have the capacity to make such decisions?  There is no
simple answer to this.  In her recent book Priscilla
Anderson gives data on children undergoing paediatric
orthopaedic surgery; she discusses the age when patients,
parents, and health professionals thought that children
could decide for themselves whether they wanted surgery that
was not lifesaving.  The children themselves set the highest
threshold age for self determination at 14 years; the
parents put it slightly lower at 13.9 years; and remarkably,
the health professionals chose the lowest figure, 10.3 years.
<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       While the age of informed consent remains
contentious, an attempt should be made fully to explain the
procedures and potential outcomes to the child, as stated by
the European charter, even if the child is too young to be
fully competent.  After all it is the child who will have to
live with the outcome of the procedure.  One of the many
themes running through Alderson's book is the dismay and
anger expressed by children who felt cheated by the
explanations or lack of them, from parents and clinicians.
Children who are legally too young to give consent to
treatment must still be treated as individuals whose rights
as members of society are not solely dependent on the legal
definition of the day.  Before accepting any consent the
clinician responsible must be sure that both child and
parents understand, to the best of their capacity, what is
entailed -- so enabling them to make a collective, considered
decision.  The doctor must be able to show that the views of
the child were taken into account and write notes to that
effect in the child's health records.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       In all but the most life threatening circumstances it
amounts to an abuse of a child's rights as a member of
society to disregard a refusal to consent to treatment if
the child seems to have made a fully informed and considered
decision.  This is especially true in the 1990s - for with
the classic family unit having so often disintegrated the
child may have a more stable and balanced viewpoint than
either parent.
