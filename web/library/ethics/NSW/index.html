1 March 1982.
<p>
The Paediatric Services Committee of the Health Department of New
South Wales has considered the practice of neonatal circumcision
of male infants.  The Committee points out that there is no valid
medical indication for circumcision in the neonatal period.  It
acknowledged the social and religious reasons.  The hazards of
neonatal circumcision may have been understated in the past.  The
chief risk is sepsis, usually Staphylococcal but sometimes
involving other organisms.  In a hospital, cross-infection may of
course impose risks to infants other than the circumcised.  Other
major complications such as haemorrhage or surgical trauma to the
penis are less common.  Boy circumcised at any time until they
are out of napkins are at risk of meatal ulceration and
consequent meatal stenosis.  The Committee recommends that
infants should not be circumcised under the age of four weeks;
preferably, if the procedure is to be performed, it should be
deferred until the child is over one year of age.  The Committee
also recommends that hospital should not permit neonatal
circumcision to be performed on hospitalised infants.  Should a
hospital elect to permit the operation, it would of course be
essential for the parents give informed consent, i.e. after being
told the nature, effects, advantages, disadvantages, and risks.
