      <h2>To Circumcise or Not to Circumcise?<br />
       <small>A Catholic Ethicist Argues That the Practice Is Not
      in the Best Interest of Male Infants</small></h2>

      <p class="text1"><b>BY FR. PETER A. CLARK, SJ, PhD</b><br />
       <i>Fr. Clark is professor, theology and health
      administration, and director, <a

      <p class="text1">Routine neonatal male circumcision is the
      most frequent surgical operation performed on males in the
      United States. In recent years, however, there has been a
      widespread debate in the medical, ethical and, most recently,
      the legal communities concerning the surgery;s
      appropriateness.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> At first
      glance, the issue appears to be solely medical. But, after
      further analysis, one can see that it has religious,
      cultural, and even socioeconomic implications. A
      comprehensive review of the medical literature reveals
      arguments both for and against this routine procedure. One
      writer notes that "of the at least 16 national and
      international medical organizations that have spoken on
      routine neonatal circumcision, not a single group has
      recommended it. This includes five leading American
      organizations, including the American Medical Association and
      the American Academy of Pediatrics."<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Is neonatal male circumcision a prophylactic
      measure with significant health benefits? Or is it, rather, a
      form of bodily mutilation and child abuse? Formidable
      questions are being posed to medical, legal, and ethical
      authorities about the procedure's purpose. Can parents give
      consent to perform circumcision on a minor if it is for
      nontherapeutic purposes? Are parents knowledgeable enough
      about this procedure to give informed consent? Do the
      benefits of such a procedure outweigh the risks? Can cultural
      and religious considerations justify the procedure when the
      medical evidence might not warrant it?</p>

      <p class="text1">The controversy extends to Catholic health
      care. In particular, some staff members in Catholic hospitals
      have challenged the practice of male circumcision as a
      violation of the moral law. The <i>Catechism of the Catholic
      Church</i> states that, "except when performed for strictly
      therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations,
      mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent persons
      are against the moral law."<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      This implies that nontherapeutic mutilations violate the
      physical integrity of the human person and are, therefore,
      morally wrong.</p>

      <p class="text1">In this article, I intend, first, to examine
      the medical and legal issue of neonatal male circumcision;
      second, to give an ethical analysis of the current
      controversy surrounding the issue; and, third, to determine
      if it is ethical for Catholic hospitals to permit it.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Medical and Legal Analysis</b><br />
       Neonatal male circumcision is a relatively uncomplicated
      medical procedure.* As the American Medical Association (AMA)
      describes it:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The normal uncircumcised penis consists of a cylindrical
        shaft and rounded tip (glans) that are separated by a
        tissue groove (coronal sulcus). The fold of the skin
        (foreskin) covering the glans is removed during the
        circumcision procedure to a point near the coronal sulcus.
        At birth, separation of the foreskin from the glans is
        incomplete. The separation process continues through
        childhood via desquamation and epidermal keratinization of
        the shaft. Keratinization does not occur on the mucosal
        surface of the foreskin, which may contain specialized
        sensory cells. Eventually, unforced and complete retraction
        of the foreskin can be accomplished.<sup><a
        href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

        <p><small>*The relative simplicity and painlessness of male
        circumcision contrasts sharply with female
        circumcision&mdash;sometimes called female genital
        mutilation. The latter practice entails amputating some or
        all of the external genitalia&mdash;the clitoris, the small
        genital lips, and the large ones&mdash;thereby diminishing
        a woman;s ability to experience sexual pleasure. Female
        circumcision is performed in 28 African countries, some
        Middle Eastern countries, and immigrant communities in
        other parts of the world. See Celia Dugger, "African Ritual
        Pain: Genital Cutting," <i>New York Times</i>, October 5,
        1996, pp. 1A, 6A.</small></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Some medical scholars believe that
      circumcision may be the oldest form of surgery. One writer
      notes that "the Egyptians, who probably acquired the practice
      from African tribes, practiced circumcision as early as 4000
      B.C. In the Jewish religion, the origin of circumcision is
      attributed to Abraham, who established the 'blood covenant;
      with God through circumcision. This practice is also of
      pre-Islamic Arabic tradition and became a near prerequisite
      to becoming a Moslem. The practice is very widespread and is
      unknown only to Indo-Germanic people, the Mongols, and
      non-Moslem Finno-Ugrian races."<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In modern times, male circumcision has been
      performed in Western societies mainly for medical reasons,
      primarily to prevent phimosis, an inability to retract the
      foreskin. Three methods of circumcision are commonly used on
      newborn males: the Gomco clamp, the Plastibell device, and
      the Mogen clamp (or variations derived from the same
      principle on which each of these devices is based). In each
      of the three methods, the surgeon:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Estimates the amount of external skin to be
        removed</li>

        <li>Dilates the preputial orifice so that the glans can be
        visualized, allowing the surgeon to ensure that it is
        normal</li>

        <li>Frees the inner preputial epithelium from the
        epithelium of the glans</li>

        <li>Places the device (which sometimes requires the surgeon
        to make a dorsal slit)</li>

        <li>Leaves the device in situ long enough to produce
        hemostasis and amputation of the foreskin<sup><a
        href="#n6">6</a></sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text1">Males have traditionally undergone
      circumcision for a variety of reasons, besides the prevention
      of phimosis. The procedure has been performed to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Enhance the man;s sexual performance</li>

        <li>Give him societal prestige</li>

        <li>Sacrifice a piece of the his flesh to fertility
        gods</li>

        <li>Demonstrate his membership in a particular tribe</li>

        <li>Demonstrate his ability to withstand pain</li>

        <li>Enable him to become like his circumcised father</li>

        <li>Allow him to conform to social practice</li>

        <li>Protect him from infant urinary tract infections
        (UTIs)</li>

        <li>Protect him from sexually transmitted diseases
        (STDs),AIDS, and cancer of the penis</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text1">Except among Jews, for whom male
      circumcision has long been a religious ritual, the practice
      does not appear to have been widespread in the United States
      before the 1940s.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> The customary
      reason for the acceptance of neonatal circumcision is that it
      promotes genital hygiene and prevents genital diseases.
      Acceptance was also grounded in the anti-masturbation
      hysteria of the late 1800s. It was feared that a young boy
      who had to pull his foreskin back to wash his penis might, by
      doing so, learn to masturbate&mdash;a practice then widely
      believed to lead to insanity and numerous other
      illnesses.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Although researchers cannot know the exact
      number, they estimate that about a sixth of the world;s
      current male population can be considered circumcised, mostly
      for religious reasons.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimates that 1.2
      million newborn males are circumcised annually in the United
      States, at a cost ranging from $150 million to $270
      million.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Circumcision rates
      vary widely, both in this country (80 percent of Midwestern
      male babies are circumcised, versus less than 40 percent of
      those born in the West) and in other parts of the
      English-speaking world (17 percent of Canadian male babies
      are circumcised, versus only 5 percent of those born in
      Britain). Elsewhere in Europe, in South America, and in
      non-Muslim Asia, the procedure is rare.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In 2003, Arizona, Missouri, Montana, and
      North Carolina joined six other states&mdash;California,
      Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, and
      Washington&mdash;in refusing to offer Medicaid reimbursement
      for circumcision for any reasons, including religious
      belief.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Legislators in those
      states apparently believe that if people have to pay for the
      procedure out of their own pockets, few will opt for it. And,
      indeed, research indicates that neonatal male circumcision is
      emerging as a cultural ritual in the United States rather
      than a medical necessity. Today the decision to have
      circumcision performed is likely to be more emotional than
      rational. Esthetics, cultural attitudes, social pressures,
      and tradition seem to be the impetus for the procedure. What
      was formerly thought of as a medical act has now become a
      cultural one.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Medically speaking, the foreskin has three
      main functions: protective, immunological, and
      erogenous.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> The foreskin is
      not just penile skin necessary for a natural erection; it is
      specialized tissue that is richly supplied with blood
      vessels, highly innervated, and uniquely endowed with stretch
      receptors. The foreskin contributes significantly to the
      sexual response of the intact male. It also provides a
      natural lubricant that, among other things, prevents the
      entry of STDs, viral and bacterial. In incontinent infants,
      the foreskin fulfills an essential function of protecting the
      glans.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The development of the foreskin (or prepuce,
      as it is also known) is incomplete in the newborn male child;
      separation from the glans, rendering it intractable, does not
      usually occur until sometime between nine months and three
      years of age. Neonatal male circumcision traumatically
      interrupts the natural separation of the foreskin from the
      glans. Because physicians must tear skin from sensitive
      glans, the procedure interferes with penile
      development.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">According to the medical literature,
      complications from this surgery normally occur in no more
      than 5 percent of cases, although they can be so severe as to
      result in loss of the penis or even death.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Unfortunately, such complications
      are often overlooked and underreported. They include
      lacerations, skin loss, skin bridges, chordee, meatitis,
      stenosis, urinary retention, glans necrosis hemorrhage,
      sepsis, gangrene, and meningitis.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> One medical ethicist notes that,
      "although precise estimates are difficult to give due to,
      among other factors, concealment of the event when it occurs,
      responsible commentators nevertheless place the number of
      circumcision-caused deaths in the United States annually at
      well over 200."<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Other writers
      estimate that between 2 percent and 10 percent of
      circumcisions result in that morbidity and death.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Long-term adverse outcomes are often not
      recognized until years later, often not until the start of
      sexual activity. Circumcision typically involves the removal
      of one-third of the entire penile skin, resulting in a
      significant loss of erogenous tissue. The loss of erogenous
      tissue can alter sexual functioning. In a study of 313
      circumcised males, nearly 50 percent said they had a sense of
      having been violated, 62 percent felt they had been
      mutilated, and 84 percent reported some degree of sexual harm
      (progressive loss of glans sensitivity, excess stimulation
      needed to reach orgasm, painful coitus, and
      impotence).<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Opponents of
      neonatal male circumcision argue that the procedure is
      unnecessary and that "greater awareness of the incidence and
      scope of associated complications will encourage a more
      carefully considered decision on whether or not to
      circumcise."<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Is Circumcision Mutilation?</b><br />
       Circumcision proponents argue that it is not a form of
      mutilation but, rather, a procedure similar to breast
      reduction, liposuction, and rhinoplasty&mdash;that is,
      essentially cosmetic surgery.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup>
      To determine whether the procedure constitutes mutilation,
      one must review the potential harms and benefits. Two
      bioethicists, Michael and David Benatar surveyed the medical
      literature and came to the conclusion that neonatal
      circumcision has both harms and benefits, with the benefits
      slightly outweighing the harms.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> They conclude that the procedure is
      a suitable matter for parental discretion.</p>

      <p class="text1">On the other hand, the Benatars found that
      circumcision is often practiced without anesthesia or with
      inadequate analgesia&mdash;even though well-documented
      studies have shown that neonates are capable of feeling
      pain.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> According to the AMA,
      "based on recent survey data, 54% of pediatricians, family
      practitioners, and obstetricians perform at least 1
      circumcision per month. Of physicians performing
      circumcision, 45% use anesthesia, most commonly dorsal penile
      block with lidocaine (71% of pediatricians, 56% of family
      practitioners, 25% of obstetricians). Those physicians who
      reported not using anesthesia cited concern about adverse
      effects and a belief that circumcision does not warrant
      anesthesia."<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The Benatars recommend the use of topical
      analgesia with a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream
      (containing small amounts of lidocaine and prilocaine),
      dorsal penile nerve block, and ring block (another form of
      anesthesia).<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> The AAP suggests
      that placing the baby in a comfortably padded bed and rubbing
      sucrose on his pacifier may reduce distress (and crying)
      during circumcision; acetaminophen, the academy says, may
      provide analgesia after the immediate postoperative
      period.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> One could criticize
      the Benatars for failing to cite recent medical literature
      indicating that neonates not only experience pain; they may
      also, as they grow older, suffer from a reduced sensitivity
      to pain as a result of inadequately controlled pain in
      infancy.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> In any case, all
      medical authorities recommend the use of analgesia both
      during the procedure and postoperatively in reducing the
      associated pain and distress.</p>

      <p class="text1">As for complications resulting from
      circumcision, the Benatars argue that the "consensus, even
      among those reporting high complication rates, is that the
      incidence of clinically significant complications is very
      low. It is commonly believed to be around 0.19% to 1.55%. It
      is also believed that even where there are complications, the
      majority of these either resolve spontaneously or are easily
      resolved by simple medical intervention."<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">One of the benefits attributed to neonatal
      circumcision involves penile cancer. Proponents of routine
      circumcision cite the extremely low incidence of penile
      cancer in Israel (0.1 per 100,000 males), where the procedure
      is even more prevalent than in the United States (which has a
      penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1 per 100,000), the vast
      majority of whose males are circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> Cancer of the penis is admittedly a
      rare disease, and the literature shows the relationship
      between circumcision and penile cancer to be difficult to
      evaluate. Nevertheless, circumcision opponents note that the
      incidence of penile cancer is higher in the United States
      than in Denmark (0.82 per 100,000 males), where circumcision
      is extremely uncommon. Studies indicate that, although
      neonatal circumcision offers some protection from penile
      cancer, circumcision at a later stage does not seem to confer
      the same level of protection. None of these studies can be
      considered definitive, however, and it is difficult to
      estimate the risk based on them. The AAP has concluded that
      "in a developed country such as in the United States, penile
      cancer is a rare disease and the risk of penile cancer in an
      uncircumcised man, although increased compared with a
      circumcised man, is low."<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The medical literature does indicate a
      relationship between UTI and circumcision, the consensus
      being that circumcision is associated with a lower incidence
      of UTI. (The studies do not, however, agree about the
      magnitude of the increased risk for uncircumcised boys;
      indeed, their estimates of the risk range from 3.7-fold, on
      one hand, to 12-fold, on the other.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup>) According to the AAP:</p>

      <p class="text1">All studies that have examined the
      association between UTI and circumcision status show an
      increased rate of UTI in uncircumcised males, with the
      greatest risk in infants younger than 1 year of age. The
      magnitude of the effect varies among studies. Using numbers
      from the literature, one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000
      uncircumcised male infants will develop a UTI during the
      first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised
      male infants. Although the relative risk of UTI in
      uncircumcised male infants compared with circumcised male
      infants is increased from 4-to as much as 10-fold during the
      first year of life, the absolute risk of developing a UTI in
      an uncircumcised male infant is low (at most, 1%).<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">It appears that circumcision may slightly
      reduce the risk of developing UTIs.</p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, some research indicates that
      uncircumcised males are at higher risk for both STDs and
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. There are other
      studies that suggest that uncircumcised males have a reduced
      risk for STDs, especially for syphilis, genital ulcer disease
      (GUD), gonorrhea, and herpes. And still other studies have
      found that it makes no difference in this regard whether one
      is circumcised or not.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup>
      However, R. S. Van Howe, an opponent of male circumcision,
      argues that "no solid epidemiological evidence has been found
      to support the theory that circumcision prevents STDs. . . .
      The only consistent trend is that uncircumcised males may be
      more susceptible to GUD, while circumcised men are more prone
      to urethritis."<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> Given the
      available data, the best one can say is that circumcision
      will give a male some protection from STDs.</p>

      <p class="text1">A substantial amount of medical data
      concerns the association of circumcision and HIV infection.
      One team of researchers reviewed 30 studies, finding that 22
      of them (including two prospective studies) documented a
      statistically significant association between the
      uncircumcised state and HIV infection, with those who are
      circumcised being less likely to become HIV infected.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> A study led by Bertran Auvert, PhD,
      Universite Versailles Saint-Quentin, France, and presented at
      the July 2005 3rd International AIDS Society Conference on
      HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, discovered that "adult male
      circumcision has been found to provide a 65% protective
      effect against infection for HIV in a randomized trial of
      more than 3,035 sexually active, heterosexual men in South
      Africa." The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
      immediately issued a statement saying that "UNAIDS emphasizes
      that more research is needed to confirm the reproducibility
      of the findings of this trial and whether or not the findings
      have more general application."<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">According to the AAP, "There does appear to
      be a plausible biologic explanation for this association in
      that the mucous surface of the uncircumcised penis allows for
      viral attachment to lymphoid cells at or near the surface of
      the mucous membrane, as well as an increased likelihood of
      minor abrasions resulting in increased HIV access to target
      tissues."<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> Both the AAP and
      the Benatars conclude that behavioral factors appear to be
      more important factors in the disease;s development than
      whether one is circumcised or not. In most of the data
      reviewed for this article, an increased chance of HIV
      infection was present only in groups that were already at
      high risk for HIV infection for other reasons.</p>

      <p class="text1">A review of the medical data regarding the
      benefits and risks of neonatal circumcision yields no
      definitive answer to whether it is or is not medically
      indicated. In recent years, however, neonatal circumcision
      has become a <i>legal</i> issue. On December 19, 2000,
      William G. Stowell, an 18-year-old man filed suit in U.S.
      district court in New York against the physician who had
      circumcised him as a newborn and against the hospital in
      which the procedure occurred.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>
      The issue involved informed consent. A nurse had obtained
      consent for the circumcision from the plaintiff's mother. The
      plaintiff argued that, because his mother was then
      debilitated by the effects of a cesarean section and
      painkillers, the consent was invalid.</p>

      <p class="text1">The suit also questioned whether a physician
      could legally and ethically remove healthy, normal tissue
      from a non-consenting minor for nontherapeutic reasons. In
      April 2003, Stowell settled with the physician and the
      hospital in what had by then become a landmark case. The
      terms of the settlement have not been publicly disclosed.
      Even so, the case has moved the discussion of neonatal male
      circumcision into the nation's courtrooms, guaranteeing that
      more such cases will be filed in the future.</p>

      <p class="text1">If we are to determine whether neonatal male
      circumcision should continue to be a routine procedure in the
      United States, we must ask what is best for the newborn,
      whether parents have a legal right to consent to a procedure
      that appears largely nontherapeutic, and whether the
      procedure violates the ethical requirement of minimizing the
      risks to the patient.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Ethical Analysis</b><br />
       The medical evidence concerning whether neonatal
      circumcision is beneficial or harmful to newborn males is
      equivocal. The legal issue regarding the potential liability
      of physicians and hospitals is unresolved. Nevertheless,
      because people seek moral clarity, the ethical dimension of
      the controversy has taken on a new urgency.</p>

      <p class="text1">Proponents of circumcision argue that since
      it is not (as they believe) a form of mutilation, but merely
      an alteration of the person;s appearance, and since it can be
      said to yield neither medical gains nor losses, the procedure
      should be left to the discretion of parents, who will act in
      the best interest of their child. Opponents argue that (as
      they believe) since the procedure is nontherapeutic and
      unsupported by clear medical evidence, it should be deferred
      until the child reaches adulthood and can make his own
      informed decision. To determine whether the procedure is
      ethical, I will use the principles of <i>respect for
      persons</i>, <i>beneficence</i> (including
      <i>nonmaleficence</i>), and <i>justice</i> to examine both
      sides of the issue.</p>

      <p class="text1">Respect for Persons This principle
      incorporates two ethical convictions&mdash;first, that
      individuals should be treated as autonomous agents; second,
      that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to
      protection. Seen in this way, the principle implies two
      further moral requirements&mdash;a requirement to acknowledge
      autonomy and a requirement to protect those with diminished
      autonomy.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Since children are minors and lack
      decisional capacity, parents are given a legal right to grant
      informed permission for diagnosis and treatment on the
      child;s behalf. These decisions are understood to be based on
      the child;s "best interest."</p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents argue that the procedure should be
      delayed until the individual can give informed consent for
      himself. Opponents believe that parents are entitled to give
      consent to surgical procedures for their children only when
      medical necessity is immediate and clear.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> Some such critics go so far as to
      call neonatal circumcision an "assault" and equivalent to
      child abuse. "Male neonatal circumcision is neither a
      diagnostic procedure nor a treatment of a disease," one
      organization says. "Thus nontherapeutic circumcision is, in
      effect, an act of battery. No parent can grant consent for an
      act of battery. By this reasoning, 'parental consent; for a
      nontherapeutic, nondiagnostic circumcision on a child appears
      to be invalid."<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Proponents, on the other hand, argue that
      parents have the right to give appropriate permission for
      medical procedures that they believe are in the best interest
      of the child. The Benatars argue that prophylactic
      immunizations of children are acceptable, even when no clear
      and immediate medical necessity is apparent; they suggest
      that the same reasoning supports neonatal
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> The Benatars
      agree that parents; right to give permission for medical
      procedures is not unlimited; parents should not, for example,
      be allowed to grant permission for procedures that are
      unequivocally harmful to the child. However, circumcision is
      not harmful, and, in fact, postponing the procedure until the
      child becomes an adult can result in psychological
      unpleasantness and increased risks; and any benefits obtained
      from a delayed procedure would be significantly reduced.</p>

      <p class="text1">In disputing the point, J. Steven Svoboda, a
      legal expert, cites studies indicating that infants probably
      suffer more greatly from the pain of male circumcision than
      adults do.<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> Moreover,
      researchers have documented the serious lifelong
      psychological damage inflicted by the procedure, which can
      include post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and a
      host of other sequelae.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The issue of informed consent comes into
      play here. The evidence clearly shows that that most parents
      are not told of the procedure;s benefits and risks and that
      few, if any, are given the option of no treatment.
      Non-circumcision is a viable alternative, as is delaying the
      procedure until adulthood. Failure to give parents this
      valuable information&mdash;including the fact that more than
      200 circumcision-caused deaths occur annually in the United
      States&mdash;is a direct violation of the principle of
      informed consent. Physicians can never place parental desires
      over the needs of the child. The physician;s responsibility
      is to provide parents with the objective information they
      need to make a well-reasoned decision that is in the child;s
      best interest.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">It is important that physicians not coerce
      or bias parents in their decision making. In this case, being
      noncoercive would include reassuring parents that deciding to
      circumcise is medically acceptable&mdash;as is deciding
      <i>not</i> to circumcise, or to delay making the decision. In
      addition, the physician should, first, make sure the parents
      are making their decision with accurate information, and,
      second, give them a step-by-step explanation of the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup> Besides
      determining what constitutes informed consent, the physician
      should also confirm the validity of the consent. As noted
      above, even though William Stowell;s mother was debilitated
      by the effects of a cesarean section and painkillers, a nurse
      obtained consent from her to circumcise William. How many
      other cases like this have occurred? Lack of education, false
      information, questionable legal validity, and even bias can
      result in a failure of genuinely informed consent. Any one of
      these factors will undermine patient autonomy; collectively,
      they clearly violate the basic principle of respect for
      persons.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Beneficence</b><br />
       This principle obliges one to prevent and remove harm to
      another person and to promote his or her good by minimizing
      possible harms and maximizing possible benefits. Beneficence
      includes <i>nonmaleficence</i>, which prohibits the
      infliction of harm, injury, and death on others. In medical
      ethics, the principle is closely associated with the maxim
      <i>Primum non nocere</i>: "Above all, do no harm."</p>

      <p class="text1">Medical research shows that neonatal male
      circumcision protects against the development of phimosis,
      balanitis (inflammation of the glans), and paraphimosis (a
      problem, seen in elderly men, requiring intermittent or
      chronic bladder catheterization).<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> Other medical benefits from male
      circumcision include reduced incidence of penile cancer,
      reduced incidence of UTIs, possible reduced susceptibility to
      certain STDs, and (in high risk groups) a possible reduced
      risk of HIV.</p>

      <p class="text1">On the other hand, circumcision can lead to
      the problems discussed above: lacerations, skin loss, skin
      bridges, chordee, meatitis, stenosis, urinary retention,
      glans necrosis, penile loss, hemorrhage, sepsis, gangrene,
      meningitis, and even death. Given the possible medical
      complications that are possible and the fact that the
      procedure is nontherapeutic, it seems advisable for parents
      to defer the decision to circumcise until the child can give
      assent or legal consent. "It might be an indication of the
      procedure;s long-term lack of viability that only one out of
      every 200 intact American men opts for circumcision in
      adulthood."<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Evidence suggests that North American men
      who have been circumcised are becoming more aware of the
      mutilation and harm that has been done to them and, as a
      result, are seeking methods of replacing the lost
      prepuce.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> The root of this
      reaction seems to be a realization that a perfectly normal,
      healthy, sexually responsive part of their penis was
      surgically amputated when these men were too young to
      consent, refuse, or resist.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup>
      In addition, research has shown that neonatal circumcision is
      usually performed without anesthesia and that postoperative
      pain is rarely addressed. The pain and stress caused by
      circumcision can contribute to breast-feeding failure, which
      can in turn have an effect on neonatal development.<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Neonatal male circumcision fails the test of
      beneficence because the minor benefits that might result from
      the procedure do not outweigh its potential harms and risks.
      Indeed, recent policy statements issued by professional
      societies representing Australian, Canadian, and American
      pediatricians do not recommend routine circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> The procedure also fails the test of
      nonmaleficence because the removal of functioning, healthy
      body tissue in the name of tradition, custom, or a
      non-disease-related cause intentionally inflicts bodily harm,
      injury, and, in rare cases, even death on vulnerable minors.
      This is clearly contrary to the basic tenet of medical
      ethics: "First do no harm."</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Justice</b><br />
       This principle recognizes that each person should be treated
      fairly and equitably and be given his or her due. It can be
      applied to neonatal circumcision in two ways.</p>

      <p class="text1">First, questions of justice have been raised
      about the legal right to bodily integrity of these vulnerable
      patients. One problem with circumcision, besides pain and
      possible complications, is the loss by the infant of the
      inherent value of an intact penis. To circumcise a person is
      to violate his bodily integrity, which is a direct violation
      of the principle of justice. Many people see male
      circumcision as cruel and degrading because it detracts from
      the appearance and function of the male sex organ by removing
      large amounts of healthy, functional, protective erogenous
      tissue. To mutilate and degrade any individual is a violation
      of the principle of justice.</p>

      <p class="text1">Second, circumcision specifically involves
      the issue of distributive justice, which concerns the fair
      and equitable allocation of medical resources. As noted, more
      than a million U.S. males are circumcised each year, at a
      cost estimated to be as high as $270 million. A cost-benefit
      analysis of neonatal male circumcision has found it not to be
      cost effective; indeed, in contrast to most medical
      interventions, which cost money but preserve or restore
      health, neonatal male circumcision costs money and may reduce
      health.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> Today the United
      States has 46 million uninsured people and countless others
      who are underinsured. Spending hundreds of millions of
      dollars a year on a nontherapeutic surgery that has, at best,
      debatable benefits for the child is a direct violation of the
      principle of distributive justice. The primary beneficiary of
      male circumcision seems to be the medical community. As an
      organization opposed to the procedure notes, "Physicians
      receive an estimated $200 million in fees for 1,100,000
      circumcisions performed annually in the United States, while
      hospitals receive an estimated $500 million due to longer
      stays for both mother and infant when circumcision is
      performed."<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Medical resources in this country and
      worldwide are limited and must be conserved. Proper
      stewardship of these resources entails not wasting them on
      treatments that have questionable outcomes and can be deemed
      inappropriate. These resources must be rationally allocated;
      to waste them is ethically irresponsible and morally
      objectionable.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>The Catholic Perspective</b><br />
       In the <i>Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic
      Health Care Services</i> (ERDs), Directive 29 states clearly
      that "bodily integrity" must always be respected:</p>

      <p class="text1">"All persons served by Catholic health care
      have the right and duty to protect and preserve their bodily
      and functional integrity. The functional integrity of the
      person may be sacrificed to maintain the health or life of
      the person when no other morally permissible means is
      available."<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup> Directive 33
      states that any therapeutic procedure that causes harm to a
      patient can be justified only if the benefits outweigh the
      burdens: "The well-being of the whole person must be taken
      into account in deciding about any therapeutic intervention
      or use of technology. Therapeutic procedures that are likely
      to cause harm or undesirable side-effects can be justified
      only by a proportionate benefit to the patient."<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> The <i>Catechism of the Catholic
      Church</i> states that "except when performed for strictly
      therapeutic reasons, directly intended amputations,
      mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent persons
      are against the moral law."<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Examining neonatal male circumcision in
      light of these moral directives, one can conclude that the
      amputation of normal, healthy foreskin for nontherapeutic
      purposes not only violates the child;s bodily integrity but
      also is a medical procedure whose benefits do not clearly
      outweigh the risks. The ERDs state clearly that such
      procedures can be justified if there is a proportionate
      benefit to the patient. But neonatal male circumcision fails
      the test of proportionality because the questionable
      therapeutic benefit is overbalanced by the certainty of
      permanent injury to the penis; the loss of protective,
      immunological, mechanical, sensory, erogenous, and sexual
      functions; as well as the risk to health and life inherent in
      every circumcision.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> Neonatal
      male circumcision may be appropriate for religious reasons,
      but after one makes a thorough examination of the medical
      literature and a comprehensive ethical analysis, one sees
      quite clearly that it should not be a routine medical
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1">Some ethicists have tried to justify
      circumcision under the Catholic moral principle of totality.
      As one writer notes, the principle of totality "is merely the
      fact that the parts of a physical entity, as parts, are
      ordained to the good of the physical whole. Since the good of
      the whole is the fundamental meaning of, and reason for, the
      existence of the parts, there is no violation of the right
      order in the destruction of the parts, when this is necessary
      for the good of the whole."<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup>
      What this principle states is that the parts exist and
      function for the good of the whole and are thus naturally
      subordinated to the good of the whole body. Thus when one
      body part&mdash;such as a gangrenous arm&mdash;becomes
      detrimental to the good of the whole body, it can be
      medically amputated. But there are limitations to amputations
      and mutilations, in that they must be necessary for the good
      of the whole body. Pope Pius XI clarified this when he said,
      "Furthermore, Christian doctrine establishes, and the light
      of human reason makes it most clear, that private individuals
      have no other power over the members of their own bodies than
      that which pertains to their natural ends: and they are not
      free to destroy or mutilate their members, or in any other
      way render themselves unfit for their natural functions,
      except when no other provision can be made for the good of
      the whole body."<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The principle of totality was further
      clarified by Pope Pius XII, on the occasion of his address to
      the First International Congress on the Histopathology of the
      Nervous System. He said:</p>

      <p class="text1">Considered as a whole, the physical organism
      of living beings, of plants, animals, or man has a unity
      subsisting in itself. Each of the members, for example, the
      hand, the foot, the heart, the eye, is an integral part
      destined by all its being to be inserted into the whole of
      the organism. Outside the organism it has not, by its very
      nature, any sense, any finality. . . . What results as far as
      the physical organism is concerned? The master and user of
      this organism, which possesses a subsisting unity, can
      dispose directly and immediately of the integral parts,
      members, and organs, within the scope of their natural
      finality. He can also intervene, as often as, and to the
      extent that, the good of the whole demands, to paralyze,
      destroy, mutilate, and separate the members.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The Catholic Church teaches that God created
      us in God's image and likeness (<a
      href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Gen+1%3A27-28"
      target="_blank">Gn 1:27-28</a>). It follows then that God
      created males with normal, healthy foreskins for the purpose
      of protecting the glans, providing natural lubrication to
      prevent dryness, and contributing significantly to the sexual
      response of the intact male. To surgically remove the
      foreskin for hygienic reasons, and/or to obtain other
      questionable benefits that absorb medical resources costing
      over $200 million a year is not only ethically unjustifiable
      but morally irresponsible, especially when such procedures
      can lead to serious injury and even death. Besides the
      possible harm the procedure can inflict on a
      child&mdash;which violates the basic tenet of Catholic health
      care of treating every person with dignity and
      respect&mdash;it also violates Catholic health care;s mandate
      to be responsible stewards of medical resources. When
      millions of people in the United States and around the world
      lack basic health care, the provision of a nontherapeutic
      procedure&mdash;especially one that is unnecessary, costly,
      and in some cases fatal&mdash;is irresponsible and a
      violation of the moral law. Therefore, it is unethical and
      immoral for Catholic health care institutions to continue to
      allow neonatal male circumcisions, except out of respect for
      religious practices of other faith traditions. Respecting the
      religious beliefs and practices of other faiths is confirmed
      in the ERDs.</p>

      <p class="text1">Culture Is No Excuse Some ethicists have
      tried to justify neonatal male circumcision under the
      principle of totality for cultural reasons. The practice may
      have a powerful cultural value for many people. But the fact
      that something is culturally valued does not mean that it is
      also morally acceptable. History is full of examples of
      cultural traditions that run the gamut from the detrimental
      to the morally reprehensible&mdash;foot binding and widow
      burning are but two examples. As the Benatars have noted, "It
      is all too easy (and common) to privilege those cultural ways
      to which one is accustomed on account of their familiarity.
      There is value in stepping back from one;s cultural
      assumptions. When one views male circumcision from another
      cultural perspective, one can only wonder what possessed
      ancient people to first think of removing the
      foreskin."<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">To justify male circumcision for cultural
      reasons could be seen as a precedent that supports the
      justification of female circumcision for cultural reasons. To
      justify one of these practices because of its cultural
      acceptance is to start down the slippery slope toward
      justifying the other as socially acceptable.</p>

      <p class="text1">Barring religious obligation, there is
      little to recommend routine neonatal male circumcision. If
      promoting the dignity and respect of every human person is a
      priority for the United States and for Catholic health care,
      then it is time to better educate the public about this issue
      and protect those who are the most vulnerable in our society.
      Doing so is not only a social responsibility; it is a moral
      imperative as well.</p>

        334, who cite a 1980-1985 study of 136,086 boys born in
        U.S. Army hospitals. Among the 100,157 boys who were
        circumcised, 193 complications were noted (0.19 percent).
        These included 62 local infections, including 8 with
        bacteremia and 83 with hemorrhage (of the latter, 31
        required ligature and 3 required transfusion). Among the
        other cases were 24 instances of surgical trauma (too much
        or too little skin was removed in 15 cases) and 20 urinary
        tract infections (UTIs). In contrast, the complications
        seen among the 35,929 uncircumcised infants were all
        related to UTIs. See also T. E. Wiswell and D. W. Geschke,
