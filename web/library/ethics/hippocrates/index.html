    <h2>OATH OF HIPPOCRATES, Cerca 400 B.C.</h2>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>From "Harvard Classics, Volume 38" Copyright 1910 by P.F.
      Collier and Son.</p>

      <h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

      <p>HIPPOCRATES, the celebrated Greek physician, was a
      contemporary of the historian Herodotus. He was born in the
      island of Cos between 470 and 460 B.C., and belonged to the
      family that claimed descent from the mythical
      &AElig;sculapius, son of Apollo. There was already a long
      medical tradition in Greece before his day, and this he is
      supposed to have inherited chiefly through his predecessor
      Herodicus; and he enlarged his education by extensive travel.
      He is said, though the evidence is unsatisfactory, to have
      taken part in the efforts to check the great plague which
      devastated Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war.
      He died at Larissa between 380 and 360 B.C.</p>

      <p>The works attributed to Hippocrates are the earliest
      extant Greek medical writings, but very many of them are
      certainly not his. Some five or six, however, are generally
      granted to be genuine, and among these is the famous "Oath."
      This interesting document shows that in his time physicians
      were already organized into a corporation or guild, with
      regulations for the training of disciples, and with an esprit
      de corps and a professional ideal which, with slight
      exceptions, can hardly yet be regarded as out of date.</p>

      <p>One saying occurring in the words of Hippocrates has
      achieved universal currency, though few who quote it to-day
      are aware that it originally referred to the art of the
      physician. It is the first of his "Aphorisms": "Life is
      short, and the Art long; the occasion fleeting; experience
      fallacious, and judgment difficult. The physician must not
      only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to
      make the patient, the attendants, and externals
      cooperate."</p>

      <h3>THE OATH OF HIPPOCRATES</h3>

      <p>I SWEAR by Apollo the physician and &AElig;sculapius, and
      Health, and All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that,
      according to my ability and judgment,</p>

      <p>I will keep this Oath and this stipulation &mdash; to
      reckon him who taught me this Art equally dear to me as my
      parents, to share my substance with him, and relieve his
      necessities if required; to look upon his offspring in the
      same footing as my own brothers, and to teach them this art,
      if they shall wish to learn it, without fee or stipulation;
      and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of
      instruction,</p>

      <p>I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and
      those of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation
      and oath according to the law of medicine, but to none
      others.</p>

      <p>I will follow that system of regimen which, according to
      my ability and judgement, I consider for the benefit of my
      patients, <span class="yellow">and abstain from whatever is
      deleterious and mischievous.</span></p>

      <p>I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor
      suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give
      to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity and
      with holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art.</p>

      <p>I will not cut persons labouring under the stone, but will
      leave this to be done by men who are practitioners of this
      work. Into whatever houses I enter, I will go into them for
      the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from every
      voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and, further, from
      the seduction of females or males, of freemen and slaves.
      Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not
      in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men,
      which ought not to be spoken of abroad,</p>

      <p>I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be
      kept secret. While I continue to keep this Oath unviolated,
      may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the
      art, respected by all men, in all times. But should I
      trespass and violate this Oath, may the reverse be my
      lot.</p>
