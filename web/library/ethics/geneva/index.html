    <h2>The World Medical Association<br />
    Declaration of Geneva (1948)<br />
    Physician's Oath</h2>

    <div class="corpus">
      <h4>Adopted by the General Assembly of the World Medical
      Association, Geneva, Switzerland, September 1948 and amended
      by the 22nd World Medical Assembly, Sydney, Australia, August
      1968.</h4>

      <h3>CIRP Introduction</h3>

      <p class="cirp">The <a href="http://www.wma.net/"
      target="_blank">World Medical Association</a> is an
      association of national medical associations. This oath seems
      to be a response to the atrocities committed by doctors in
      Nazi Germany. Notably, this oath requires the physician to
      "not use [his] medical knowledge contrary to the laws of
      humanity." This document was adopted by the World Medical
      Association only three months before the United Nations
      General Assembly adopted the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights (1948)</a> which provides for the security of
      the person.</p>

      <h3>Physician's Oath</h3>

      <p>At the time of being admitted as a member of the medical
      profession:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I solemnly pledge myself to consecrate my life to the
        service of humanity;</li>

        <li>I will give to my teachers the respect and gratitude
        which is their due;</li>

        <li>I will practice my profession with conscience and
        dignity; <span class="yellow">the health of my patient will
        be my first consideration;</span></li>

        <li>I will maintain by all the means in my power, the honor
        and the noble traditions of the medical profession; my
        colleagues will be my brothers;</li>

        <li>I will not permit considerations of religion,
        nationality, race, party politics or social standing to
        intervene between my duty and my patient;</li>

        <li>I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from
        the time of conception, even under threat, <span
        class="yellow">I will not use my medical knowledge contrary
        to the laws of humanity;</span></li>

        <li>I make these promises solemnly, freely and upon my
        honor.</li>
      </ul>
