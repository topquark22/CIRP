<B>Page 9:</B><P>
<blockquote><P align="justify">
As is discussed in later chapters, the law is changing to accommodate
trends such as that of unmarried parenthood by re-examining the legal issue
of parental responsibility and, in case law, by insisting that consent from
one parent alone is insufficient for non-therapeutic interventions such as
male infant circumcision (see section 6.1.1). In our view, while
uncertainty remains regarding the extent to which practice will change in
relation to minors' rights as a result of the <A HREF="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs" target="_blank">Human Rights Act</A>, such rights
are increasingly seen as an important matter for debate and re-evaluation,
etc. It is conceivable, therefore, that as we become more accustomed to
looking at a range of issues, such as health care, through the prism of
human rights, views about parental authority over competent children will
also undergo significant change.</blockquote>

<B>Page 107 Refusal of Treatment</B>
<blockquote><P align="justify">
Consent allows treatment to be given, but does not require health
professionals to treat. A decision whether to provide treatment on the
basis of consent from one parent may be influenced by the view of the other.
Although the law does not require that parents agree, in practice doctors
are reluctant to override the strongly held views of a parent, particularly
where the benefits and burdens of the treatment are finely balanced and it
is not clear what is best for the child. Disputes between parents can be
difficult for everybody involved in the child's care. Health professionals
need to be able to distinguish between a genuine concern of the dissenting
parent and an objection that is simply an extension of a marital dispute.
Discussion aimed at reaching a consensus should be attempted. If this
fails, a decision must be made by the clinician in charge whether to go
ahead despite the disagreement. The onus is then on the parent who refuses
treatment to take steps to stop it. If the dispute is over a
controversial, elective procedure, for example male infant circumcision for
religious purposes, doctors must not proceed without the authority of a
court. (Reference: <A HREF="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/cases/Re_J.htm" target="_blank">Re J (A Minor)</A> (Prohibited Steps Order: Circumcision),
