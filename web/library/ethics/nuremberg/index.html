      <h3>CIRP Introduction</h3>

      <p class="cirp">The judgment by the war crimes tribunal at
      Nuremberg laid down 10 standards to which physicians must
      conform when carrying out experiments on human subjects in a
      new code that is now accepted worldwide.</p>

      <p class="cirp">This judgment established a new standard of
      ethical medical behavior for the post World War II human
      rights era. Amongst other requirements, this document
      enunciates the requirement of <i>voluntary informed
      consent</i> of the human subject. The principle of voluntary
      informed consent protects the right of the individual to
      control his own body.</p>

      <p class="cirp">This code also recognizes that the risk must
      be weighed against the expected benefit, and that unnecessary
      pain and suffering must be avoided.</p>

      <p class="cirp">This code recognizes that doctors should
      avoid actions that injure human patients.</p>

      <p class="cirp">The principles established by this code for
      medical practice now have been extened into general codes of
      medical ethics.</p>

      <h3>Permissible Medical Experiments</h3>

      <p align="left">The great weight of the evidence before us to
      effect that certain types of medical experiments on human
      beings, when kept within reasonably well-defined bounds,
      conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally.
      The protagonists of the practice of human experimentation
      justify their views on the basis that such experiments yield
      results for the good of society that are unprocurable by
      other methods or means of study. All agree, however, that
      certain basic principles must be observed in order to satisfy
      moral, ethical and legal concepts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><span class="yellow">The voluntary consent of the human
        subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person
        involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should
        be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of
        choice, without the intervention of any element of force,
        fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form
        of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient
        knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject
        matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding
        and enlightened decision.</span> This latter element
        requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative
        decision by the experimental subject there should be made
        known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the
        experiment; the method and means by which it is to be
        conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be
        expected; and the effects upon his health or person which
        may possibly come from his participation in the
        experiment.<br />
        <br />
         The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality
        of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates,
        directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal
        duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to
        another with impunity.</li>

        <li>The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful
        results for the good of society, unprocurable by other
        methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary
        in nature.</li>

        <li>The experiment should be so designed and based on the
        results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the
        natural history of the disease or other problem under study
        that the anticipated results justify the performance of the
        experiment.</li>

        <li><span class="yellow">The experiment should be so
        conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental
        suffering and injury.</span></li>

        <li>No experiment should be conducted where there is an a
        priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury
        will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the
        experimental physicians also serve as subjects.</li>

        <li><span class="yellow">The degree of risk to be taken
        should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian
        importance of the problem to be solved by the
        experiment.</span></li>

        <li>Proper preparations should be made and adequate
        facilities provided to protect the experimental subject
        against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or
        death.</li>

        <li>The experiment should be conducted only by
        scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of
        skill and care should be required through all stages of the
        experiment of those who conduct or engage in the
        experiment.</li>

        <li>During the course of the experiment the human subject
        should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if
        he has reached the physical or mental state where
        continuation of the experiment seems to him to be
        impossible.</li>

        <li><span class="yellow">During the course of the
        experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to
        terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable
        cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith,
        superior skill and careful judgment required of him, that a
        continuation of the experiment is likely to result in
        injury, disability, or death to the experimental
        subject.</span></li>
