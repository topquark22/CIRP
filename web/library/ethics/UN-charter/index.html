    <h2>CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS (1945)</h2>
    <br />
    <br />

    <div class="corpus">
      <h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

      <h3>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COOPERATION</h3>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This file contains an extract of
      the human rights provisions of the Charter of the United
      Nation which was signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945. All
      members of the United Nations are bound by these provisions.
      This includes the United States of America.</p>

      <p class="cirp">The human rights provisions were a response
      to the widespread human rights violations of World War
      II.</p>

      <p class="cirp">Article 55 charges the United Nations to
      promote respect for and observance of universal human rights
      for all. Article 56 charges each member nation to help the UN
      to achieve goals set forth in Article 55. Article 60 vests
      this power in the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

      <p class="cirp">The post World War II human rights era began
      with these articles.]</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Article 55</b></p>

      <p>With a view to the creation of conditions of stability and
      well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly
      relations among nations based for respect for the principle
      of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, the United
      Nations shall promote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        (a) higher standards of living, full employment, and
        conditions of economic and social progress and
        development;<br />
        (b) solutions of international economic, social, health,
        and related problems; and international cultural and
        educational cooperation and<br />
        <span class="yellow">(c) universal respect for, and
        observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for
        all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or
        religion.</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="center"><b>Article 56</b></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">All members pledge themselves to take
      joint and separate action in cooperation with the
      Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in
      Article 55.</span></p>

      <p align="center"><b>Article 60</b></p>

      <p>Responsibility for the discharge of the functions of the
      Organization set forth in this Chapter shall be vested in the
      General Assembly and, under the authority of the General
      Assembly in the Economic and Social Council, which shall have
      for this purpose all the powers set forth in Chapter X.</p>
