            </h2>

            <p>At the XIII World Congress of Sexology in Valencia,
            Spain, June 1997, the following declaration was
            approved. See also the <a

            <h3 align="center">Valencia Declaration on Sexual
            Rights</h3>

            <p>We, the participants of the XIII World Congress of
            Sexology, declare that:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Sexuality is a changing and dynamic dimension of
              humanity. It is constructed through the interaction
              between the individual and social structures. It is
              present throughout the life cycle, harmonizing
              identity and creating and /or strengthening
              interpersonal bonds.<br />
              <br />
               Sexual pleasure, including autoeroticism, is a
              source of physical, psychological, intellectual and
              spiritual well-being. It is associated with a
              conflict-free and anxiety-free experience of
              sexuality, allowing, therefore, social and personal
              development.
            </blockquote>

            <p>We hereby urge that societies create the conditions
            to satisfy the needs for the full development of the
            individual and respect the following SEXUAL RIGHTS:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>The right to freedom</b>, which excludes all
              forms of sexual coercion, exploitation and abuse at
              any time and in all situations in life. The struggle
              against violence is a social priority. All children
              should be desired and loved.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><span class="yellow"><b>The right to autonomy,
              integrity and safety of the body</b>. This right
              encompasses control and enjoyment of our own bodies,
              free from torture, mutilation and violence of any
              sort.</span><br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><b>The right to sexual equity and equality</b>.
              This refers to freedom from all forms of
              discrimination, paying due respect to sexual
              diversity, regardless of sex, gender, age, race,
              social class, religion and sexual orientation.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><b>The right to sexual health</b>, including
              availability of all sufficient resources for
              development of research and the necessary knowledge
              of HIV/AIDS and STDs, as well as the further
              development of resources for research, diagnosis and
              treatment.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><b>The right to wide, objective and factual
              information on human sexuality</b> in order to allow
              decision-making regarding sexual life.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><b>The right to a comprehensive sexuality
              education</b> from birth and throughout the life
              cycle. All social institutions should be involved in
              this process.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><b>The right to associate freely</b>. This means
              the possibility to marry or not, to divorce, and to
              establish other types of sexual associations.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><b>The right to make free and responsible choices
              regarding reproductive life</b>, the number and
              spacing of children and the access to means of
              fertility regulation.<br />
              <br />
              </li>

              <li><span class="yellow"><b>The right to privacy</b>,
              which implies the capability of making autonomous
              decisions about sexual life within a context of
              personal and social ethics.</span> Rational and
              satisfactory experience of sexuality is a requirement
              for human development.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>Human sexuality is the origin of the deepest bond
            between human beings and is essential to the well-being
            of individuals, couples, families and society.
            Therefore, the respect for sexual rights should be
            promoted through all means.</b></p>

            <p align="center"><b>SEXUAL HEALTH IS A BASIC AND
            FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT.</b></p>
