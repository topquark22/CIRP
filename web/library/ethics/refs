The AAP has waffled all over this issue, which document from which year
are you referring to?

1) The motto of medicine, "First Do No Harm", although not a document, 
indicates that circumcision is not ethical. It must be recognized that
the child is normal as born and that circumcision inflicts loss of a
normal body part and leaves a scar.

2) In the Int'l J of Gyn & Obst, 1994; 46:127-135, N. Toubia says in
"FGM: Responsibility of Reproductive Health Professionals" that
the unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of
tradition, custom or any other non-disease related cause should
never be acceptable to the health profession ...and breaches fundamental
medical ethics.

3) In the British Medical Journal, May 1994; 308:1182-1183, JPH. Shield
says in "Children's Consent to Treatment" that children too young to give
consent must be treated as individuals. The child must live with the
outcome of decision.

You can see it yourself at:

Throughout this document it is clear that it is medical intervention that is
being discussed, not social customs that happen to involve amputating the
healthy prepuce from infants.
