<h2>CIRCUMCISION IN INFANCY</h2>

<I>TO THE EDITOR:</I>

<P>Doctors never raised the fuss when routine tonsillectomy was
phased out that circumcisers do today as circumcision is being
phased out. The reform of medical practice has never before generated
such emotionalism. When the ever-changing medical excuses are
stripped away, one is left questioning the motives of circumcisers.

<P>M. L. Dresner, in his editorial "Circumcision in Infancy,"
mistakenly claims that controversy over circumcision has been raging
for centuries.<SUP>1</SUP> American doctors did not start experimenting with
posthectomy until the 1870s, when it was used as a method of
desensitizing and denuding the penis in order to make masturbation
theoretically impossible.<SUP>2</SUP> Routine circumcision of infants became
widespread in the United States only after World War II. Dresner's
implication that intact males are dissatisfied, disease-ridden,
indolent failures who with there were only some way the end of the
penis could be cut off is nothing less than hate speech. Dresner's
military experiences reveal nothing about human anatomy but say
much about the control that military doctors exercised over the
lives, minds, and sexual organs of their enlisted subordinates.

<P>Circumcision always poses serious life-threatening and life-long
health risks for males. The complication rate may appear low, but
the potential for the complications to be tragic is high. It is
not that deaths due to circumcision are rare: it is that they are
rarely reported in medical journals. It is puzzling that Dresner
should be more concerned with a spurious 1.4% risk of urinary tract
infection (UTI), easily curable with antibiotics, than with a 1.5%
risk of significant and irreparable complications.<SUP>3,4</SUP> Wiswell's
UTI data have been disproved.<SUP>5,6</SUP> Controlled studies show that
circumcised men are more at risk for some sexually transmitted
diseases.<SUP>7-9</SUP> The myth that the intact penis is more difficult to
keep clean is a preposterous scare tactic invented by circumcisers.
It is irrational to circumcise babies because some parents have a
sexual attraction for the surgically denuded penises with which
they are familiar. Whose penis is it, anyway? It is the child who
must live with the consequences of the surgery. Ethically, only he
can make the decision to undergo nontherapeutic penile reduction
surgery to become more attractive to acrotomophiliacs.

<P>The central importance Dresner places on his having ordered his
own sons to be circumcised is beside the point. Parents from the
era of mass circumcision must be taught to accept normal human
reproductive anatomy. In the absence of immediate, life-threatening,
clinically verifiable medical indications, parents and doctors have
no right to remove body parts from children. There is a human right
to an intact body. American males deserve the right to control
their own reproductive organs. American males deserve the right to
refuse treatment or to seek alternative treatment. Forcing circumcision
on a male when he is too young to refuse is a violation of human
rights and medical ethics.
