        <h2>Convention on the Rights of the Child:<br />
        It's Time for the United States to Ratify</h2>
        Robert J. Haggerty, MD<br />

      <p class="text">On November 20, 1989, in an historic action,
      the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a treaty
      statement labeled "<a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/"
      target="_blank">The Convention on the Rights of the
      Child</a>." It was ratified within 4 months by the required
      20 countries to give it treaty status. <span
      class="yellow">The American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed it
      promptly</span>, but it has yet to be ratified by the
      appropriate governmental body in the United States - the
      Senate. The United States (US) is the only Western democracy
      not to have signed; to date over 157 countries worldwide have
      adopted the Convention - only 30 have not. To understand the
      reasons why the US has abstained requires outlining some of
      the major points of the treaty, particularly those that have
      been the basis for the US inaction.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The preamble affirms the
      fact that children because of their vulnerability, need
      special care and attention;</span> it also places special
      emphasis on the primary caring and protective
      responsibilities of the family. No pediatrician can dispute
      these affirmations.</p>

      <p class="text">A point of some debate emerges from Article
      1, which states that "... a child means every human being
      below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to
      the child, majority is attained earlier." In the US majority
      is attained at 18 years, but as Article 40 of the Convention
      outlines, "administration of the juvenile justice system must
      take the best interests of the child into account." This has
      been interpreted by some to mean interference with the trial
      and sentencing of juveniles who have committed capital
      offenses. This Article has been cited as one of the reasons
      the US has not ratified the Convention. Indeed, the US is one
      of only seven countries now legally permitting the death
      sentence (in those few states that so approve) for juveniles.
      The other six are Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
      and Barbados. With the news bringing us examples of juveniles
      who have been involved in killings in the United States each
      evening, it is not surprising that this issue seems to some
      to be a reason to oppose the treaty. As I read this Article,
      however, I do not see a problem. The Article states that "a
      child in conflict with the law has the right to treatment
      which promotes the child's sense of dignity and worth, takes
      the child's age into account, and aims at his or her
      reintegration into society." Other parts of this Article
      guarantee the child the right to be presumed innocent until
      proven guilty, to have legal assistance for his or her
      defense, to be judged by an impartial judicial body, and not
      be compelled to give testimony or confess guilt (all rights
      that we as adults possess). The Article also stipulates that
      each country shall establish a minimum age below which
      children shall be presumed not to have the capacity to
      infringe the penal law. In addition, all the evidence
      indicates that capital punishment is not deterrent to crime
      at any age.</p>

      <p class="text">Other objections have been raised about
      children serving in the armed forces, but Article 38
      specifically states that "parties shall take all feasible
      measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age
      of 15 years do not take a direct part in hostilities."
      Surely, we as a country observe and practice this. Perhaps
      some would disagree with another section of this Article that
      states "... in recruiting (for military service) among those
      persons who have attained the age of 15 years but who have
      not attained the age of 18 years, states' parties shall
      endeavor to give priority to those who are oldest." The
      United States allows 17-years-olds to enlist; Article 38 uses
      the words "shall endeavor," not the words "prohibit" or
      exclude" in reference to those under 18 years.</p>

      <p class="text">The other Articles seem to me to be ones all
      pediatricians support, such as supporting the rights of
      parents to provide guidance; the right of the child to have a
      name at birth, including a family name; to live with his or
      her parents (unless this is deemed incompatible with the
      child's best interests); the right to leave and reenter any
      country, especially for the purposes of maintaining the
      child-parent relationship; the right to prevent kidnapping;
      freedom of expression of his or her views, thoughts,
      religion; and freedom to meet with others for peaceful
      assembly. There are those who believe that this statement
      interferes with families' rights to bring up a child in their
      own religion. This is part of a larger fear of governments
      interfering with families. We who support this convention
      must acknowledge the sincere concern of those who see
      government as the enemy of family values. My view is that we
      all want to support families as the best way to support
      children and there are a number of rights in the treaty
      designed to protect the family and to ensure that parents
      have joint responsibility for raising [sic] the child, and
      more important that the state shall support them in this
      task. Perhaps some might object to this last point, but we
      already support parents in many ways. Pediatricians should
      applaud the Articles that guarantee the right to be protected
      from maltreatment, abuse and neglect. There are special
      Articles dealing with the right of children to education and
      the special concerns of children without families, those who
      are adopted, are refugees, or are exposed to child labor,
      drug abuse, and sexual exploitation. There are some families
      for whom the state must intervene for the benefit of the
      child, and there have been instances of overzealous state
      intervention into family life. But the common ground should
      be the support of parents to do the best for their
      children.</p>

      <p class="text">Health is dealt with in Articles 23 and 24,
      which state that "a disabled child has the right to special
      care, education and training, and the right to the highest
      standard of health and medical care attainable." Although we
      have not achieved these health goals in the United States,
      the entire Convention is a declaration of goals to be working
      toward, not necessarily the stage where we are today. The
      fimal Articles agree to a monitoring system in each country
      and require periodic reporting concerning the progress made
      toward reaching these goals. In addition to this Convention
      being a template by which all countries can be judged, it is
      a stimulus and guide for all to do better by our
      children.</p>

      <p class="text">In 1995, the XXIst World Congress of
      Pediatrics, to be held in Cairo, Egypt, from September 10
      through 14, will include a pre-Congress workshop to hear the
      progress of all countries toward achieving these goals and to
      examine how barriers to achieving these goals have been
      overcome.</p>

      <p class="text">In 1993, the Chapter Presidents Forum of the
      Academy passed a resolution asking that the Academy promote
      early ratification of the Treaty. <span class="yellow">The
      Executive Board of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in its
      February 1994, meeting, again endorsed the Convention and
      urged the United States to promptly submit the Convention to
      the US Senate for approval.</span> President Clinton in
      response to a letter I wrote him has asked me and the Academy
      to help build support for this action:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          I share your firm conviction that we must strive to
          protect the world's children, and I am determined to
          address this important challenge.
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      He has asked the State Department to ask each state to review
      the Convention to determine if it is consistent with state
      laws.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Pediatricians in their
      individual roles as advocates for children, as well as
      collectively through the AAP should support this action. The
      US should not have to face the shame of the rest of the world
      at the 1995 World Congress of Pediatrics. More importantly,
      pediatricians should work toward implementing the Articles in
      the Convention in our own country once we have ratified the
      treaty, so that we can be faithful to our goal of working
      "for the welfare of all children."</span></p>
