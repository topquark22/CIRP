      <p class="CIRP">[CIRP Note: Letter in response to article
      entitled <i>Suffer little children?</i> by Mr Nigel Zoltie,
      MB, ChB, FRCS(Eng), FFAEM, MAE, MEWI, which appeared in the
      <i>BMA News Review</i> on 8 August 1998. Mr Zoltie is chair
      of the Association of Reform and Liberal Mohelim.]</p>

      <h3 class="headline">Parental wishes are not the determining
      factor</h3>

      <p class="text1">Nigel Zoltie makes a valuable contribution
      to the debate about whether circumcision should be allowed,
      and whether doctors should participate, but incorrectly
      states that parents have ultimate decision-making powers.</p>

      <p class="text2">Decisions like this are inseparable from
      decisions about what is best for the child. <span
      class="highlight">Whatever treatments doctors provide for
      children must be in their best interests.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">But assessment of best interests is not
      based only on what parents want for their children. <span
      class="highlight">Parental responsibility only gives the
      right to do what is reasonable to promote the welfare of the
      child.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">The BMA ethics committee is writing a book
      for doctors on consent to and refusal of treatment that will
      give clear guidelines on these issues.</p>
