        <h2>European Charter of Children's Rights</h2>

        <p class="navlink"><strong>Priscilla Alderson</strong></p>
      </center>

      <p>In October, the <a
      href="http://each-for-sick-children.org/each.htm">European
      Association for Children in Hospital</a> (EACH) met in Graz,
      Austria with delegates from East and West Europe and
      Scandinavia. EACH works to promote the Charter for Children
      in Hospital throughout Europe. This paper discusses the
      Charter.</p>

      <p>Members of EACH have used the Charter as the basis for a
      range of activities, from a Michelin-type guide to good
      children's wards in France, to a finely illustrated Polish
      brochure showing how one hospital implements each section of
      the Charter. The ten points of the Charter (see p 14) offer
      an ethical foundation for the care of children in
      hospital.</p>

      <h3>International rights for children</h3>

      <p>Aspects of the Charter were reinforced by the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">1989 United Nations
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, now ratified by
      almost every nation state. Basically, the Convention
      advocates three kinds of rights for children. Adults are
      happy to discuss the first two kinds:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>rights to resources and care - good hospital care,
        food, warmth, safety, parents' loving care:</li>

        <li>rights to protection from harm - from neglect and
        abuse, from fear, pain and loneliness, from too many
        medical interventions or the neglect of being denied
        necessary treatment.</li>
      </ul>
      However, many are uneasy about the third kind: 

      <ul>
        <li>rights to self determination, dignity, respect,
        integrity, non-interference, the right to make informed
        personal decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some adults argue that if you let children decide for
      themselves, they will refuse medical treatment, because they
      are too ignorant, foolish and inexperienced to know their own
      best interests. Yet the right to self-determination is the
      key to all rights. You can talk about resources, care and
      protection under the heading of children's welfare or
      interests, but do not need to use rights language to promote
      these benefits.</p>

      <p>The right to choose is a crucial part of being a right
      holder. Alice Miller, the Swiss psychoanalyst, has shown (1)
      that centuries of harsh, even cruel, child-rearing illustrate
      differences between adults' ideas of `care', `protection',
      what is `right for children', versus children's rights to
      choose how they would live. Austria is one of very few
      countries, so far to ban all physical punishment of children
      by law, and to have a children's Ombudsman. Children form the
      only group of people in the UK who are not protected from
      assault.</p>

      <p>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child clearly
      states that some children have rights to influence decisions
      affecting them:</p>

      <blockquote>
        States shall assure to the child who is capable of forming
        his or her own views the right to express those views
        freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the
        child will be given due weight in accordance with the age
        and maturity of the child. (Convention 12.1) 

        <p>For this purpose, the child shall in particular be
        provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or
        administrative proceedings affecting the child, either
        directly, or though a representative or an appropriate body
        ... (12.2)</p>
      </blockquote>

        <h3>Charter for Children in Hospital</h3>

        <p>The right to the best possible medical treatment is a
        fundamental right, especially for children.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Children should be admitted to hospital only if
            care they require cannot be equally well provided at
            home or on a day basis.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children in hospital shall have the right to
            have their parents or parent substitute with them at
            all times.</b></li>

            <li><b>Accommodation should be offered to all parents,
            and they should be helped and encouraged to stay.
            Parents should not need to incur additional costs or
            suffer loss of income. In order to share in the care of
            their child, parents should be kept informed in a
            manner appropriate to age and understanding. Steps
            should be taken to mitigate physical or emotional
            stress.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children and parents shall have the right to be
            informed in a manner appropriate to age and
            understanding. Steps should be taken to mitigate
            physical or emotional stress.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children and parents have the right to informed
            participation in all decisions involving their health
            care. Every child shall be protected from unnecessary
            medical treatment and investigation.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children shall be cared for together with
            children who have the same developmental needs and
            shall not be admitted to adult wards. There should be
            no age restriction for visitors to children in
            hospital.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children shall have full opportunity for play,
            recreation and education suited to their age and
            condition and shall be in an environment designed,
            furnished, staffed and equipped to meet their
            needs.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children shall be cared for by staff whose
            training and skills enable them to respond to the
            physical, emotional and developmental needs of children
            and families.</b></li>

            <li><b>Continuity of care should be ensured by the team
            caring for the children.</b></li>

            <li><b>Children shall be treated with tact and
            understanding and their privacy shall be respected at

      <h3>Listening to children and mothers</h3>

      <p>Taking the Convention and the Charter seriously means
      informing children, listening to them, and actively involving
      children who have views in making decisions about their care.
      It means listening to mothers who pick up clues from their
      baby about how the treatment is benefitting or harming them,
      and how it might be improved (2). It also means overcoming
      age-assumptions, such as that children aged under 3 years
      cannot understand explanations (they can), (3) or do not mind
      that their privacy and dignity being disregarded (they do),
      or that children aged 5 or 6 years can never take part in
      making complex, serious decisions about their treatment (some
      do), or that older adolescents do not need or want close
      mothering care (many do during the early days after major
      surgery).</p>

      <p>Patients have unique, inside knowledge of their own case,
      and their parents can help them to be heard when they express
      their views. Some hospital staff say that mothers can be with
      their child in hospital as long as they support everything
      that hospital staff do. Of course, helpful cooperation is
      very important. But sometimes the best way for mothers to
      help their children is to point out how standards of care can
      be improved, and to insist that changes are made. The Charter
      for Children in Hospital grow out of the work of a few
      parents, nurses and doctors in England in the 1950s who said,
      `Our hospitals are not yet good enough, we must change and
      improve them' (4).</p>
      <br />

      <h3>First do no harm</h3>

      <p>A crucial way to safe-guard children's rights is to avoid
      admitting them to hospital when possible and to avoid
      unnecessary interventions. Some professionals report on how
      `non-invasive' technology, such as scans, has beneficially
      replaced invasive surgical interventions. Such advances are
      to be welcomed. However, some people find scans frightening
      and psychologically invasive. Discussion of how one kind of
      technology replaces another risks diverting attention from
      the main question: Is the intervention really necessary? Will
      it do more good than harm?</p>

      <p>Sadly in Europe, many children are denied the treatment
      and relief they need from illness, pain and disability
      through poverty, government economies or war. Yet other
      children are being over-treated, or have interventions which
      have not been evaluated through well-designed research. Very
      little health care is subjected to careful scrutiny (5). In
      beautifully designed and equipped wards, with the latest
      technology and highly skilled staff, it can seem impertinent
      to question the benefits of the treatment provided. There is
      a paradox, that the more professionals are convinced that
      they have provided a child centred refuge in an unfriendly
      world, the higher the risk that children and parents who
      question the care will be seen as negative and ungrateful,
      (6) so that their right to make informed choices can be
      threatened. For decades, research has shown the great harms
      perpetuated by the institutional care of children. Yet in
      many European countries, children are still kept in hospitals
      or children's homes, for weeks or months, for problems which
      could more effectively be treated at home, including minor
      eating and sleeping disturbance, or allegations of `bad
      mothering'. The new children's rights movement sweeping
      across Europe will help professionals and parents to listen
      more seriously to children, so that they are all better able
      to make truly informed decisions which respect children's
      rights.</p>
