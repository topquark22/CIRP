        <p>[CIRP Comment: This report of an anatomical
        investigation of the innervation of the human penis, which
        was published in July 1998, contains very important and
        useful information. There are, however, some glaring
        deficiencies of which one should be aware.</p>

        <p>The first concerns their literature review, which
        overlooked the very important work on the innervation of
        the foreskin, <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">The
        prepuce: specialized mucosa of the penis and its loss to
        circumcision</a>, that was published in the same journal in
        March 1996 &mdash; 2 years and 4 months before.</p>

        <p>Secondly, this work was carried out in the United States
        on anatomical speciments taken from cadavers. The authors
        fail to state if the cadavers were circumcised. If they
        were, and this is likely because the work was done in the
        United States, then they were working with cadavers who had
        an incomplete penis.</p>

        <p>Thirdly, this work contains no information whatsoever on
        the innervation of the foreskin and its relationship and
        connection to the dorsal nerve. This is another serious
        omission.]</p>

            <p><b>Objective</b> To determine the distribution of
            the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP), the principal
            somatosensory nerve innervating the phallus, along the
            penile shaft and within the glans penis.</p>

            <p><b>Materials and Methods</b> The DNP was dissected

            ventral portions of the penile shaft were innervated by
            branches arcading from the dorsal midline radiating
            toward the ventral surface. These branches were very

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">The skin of the human phallus is innervated
      by the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP). The significance of
      this nerve in erectile and ejaculatory function has been
      shown in numerous clinical observations in animals and
      humans. Ablation of the DNP in monkeys [<a href="#n1">1</a>]
      and rats [<a href="#n2">2</a>] resulted in impaired mating
      activity and ejaculatory function. Bors and Comarr [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>] observed in that patients with spinal
      injury after bilateral pudendal neurectomy had total loss of
      spontaneous erectile and ejaculatory function."</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the DNP is crucial to normal male
      sexual functioning, a detailed anatomical investigation of
      the distribution of this nerve along the penile shaft and
      glans has not been performed. A description of this nerve
      along the penis provides insight into the neurophysiology of
      male sexual function. In addition, the patterns of
      innervation provide pertinent information for surgical penile
      reconstructive procedures. This study is a report on the
      course, distribution and variations of the DNP on the penile
      shaft and glans penis in man.</p>

      <h4>Materials and methods</h4>

      <p class="text1">The DNP in fresh autopsy cadavers (mean age
      65 years) were dissected with the aid of an operating
      microscope (x15-30) and operating loupes (x2.5). Twenty-two
      penises were dissected to document penile shaft neuroanatomy
      and six specimens were used to document glanular innervation.
      Antegrade dissections of the DNP were performed after removal
      of the penile shaft skin and fasciae. The DNP was identified
      as it passed beneath the pubis, and branches were traced
      either along the penile shaft or into the glans. Nerves were
      followed until they were beyond the resolution of the
      magnifying instruments.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text1">The pudendal nerve is classically described
      as being derived from the second to fourth sacral segments
      and is composed of three main divisions, the dorsal nerve of
      the penis (or clitoris), the perineal nerve, and the inferior
      rectal nerve. The DNP arises close to the perineal nerve as
      the pudendal nerve exits Alcock's canal, a tunnel formed by a
      division of the obturator fascia along the lateral wall of
      the ischiorectal fossa. The DNP travels along the ramus of
      the ischium and then along the margin of the inferior ramus
      of the pubis, until it pierces the urogenital diaphragm. The
      nerve joins the penile shaft just beneath the inferior pubic
      ligament [<a href="#n4">4</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The present study focused on the
      distribution of the DNP along the penis. The main trunk of
      the nerve was identified bilaterally at the base of the
      penis, lying within 0.5 cm on either side of the deep penile
      vein. The nerve lay on the surface of the tunica albuginea of
      the corpus cavernosum beneath the deep fascia of the penis
      (Buck's fascia). Thin connective tissue adhered the nerve to
      the tunica. The superficial penile fascia (dartos layer) and
      the penile skin lay superficial to this layer. Sparse
      subcutaneous tissue was present beneath the penile shaft
      skin, so that the DNP was close to the epithelial surface.
      Cutaneous connections were not identified as the penis was
      degloved for dissection.</p>

          branch whereas none would do so on the contralateral half

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">The DNP was composed of two different
      populations of axons (Fig. 1). The first group consisted of
      fibres travelling along the dorsal midline and terminating in
      the glans. The other group of fibres radiated from the main
      trunk over the lateral and ventral aspects of the penile
      shaft. These branches were very variable in number and
      location (Fig. 2). A constant feature was the lateral
      direction of nerve branching, away from the main trunk, with
      no evidence of axons crossing the dorsal midline. The calibre
      of the nerve bundles varied and gradually diminished as the
      branching increased. Contrasting with a previous report, this
      study found no DNP branches perforating the tunica albuginea
      [<a href="#n5">5</a>]. The ventral aspect of the penis
      revealed a paucity of nerves. Attention was paid to identify
      branches of the perineal nerve, particularly in the cleft
      between the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa; no
      branches were identified. In several specimens, DNP fibres
      radiating from the dorsal aspect penetrated the corpus
      spongiosum (Fig. 1b). These fibres presumably innervated the
      urethra, as shown in feline electrodiagnostic studies [<a

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">At 1-2 cm proximal to the corona glandis,
      the DNP dorsal trunk divided into 2-3 nerve bundles which
      entered the glans (Fig. 3). The dorsal bundles extended
      straight into the glans to form medial glanular branches, and
      ventrolateral branches arose from the lateral bundles. The
      terminal 'twigs' of the most distal nerve branches radiated
      toward the urethral meatus (Fig. 4). As the DNP entered the
      glans, it immediately branched. Each of the main glanular
      branches travelled along the tunical surface, giving rise to
      a network of smaller branches extending into the substance of
      the glans toward the epithelium. Thus, while the DNP and its
      branches along the shaft were just beneath the skin and
      fasciae, the main branches within the glans were 3-6 mm from
      the epithelial surface. The branching within the glans was an
      extensive three-dimensional array, in contrast to the more
      limited two-dimensional pattern along the shaft. Nerve fibres
      did not cross the midline, nor were there any obvious ganglia
      within the glans. No discernible pattern of
      intercommunication between the branches was noted.</p>

      <p class="text2">At low magnification, the nerve branches
      along the shaft had a serpiginous appearance, with fascicles
      within a nerve branch undulating at the same frequency. While
      manipulating the nerve during dissections, these undulations
      were irreversibly straightened. Nerves within the glans did
      not have a serpiginous appearance.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Erection and ejaculation in man require the
      participation of the autonomic and somatic nervous systems
      [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. The emphasis in most human anatomical
      studies has focused on the contribution of the autonomic
      nervous system [<a href="#n8">8,9</a>]. However, clinical
      data from animal and human studies have shown the significant
      role of somatosensory input to male sexual function, which is
      mediated through the DNP, the primary sensory nerve of the
      human penis. This study provides the first gross anatomical
      documentation of the character and distribution of the DNP
      along the penile shaft and glans penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Bors and Comarr [<a href="#n3">3</a>]
      observed impairment of erectile capacity in patients with
      spinal cord injury who underwent pudendal neurotomy to
      improve voiding. Animal studies suggested that this deficit
      was caused by the interruption of that portion of the
      pudendal nerve conveying axons of the DNP [<a
      href="#n1">1,2</a>]. The crucial role of the DNP in human
      erectile function was further supported by Seftel et al. [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>] who showed that reflex erections could be
      abolished by anaesthetizing the DNP. Investigations of the
      pudendal nerve and its influence on ejaculation have also
      defined the critical importance of the DNP in this response.
      The contraction of the bulbocavernosus muscle (BCM) is the
      predominant force for expelling semen from the bulbous
      urethra [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. Reflex contraction of this
      muscle after stimulation of the DNP has been documented with
      electrophysiological studies [<a href="#n12">12</a>].
      Vibratory stimuli applied to the glans penis induced
      ejaculation in men with spinal cord injury [<a
      href="#n13">13,14</a>], supporting the concept that the DNP
      is the principal source of afferent excitatory drive to the
      BCM and ejaculation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two populations of axons form the DNP, one
      with a constant course along the dorsum of the penis and then
      abundantly branching within the glans, and the other
      displaying a highly variable, although less extensive array
      of nerves along the penile shaft. The distinct pattern of
      glanular innervation prompts the question; what is the
      utility of the glans penis? From a urinary standpoint, there
      is no obvious functional advantage to having spongy tissue at
      the end of the urethra. For erectile function, the glans may
      act as a sensory organ, with transmission of sensory
      afferents through the DNP to the CNS. As the glans distends
      during erection, there is a resultant increase in glanular
      surface area. Stretching of the epithelial rete papillae
      exposes more sensory receptors to stimulation. The afferent
      impulses are conveyed to the intermediolateral cell column in
      the lumbar and sacral spinal cord, and to higher CNS centres
      such as the cortex. The resultant efferent impulses generated
      further propagate the sexual response by maintaining erection
      or initiating ejaculation. The abundant branching of the DNP
      within the glans supports the supposition that the glans acts
      as a sensory end-organ for sexual reflexes; animal studies
      also affirm this [<a href="#n1">1,2,15-17</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Clinical observations in patients with
      spinal cord injury by Kuhn [<a href="#n18">18</a>] and others
      [<a href="#n13">13,14</a>] indicate that the corona glandis
      and frenulum are areas of lower threshold for the induction
      of erection and ejaculation than are other areas of the
      penis. The present study showed no areas in the glans to be
      more densely innervated than others. Halata and Munger [<a
      href="#n19">19</a>] reported a higher density of sensory
      receptors specific to the genital skin, called genital
      corpuscles, in the region of the corona and frenulum; the
      higher sensitivity in these regions may be based purely on
      receptor density. Whether the glans and the penile shaft are
      of equipotential value for the initiation of neural impulses
      during erection and sexual intercourse awaits further
      research, including more studies on genital receptors.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some of the lateral fibres of the DNP
      penetrated the corpus spongiosum, the sinusoidal erectile
      tissue surrounding the urethra. The fibres of the DNP
      appeared to penetrate the substance of the corpus spongiosum
      to innervate the urethral lumen. Pudendal innervation of the
      urethra had been previously documented in the cat [<a
      href="#n6">6,20</a>] but has not been confirmed in the human.
      As the function of the DNP is primarily somatosensory and
      dedicated exclusively to sexual reflexes, urethral sensation
      of the passage of seminal fluid during ejaculation may be the
      somatic afferent information necessary for sustaining reflex
      BCM contractions until the expulsion of all seminal fluid is
      complete. The pathway from the DNP to the BCM has been shown
      electrodiagnostically in humans [<a href="#n12">12</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The distribution of the DNP along the penile
      shaft, with ventrolateral radiation to the corpus spongiosum
      and midline axons to the glans, is important for the surgical
      approach to corrective penile procedures. Classic
      descriptions in urological texts of the 'neurovascular
      bundles' on the dorsum of the penis make little mention of
      the ventrolateral radiations of the DNP [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>]. Albeit undefined, the significance of
      these branches may be considerable in genital and urinary
      tract physiology. Nerve branching becomes more intricate at
      the distal end of the penile shaft, with no discernible
      neurovascular bundle. Surgical procedures on this area of the
      penis may result in denervation of significant portions of
      the glans, with consequent numbness and a higher likelihood
      of postoperative impotence. Incisions in the glans should be
      limited, and if needed, should be made as distally as
      possible. Large incisions should be made in the midline or
      parallel to the midline to avoid dividing the innervation of
      the glans. The findings from this study provide a new
      perspective on the innervation of the penis, and may be the
      basis for modifications to surgical approaches for Peyronie's
      disease, priapism and urethral reconstructive procedures.</p>

      <p class="text2">In conclusion, the dorsal nerve of the penis
      innervates the phallus through two separate populations of
      axons; one with branches radiating ventrolaterally across the
      penile shaft, with branches to the corpus spongiosum and
      urethra, and one to the glans penis. The pattern of
      innervation to the glans supports the role of the glans as a
      sensory structure for sexual function. These anatomical
      findings may assist in planning penile surgical
      procedures.</p>
