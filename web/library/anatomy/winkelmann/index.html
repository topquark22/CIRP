        <h2>THE EROGENOUS ZONES:<br />
         THEIR NERVE SUPPLY AND SIGNIFICANCE</h2>

        <h3>R. K. Winkelmann, M. D., Section of Dermatology</h3>
      </center>

      <p>Sensuality is usually discussed in terms of the central
      appreciation of those complex stimuli and associations that
      give rise to it. Much of the primary erotic stimulus comes
      from the skin, and a definition in terms of the sensory
      receptors of the skin should be a necessary part of our
      understanding of the physical part of this complex sensation.
      It is hoped that those who study human behavior will find the
      following anatomic and developmental information useful.</p>

      <p>Two types of erogenous zones exist in the skin:
      nonspecific and specific. In the nonspecific type the skin is
      similar to any other portion of the usual haired skin. The
      nerves supplying it are composed of the usual density of
      dermal-nerve networks and hair-follicle networks. Examples of
      this type of skin are the sides and back of the neck, the
      axillas and the sides of the thorax. The pleasurable
      sensation perceived from these regions is simply an
      exaggerated form of tickle. The pleasant associations and the
      learned and anticipated responses concurrent with the
      stimulus produce the final amplified central sensation.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">The specific type of erogenous zone
      found is found in the mucocutaneous regions of the
      body.</span> Such specific sites of acute sensation in the
      body are the genital regions, including the prepuce, penis,
      clitoris and external vulva of the female and perianal skin,
      lip, nipple and conjunctiva. It is the special anatomy of
      these regions that require the term "specific" when one
      speaks of erotic sensations originating in the skin. This
      anatomy favors acute perception. <span class="yellow">The
      rete ridges of the epithelium are well formed and more of the
      organized nerve tissue rises higher in the dermis than is
      true of haired skin.</span> The relationship between the
      anatomy of the skin in those structures and the nerve supply
      is shown in figure 1. The structures, as hair follicles, that
      occupy the dermis determine to some extent the neural
      formations. Dermal thickness also is a factor. The inverse
      relationship between mucocutaneous end organs and hair
      follicles as one moves from glabrous to haired skin should be
      observed.</p>

      <p>While the innervation of these regions consists
      principally of dermal-nerve networks, which are present in
      all other skin surfaces, it is the presence of the
      mucocutaneous end-organ that makes special consideration
      necessary. My early studies of these end-organs with
      methylene blue and frozen silver technics have been reported
      elsewhere.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <h3>GENITALIA</h3>

      <p>The innervation of the genitalia has been described by
      authors as early as William Krause.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Tello<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      gave a minute and excellent description of the clitoris.
      Jaeger<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> from studies on the
      penis and clitoris, concluded that a specific end-organ
      existed in these regions. Kantner,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> on the basis of his review of the
      literature, felt that no specific ending existed. I believe
      that a definite ending exists but that it has no specific
      morphology that characterizes it as a separate end organ,
      since it is found in other mucocutaneous regions.</p>

      <center>

          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>There appears to be no advantage in retaining such terms
      as "Krause end-bulb," Endkapseln, "Dogiel body" or "genital
      body" for the ending seen in figure 2.</p>

      <h3>PREPUCE</h3>

      <p><span class="yellow">The mucocutaneous end-organs extend
      from the distal margin of the prepuce to the site at which
      hairy skin begins, where they diminish and disappear. Because
      of the thin dermis and minimal subcutaneous tissue in the
      prepuce, the nerve networks are closely set.</span> The
      number of Vater-Pacini corpuscles in tissue from the adult
      appears to be decreased from that in tissue from the newborn.
      This decrease is apparently relative, however, and seems to
      be due to expansion of the organ rather than to diminution of
      the absolute number of corpuscles present. This observation
      indicates that Vater-Pacini corpuscles do not form after
      birth. In contrast, the mucocutaneous end-organs are formed
      in the prepuce after birth. One primitive ending was found in
      the prepuces of 30 newborn infants, while many well organized
      end-organs are present in each sample from the prepuce of the
      adult.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>CLITORIS</h3>

      <p>Tello<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> did not find Meissner
      corpuscles or Ruffini end-organs in the clitoris. He noted
      prominent genital corpuscles, as did Jaeger.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Tello,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      Ohmori,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> and later Yamada<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> stated that the degree of organization
      of the genital corpuscles increases with age, even after
      puberty. Tello<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> found a
      diminution of the superficial nerves and an increase in the
      complexity and organization of the deeper nerve endings in
      old age.</p>

      <p>I have observed that the clitoris possesses the most dense
      nerve supply of any region of the skin, with numerous
      mucocutaneous end-organs and closely set networks of nerves.
      The Vater-Pacini corpuscle is present in the base of the
      clitoris. The organized mucocutaneous ending is present over
      the entire inner surface of the labia majora and labia
      minora, with a concentration toward the clitoris. The deep
      vaginal mucosa that has been available for investigation has
      not shown any specific nerve endings. No intraepithelial
      endings have been found.</p>

      <h3>GLANS PENIS</h3>

      <p>The mucocutaneous end-organs are present over the surface
      of the glans penis, and especially about the coronal sulcus.
      The Vater-Pacini corpuscles are found in the subcutaneous
      tissue of the glans in their normal form. The small phallus
      of a hermaphrodite that I examined had a greater density of
      nerve tissue than the glans penis usually has. Abnormal
      Vater-Pacini corpuscles with an enlarged inner bulb and an
      unusually convoluted and divided and divided nerve expansion
      were found in it. A mucocutaneous end-organ from this tissue
      is seen in figure 3.</p>

            silver method, X400).</font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>PERIANAL REGION</h3>

      <p>As one moves from the hairy skin to the glabrous skin
      about the anus, one observes that the nerve networks rise
      higher and higher in the dermis and that the mucocutaneous
      end-organ becomes apparent at the vermillion border. These
      endings, as well as more non-specific papillary endings,
      occur frequently in this transitional zone. The Vater-Pacini
      corpuscle is found deep in the subcutaneous tissues of this
      region.</p>

      <h3>LIP</h3>

      <p>One may find varied papillary end organs in the lip. Most
      of them resemble rudimentary mucocutaneous end-organs and are
      situated in the superficial part of the dermis. Meissner
      corpuscles have been described by other authors, such as
      Ceccherelli,<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> but I have not
      seen any specific endings of this kind in many sections of
      tissue from the lip. The tactile disk has been seen in the
      lip of the cat, but not in the human lip. The nerve networks
      are in close relationship to the epithelium of the vermillion
      border of the lip and begin to diminish in density as one
      approaches the haired surface of the outer part of the lip.
      Toward the oral cavity the dermis becomes thinner and the
      number of organized nerve endings diminishes. Subcutaneous
      tissue is absent and the network dermal nerves become more
      superficial. I have not found Vater-Pacini corpuscles in the
      structure of the lip, nor have they been reported at this
      site by others.</p>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>ORAL CAVITY</h3>

      <p>Ceccherelli<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> described
      Ruffini and Meissner corpuscles together with different kinds
      of varicose expansions of nerves in the mucosa of the tongue.
      Botezat<sup><a href="#n11">11,12</a></sup> described
      complicated papillary endings in the oral cavity of man and
      other mammals Gairns and Aitchison<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> found that the nerve endings in the
      human gum varied widely in form. Gairns<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> found similar endings in all types
      of papillae of the tongue. Many of his illustrations are
      entirely comparable to my illustrations of mucocutaneous
      end-organs.</p>

      <h3>CONJUNCTIVAL REGION</h3>

      <p>One may find special mucocutaneous endings in the thin
      zone of transitional glabrous skin. These are in the
      papillae. None have been found in the conjunctiva. Krause
      described the human end-bulb in the conjunctiva proper as
      shown in figure 4. Strughold and Karbe<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> and Sakamoto<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> described an ending in this location
      which appears to represented nerve-trunk artifacts. Recent
      work of Oppenheimer, Palmer, and Weddell<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> confirms my conclusion that most of
      the nerves in his region end as free arborizations.</p>

      <h3>AREOLA AND NIPPLE</h3>

      <p>Martynoff<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> found
      Golgi-Mazzoni, Vater-Pacini and genital corpuscles in the
      areola and nipple. Belonoschkin<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> observed what he termed a "Krause
      end-bulb in the areola and nipple. Cathcart and
      colleagues<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> did not confirm
      these findings. They found no Meissner corpuscles and few
      organized endings of any nature. I have found the
      dermal-nerve networks and the concentrations of nerve tissue
      about ducts and along masses of smooth muscle. The presence
      of hair in the areola itself gives rise to some additional
      sensory tissue. It is apparent that the mass of smooth muscle
      and glandular-duct tissue in the nipple and areola serves to
      block normal development of the dermal-nerve networks seen in
      other erogenous regions. The nipple is well innervated
      immediately below the epidermis, but the glandular and
      smooth-muscle structures crowd out the uniform richness of
      middle dermal networks and prevent development of special end
      organs.</p>

      <h3>MAMMALIAN END-ORGANS</h3>

      <p>This is elongated and sometimes serpentine nerve receptor
      composed on a central axial nerve and closely set,
      non-expanded, concentric fibrillar lamellae (fig. 5). It is
      found in the mucocutaneous regions of lower mammals, such as
      the dog, cat, cow, mole, guinea pig and rat.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21,22</a></sup> It is found in the paw or hoof of
      these animals. In addition, it is found in the nose of the
      pocket gopher and the mole. It appears to be a general
      biologic phenomenon in mammals. It is nonspecific
      cholinesterase-positive in all species of mammals tested, and
      alkaline phosphatase-positive in some of these. Its
      resemblance to the isolated inner bulb of the Vater-Pacini
      corpuscle is so close as to require no attention.</p>

      <h3>COMMENT</h3>

      <p>A great unity exists in the forms of innervation of the
      several true erogenous zones in any animal. In primates the
      ending appears to be principally nonmyelinated nerve, while
      in the lower animals the ending is convoluted and heavily
      encapulated. The single exception of the nipple region is
      adequately explained by the anatomy of that region. Compared
      with lower animals, the primate group is much better equipped
      to appreciate sensations in special tactile zones such as the
      hand, as well as in the erogenous zones.</p>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>These end-organs develop principally after fetal life. No
      adequate knowledge of true relations exists, but it is
      apparent that most significant morphological changes occur
      after several or many years of organized extrauterine life.
      This would fit well with the basic psychiatric concept of
      oral, anal, and genital eras in man's psychic development. We
      do not know that such a progressive morphological
      organization of cutaneous nerves occurs but in view of the
      organized behavior patterns, it would be logical to look for
      it. Much behavior is readily explicable on the basis of an
      identity of the oral, anal, and genital regions in regard to
      nerve supply. It is now confirmed that such a peripheral
      sensory identity does exist.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">All biologic phenomena, including
      sensation, are the result of a certain statistical events. It
      is logical to anticipate that some individuals will have
      cutaneous hyperneuria, and also to expect eventually to find
      some individuals with actual diminution in organization of
      the cutaneous nerves for sensation. Certain pathologic states
      may be explicable on the basis of diminished or augmented
      cutaneous nerve supply. Examples of these might be
      satyriasis, priapism, nymphomania, impotence and frigidity.
      It is entirely possible that glossopyrosis is related to
      degenerative changes accompanying ageing of the oral tissues.
      Since adequate data are not available on these subjects, one
      can only speculate that an anatomic basis for these various
      clinical syndromes may some day be found. This would not
      diminish the tremendous importance of psychiatric
      contributions to these subjects but would serve to make
      definition of the psychosexual states clearer.</span></p>

      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

      <p>There are two types of erogenous zones: nonspecific and
      specific. Those of the nonspecific type depend upon
      exaggeration of a basic tickle sensation. Specific erogenous
      zones, the mucocutaneous zones of man and animal, have
      special neural and cutaneous anatomic characteristics. The
      mucocutaneous end-organs in any given species appear to be
      identical in all of the the zones. The endings of the
      primates are markedly different from those of lower animals.
      Development of the nerve endings is principally postfetal and
      may coincide with the organization of oral, anal and genital
      patterns of behavior.</p>
