      <h3>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</h3>

      <p class="text2">Looking back, it is astounding that the
      complex nature of the prepuce (or the fact that it is not a
      simple fold of skin) was not described until 1991<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> and that this did not appear in the
      mainstream medical media until 1996.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> When Dr. John Taylor faced family
      enquiries, he asked himself: &lsquo;What exactly is removed
      by circumcision?&rsquo; A total absence of an answer to that
      question from the medical literature was the motivation for
      his investigation. The reason why this had never been asked,
      during a century of extensive study of the male genitalia and
      increasing application of circumcision, remains a mystery. No
      special techniques, or dissections, or equipment were
      initially required &mdash; just an observant eye and
      scientific curiosity.</p>

      <h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REVIEW OF PREPUTIAL
      ANATOMY</h3>

      <p class="text2">When Taylor and his colleagues examined 22
      prepuces in males aged 22 to 58 years,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> they discovered that the classical
      description, which simply divided the prepuce into outer and
      inner (or mucosal) areas,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> was
      incomplete. The outer area is a continuation of the shaft
      skin, up to the rim of junction with the mucosa at the
      opening of the prepuce at rest, with all its characteristics
      of form and mild sensitivity. On the other hand, the mucosa,
      that inner preputial skin from the junctional or transitional
      zone to the sulcus where it continues as the mucosal covering
      of the glans, he found to be more sophisticated than had been
      previously described. Just inside the junctional rim of the
      prepuce at the dorsal aspect is a transverse band of ridges
      10-15 mm wide. Beyond this <i>ridged band</i>, the remainder
      of the mucosa is smooth (15-30 mm wide dorsally) &mdash; the
      <i>smooth zone</i>. The ridged band is continuous with the
      frenulum, being a radial band over about 60% of the penile
      diameter &mdash; the dorsal and lateral aspects &mdash; then
      turning distally to form a &lsquo;V&rsquo; shape in the
      ventral aspect whilst smoothly reducing its width to merge
      with the frenulum. This continuity is the reason why the
      ridged band is also known as the <i>frenular band</i>. Under
      microscopic examination, the entire mucosa is invested with
      Meissner&rsquo;s corpuscles (the nerve endings which mediate
      low-threshold and fine-touch sensation) which are heavily
      concentrated in the projections of the dermis that rise into
      the ridged band and in the frenulum. These corpuscles are
      innervated by thick myelinated axons of the epicritical
      sensory system. A recent quantitative study has shown mean
      axon bundle counts in the prepuce of 17.9 bundles/mm
      ventrally, 8.6 bundles/mm laterally and 6.2 bundles/mm
      dorsally.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> As each bundle
      contains tens of axons, the nerve supply to the prepuce is
      obviously very substantial.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another feature of the inner prepuce not
      previously described prior to Taylor&rsquo;s reports is the
      extensive plexus of venules and capillaries that are
      collected into the large superficial veins of the outer
      prepuce and penile shaft skin. These superficial veins begin
      to divide as they approach the prepuce and have frequent
      anastomoses especially in the outer prepuce and distal shaft
      skin. The anastomoses in the prepuce have sometimes been
      termed &lsquo;radial veins&rsquo; because, in some
      individuals, they are circumferential. From the junctional
      rim, the many smaller veins divide frequently as they run
      towards the sulcus to form a dense plexus of venules and
      capillaries. This vascularity was noted by Taylor as being
      pronounced in the ridged band and often seen as a bright
      flush.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In most genitally intact males, some core
      branches of the superficial veins do not divide further on
      crossing the inner prepuce. These medium-sized veins continue
      unchanged to run under the corona to form at least part of
      the drainage of the glans surface. This is contrary to a
      report by Breza, et al., that describes the superficial veins
      as draining the shaft skin and prepuce only.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> This otherwise excellent and extensive
      paper is flawed by not reporting the state (intact or
      circumcised) of the cadaver penises examined. It is
      reasonable to suppose that, in California, all, or the
      majority, were circumcised and thus could not present the
      normal anatomy of the superficial veins. Clearly, the volume
      of blood gathered by these veins, and their consequent
      prominence, is greater than could be involved solely in
      drainage of this skin. Furthermore, the superficial veins
      become more prominent with erection, suggesting that they may
      be carrying extra blood from the glans portion of the corpus
      spongiosum. It may be postulated that: (1) as circumcision
      interrupts this venous circuit and (2) as superficial veins
      are not restored in the great majority of preputial remnants,
      the change in the color of the glans from a venous purple in
      genitally intact males to the pink tint of the penile shaft
      in circumcised males is due to a dramatic change in skin
      circulation in the circumcised penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">The other major feature of the prepuce noted
      by Taylor, which it shares with the shaft skin, is a layer of
      smooth muscle bundles.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> This
      <i>peripenic muscle</i> has been known since at least 1907
      and is the continuation of the <i>dartos muscle</i> of the
      scrotal skin.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> In the shaft
      skin, these muscle bundles are oriented in mixed
      directions,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> but they become
      specifically oriented in the prepuce to add to its
      complexity. In the outer prepuce, the bundles are aligned
      longitudinally to mediate the length of that portion of skin.
      At the tip of the prepuce (i.e., in the junctional zone), the
      muscle bundles are radially oriented to form a kind of
      sphincter which tends to close the orifice when the penis is
      flaccid.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Together with abundant
      elastic fibers, this muscle layer gives the prepuce a very
      snug fit over the glans. In the absence of constriction of
      the preputial orifice (a preputial stenosis or true
      pathological &mdash; as opposed to physiological &mdash;
      &ldquo;phimosis,&rdquo; which can cause back-flow of the
      urinary stream), all extraneous matter (including urine,
      sand, etc.) is prevented from gaining access to the preputial
      space.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, a comment on what is probably the
      longest enduring myth in anatomy. To the present day,
      textbooks still assert the presence of glands in the mucosa
      of the sulcus, especially on both sides of the frenulum,
      despite the existence of these so-called <i>Tyson&rsquo;s
      glands</i> being rejected by many European investigators as
      far back as 1884.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> The problem
      has arisen because one of the findings of Tyson&rsquo;s paper
      of 1699 on the orangutan was interpreted as applying to
      humans, which it does not.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> No
      actual description of them in humans exists and a number of
      modern investigations have failed to find any glands in the
      inner prepuce or sulcus.<sup><a href="#n10">10-13</a></sup>
      My colleague, Christopher Cold, and I have also failed to
      find any glands in this region. The 1904 comment of Keith and
      Shillitoe best sums up this myth: &lsquo;It shows the
      strength of the faith of anatomists that they have for nearly
      two centuries described glands which have not, and never had,
      an existence.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> It remains
      to observe that smegma is epithelial debris shed from the
      mucosa suspended in a proteinaceous fluid;<sup><a
      href="#n12">12, 14</a></sup> Taylor and I believe this fluid
      to be a transudate &mdash; extracellular fluid that leaks out
      from between cells that have no tight junctions.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE FRENULAR DELTA</h3>

      <p class="text2">Some months ago, whilst rereading the report
      of Taylor, et al., I realized that their description and
      illustrations of the inner prepuce and ridged band were
      confined to the dorsal aspect.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      The frenular attachment of the ridged band was described, but
      there was no other mention or an illustration of the ventral
      aspect.</p>

      <p class="text2">The ridged band is not circumferential over
      the ventral aspect, since it curves distally to merge with
      the frenulum, as noted above. This means that the smooth zone
      is progressively reduced as the median raphe is approached
      until it disappears at the mid-line. As the smooth zone is
      reduced, a corresponding zone of the inner prepuce appears
      proximally between the ridged band and the circumferential
      junctional rim. Because the length of the inner prepuce
      actually increases as the median raphe is approached due to
      the curving of the corona towards the meatus to form the
      ventral cleft in the glans, the mucosal area of the prepuce
      is also greater in the ventral aspect. Thus, in the ventral
      prepuce, there is an undescribed zone that occupies about
      20-40% of the mucosa.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="FrenDelta.gif" width="500" height="394"
        alt="figure one" /><br />
        <br />
         <span class="caption"><b>Figure 1.</b> Ventral and lateral
        views of the human penis showing the <i>frenular
        delta</i><br />
         (outlined in grew tone) and <i>frenular veins</i>,
        together with other landmarks.</span>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">I propose the name <i>frenular delta</i> for
      this zone, because of its shape and its association with the
      frenulum. It may be described as that preputial mucosa of
      triangular shape proximal to the <i>ridged band</i> in the
      ventral aspect, having the frenulum at its point, its sides
      defined by the ridged band and as its base the junctional
      rim. It presents as the greater area of the mucosa ventrally
      and does not include the ridged band which is a zone in its
      own right. The median raphe runs longitudinally through its
      mid-line to become the frenulum and bisects the delta into
      two equal halves. In males with a short prepuce, the ridged
      band lies immediately inside the junctional rim at rest and
      against the glans in a variable position according to the
      preputial length. The frenular delta in these individuals
      does not extend beyond the lateral aspects. On the other
      hand, males with a long prepuce forming an
      <i>akroposthion</i> (the tubular and tapered part of the
      prepuce that extends beyond the glans penis) have their
      ridged band lying over the glans tip at rest. In this
      situation, the frenular delta base extends beyond the lateral
      aspects in a ribbon-like band as the extra dorsal strip of
      mucosa between the junctional rim and the ridged band. The
      frenular delta is noted by men as the most sensitive area of
      their penis, especially in the mid-line nearest the frenulum,
      and the frenulum itself.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two of the medium &lsquo;veins of
      passage&rsquo; described above are of relevance here:
      regardless of the pattern and numbers of superficial veins,
      two medium-sized branches curve from each side of the outer
      prepuce to course through the frenular delta ever closer to
      the median raphe, eventually to lie on either side of the
      frenulum before disappearing into its depths. In this way,
      they appear eventually to flank the frenular artery to form a
      triplet analogous to the two dorsal arteries and deep dorsal
      vein of the penile shaft. For these two veins, I propose the
      name <i>frenular veins</i>. After careful observation of a
      large number of intact penises, I have not found any that
      lack these veins and would also observe that they are almost
      never seen in circumcised penises. There is no observable
      division of these veins into smaller venules before they
      disappear into the sides of the frenulum, so we may assume
      that they drain the area of the glans supplied by the
      frenular artery (i.e., the immediate surroundings of the
      cleft and meatus).</p>

      <h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p class="text2">Our knowledge of penile anatomy is far from
      complete. Some of the early findings on gross anatomy, such
      as the peripenic muscle mentioned in the review, are in need
      of rehabilitation, as they do not appear in modern
      literature. Another example is the presence of hair on the
      underside of the penis &mdash; a source of concern for some
      men; this is explained by the <i>area scroti of Klatsch</i>,
      which does not seem to have been reported since 1914.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> This ventral extension of hair-bearing
      skin from the scrotum (with most of its characteristics) is a
      triangular region with its base at the penile-scrotal
      junction, having its point of disappearance at a variable
      distance up the shaft (but not beyond the beginning of the
      outer prepuce), and is equally distributed on either side of
      the median raphe. Even the recent &lsquo;detailed
      anatomy&rsquo; study of neurovascular structures leaves
      questions unanswered:<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> the
      patterns of arterial supply and innervation of the prepuce
      remain unknown.</p>

      <p class="text2">The nerve supply to the prepuce has been
      reported as coming from the dorsal nerves (to the dorsal and
      lateral aspects) and from the perineal nerve (to the ventral
      aspect and frenulum) with some overlap in the lateral
      aspect.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> This recent report
      explains the frequent failure to provide total skin
      anesthesia by the dorsal nerve block that is widely
      recommended for and used in circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> How these nerves reach the prepuce
      from their deeper sites remains unanswered and leaves us with
      a physiological conundrum: because the whole skin of the
      penis is uniquely mobile, any direct branches of nerves to
      the surface would be broken by this extensive longitudinal
      and radial movement. Nerve bundles must, therefore, enter
      from either end of the tubular skin, as do the superficial
      blood vessels. Ironically, circumcision provides an important
      clue, since nerves running down the skin to the prepuce from
      the proximal end at the penile base would be severed by that
      excision of a large circumferential segment of skin, leaving
      the preputial stump and frenulum denervated. As circumcised
      men often describe the preputial and frenular remnants as
      highly sensitive, it seems apparent that innervation of the
      prepuce must be retrograde, i.e., entering the skin from the
      distal end and progressing back towards the base. Moreover,
      nerves regenerating after surgery seldom, if ever, cross the
      scar, as it is an impenetrable barrier to the delicate growth
      cones sprouting from the proximal nerve stump which often
      form neuromata at the scar boundary. Neuromata have been seen
      recently by Cold in microscope sections of circumcision
      scars.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Given the ventral nerve bundle counts and
      the universal accounts of its sensitivity, which it shares
      with the frenulum, the frenular delta must have impressive
      sensory resources. Tracing of preputial nerve pathways and
      quantitative studies of nerve endings should provide evidence
      to confirm these observations. The neurological differences
      from the female equivalents also need to be more thoroughly
      investigated.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> That the
      so-called &lsquo;G-spot&rsquo; of males could have been
      ignored by neuro-anatomical studies to the present day is
      extraordinary.</p>
