      <p>A collection of necrotic debris under the prepuce in the
      uncircumcised male subject is a common occurence unless the
      prepuce is retracted and the area cleansed. This debris is
      popularly known as smegma, a word of Greek origin meaning
      soap or salve. It is generally believed to be a secretion of
      glands thought to be located in this region and often termed
      Tyson's glands.<sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> However there
      appears to be no acceptable evidence to indicate the
      existence of these glands.</p>

      <p>Since smegma has been incriminated as a possible
      etiological factor in carcinoma of the penis and of cervical
      carcinoma, we believed it imperative to undertake a study of
      this substance, particularly since the incidence of these
      types of carcinoma is high in our part of the world.</p>

      <h4 align="center">MATERIAL AND METHODS</h4>

      <p>The material included 1) as investigation of the
      subpreputial status of 1,000 male subjects seen as
      outpatients and of 98 patients treated surgically for
      phimosis; 2) a review of cases of carcinoma of the penis
      treated in the previous 5 years; 3) a physical biochemical,
      bacteriological and microscopic examination of the smegma
      collection and 4) a histological study of the inner lining of
      the prepuce, corona glandis and also the glans in
      cadavers.</p>

      <h4 align="center">OBSERVATIONS</h4>

      <p>The status of the preputial collection in subjects with
      phimosis and in those without phimosis is summarized in
      tables 1 and 2, respectively. Sixty per cent of the subjects
      without phimosis were members of an extremly low income group
      and they accounted for more than 75 per cent of the
      smegma-positive subjects. Among 98 patients with phimosis
      from all age groups, only 12 had a subpreputial collection.
      The review of cases of carcinoma of the penis revealed that
      100 cases had been treated in the last 5 years. All of these
      patients derived from the poor strata and most were laborers.
      There was evidence of previous inflammatory episodes and 21
      percent had phimosis as compared to an incidence of 12 per
      cent among the over-all outpatient population.</p>

      <p><i>Physical characteristics.</i> The collection tended to
      take the color of the inner lining of the prepuce and was
      darker in highly pigmented individuals. In most subjects it
      was dry, scaly or mealy and odorless The characteristic odor
      was noted in a few instances was wet and slimy.</p>

      <p><i>Bacteriology.</i> There was a mixed flora. The smegma
      bacillus was identified in approximately 50 per cent of the
      cases.</p>

      <p><i>Biochemistry.</i> Biochemical study of pooled,
      desiccated smegma revealed an average value of 26.6 per cent
      fats and 13.3 per cent proteins, which is consistent with
      necrotic epithelial debris.</p>

      <p><i>Microscopy.</i> Microscopic examination revealed a lot
      of amorphous material and some dead epithelial cells (part A
      of figure)</p>

      <p><i>Histology.</i> Histologic findings are summarized in
      table 3. Detailed examinations were performed on 128
      specimens. Multiple small pieces were taken from the inner
      lining of the circumcised prepuce and also from the glans
      lining in cadavers. The pieces were serially sectioned and
      every fifth section was studied using hematoxylin and eosin
      stain. A special search was made for glandular tissue. No
      such tissue was found in the material (part B of figure).
      Chronic inflamatory changes and scarring were noted in most
      of the material from adults.</p>

      <h4 align="center">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h4>

      <p>Smegma appears to be desquamated epithelial debris
      collecting in the preputial fold and is not the product of
      glandular secretion. This finding is in agreement with the
      observations of Keith and Shillitoe,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Steive (cited by Dickinson)<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> and Arey.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> If allowed to collect, this material
      leads to inflammation and chronic irritation of this region
      and the prepuce causing a narrowing or, in some cases
      adhesions between the glans and the prepuce. The high
      incidence of phimosis--21 percent in those treated carcinoma
      and 12 percent in the over-all outpatient population--can
      definitely be ascribed to a lack of personal hygiene since
      this causes inflammation and secondary phimosis. Since most
      patients are unaware that the prepuce was retractable, the
      history of phimosis often appeared to be from birth. <span
      class="yellow">When the opening in the prepuce was narrowed,
      smegma accumulation was absent if there were no adhesions;
      the restriction to the flow of urine perhaps flushed the
      space resulting resulting in an absence of this material in
      most of these cases.</span><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p>Chronic inflammation in sinuses, scars and so on is known
      to cause an irritation of epidermal tissues, leading to an
      epithelioma. A similar pathogenesis at this site deserves
      serious consideration.</p>

      <h3 align="center">SUMMARY</h3>

      <p>A detailed study of the subpreputial collections and
      histological study of 128 specimens led us to conclude that
      there appears to be no evidence of any glandular tissue in
      the subpreputial region of the penis. Smegma is an epithelial
      debris collecting in this space. This collection, if not
      removed, leads to chronic inflammation of the glans and
      prepuce resulting in secondary phimosis, which in turn
      appears to be associated with penile carcinoma as suggested
      by a review of cases.</p>
