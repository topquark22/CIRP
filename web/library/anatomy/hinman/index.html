      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: The treatment of hypospadias is
      beyond the scope of the CIRP. This article is presented
      because of its excellent discussion of preputial
      vascularization.</p>

      <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text2">The prepuce is formed by a combination of
        folding and unfolding and epithelial proliferation, and
        separates from the glans after it has developed a blood
        supply. The arterial input, through 4 branches from the
        external pudendal arteries, is terminal and after birth
        supplies the outer and inner preputial surfaces in
        succession. Similarly, the venous return arises from small
        veins running transversely in the prepuce that connect to
        larger subcutaneous veins along the dorsal surface of the
        shaft. Because the two preputial surfaces have one blood
        supply they must be treated as 1 unit. Unfolding the
        prepuce leaves the former inner segment with only a
        terminal blood supply. The pedicle containing the
        superficial blood supply must remain attached to the skin
        flap or it will be devascularized. However, since this
        circulation goes exclusively to the flap, the more proximal
        portion of the prepuce that was raised to form the pedicle
        becomes ischemic when used as ventral cover. A double faced
        flap avoids this complication.</p>

        <p>Key words: penis, hypospadias, urethra, surgical flaps,
        island flaps.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>On the Formation of Flaps</h4>

      <p class="text2">The preputial skin, with its accompanying
      superficial fascia and vessels, is ideal material for the
      construction of flaps for hypospadias repair. It is
      relatively thin and pliable, and has a good blood supply that
      can be mobilized as a pedicle. This particular skin tolerates
      prolonged contact with urine better than any tissue other
      than bladder mucosa.</p>

      <p class="text2">Distally, the penile skin forming the
      prepuce appears as a simple double layer separate from the
      glans. However, it is not appreciated that embrylogically the
      prepuce does not form in situ but arises from a combination
      of folding and epithelial ingrowth from the coronal margin
      near the glans. Only in later fetal life does separation from
      the glans occur, leaving a thin epithelialized layer on the
      inside of the prepuce and a thinner more sensitive layer
      covering the glans.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since the prepuce is formed by progressive
      extensions from the coronal sulcus, it initially has a single
      terminal arterial system in the mesenchyme that ends at the
      preputial ring supplying the inner and outer preputial
      surfaces. Only later after retraction does some of the blood
      supply run first along the outer surface to end at the
      coronal sulcus. The vessels in the superficial fascia are
      axially oriented and flaps must be constructed on
      longitudinal pedicles. When the prepuce is used for a flap on
      the portion attached to the vascular pedicle can be
      considered adequately vascularized.</p>

      <p class="text2">An understanding of the development of the
      prepuce and its blood supply is helpful for the greatest use
      of this organ.</p>

      <h4>ORIGIN OF THE PREPUCE</h4>

      <p class="text2">At approximately 8 weeks of gestation
      symmetrical low ridges arise just proximal to the sulcus near
      the meatus and progress dorsally until they form a fold
      entirely around the glans, except in the midline on the
      ventrum where they are blocked by the incompletely developed
      urethra (fig 1,A). This preputial fold rolls over the base of
      the glans to leave a groove between it, the coronal sulcus
      and the nascent prepuce.[<a href="#n1">1</a>] Simultaneously,
      the glanular lamella, an ingrowth of epithelium many cells
      thick, actively proliferates in the groove to form a shelf
      between the preputial fold and the glans (fig. 1, B).[<a
      href="#n2">2,3</a>] Since this epithelial tissue generates
      most actively at the apex (proximal end) of the groove its
      proliferation carries the ridge of the preputial fold
      distally. The tissue of the more proximal portion of the
      epithelial glanular lamella is not as well differentiated as
      that distally, showing that the prepuce is not formed by
      fusion but by being pushed ahead by active proliferation. The
      mesenchyme between the layers of prepuce proliferates, thus
      extending its tip even after it reaches the summit of the
      glans (fig. 1,C). By 4 months the single epithelial layer
      between the prepuce and the glans begins to split into 2
      layers beginning distally and continuing proximally until
      birth (fig. 1, D).[<a href="#n4">4</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus, 3 processes form the prepuce:
      1)initially, the skin of the shaft is folded over the base of
      the glans at the coronal sulcus to create a groove, 2) a ring
      of epithelial cells form a shelf and proliferates in the
      groove to carry the prepuce progressively distally until it
      reaches the tip of the glans, helped by mesenchymal growth
      within the prepuce, and 3) beginning distally, the epithelial
      layer between the prepuce and glans separates into 2
      layers.</p>

      prepuce and glans.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>PREPUTIAL ARTERY SUPPLY AND VENOUS DRAINAGE</h4>

      <p class="text2">Four arteries provide the blood supply to
      the prepuce (fig. 2, A). The inferior external pudenal artery
      gives off 4 branches as the superficial penile arteries (2
      enter the superficial fascia of the penis dorsolaterally and
      2 enter it ventrolaterally). Beyond the preputial ring on the
      inner surface the terminal branches become minute.</p>

      <p class="text2">Venous drainage is less well organized (fig.
      2, B). Multiple small veins in the prepuce without particular
      orientation join the superficial dorsal veins and drain into
      the saphenous vein. [<a href="#n5">5</a>] The blood supply to
      the frenulum arises from the dorsal artery of the penis (fig.
      3). Branches of the dorsal artery curve around each side of
      the distal shaft to enter the glans and the frenulum
      ventrally.</p>

      <h4>THE SURGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FORM OF BLOOD
      SUPPLY</h4>

      <p class="text2">The prepuce is not formed by skin of the
      shaft that slides distally to cover the glans. Since it
      develops over a mesodermal core that is then split off, the
      arteries supplying it would be expected to run distally in
      the connective tissue core and terminate at the preputial
      ring, rather than at the corona. This is not the case, since
      the prepuce must form a 1-layer sheet of skin during
      erection. Thus, the terminal vessels lose their axial
      arrangement and become reoriented when erection and preputial
      retraction begin. When the prepuce is not retracted they loop
      back upon themselves to terminate at the corona and not at
      the preputial ring.</p>

      <h4>APPLICATION TO REPAIR OF HYPOSPADIAS</h4>

      <p class="text2">Other than for minor degrees of deformity,
      most hypospadias procedures make use of the prepuce. A
      virtually bloodless circumcising incision can be made to
      release the prepuce before preparing a proximal flap, since
      the arteries enter the prepuce proximally along the shaft and
      rarely from the area of the coronal sulcus. For a 1-face
      island flap the blood supply to the prepuce in the area of
      the proposed flap follows the contour of the skin by doubling
      back at the preputial ring. (fig. 4, A). The pedicle
      containing the blood supply to the inner prepuce is dissected
      with care to avoid jeopardizing the new tube (fig. 4, B and
      C). Once the vascularized pedicle is developed, the flap may
      be rolled into a tube for construction of a neourethra (fig.
      4, D). Then, however, the principal arterial support is
      diverted away from the outer flap, reducing the vascularity
      needed to avoid ischemia when this flap is applied to cover
      the ventral defect.</p>

      <p class="text2">For a 2-faced island flap the entire
      superficial fascial arterial system is maintained to supply
      both faces to avoid creating a devascularized covering flap
      (fig. 5, A).[<a href="#n6">6</a>] The preputial skin is
      divided transversely in 3 places (fig 5, B). Both flaps are
      supplied by the entire pedicle (fig. 5, C). Since the more
      distal flap is rolled into a tube, ventral cover is obtained
      from the proximal well vascularized flap and the pedicle then
      supplies both flaps (fig. 5, D).</p>

      <h4>CONCLUSIONS: PRECEPTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF PEDICLE
      FLAPS</h4>

      <p class="text2">Keep intact at least 1 of the 4 branches of
      the external pudendal artery supplying the penile skin. The
      dorsal 2 branches are most suitable for formation of a
      pedicle for a flap. Make only longitudinal incisions in the
      superficial fascia because of the axial arrangement of the
      superficial vessels. Do not divide the superficial fascia
      with its contained blood supply. It cannot support two flaps
      on the same superficial artery. Consider the prepuce as 1
      unit. It has a single blood supply to the inner and outer
      preputial surfaces. After the prepuce is unfolded, if the
      more distal, inner segment is not left generously attached to
      the superficial blood supply devascularization may follow
      when a flap is formed from it. Similarly, since this blood
      supply is directed to the flap the more proximal portion of
      the prepuce is deprived. Raise a second flap if necessary,
      since there are usually 4 arteries to the prepuce. Remember
      that the closer to the corona the preputial flap is mobilized
      the more tenuous will be its vascularization. A flap from the
      shaft is best. Next best is one from the outer surface of the
      prepuce. A flap formed only from the inner preputial surface
      has the poorest blood supply, which is important when a flap
      is placed at a scarred site, as in secondary operations for
      adults. Base all flaps on the superficial fascial system of
      blood vessels that enter proximally. Use magnification on the
      minute terminal vessels to preserve them during formation of
      a flap.</p>

      <h4>Editorial Comment</h4>

      <p class="text2">The article has merit but seems to extend
      anatomical considerations to the clinical area where the
      described limitations have not prevailed. The author has
      chosen a deductive logic based on enbryological sequence
      leading in the abstract and text to favoring a pedicled
      double spaced flap in the repair of hypospadias. Indeed, the
      proposed mobilized 2-faced flap has been found wanting. That
      approach has been pursued by Asopa and Asopa,[<a
      href="#h1">1</a>] Duckett and Hodgson[<a href="#h3">3,4</a>]
      separately, and has since been abandoned by all of them
      because of a bib effect on the ventrum. Clinical experience
      has not encountered the absolute limitations set by the
      premise. The vascular supply of the prepuce is axial. The
      quality of the vessels is variable and to some extent visible
      through transillumination. The vessels can be used
      individually, selectively or collectively. They can determine
      the choice of a ventrally rotated attached innerface island
      flap,[<a href="#h1">1,3,4</a>] a mobilized innerface island
      flap,[<a href="#h2">2</a>] a verge island flap[<a
      href="#h5">5</a>] or an external face island flap.[<a
      href="#h6">6</a>] These island flaps can be transverse of
      tangential,[<a href="#h3">3,4</a>] or vertical.[<a
      href="#h7">7</a>] They can also be dorsal or ventral. The
      innerface can remain attached to the coronal margin and
      retain vitality through back perfusion. Dorsal release then
      allows the use of advancement flaps to the ventral side
      (Firlit). The observation that the dorsal artery divides to
      curve around the distal shaft to enter the glans ventrally is
      also supplemented by feeders entering mainly at the 10 and 2
      o'clock positions.</p>

      <p class="text2">The anatomical studies of Juskiewenski et
      al,[<a href="#h8">8</a>] and Quartey[<a href="#h7">7</a>]
      along with the clinical observations of (alphabetically)
      Asopa and Asopa,[<a href="#h1">1</a>] Broadbent, Carmignani
      et al,[<a href="#h5">5</a>] Duckett,[<a href="#h2">2</a>]
      Hinderer,[<a href="#h9">9</a>], Hodgson,[<a
      href="#h3">3,4</a>] Orandi, Standoli[<a href="#h">6</a>] and
      Van Der Meulen all show the versatility of vascularized
      flaps. I believe the work is of merit to emphasize the
      vasculature and some of the characteristics of the prepuce
      but that deductive reasoning has imposed limits that are
      unsupported in clinical experience. Clearly, ischemia is a
      consideration that limits the expression of flap use but it
      can be judged (if necessary with flourescein)
      intraoperatively or used in a variety of different
      approaches.</p>
