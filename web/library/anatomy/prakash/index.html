      <p align="center"><b>Summary</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sub-preputial space
      collects material unless kept clean. This does not happen in
      phimotics without sub-preputial adhesions. In the absence of
      any glands or secretions in this region, a study was made to
      explain the wetness in the sub-preputial space. A
      bio-chemical examination of the collected material as well as
      the washings indicated that the wetness was due to the
      prostatic, vesicular and urethral secretions. Urine played no
      part in this wetness.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sub-preputial space
      tends to be wet in most individuals. Spotting of
      underclothing is a common feature. If not cleaned, this space
      collects a material, commonly labeled as smegma. Contrary to
      popular conception, this collection does not occur if there
      is a preputial stenosis, i. e. phimosis, without adhesions
      (Parkash and Rao 1980; <a
      href="/library/anatomy/parkash/">Parkash et al. 1973</a>; <a
      href="../lakshmanan/">Lakshmanan and Satya Parkash 1980</a>).
      There are no glands in this space to explain this lesion, the
      Tyson's glands being a non-entity (Keith and Shellitoe 1904;
      Ashley Montague 1943; Parkash et al. 1973). A lot of
      importance has been given to collections in this region
      because of their likely association to squamous cell
      carcinoma. In the absence of a secretion, this wetness can be
      due to: --</p>
<pre>
     (a)  Possible hygroscopic nature of the collection.  This chiefly
          consists of epithelial debris (Parkash et al. 1973).

     (b)  Urine spreading out in this space and also whirling around
          in phimotics, thus flusing (sic) it out.

     (c)  non-urinary secretions or discharge from the urethra,
          spreading out by capillary action, continuously or
          intermittently, with a possible cleansing action of the
          epithelial debris, in the phimotics.  Besides testicular,
          other secretions passed through the urethra are prostatic,
          vesicular and that of the urethral glands.
</pre>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urine is rich in
      urea, the content being about 2 gms%. The prostatic
      secrations (sic) contain about 3950 KA units/ml. of acid
      phosphatase (Mann 1954). Seminal vesicle discharge has
      140-295 units/ml. of fructose, while urethral gland secretion
      is rich in much (Young 1961). As such a study was made to
      determine the level of these in the sub-preputial region.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven specimens of
      pooled and un-pooled sub-preputial collections were examined
      for moisture content, hygroscopic properties, mucoproteins
      and the urea content (Varley 1975).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washings with 2 c.c.
      of distilled water from five non-phimotic individuals were
      examined for acid phosphatase (Varley 1975) and fructose
      content (Roe 1934).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fine polythene
      catheter was inserted in five phimotic individuals (without
      adhesions) and washings obtained by repeated irrigation with
      2 c.c. of distilled water; examined as above.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings were
      summarised in Tables I and II. No hygroscopic property could
      be demonstrated. The urea content was negligible. The average
      fructose content was about 22 mgm% in non-phimotics and 26.8
      mgm% in phimotics. The acid phosphatase content was about
      12.4 K.A. units in non-phimotics and 15.6 K.A. units in
      phimotics. The difference is statistically significant.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Discussion and Conclusion</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">The space is usually wet</span>, even in the
      absence of a collection, excluding hygroscopic properties of
      the material in this space as a factor. The collection was
      also not found to be hygroscopic. Ballooning of the space
      occurs only in patients who have a pinhole opening, while
      there is an absence of collection in all non-adherent
      phimotics. As such a whirl pool effect of the urine can be
      excluded. The urea content of the collected material was also
      very low and indeterminable in the absence of a collection,
      that is, in the washings.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">The prostatic and seminal vesicle secretions
      are known to be rich in lytic material.</span> <font
      color="navy"><b>[See CIRP note below]</b></font> Presence of
      appreciable amounts of fructose and acid phosphtase and a
      higher content of these in phimotics is a significant
      observation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyalase content could
      not be determined due to lack of facilities but can be
      presumed to raised along with the other constituents of the
      prostatic secretion as suggested by the acid phosphtase
      content in the washings.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">As such it appears safe to conclude that the
      space is kept moist and also clean in those with preputial
      stenosis, by the secretions of the prostate, supplemented by
      the seminal secretion of the mucin content of the secretion
      of the urethral glands.</span></p>
