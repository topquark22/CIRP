            <p class="text1">The prepuce is a common anatomical
            structure of the male [<a href="#n1">1</a>] and female
            [<a href="#n2">2</a>] external genitalia of all human
            and non-human primates; it has been present in primates
            for at least 65 million years, and is likely to be over
            100 million years old, based on its commonality as an
            anatomical feature in mammals [<a href="#n3">3</a>]
            Certain cultures have excised the prepuce from children
            to conform to societal standards, while other cultures
            accept the complete external genitalia as normal (Fig.
            1). The motives for circumcision in preliterate
            cultures are difficult to define, but include rites of
            passage, blood sacrifices and cultural markings [<a
            href="#n4">4</a>]. Ritualistic, childhood genital
            surgery has become popular in the last several thousand
            years, making the prepuce the most vilified normal
            anatomical structure of the human body. Rather than
            acknowledging the prepuce as normal anatomy, some
            contemporary physicians consider the penile [<a
            href="#n5">5</a>] and clitoral prepuce (or clitoral
            hood) [<a href="#n6">6,7</a>] to be dangerous and
            unhealthy. However, before theoretical justifications
            for circumcision can be considered, a complete
            understanding of the normal anatomy and function of the
            prepuce is required. This paper reviews the embryology,
            anatomy and function of the prepuce.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce is an integral, normal part of
      the external genitalia that forms the anatomical covering of
      the glans penis and clitoris. The outer epithelium has the
      protective function of internalising the glans (clitoris and
      penis), urethral meatus (in the male) and the inner preputial
      epithelium, thus decreasing external irritation or
      contamination. The prepuce is a specialized, junctional
      mucocutaneous tissue which marks the boundary between mucosa
      and skin; it is similar to the eyelids, labia minora, anus
      and lips. The male prepuce also provides adequate mucosa and
      skin to cover the entire penis during erection. The unique
      innervation of the prepuce establishes its function as an
      erogenous tissue [<a href="#n8">8</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Ritualistic circumcision involves the
      involuntary removal of normal, healthy genital tissue from
      infants and children for religious, societal or theoretical
      medical benefits. Although the amount of genital tissue
      removed is variable, the penile prepuce is removed in nearly
      all male circumcisions, and the clitoral prepuce is removed
      in a Fourcroy grade 1 female circumcision [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>] (see Elchalal, pp.103-108).</p>

      <h3>Embryology</h3>

      <p class="text1">The male prepuce is formed by a midline
      collision of ectoderm, neuroectoderm and mesenchyme,
      resulting in a pentalaminar structure composed of a squamous
      mucosal epithelium lamina propria (corion) dartos muscle,
      dermis and outer glabrous skin [<a href="#n10">10</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The embryology of the penile prepuce has
      been controversial since the original account given by
      Schweigger-Seidel in 1866 [<a href="#n11">11</a>], who
      described a preputial fold that progressively extended and
      fused with the epithelial covering of the glans. Glenister
      cited Retterer (1885-1915) as the first to show that the
      prepuce was formed by a combination of preputial folding and
      the ingrowth of a cellular lamella [<a href="#n12">12</a>].
      This ingrowth creates the prepuce, glans, corona and coronal
      sulcus mucosa. This results in a common mucosal epithelium of
      the glans penis and the inner mucosal lining of the prepuce.
      The squamous mucosa of the glans penis, coronal sulcus and
      prepuce should be considered as one tissue compartment [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>] with a common cytokeratin polypeptide
      pattern [<a href="#n13">13</a>].</p>

          shown in green and the type IV and V as red; a type IV
          prepuce retracts to the glans corona and type V retracts
          to completely expose the glans.</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text2">The fused mucosa of the glans penis and the
      inner lining of the prepuce separates gradually over years,
      as a spontaneous biological process. Topical steroid [<a
      href="#n14">14-16</a>] and nonsteroidal [<a
      href="#n17">17</a>] anti-inflammatory ointments are known to
      accelerate the glans-prepuce separation. In male rhesus
      monkeys exposed to intrauterine diethylstilbestrol, the
      normal separation of the glans/prepuce is delayed from a
      normal age of 2.5-3 years to 4.5-5.5 years [<a
      href="#n18">18</a>]. Despite this research, the hormones
      and/or growth factors responsible for this separation of the
      glans-prepuce are poorly understood. Gairdner found that 96%
      of newborn males have a fused mucosa; in 20% of boys aged
      5-13 years, he reported that the prepuce could not be
      completely retracted [<a href="#n19">19</a>]. &Oslash;ster
      confirmed in a large study that preputial non-separation
      (adhesions) is very common in children and teenagers. The
      separation of the prepuce/glans penis mucosa is usually
      complete by about age 17 years, as confirmed by later Chinese
      studies (Fig. 2) [<a href="#n20">20,21</a>]. Recent work by
      Kayaba <i>et al.</i> verified that the preputial orifice may
      be tight in young boys, but resolves over time (Fig. 3) [<a
      href="#n22">22</a>]. Without knowledge of the normal
      development of the penis, some physicians advocate childhood
      circumcision as a surgical treatment of normal anatomy [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. One study stated that microscopic
      examination of the prepuce circumcised for phimosis showed
      normal histology in 46% of cases [<a href="#n23">23</a>]. As
      the mean age in that study group was 8.7 years, almost half
      of these boys were circumcised for a normal stage of penile
      development [<a href="#n22">22</a>]; a tight preputial
      orifice with normal histology is not pathological in young
      boys, but should be considered a normal stage of penile
      development. Neonatal circumcision, before the prepuce has
      naturally separated, involves tearing the common
      prepuce/glans penis mucosa apart, with the concomitant risk
      of glanular excoriation and injury. Manipulation and
      retraction of the immature prepuce must be avoided to prevent
      scarring, bleeding, phimosis and psychological trauma [<a
      href="#n24">24</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Frequently after circumcision, the immature
      mucosa of the glans and the preputial remnant will fuse [<a
      href="#n25">25</a>]. Of historical interest, true aposthia
      (absence of a prepuce) with normal development of the urethra
      and glans must be very rare: however, it is referenced in
      Jewish law of 1567 CE, relative to a child born circumcised
      [<a href="#n26">26</a>]. This probably represented
      hypospadias with incomplete development of the prepuce.
      However, some authors believed that `aposthia' in Jewish
      males proved the effects of circumcision could be passed on
      in a Lamarckian-type hereditary transfer of somatic
      alterations [<a href="#n26">26</a>]. Although it is generally
      accepted that normal preputial development is required for
      the successful canalization of the glans urethra [<a
      href="#n27">27</a>], hypospadias [<a href="#n28">28</a>] and
      epispadias [<a href="#n29">29</a>] have been reported with
      normal preputial development. These reports underscore the
      complex development of the prepuce and distal urethra.
      Megameatus with an intact prepuce [<a href="#n30">30</a>] and
      subcoronal hypospadias with complete prepuce [<a
      href="#n31">31</a>] are two other variants of hypospadias
      that are important to recognize as contraindications to
      newborn circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The clitoral prepuce develops similarly to
      that in the male [<a href="#n12">12</a>]. The prepuce of the
      clitoris forms independently of the urogenital and
      labioscrotal folds, which form the labia minora and labia
      majora, respectively [<a href="#n32">32</a>]. The clitoral
      prepuce is formed by a cellular lamella which grows down on
      the dorsum of the clitoris [<a href="#n12">12</a>] and is
      fused to the clitoris in the fetus [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>].</p>

      <p>Some authors state that the clitoral prepuce is formed by
      a splitting of the urogenital folds around the clitoris, with
      development of the prepuce superiorly and the clitoral
      frenulum inferiorly [<a href="#n34">34</a>]. However, this
      theory is discordant with earlier studies [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>] and has not been explicitly proved. The
      urogenital groove on the ventral surface of the clitoris
      prevents circumferential preputial development and results in
      the hoodlike appearance of the clitoral prepuce. The
      urogenital groove of the clitoris eventually regresses and
      develops into the labia minora [<a href="#n32">32</a>]. In
      the female, there is no mesenchymal proliferation in the
      prepuce to form a dartos muscle layer. Physicians can allay
      parental fear of normal, intact external genitalia by
      explaining normal development and maturation. With this
      understanding, physicians will also be less likely to
      amputate normal, healthy genital tissue from children.</p>

      <h3>Innervation of the prepuce</h3>

      <p class="text1">The male prepuce has somatosensory
      innervation by the dorsal nerve of the penis and branches of
      the perineal nerve (including the posterior scrotal nerves)
      [<a href="#n35">35,36</a>]. Autonomic innervation of the
      prepuce arises from the pelvic plexus. The parasympathetic
      visceral efferent and afferent fibres arise from the sacral
      centre (S2-S4), and sympathetic preganglionic afferent and
      visceral afferent fibres from the thoracolumbar centre
      (T11-L2). The parasympathetic nerves run adjacent to and
      through the wall of the membranous urethra [<a
      href="#n35">35</a>]. Although most neonatal and childhood
      circumcisions are performed with no anaesthesia [<a
      href="#n37">37</a>], the complicated innervation of the penis
      explains why a dorsal penile nerve block provides incomplete
      pain relief for neonatal male circumcision [<a
      href="#n37">37,38</a>]. Likewise, a penile ring block cannot
      block the visceral afferent fibres from the cavernosal nerve
      nor the posterior scrotal somatosensory branches of the
      perineal nerve [<a href="#n38">38</a>]. A eutectic mixture of
      local anaesthetic cream (EMLA) does not relieve the pain
      associated with circumcision because of the complexity of
      penile innervation and the multiple layers that would have to
      be penetrated by the topical cream in the newborn penis [<a
      href="#n39">39</a>]. Amazingly, some modern urology textbooks
      even recommend wine as an anaesthetic for newborn
      circumcision [<a href="#n24">24</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Researchers have documented that women with
      complete spinal cord injury may achieve orgasm with
      self-stimulation, suggesting that some sensory pathways of
      the genital tract may bypass the spinal cord by way of the
      vagus nerve [<a href="#n40">40</a>]. Whether the external
      genitalia, including the prepuce, are innervated by the vagus
      nerve has yet to be determined.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the sensory and autonomic
      innervation of the penis and clitoris are similar, there is a
      remarkable difference in their encapsulated somatosensory
      receptors. Sensory receptors can be classified as
      mechanoreceptors, e.g. Meissner's corpuscles (Fig. 4),
      Vater-Pacinian corpuscles (Fig. 5) and Merkel cells (Fig. 6);
      and nocioceptors (free nerve endings) [<a
      href="#n41">41</a>]. A multitude of names have been used to
      describe these encapsulated receptors, e.g. Krause, Dogiel,
      genital corpuscles, Endkalpsen <i>[sic]</i> and mucocutaneous
      end-organs [<a href="#n42">42</a>], but the term corpuscular
      (encapsulated) receptors will be used here to include all of
      these mechanoreceptors. Most of the encapsulated receptors of
      the prepuce are Meissner corpuscles, as they contact the
      epithelial basement membrane.</p>

      </table>

      <p class="text2">The glans penis is primarily innervated by
      free nerve endings and has primarily protopathic sensitivity
      [<a href="#n43">43</a>]. Protopathic sensitivity refers to
      cruder, poorly localized feelings (including pain, some
      temperature sensations and certain perceptions of mechanical
      contact) [<a href="#n44">44</a>]. In the glans penis,
      encapsulated end-organs are sparse, and found mainly along
      the glans corona and the frenulum [<a href="#n43">43</a>].
      The only portion of the body with less fine-touch
      discrimination than the glans penis is the heel of the foot
      [<a href="#n45">45</a>]. In contrast, the male prepuce ridged
      band (Fig. 7) at the mucocutaneous junction has a high
      concentration of encapsulated receptors [<a
      href="#n46">46</a>]. The innervation difference between the
      protopathic sensitivity of the glans penis and the
      corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the prepuce is part
      of the normal complement of penile erogenous tissue.</p>

      <p class="text2">In females, the glans clitoris and the inner
      plate of the prepuce have corpuscular receptors on their
      oppositional surfaces [<a href="#n47">47</a>]. The glans
      clitoris also has a much denser concentration of
      Vater-Pacinian corpuscles than either the glans penis or the
      male prepuce. The fused common epithelium of the clitoris and
      the inner plate of the prepuce are reported to have
      intraepithelial nerves [<a href="#n33">33</a>]. Merkel cells
      mediate tactile sensations, and are found in glabrous skin ;
      they have been reported in the clitoris and can be identified
      in the male prepuce (Fig. 6) [<a href="#n49">49</a>].</p>

      <h3>Mucosal epithelium (inner plate of the prepuce)</h3>

      <p class="text1">The mucosal epithelium of the male prepuce
      is the same as the squamous mucosal epithelium that covers
      the glans penis [<a href="#n10">10</a>]. The glans penis and
      the inner prepuce share a common, fused mucosal epithelium at
      birth. Regardless of the embryological explanation, this
      common epithelium does not separate until the proper hormonal
      and growth factors are present. The epithelium of the
      clitoral prepuce is fused in the foetus and has
      intraepithelial nerves [<a href="#n33">33</a>]. The fused
      inner plate of the male prepuce/glans has also been reported
      to have intraepithelial nerves [<a
      href="#n50">50-52</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Ohmori [<a href="#n50">50</a>] described
      intraepithelial nerves within the common prepuce-glans penis
      epithelium in an 11.5-cm male embryo, but later studies by
      Winkelmann on newborn prepuces failed to identify
      intraepithelial nerves [<a href="#n53">53</a>]. It is
      understandable why Winkelmann did not find these nerves, as
      he only studied amputated foreskins and not the normal,
      fused, prepuce/glans penile unit. Studies of the complete
      human foetal penis with careful attention to this area will
      be required before the assertions of Dogiel and Ohmori for
      intraepithelial nerves of the male prepuce can be dismissed.
      The mucosal epithelium also contains Langerhans cells, but
      does not contain melanocytes.</p>

      <h3>Lamina propria of preputial mucosa</h3>

      <p class="text1">The lamina propria of the male and female
      prepuce is very vascular, which explains the common
      haemorrhagic complications associated with circumcision. The
      male prepuce has looser collagen than the dense collagenous
      lamina propria of the glans penis. The ridged band of the
      prepuce is near the mucocutaneous tip (acroposthion) of the
      male prepuce and, in the unretracted prepuce, usually lies
      against the glans penis [<a href="#n46">46</a>]. The mucosal
      lamina propria (corion) is devoid of lanugo hair follicles,
      sweat and sebaceous glands [<a href="#n46">46</a>]. Even in
      modern textbooks, Tyson's glands are often described as the
      source of smegma [<a href="#n54">54</a>]; however, no evidence
      of Tyson's glands has ever been described outside of Cowper's
      macroscopic description of these glands in 1694 [<a
      href="#n55">55</a>]. This may be one of the longest held
      myths in medicine [<a href="#n55">55,56</a>]. Cowper's
      description of Tyson's glands in the human is actually of
      hirsutoid papillomas of the glans penis, which are
      fibroepithelial structures and not glandular structures <font
      size="3">[<a href="#n55">55</a>].</font> Although other
      mammals have true clitoral and penile preputial glands which
      secrete sex pheromones, there is no current evidence of these
      glands in humans [<a href="#n57">57</a>].</p>

      <h3>Dartos muscle</h3>

      <p class="text1">The dartos smooth muscle is specific to the
      male external genitalia and the vast majority of the penile
      dartos muscle is contained within the prepuce. The dartos
      muscle consists of smooth muscle cells invested with elastic
      fibres (Fig. 8). From the prepuce, the delicate, attenuated
      penile dartos muscle surrounds the shaft of the penis and is
      continuous with the scrotal dartos muscle. The penile dartos
      muscle is temperature-dependent and allows for the volume
      changes required for erection [<a href="#n58">58</a>]. The
      function of the dartos muscle has been well described by
      Jefferson, and its loss to circumcision explains the altered
      response of the circumcised penis to temperature changes. In
      the infant, the muscle fibres are intertwined and arranged in
      a mosaic-like pattern [<a href="#n59">59</a>], causing the
      distal prepuce to pucker and close like a one-way valve [<a
      href="#n60">60</a>]. When comparing the dartos muscle layer
      of the prepuce in males before and after puberty, the ratio
      of muscle fibres to elastic fibres decreases. This may
      explain why on gross inspection the distal prepuce is
      puckered in the infant and appears more relaxed in the adult.
      The increase in elastic fibres may be necessary for the
      uncomplicated eversion of the glans in the adult. While the
      aetiology of this transformation is unknown, steroid hormones
      may have an influence, as their topical application can
      accelerate the retractability of the prepuce in prepubescent
      boys [<a href="#n61">61</a>]. Nerve bundles of the prepuce
      run alongside the dartos muscle.</p>

      <h3>Dermis of the prepuce</h3>

      <p class="text1">The dermis of the prepuce consists of
      connective tissue, blood vessels, nerve trunks, Meissner
      corpuscles within the papillae, and scattered sebaceous
      glands. The dermis of the male prepuce appears to have more
      elastic fibres than the lamina propria of the prepuce. The
      difference between the elastic fibres in the preputial lamina
      propria and dermis may also help form the `muzzle'
      configuration around the glans penis. The elastic tissue of
      the prepuce dermis, along with the dartos muscle arid
      frenulum, tether the prepuce and help return it to its
      anatomically correct position after deployment during
      erection or after manual retraction.</p>

      <p class="text2">The clitoral prepuce has only a dermal
      component with fewer elastic fibres than the male prepuce.
      The outer layer of the male and female prepuce has occasional
      sebaceous glands and sweat glands.</p>

      <h3>Outer epithelium (glabrous skin of the prepuce)</h3>

      <p class="text1">The outer epithelium of the prepuce consists
      of stratified squamous cells that are keratinized.
      Melanocytes are present in the basal layers. Langerhans cells
      and Merkel cells are also present (Fig. 6). The Langerhans
      cells are the first line of the body's immune defence system
      and are required for normal immune function. Merkel cells are
      specialized neuroendocrine cells that mediate tactile
      sensations and stain positively with cytokeratin 20 [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]. The Merkel cells of glabrous skin
      contain characteristic membrane-bound dense core granules and
      are sometimes associated with unmyelinated neurites [<a
      href="#n48">48</a>]. Merkel cells may express VIP,
      neurone-specific enolase, chromogranin A and cytokeratin 20
      [<a href="#n10">10</a>]. The function and concentration of
      Merkel cells within the external genitalia has not been
      extensively studied.</p>

      <h3>The preputial sac</h3>

      <p class="text1">The male preputial sac is moistened by
      secretions from the prostate, seminal vesicle and urethral
      glands of Littre [<a href="#n56">56</a>]. Urine is not a
      normal component of subpreputial wetness [<a
      href="#n56">56</a>]. The rich vascular plexus of the prepuce
      mucosa may facilitate production of a fluid transudate
      similar to that of the vaginal/vulva mucosa [<a
      href="#n62">62</a>]. The female preputial sac is kept moist
      by a fluid transudate. Unlike some other mammals, the female
      preputial sac has not been shown to contain any preputial
      glands. VIP mediates the moistness of the aroused female
      genitalia [<a href="#n62">62</a>], but it is unknown whether
      it also contributes to the preputial moistness of the aroused
      male. The moist, lubricated male preputial sac provides for
      atraumatic vaginal intercourse.</p>

      <p class="text2">The preputial sac is colonized by
      Cornybacterium, Gram-negative anaerobes (especially
      <i>Bacteroides melamnogemcus</i>), Enterococci,
      Enterobacteria and coagulase-positive Staphylococci [<a
      href="#n63">63</a>]. Although <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>
      is reported in a modern textbook as a possible factor in
      penile carcinogenesis [<a href="#n64">64</a>], attempts to
      show that <i>M. smegmatis</i> produces carcinogens or
      procarcinogens have been unsuccessful [<a
      href="#n65">65,66</a>]. In the study by Neubert and Lentze
      [<a href="#n53">63</a>], acid-fast bacteria could be seen on
      the Ziehl-Nielsen smears, but nothing could be cultured in
      Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Therefore, the acid-fast organisms
      found in the preputial sac by Neubert and Lentze could have
      been mycobacterial contaminants from soil and water, such as
      <i>M. gordonae</i>[<a href="#n67">67</a>]. Although <i>M.
      smegmatis</i> may be a commensal organism within the
      preputial sac it does not cause genital tract disease.
      However, <i>M. smegmatis</i> can cause non-genital
      soft-tissue infections after trauma or surgery [<a
      href="#n68">68</a>]. The normal bacterial flora of the
      clitoral preputial sac has not been reported, but it would be
      assumed to be similar to the vulva, and would include
      Cornybacterium. Of interest, one study found <i>M.
      smegmatis</i> more commonly in female labial smears (46%)
      than in male urethral smears (4.5%) [<a href="#n69">69</a>].
      Furthermore, this study showed that circumcision had no
      effect on the recovery of acid-fast bacteria from the male
      urethra, and the presence of acid-fast bacteria did not cause
      urethritis. These data support the contention that <i>M.
      smegmatis</i> is a benign commensal organism within the
      external genital tract.</p>

      <p class="text1">The preputial sac contains desquamated
      squamous epithelial cells similar to other mucosal cavities
      such as the oral cavity or vagina. This white, creamy
      material may collect under the prepuce of the clitoris
      <i>(smegma clitoridis)</i> or penis (<i>smegma preputii</i>).
      Male smegma has been shown to contain squalene,
      beta-cholestanol, sterols and long-chain fatty acids [<a
      href="#n65">65,66,70</a>]. In men over 35 years old,
      9,10-methyleneoctadecanoic acid is present, but it is not
      found in younger (17-20-year-old) males [<a
      href="#n70">70</a>]. The function of the steroids, sterols
      and fatty acids produced within the human prepuce are
      unknown, but are considered to be protective elsewhere on the
      skin. In mammals that have preputial glands, sex pheromones
      and aggression-promoting pheromones are known to occur [<a
      href="#n57">57,71</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Clinically, the presence of <i>smegma
      preputii</i> is a rare finding; in a prospective examination
      of 4521 uncircumcised boys, only 0.5% had smegma [<a
      href="#n72">72</a>]. In adult men with clinically confirmed
      phimosis, only 6% had smegma present on examination [<a
      href="#n73">73</a>]. Smegma can also be found in up to 25% of
      circumcised male children [<a href="#n25">25</a>] and can be
      detected in circumcised adults.</p>

      <h3>Immunological aspects of the prepuce</h3>

      <p class="text1">Although it has been known for many years
      that Langerhans and dendritic cells play an essential role in
      the cutaneous mucosal immune system, only recently has the
      mucosal immune system been used to prevented urinary tract
      infections by introducing antigens, i.e. immunisation, via
      the vaginal mucosa [<a href="#n74">74</a>]. The
      immunologically active mucosal system of the prepuce may also
      provide a logical route of administering mucosal vaccines [<a
      href="#n75">75</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Although it has been known that Langerhans
      cells can secrete cytokines [<a href="#n76">76</a>], only
      recently has it been discovered that squamous epithelial
      cells, with no Langerhans cells, can secrete cytokines and
      interleukin-1 that stimulate the immune response of T cells
      [<a href="#n77">77</a>]. The cytokines released by the
      preputial mucosa and skin have not been carefully studied.
      Weiss <i>et al.</i> were unable to document Langerhans cells
      in the mucosal surface of newborn foreskins [<a
      href="#n78">78</a>], but in the adult prepuce, Langerhans cells
      are easily identified in the mucosal epithelium. The
      inability of Weiss <i>et al.</i> to find Langerhans cells in
      the newborn can be explained by the fusion of the preputial
      mucosa to the glanular mucosa in the sterile intrauterine
      environment. Langerhans cells would not be expected in the
      fused prepuce/glans penile mucosa until later in life, when
      the prepuce becomes retractable and the mucosa is exposed to
      antigens.</p>

      <p class="text2">The role of the diversity of subpreputial
      flora in preventing infection has yet to be explored, as the
      study of the immunological function of the prepuce is in its
      infancy [<a href="#n79">79</a>]. Circumcision has been
      justified by some because it removes the Langerhans' cells of
      the prepuce [<a href="#n80">80</a>] and therefore supposedly
      decreases the risk of HIV infections. This theory is flawed,
      as even after circumcision, there is residual penile mucosa
      of the glans, and there are Langerhans' cells in the penile
      shaft epidermis. Surgical removal of the Langerhans cells in
      all mucosa and skin to prevent infections is not feasible,
      nor rational. In addition, the aggressive circumcision
      campaign in the USA has not prevented sexually transmitted
      infections, including HIV. Therefore, Langerhans cells of the
      prepuce should be understood as normal mucosal immune cells,
      rather than a pathological entity requiring excision.</p>

      <h3>Preputial coverage of the glans</h3>

      <p class="text1">There is variability in the preputial
      coverage of the intact glans penis and clitoris. Some adult
      men have the glans penis completely covered by the prepuce
      while others have only partial coverage of the glans [<a
      href="#n46">46,63</a>]. In a similar manner, the glans
      clitoris can be partially or completely covered by the
      prepuce; this merely represents anatomical variation.</p>

      <h3>Sexual function</h3>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce is primary, erogenous tissue
      necessary for normal sexual function [<a href="#n8">8</a>].
      The complex interaction between the protopathic sensitivity
      of the corpuscular receptor-deficient glans penis [<a
      href="#n42">42</a>] and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged
      band of the male prepuce [<a href="#n45">45</a>] is required
      for normal copulatory behaviour. The increased frequency of
      masturbation, anal intercourse and fellatio reported by
      circumcised men in the USA [<a href="#n81">81</a>] may
      possibly be due to the sensory imbalance caused by
      circumcision. Clearly, amputation of the prepuce causes
      changes in sexual behaviour in human males [<a
      href="#n81">81</a>] and females [<a href="#n82">82</a>].</p>
      <a id="circumcision" name="circumcision"></a> 

      <h3>The effect of circumcision on penile anatomy</h3>

      <p class="text1">Surgical amputation of the prepuce removes
      many of the fine-touch corpuscular receptors from the penis
      and clitoris. In males, circumcision is essentially a partial
      penile mucosectomy. The residual exposed glans mucosa becomes
      abnormally keratinized with an increase in the number of cell
      layers in glanular mucosal epithelium. The urethral meatus is
      exposed and prone to irritation. Meatal stenosis can be a
      complication after circumcision. During circumcision, the
      frenular artery may also be ablated, depriving the anterior
      urethra of its major blood supply. The combined effect of
      urethral ischaemia and irritation results in the development
      of meatal stenosis in 5-10% of circumcised males [<a
      href="#n25">25,83-86</a>]. The risk of glanular injury when
      tearing the fused penile mucosa, and the development of
      meatal stenosis, makes circumcision in the newborn period
      inadvisable [<a href="#n87">87-89</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">During circumcision, most of the penile
      dartos muscle is removed; all that remains is a few bundles
      of muscle at the circumcision scar. It has been observed that
      the flaccid penis in circumcised males tends to hang less
      vertically than in those with complete anatomy. The loss of
      dartos muscle support may explain the difference. Certainly,
      the loss of most of the penile dartos muscle makes the penis
      less able to make positional adjustments during erection and
      with temperature changes.</p>

      <p class="text2">For unknown reasons, keloid formation after
      circumcision is quite rare [<a href="#n90">90,91</a>].
      Although the circumcision scar has not been thoroughly
      studied, there are several different theories as to what
      happens when the nerves of the sensory receptors of the
      prepuce are transected during circumcision. Some have
      speculated that after circumcision, these nerves regenerate
      and develop new encapsulated receptors [<a
      href="#n92">92</a>]. According to this theory, there would be
      a significant loss of penile sensitivity after circumcision,
      but this loss would not be apparent 6 months after the
      circumcision [<a href="#n92">92</a>]. This notion is in
      direct conflict with human and animal studies that show when
      a nerve is transected, and the distal tissue is amputated,
      the proximal nerve undergoes acute axonal swelling [<a
      href="#n93">93-95</a>]. After acute injury, the axon begins
      to sprout and branch at the injury site. Without the distal
      nerve, this frustrated attempt at re-innervation results in a
      bulbous, disordered tangle of axons, Schwann cells and
      fibrous tissue. Histology of the male circumcision scar shows
      amputation neuromas, Schwann cell proliferation and the
      bulbous collection of variably sized neurites. Amputation
      neuromas do not mediate normal sensation and are notorious
      for generating pain. Animal studies show that extirpation of
      the external genitalia results in acute retrograde
      degeneration of the nerve axon back to the spinal cord [<a
      href="#n96">96</a>]. Therefore, the changes in circumcised
      male sexual behaviour [<a href="#n81">81</a>] may be related
      to a central nervous system alteration by retrograde axonal
      degeneration, or to peripheral nervous system damage by loss
      of the prepuce ridged band and amputation neuroma. It is
      assumed that amputation neuromas also form at the female
      circumcision scar, although we are unaware of a formal
      histology study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although foreskin restoration cannot
      regenerate dartos muscle or encapsulated sensory receptors,
      it appears that the residual stump of prepuce could be
      stretched to provide partial covering of the coronal sulcus
      and corona. This re-covering of the corona, combined with a
      reversion of the epithelium to the normal squamous mucosa of
      the glans, may account for the improved sensitivity reported
      by men who have nonsurgically restored their foreskins [<a
      href="#n97">97</a>]. Likewise, it appears that restoration of
      the female vulva after circumcision may provide subjective
      improvements in sensitivity and selfesteem [<a
      href="#n98">98</a>]. Further histological examination and
      somatosensory evaluation of the circumcision scar and the
      restored foreskin is needed to explain the altered
      sensitivity reported by circumcision and restoration.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce is a specialized, specific
      erogenous tissue in both males and females. Therefore,
      surgical excision should be restricted to lesions that are
      unresponsive to medical therapy, such as lichen sclerosis of
      the penis (balanitis xerotica obliterans) or vulva, which is
      unresponsive to other therapies (e.g. topical clobetasol,
      intralesional corticosteroids, topical testosterone
      propionate ointment, etretinate, and carbon dioxide or laser
      vaporization) [<a href="#n99">99</a>]. Preputial plasty [<a
      href="#n100">100</a>] should be considered in place of
      circumcision whenever possible, so as to preserve the
      corpuscular sensory receptors, dartos muscle, penile mucosa
      and complete function of the penis, while avoiding abnormal
      exposure and keratinization of the glans penis. Although some
      cultures celebrate the abnormal anatomy caused by
      circumcision, many women [<a href="#n101">101,102</a>] and
      men [<a href="#n103">103</a>] have reported this abnormal
      penile/clitoral exposure to be uncomfortable. The male
      prepuce contains the vast majority of the penile dartos
      muscle that cannot be regenerated after circumcision. The
      preputial mucosa and outer epithelium provides adequate
      epithelial coverage of the erect penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">The loss of the prepuce ridged band and the
      formation of an amputation neuroma are two further
      complications associated with male circumcision. Although a
      Fourcroy grade 1 female circumcision would excise less tissue
      than in a male, this comparison cannot be used to justify
      female circumcision. Excision of normal, erogenous genital
      tissue from healthy male or female children cannot be
      condoned, as the histology confirms that the external
      genitalia are specialized sensory tissues.</p>

      <p class="text2">The complex anatomy and function of the
      prepuce, along with the fused prepuce/glans penile mucosa in
      the immature penis, dictates that neonatal circumcision be
      strictly avoided, as recommended by the Australasian
      Paediatric surgeons [<a href="#n88">88</a>], Canadian
      Paediatric Society [<a href="#n89">89</a>], and a paediatric
      urology textbook [<a href="#n87">87</a>]. Removal of normal
      genital anatomy in children and infants should be deferred
      until the individual can make an informed decision [<a
      href="#n104">104</a>]. If external genital tissue must be
      excised to combat a disease process that threatens the
      child's health, and is unresponsive to medical therapy., then
      the amount of tissue should be limited so as to preserve the
      anatomy and function of the external genitalia. All genital
      tissue excised from children should be microscopically
      examined to confirm the clinical opinion of the disease. As
      physicians and parents learn the normal anatomy and functions
      of the external genitalia, there will be greater
      understanding of its essential nature, and more attempts to
      limit its removal.</p>
