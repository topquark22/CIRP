      <h2>Immunochemical Analysis of Nerve Distribution Patterns
      within Prepucial Tissue</h2>

      <p><b>Robert M. Moldwin, M.D., and Elso Valderrama, M.D., New
      Hyde Park, NY</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Numerous reports have amassed documenting
      the extent of pain inflicted while performing neonatal
      circumcision. Most investigators have theorized that the
      relative absence of pain during excision of the prepuce is
      related to the lack of maturation of pain mediating spinal
      pathways (i.e., spinothalamic tract). In order to document
      the extent and variations of innervation on an end organ
      level, we examined prepucial tissue of 35 patients undergoing
      cosmetic circumcision. Patients ranged from newborn to 32
      years of age. Specimens were analyzed histologically using
      hematoxalin-eosin stains then specifically examined for
      patterns of nerve distribution using silver stains and neuron
      specific enolase immunohistochemistry.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nerve bundle density was noted to be highest
      in ventral prepucial tissue (mean = 17.9 bundlens/rm) as
      opposed to dorsal (mean = 6.2 bundles/rm) and lateral (m =
      8.6 bundles/rm) tissue. Interestingly, newborns appear to
      have a higher nerve density in all regions studied perhaps
      owing to a relative abundance of collagen matrix acquired
      with age.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Our findings suggest an
      extensive neuronal network within prepucial tissue which is
      present in birth with little change to adulthood.</span></p>
