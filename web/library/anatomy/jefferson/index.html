      ON THE ANATOMY OF PHIMOSIS</h2>

      C.</b></p>

      <p><font size="7">M</font>y attention having been called to
      the peripenic muscle by an experience during an operation, an
      investigation was undertaken the results of which are
      appended below.</p>

      <p>It is not very generally realized that the dartos muscle
      of the scrotum is continued forward beneath the skin of the
      penis to from the peripenic muscles (Fig. 1). This muscle
      sheet has a certain practical importance, for by the agency
      of its fibers the distal opening of the prepuce is liable to
      marked alterations, seemingly larger at some times than at
      others, according to the state of contraction of his
      subcutaneous muscle.</p>

      <p>The peripenic muscles appears accurately to have been
      described for the first time by Sappey (<a href="#n1">1</a>)
      in 1860, but it is passed over with the briefest mention by
      the majority of anatomical textbooks. It will be remembered
      that the superficial fascia of the bodies of many of the
      lower animals contains a thin muscle sheet, the panniculus
      carnosus. in man the dartos, the fasciae of Colles and
      Scarpa, and the platysma myoides, are the only remnants of
      this once widely distributed muscle layer. It has been
      thought that the dartos extends into the penis only for a
      short distance on its underside, in the so-called area scroti
      of Klatsch. These are two areas, one on either side of the
      root of the penis on its under surface, differing from the
      rest of the penic skin in presenting a darker, rougher
      appearance, in being very rich in sebaceous glands, and
      plentifully provided with hairs (<a href="#n6">6</a>). This
      is too conservative an estimate of the extent of the muscle
      tissue, for my own observations agree with the excellent
      account given by Delbert (<a href="#n2">2</a>) that the
      muscle extends over the whole length of the penis.</p>

      <h3>MATERIAL</h3>

      <p>I have examined a series of ten prepuces removed at
      operation (circumcision), the ages of the patients ranging
      from a few weeks to thirty years. The whole length of the
      penis was examined in one specimen only, a twin foetus of 30
      weeks, in which the whole penis and scrotum were of
      convenient size for cutting <i>en bloc</i>. I can therefore
      speak with more authority on the preputial part of the
      peripenic muscle than upon the remainder, the former portion
      being surgically the more important. The specimens were
      embedded in paraffin and the sections stained with Ehrlick's
      acid haematooxylin, Van Gieson's picrosaurefuchsin being
      employed as a differential stain for smooth muscle. The
      amount of muscle tissue present beneath the skin is really
      rather astonishing.</p>

      Some are cut longitudinally, some obliquely, and others
      transversely,<br />
      this demonstrating the diverse directions in which the bands
      of muscle run.</p>

      <h3>THE PERIPENIC MUSCLE</h3>

      <p><span class="yellow">Like the scrotal dartos, of which it
      is a direct prolongation, the peripenic muscle is composed of
      unstriped fibers which form an incomplete investment of the
      penis from its base to the extremity of the prepuce. The
      muscle is situated 1 or 2 mm. beneath the skin, from which it
      is quite separate except inferiorly in the region of the
      median raphe. In the many sections examined by me the muscle
      fibers are plentiful. Owning to their great diversity of
      direction only a few fibers can be seen running the same way
      in any one microscopic field. (Fig. 4) The muscle bundles are
      very slender and are made up of a few muscle-cells only, but
      they run in every direction transversely, longitudinally, and
      obliquely. In the prepuce a great many of the fibers course
      in the long axis of the organ. The fibers are loosely packed
      (Fig. 2), the intervals between the muscle-bundles being
      filled up with lax fibrous tissue. There is of course no
      subcutaneous fat in the penis. The muscle forms a sheet of
      practically equal thickness for its whole extent, but owing
      to the doubling of the skin to from the prepuce the
      muscle-fibers are rather more abundant in that region, as the
      muscle lines, to a certain extent, the inner "mucosal" layer
      to the prepuce as well as the outer. Woolsey (<a
      href="#n5">5</a>) remarks that the dartos fibers at the end
      of the prepuce are circularly arranged, forming a kind of
      sphincter. There was no special collection of fibers such as
      might be thought to indicate a sphincter in any of the
      specimens I examined, but the sphincteric possibilities of
      any part of the preputial portion of the muscle cannot be
      denied.</span></p>

      <p>The development and strength of the whole dartos sheet
      varies greatly in different individuals, and the peripenic
      muscle is not always well formed. It is particularly likely
      to be weak in persons with dependent, lax, smooth scrotums.
      The muscle was present in all the ten prepuces examined; it
      was poorly developed in one case only. Charpy reports that he
      has has seen it absent in its preputial portion. The
      peripenic muscle is doubtless the cause of the remarkable
      rugosity usually exhibited by the removed prepuce or the
      prepuce under the stimulus of cold. These rugae are in the
      main arranged transversely, but innumerable minute ridges are
      superposed upon these. There can be no doubt but that the
      purpose of the muscle is to adapt the skin to the varying
      volume of the organ, as the changes are greater than could be
      accommodated by the elasticity of the skin alone. It has been
      suggested that the muscle may aid in erection by compression
      of the dorsal vein, but this influence could hardly be
      exerted to any great extent upon the vena dorsalis penis
      profunda (which drains the erectile tissue), as this vein is
      protected by the fascia propria penis, though the superficial
      vessel might be constricted.</p>

      <p>The prepuces of the lower animals are usually more
      complicated than man's (see for example the horse and ox, 4,
      which have a double prepuce, the outer, at least, very
      muscular), so homologies are difficult to establish./*</p>

      <h3>THE PERIPENIC MUSCLE AND PHIMOSIS</h3>

      <p>As has already been said, under the stimulus of cold the
      peripenic muscle contracts just as does the scrotal dartos,
      and whereas the contraction of the latter draws the testes
      close to the body, contraction of the former causes the skin
      to conform to the reduced size of the organ, and the prepuce,
      if of any length, to shrivel into a small knot beyond the
      glans. If the prepuce is short it tends to retract behind the
      glans and the muscular contraction makes it difficult to draw
      the fold of skin forward. It will be realized that this
      muscle has considerable potentialities in the question of
      phimosis and possibly also in paraphimosis. It is common to
      observe how different an appearance many phimosis cases
      present if seen on different occasions under different
      conditions. It may at one time be impossible to retract the
      skin enough to get a glimpse of the glans, while at other
      times the preputial orifice may be several millimeters in
      diameter. This change is brought about by muscular activity
      and the possibility of such contraction should be borne in
      mind when an opinion is given as to the desirability of
      circumcision. As is characteristic of smooth muscle
      everywhere, the peripenic muscle contracts very slowly and
      sluggishly, so that the alterations which it induces are slow
      to occur and, being slight, are usually overlooked.</p>

      <p>Surgical textbooks sometimes describe two varieties of
      phimosis, namely the hypertrophic and the atrophic, these
      besides the ordinary classes of congenital and acquired. The
      distinction between the two forms lies in the amount of
      prepuce present, difficulty or impossibility of retraction of
      the foreskin being common to both varieties (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>). Thus, in the hypertrophic form the prepuce
      is abundant but has too small a distal opening, while in the
      atrophic form the prepuce is short as well as too narrow (see
      Fig. 6). This distinction is, in the adult, artificial to a
      certain extent, as the two varieties can be seen on the same
      patient under different circumstances. For the peripenic
      muscle not only can alter the size of the preputial opening
      but, aided perhaps by a certain shrinkage of the penis, can
      cause the prepuce to appear redundant, while at other times
      it is barely sufficient to cover the glans (Fig. 6). This
      statement cannot be so rigidly applied to infants, in whom
      redundancy of the foreskin is common. <span
      class="yellow">The probabilities are that such redundancy is
      not only common but normal; the skin awaits the development
      of the corpora cavernosa and spongiosum which will occur at
      puberty.</span></p>

      <p>The writer might have doubted the latent powers of this
      muscle had he not met with a remarkable example.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">A male, aged 35, suffered from a
        phimosis; the prepuce was just long enough to cover the
        glans, but the opening was too small for retraction.
        Circumcision was advised. Under the influence of the
        alcoholic solution of iodine with which the penis was
        painted beforehand the peripenic muscle underwent a
        powerful tonic contraction. The tip of the prepuce became
        somewhat inverted and the muscular contraction was of so
        determined a character that it was impossible to roll the
        prepuce backward to display its distal opening. This
        rendered an accurate estimation of the amount of skin to be
        removed extremely difficult, and too much was very nearly
        removed. When the section was made the muscle slowly
        relaxed.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">A colleague had an experience which helps
        to emphasize the powers of the muscle: On one occasion he
        found it impossible to introduce in the cold a catheter
        through the preputial orifice of an adult male who had a
        phimosis, while the meatus and tip of the glans could be
        easily displayed in the warmth of the operating room (Fig.
        6).</font></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Experiences such as these illustrate the vigor of the
      peripenic muscle under favorable circumstances, and induce
      one to take more heed of its possibilities.</p>

      <p>It is probable that far more circumcisions are performed
      upon infants than are really necessary. <span
      class="yellow">It is not widely enough realized, particularly
      by the lay public, that a condition of phimosis is normal at
      birth.</span> It is inconceivable that children are born with
      actual deformities in this region as often as the statistics
      of circumcision would lead an observer to suppose. <span
      class="yellow">It is not until the penis undergoes its final
      development at puberty that the proper balance between the
      prepuce and the glans is struck.</span> Further, adhesion
      between the prepuce and the glans is not an absolute
      abnormality, nor one which time cannot correct. This point
      merits, perhaps, some discussion.</p>

      <h3>THE NATURE OF THE ADHESION BETWEEN THE GLANS PENIS<br />
       AND PREPUCE ENCOUNTERED AT CIRCUMCISION.</h3>

      <p>All operators must have been struck by the great tenacity
      of the adhesion between the glans and the prepuce. However
      careful a dissection is made raw surfaces are commonly left
      on the glans, and sometimes these are of considerable extent,
      detracting from an otherwise aesthetically pleasing result.
      As a rule, the younger the child the worse the glans looks.
      These abrasions usually heal easily without leaving permanent
      scarring, but it would be well if they could be avoided. That
      these abrasions are inevitable is readily seen on reference
      to the photomicrograph of the corona glandis of a 30 week
      foetus. It will be seen (Fig. 7) that the corona and
      balanopreputial space are filled up with epithelial cells
      which bind the inner surface of the prepuce to the glans.
      These cells form the "adhesion" which is so difficult to
      break down without injury to the superficial cells of the
      glans and prepuce. The origin of these cells is best
      explained by the more recent accounts of the development of
      the prepuce. It was formerly believed that the tip of the
      genital tubercle represented the glans penis or clitoridis,
      and that the prepuce grew forward over this from the outer
      skin folds (<a href="#n7">7</a>). Berry Hart (<a
      href="#n8">8</a>) and Wood Jones (<a href="#n9">9</a>) have
      independently shown that the genital tubercle is a skin
      covered papilla and that the glans is sculptured out (to use
      Wood Jones' phrase) within the solid tubercle by the invasion
      of a mass of epithelial cells which start from the site of
      the future preputial orifice The invading cells burrow not
      only circumferentially but centrally, the latter advancing as
      a solid plug into the the tip of the glans. The breaking down
      of the former leads to the liberation of the prepuce, the
      degeneration of the latter forms the terminal part of the
      urethra. The breaking down of the preputial cells begins late
      in foetal life and is commonly incomplete at birth, making
      retraction of the prepuce impossible even though the the
      preputial orifice itself is large. Failure of these cells to
      desquamate is sometimes though rarely met with in the female.
      In such cases the prepuce entirely covers the glans
      clitoridis.</p>

      <p>It will be noted that there is no evidence of any glands
      in the corona such as Tyson described in the orang-outang.
      Opinion that these glands do not exist is growing; Sprunk
      examined 300 human penes without finding a single gland of
      Tyson (<a href="#n1">1</a>). There are a few rudimentary
      sebaceous glands and no hairs (Fig. 7). In youth the
      so-called mucous membrane of the prepuce and glans is
      certainly far different from that of the mouth or vagina, but
      probably becomes more deeply stratified if the glans becomes
      largely uncovered (as it often does) at puberty.</p>

      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

      <p>An examination of ten prepuces removed at circumcision and
      one entire penis and scrotum (foetal) confirms the existence
      of abundant unstriped muscle-fiber beneath the skin of the
      penis. These are prolongations of the dartos sheet and form
      the "peripenic muscle." The fibers of this muscle possess the
      power of altering the preputial orifice to a certain extent,
      and hence a consideration of the latent powers of the muscle
      in causing varying degrees of phimosis is important.</p>

      <p>The writer wishes to thank his colleagues at St. Joseph's
      Hospital, and also Dr. W. E. Home, pathologist to the
      Provincial <a
      href="http://carver.pinc.com/home/bmwong/vepa/rjh.htm"
      target="_blank">Royal Jubilee Hospital</a>, for several of
      the specimens examined.</p>
