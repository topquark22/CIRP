      <h2>The intromission function of the foreskin.</h2>

      <p><b>Donald R. Taves</b></p>

      <p>Redmond, Washington, USA</p>

      <h4>Abstract</h4>

      <p class="abs">Masters and Johnson observed that the foreskin
      unrolled with intercourse. However, they overlooked a prior
      observation that intromission was thereby made easier. To
      evaluate this observation an artificial introitus was mounted
      on a scales. Repeated measurements showed a 10-fold reduction
      of force on entry with an initially unretracted foreskin as
      compared to entry with a retracted foreskin. For the foreskin
      to reduce the force required it must cover most of the glans
      when the penis is erect. This may occur only in humans. These
      observations mean that foreskin and prepuce can no longer be
      considered synonymous. Why the penises of humans and
      chimpanzees evolved so differently should be addressed in
      light of these findings.</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text">Morgan [<a href="#n1">1</a> and <a
      href="#n2">2</a>] stated that vaginal intromission is easier
      with a (retractable foreskin in place. However, no one has
      experimentally tested his contention or clearly stated the
      mechanism. There are no contradictory claims in any of the
      citations to Morgan's letters. Harnes [<a href="#n3">3</a>]
      published a `fruitless' attempt with a questionnaire to
      evaluate Morgan's claim of greater sexual pleasure with a
      foreskin. Articles about circumcision and evolutionary
      antecedents of human sexually have almost totally neglected
      the even more general question: the function of the foreskin.
      The recent position paper of the American Pediatrics
      Association is silent on this issue [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. A
      heated debate in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>
      produced no references and only a single sentence regarding
      the function, `...protection of the sensitive glans' [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. Porter and Bunker [<a href="#n6">6</a>] in
      an article entitled, The <i>dysfunctional foreskin</i>, say
      only `...its function-physically, physiologically and
      immunologically protective of the glans and external urethral
      orifice.'</p>

      <p class="text">Several recent publications have considered
      evolutionary antecedents of human sexual behavior and unusual
      primate male genitalia but they do not mention the foreskin
      or prepuce [<a href="#n7">7</a>, <a href="#n8">8</a> and <a
      href="#n9">9</a>]. Money [<a href="#n10">10</a>] cites a
      survey finding that the foreskin is a `visual and tactile
      erotic organ.' Cox [<a href="#n11">11</a>] postulates,
      without evidence, that the foreskin retards the age of sexual
      reproduction. There is little in the older literature they
      missed. Even an article entitled, `Observations on the
      evolution of the genitalia and copulatory behaviour in male
      primates, [<a href="#n12">12</a>] there is no mention of the
      foreskin or prepuce! All the <i>Textbook of Sexual
      Medicine</i> [<a href="#n13">13</a>] says, without
      references, is `There is much controversy and little data
      surrounding the effect of circumcision on male function.'</p>

      <h4>Evidence</h4>

      <p class="text">Preliminary measurements of the force
      required for intromission with and without the benefit of the
      foreskin have been made with a simple device. The device
      consisted of a Styrofoam cup the bottom of which was cut to
      make an artificial introitus. The cup was mounted on diet
      scales so that the force being applied could be noted (Fig.
      1). Twelve measurements were made with the glans penis
      alternately exposed or covered by the foreskin. <span
      class="yellow">Intromission with the glans exposed required a
      minimum of 500 g of force and was uncomfortable. In contrast
      only 40 to 50 g were required for complete insertion of the
      glans when it was covered, and there was no discomfort. Thus,
      intiating intromission with the foreskin covering the glans
      resulted in a greater than 10-fold reduction in the force
      needed to penetrate an `introitus' and make an otherwise
      uncomfortable intromission comfortable.</span></p>

          force during intromission. (Diet Scales, Hanson Scale
          Co., Division of Sunbeam Corporation, P. O. Box 38,
          Highway 45 North, Shubuta, Mississippi 39360.) Lawer
          left: an artificial introitus was made by cutting a
          quarter size piece out of the bottom of the an 8 1/3
          ounce foam beverage cup (Western Family Space Saver
          Inulated FOAM CUPS, Western Family Foods, Inc. Portland,
          Oregon 97223.) and making 8 equidistance cuts from the
          margin to the thickened ring of the cup. The length and
          number of cuts determined the stiffness and expansibility
          of the 'introitus' and hence the ease of
          intromission.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">Several factors can be expected to affect the
      required force: The degree of exposure of the glans with an
      erection, the size of the penis and the length of the
      foreskin. If the artificial orifice is smaller than the size
      of the exposed glans then there will be more friction. With a
      large glans more friction can be expected and the force
      required would increase after the foreskin has completely
      unrolled. In this trial the exposure of the glans was just
      under 1 cm with erection of the penis while the opening of
      the articficial orifice was 2.4 cm. The lateral diameter of
      the erect penis was 4.1 cm. The maximum distance the foreskin
      moved up the shaft (not including the glans) was 6-7 cm,
      depending inversely on the amount of turgor in the glans. The
      limiting factor was tension in the area of the frenulum,
      which decreased with loss of turgor in the glans.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text">These preliminary figures support the claim
      by Morgan [<a href="#n1">1</a> and <a href="#n2">2</a>] that
      vaginal intromission is easier with a (retractable) foreskin
      in place. The mechanism is simple. The interposed foreskin
      decreases the friction between the introitus and the glans.
      The unretracted foreskin consists of a thin dermis that is
      folded on itself with very little friction between the
      layers. As the penis advances, the foreskin unrolls so that
      the portion that makes initial contact with the introitus is
      6 cm. Up the shaft before any friction occurs between the
      device and the skin.</p>

      <p class="text">These observations were limited to a single
      subject with an artificial introitus. However, this function
      of the foreskin is likely to be a general phenomenon. Masters
      and Johnson report [<a href="#n14">14</a>], `Only 6 of the 35
      uncircumcised study subjects failed to demonstrate
      significant exposure of the glans during or immediately
      subsequent to active coition.' They also note that this
      happened occasionally during auto manipulation. Thes
      statements imply that none of the subjects significantly
      exposed the glans by an erection and that the act of
      intromission generally rolled the foreskin back.</p>

      <p class="text">Current dictionaries use the term foreskin
      and prepuce interchangeably. It is now possible to make a
      clear distinction between them. According to Roberts [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>], `the <b>prepuce</b>, or sheath, is a
      double invagination of skin which contains and covers the
      free portion of the penis <i>when not erect</i> (italics
      mine) and covers the body of the penis behind the glans when
      the penis is erect.' A <b>foreskin</b> is a double
      invagination of skin that covers the glans when the penis is
      erect and is retracted over the body of the glans with
      intromission.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Homo sapiens</i> may be the only species
      that has a foreskin. Farm animals have prepuces [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>]. There are no published statements on
      non-human primates that allow classification. Personal
      communication indicates that many if not all Macaque species
      of monkeys do not have foreskins [<a href="#n16">16</a>].
      There is a prosimian species described as having an "...ample
      prepuce which narrows over the apex glandis in singularly
      human fashion' [<a href="#n17">17</a>] but the size of the
      flaccid penis looks small and seems unlikely to remain
      covered during an erection. The flaccid human penis is said
      to be uniquely large in relative size [<a href="#n7">7</a>].
      Also Hafez [<a href="#n18">18</a>] says, `Man is exceptional
      in attachment of the prepuce very close to the glans.' Both
      features may have been important in the evolution of the
      foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text">Primates other than chimpanzees generally
      have glans but with highly variable shapes [<a
      href="#n12">12</a> and <a href="#n19">19</a>]. Chimpanzees
      lack glans [<a href="#n20">20</a> and <a href="#n21">21</a>]
      and their prepuces may fail to fully cover the tip of a very
      pointed penis even when it is flaccid [see picture, [<a
      href="#n20">20</a>]]. The marked difference between early and
      late primates and between the late primates themselves raise
      interesting questions. What were the reproductive advantages
      to cause the evolution of such varied penies? How did these
      evolutionary forces tie in with the increasing use of sex for
      social purposes seen in chimpanzees and <i>Homo sapiens</i>?
      Thornhill and Palmer [<a href="#n22">22</a>] make a case for
      rape as an important ancestral strategy to allow males to
      obtain a higher number of mates. However, neither they nor
      Palmer [<a href="#n23">23</a>], who reviews the evidence for
      rape in non-human species, can point to anything besides the
      notal organ of the scorpion-fly as `...a trait being designed
      specifically to promote successful reproduction by rape.'
      Recognition that the foreskin makes intromission easier
      raises the possibility that it is an organ specifically
      designed for rape. The pointed penis of the chimpanzees might
      have been an alternative adaption for the same purpose.
      However, unlike the common chimpanzee [<a
      href="#n23">23</a>], it would appear that it is no longer
      useful in the pigmy chimpanzee, since they have no longer
      been observed to rape in the wild [<a href="#n9">9</a>].</p>
