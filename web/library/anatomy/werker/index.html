      <h2>The Prepuce Free Flap: Dissection Feasibility Study<br />
      and Clinical Application of a Super-Thin New Flap</h2>

      <h4>Paul M. N. Werker, M.D., Ph.D., Alex S. C. Terng, and
      Moshe Kon, M.D., Ph.D.</h4>
      <small><i>Utrecht, The Netherlands</i></small> 

      <p>The aim of this study was to develop a free flap of the
      male prepuce. First, a dissection feasibility study was
      performed on eight male cadavers. Dissection proved feasible,
      and the mean surface area of the prepuce when folded out, was
      46.7 cm<sup>2</sup>. The mean pedicle length was 15 cm, with
      a mean diameter of the inferior external pudendal artery at
      its orgin of 1.2 mm and a mean diameter of the inferior
      external pudendal vein at its orgin of 1.9 mm. Next, a
      viability study was performed by isolating a prepuce free
      flap during male-to-female sex reassignment procedures. The
      flap as well as the residual skin of the penis shaft remained
      well perfused. Thereafter, the new prepuce free flap was
      successfully applied for the reconstruction of defects of the
      floor of the mouth, tongue, and oropharynx in two patients.
      The thinness and pliability of the flap, its large surface
      area, the long vascular pedicle, and the limited donor-site
      morbidity are the major advantages of the new flap. The
      possibility to raise the flap simultaneously with the tumor
      resection is an additional advantage. The small caliber of
      the flap artery seems to be the only drawback. (<i>Plast.
      Reconstr. Surg.</i> 102: 1075, 1998.)</p>

      <p><span class="CIRP">CIRP NOTE: Prior to excision for the
      purposes of using the foreskin tissue for repair of oral
      cancers, the total surface areas of the inner and outer
      layers of the foreskins from two adult male patients were
      measured. Below are excerpts from the findings:</span></p>

      <p>CASE REPORTS</p>

      <p>Case 1: "The proximal border of the prepuce skin island
      was determined while traction was applied on the penis. Its
      skin surface area measured 64cm2 (8.5 x 7.5)." CIRP NOTE:
      This equals approximately 10 square inches of tissue.</p>

      <p>Case 2: "Subsequently, the prepuce flap was elevated,
      including again both the inner and outer layers of the
      prepuce. The flap's skin surface area was found to be 90cm2
      (10 x 9 cm)." <span class="CIRP">CIRP NOTE: This equals
      approximately 14 square inches of tissue.</span></p>
