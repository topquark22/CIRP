      <h3>Objective</h3>
      To assess the type and amount of tissue missing from the
      adult circumcised penis.

      <h3>Materials and methods</h3>
      The gross and histological features of the prepuces of 22
      adults obtained at autopsy were assessed, primarily focusing
      on the inner or mucosal surface of the prepuce.

      <h3>Results</h3>
      Skin and mucosa sufficient to cover the penile shaft was
      frequently missing from the circumcised penis. Missing tissue
      included a band of ridged mucosa located at the junction of
      true penile skin with smooth preputial mucosa. This ridged
      band contains more Meissner's corpuscles than does the smooth
      mucosa and exhibits features of specialized sensory mucosa.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      The amount of tissue loss estimated in the present study is
      more than most parents envisage from pre-operative
      counselling. Circumcision also ablates junctional mucosa that
      appears to be an important component of the overall sensory
      mechanism of the human penis.

      <h3>Keywords</h3>
      Prepuce, ridged band, Meissner's corpuscle, specialized
      mucosa, circumcision.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce is usually dismissed as skin [<a
      href="#ref1">1</a>],[<a href="#ref2">2</a>] or, less often,
      it is seen as a simple fold of skin and mucosa [<a
      href="#ref3">3</a>]. At best, the prepuce is thought to
      protect the glans penis; at worst it is a health hazard that
      may be avoided by circumcision [<a href="#ref4">4</a>], [<a
      href="#ref5">5</a>], [<a href="#ref6">6</a>]. Not
      surprisingly, articles and editorials on the advantages and
      disadvantages of circumcision consistently fail to discuss
      the prepuce as a tissue worthy of preservation in its own
      right.</p>

      <p class="text2">`Circumcision removes only a few millimeters
      of skin' is, in our experience, common and comforting counsel
      but has been neither proved nor disproved for North America
      or other countries where circumcision remains largely a
      cosmetic procedure.</p>

      <h3>Material and methods</h3>

      <p class="text1">The prepuces of 22 adults (mean age 37
      years, range 22-58) were studied grossly and histologically
      at autopsy. Ten prepuces extended to or beyond the tip of the
      glans and 12 prepuces failed to reach the tip of the glans.
      The material was unselected except for the age of the
      subjects (20-60 years) and for preputial length (`long' and
      `short'). The outer surface of the prepuce was measured from
      its tip to the sulcus of the glans; the skin of the penile
      shaft extended from the sulcus to the abdominal wall. The
      inner surface of the prepuce (`mucosa') was measured with the
      prepuce retracted but not stretched. The expected preputial
      tissue loss to circumcision (preputial skin plus mucosa) was
      reduced by 3 cm to allow for a residual mucosal cuff (the
      estimated cuff at autopsy was 2-4 cm). Ellipses of mucosa and
      submucosa (15 x 5 mm) were excised from four sites; the
      mucocutaneous junction, to include a cross-section of the
      `ridged band' (see below); the `smooth mucosa'; the corona of
      the glans penis; and the frenu lum of the prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mucosae were fixed in buffered 5%
      formol-saline, divided lengthwise into two blocks and
      embedded in paraffin wax. Subserial sections, 3-5 from each
      block, were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE).
      Meissner's corpuscles of the genitalia resemble those of
      finger-print skin and are identified in H&amp;E-stained
      sections as compact, pear-shaped or elongated, lamellated and
      encapsulated end-organs attached to the basal lamina of the
      mucous membrane, or located high in the mucosal papillae of
      preputial mucosa [<a href="#ref7">7</a>], [<a
      href="#ref8">8</a>]. Similar and additional end-organs of
      `ridged' and `smooth' mucosae were stained using the
      avidin-biotin-complex peroxidase technique using an antibody
      (Biomeda Corp, Foster City, CA, USA) against S100 protein [<a
      href="#ref9">9</a>] present in neurites and Schwann cells.
      Sections from each mucosal area were assessed
      semi-quantitatively for neural end-organs. Superficial blood
      vessels of the `ridged band' were filled with a silicone
      rubber mass placed in the superficial external pudendal
      artery, followed by dehydration and clearing of the mucosa
      samples through graded alcohol and methyl salicylate.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <h4>Normal prepuce</h4>
      The mean length of prepuce in this sample was 6.4 cm (range
      4.8-9.2) and covered 93% of the mean penile shaft (6.9 cm).
      Ten prepuces were as long as or longer than the shaft of the
      penis to which they belonged; three of them were &gt; 10%
      longer than the shaft and glans combined. Circumcision of
      these subjects, allowing for a 3 cm mucosal cuff, would have
      removed a mean of 3.4 cm (range 1.8-6.2) of (strictly)
      preputial skin and mucosa, or 51% of the length of the mean
      adult penile shaft, or more from nearly half the penises.

      <p class="text2">Unknown amounts of true skin were missing
      from the shaft of the circumcised adult penis. Therefore,
      four circumcised babies, 1-3 years of age, who had died for
      reasons unrelated to circumcision, were also reviewed. In
      each case, the cut edge of the skin of the penile shaft
      stopped 1-2 cm short of the glanular sulcus, an estimated
      shortfall in shaft skin of 20-25%. The mucosa between the
      cut-skin edge and corona of glans was stretched and flattened
      and contrasted sharply with the lax mucosa normally seen at
      this location (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1,</a> <a
      href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

      <h3>Ridged and smooth mucosal surfaces</h3>

      <p class="text1">When retracted, the inner surface of the
      prepuce displays two zones, `ridged' and `smooth' <a
      href="#fig3">(Fig. 3)</a>. The first, a transversely-ridged
      band of mucosa 10-15 mm wide, lies against the true skin
      edge, forming the outer surface of the tip of the prepuce. In
      the dorsal midline. the `ridged band' lies above the level of
      the adjacent `smooth' mucosa and merges smoothly, on either
      side, with the frenulum of the prepuce. When magnified, the
      ridged mucosa has a pebbled or coral-like appearance.
      Unretracted, the adult `ridged band' usually lies flat
      against the glans; retracted, the `ridged band' is everted on
      the shaft of the penis. The remainder of the preputial lining
      between the `ridged band' and the glans is smooth and lax.
      There is considerable variation in the degree of ridging:
      older subjects showed less and younger subjects more marked
      ridging. Some ridging was seen in all the prepuces examined
      <a href="#fig4">(Fig. 4</a>, <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>, <a
      href="#fig6">Fig. 6).</a> The intense vascularity of the
      `ridged band' was best seen in transilluminated mucosa <a
      href="#fig7a">(Fig. 7).</a></p>

      <h3>Mucosal histology</h3>

      <p class="text1">The inner surface of the prepuce is lined by
      variably-keratinized squamous epithelium similar to
      frictional of the mouth, vagina and oesophagus. The
      epithelium is papillated by stromal or `corial' tissue and is
      rich in nerves, Schwann cells, lymphoid cells and
      capillaries. Papillae are continuous with a highly vascular,
      loose-knit tissue layer that resembles the corium of oral
      mucosa. Preputial mucosa also lacks the dense collagenous
      zone seen in most areas of true (skin) dermis and, again
      unlike true skin of the penile shaft and outer surface of the
      prepuce, the mucosal surface of the prepuce is completely
      free of lanugo hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands.
      Smooth muscle bundles are common to both shaft skin and
      preputial mucosa.</p>

      <p class="text2">Histological cross-sections of the `ridged
      band' showed focal, spiky or more rounded, broader and
      flatter ridges interspersed with sulci. Meissner's corpuscles
      were more plentiful in some subjects than in others but
      perhaps significantly, they were only seen in the crests of
      ridges, occasionally in small clumps that expanded the tips
      of corial papillae (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>). End-organs
      were not seen in sulci between ridges in this material. S100
      staining (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>) showed additional
      end-organs and myelinated nerve fibres within papillae and
      confirmed the richly innervated nature of the `ridged band'.
      The distribution of Meissner's corpuscles in the mucosal
      ridges was best seen in tangential sections through the
      epithelium and tips of corial papillae of some but not all
      specimens. Sections of `smooth mucosa' showed no ridging of
      the mucosal surface, slightly shallower corial papillae and
      few Meissner's corpuscles. Meissner's corpuscles were seen in
      the frenulum and glans but no at tempt was made to compare
      smooth with deeply ridged mucosae. Histologically, no clear
      demarcation line can be drawn between true skin of the penile
      shaft and the `ridged band' at the precise tip of the
      prepuce.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text1">Teaching on the anatomy of the prepuce has
      undergone little change since that of Niccolo Massa,
      Alessandro Benedetti and other masters of the 15th century.
      `The skin covering the penis is remarkable for its thinness,
      its dark colour, and its looseness of connexion with the
      fascial sheath of the organ. At the neck of the penis, it is
      folded upon itself to form the prepuce or foreskin, which
      covers the glans for a variable distance' <a
      href="#ref10">[10</a>]. The current tendency to eliminate the
      prepuce from anatomy textbooks <a href="#ref1">[1</a>]
      reflects the popular emphasis on the glans; perhaps the
      wrinkling and pleating of the retracted prepuce, like
      unwanted hair, is an affront to good taste or simply
      superfluous to requirements.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present findings support the view that
      the lining of the prepuce is identical to and a prolongation
      of the common squamous mucosa of the glans and the
      balano-preputial sulcus [<a href="#ref11">11</a>]. The
      `ridged band' may be key to the persistent mislabelling of
      the inner lining of the prepuce as `skin'; it is clearly
      visible on inspection of the retracted prepuce, it is
      continuous with the wrinkled true skin of the tip of the
      prepuce, and it looks like skin. Histology aside, the
      `wrinkles' of the ridged band are regularly transverse and
      are difficult to efface by gentle stretching. A vascular
      blush is usually present.</p>

      <p class="text2">The vascular ridges of the `ridged band' and
      its Meissner's corpuscles firmly separate preputial
      epithelium from true skin and place preputial mucosa amongst
      other mucocutaneous mucosae. Winkelmann [<a
      href="#ref12">12</a>], [<a href="#ref13">13</a>] emphasized
      the structural and functional importance of junctional
      regions of the body and focused on mucocutaneous end-organs,
      or `genital corpuscles', of the glans penis and prepuce. Some
      of these end-organs resemble Krause end-bulbs; others
      resemble Meissner's corpuscles.</p>

      <p class="text2">Meissner's corpuscles of the prepuce may be
      compared with similar nerve-endings in the finger-tips and
      lips, which respond in a fraction of a second to contact with
      light objects that bring about deformation of their capsules
      [<a href="#ref14">14</a>]. However, complex sensation, at
      least in the glans penis, may be mediated by free
      nerve-endings rather than by specialized end-organs [<a
      href="#ref15">15</a>]. The mode of transmission of stimuli
      from the prepuce and glans penis has not been completely
      elucidated.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present findings suggest that a part of
      the prepuce differs in several ways from the rest of the
      prepuce; no attempt was made to quantify the specialized
      nerve endings of the `ridged band' because they should be
      seen in the context of their function and location in the
      crests of ridges. The present study examined the area as a
      whole rather than analysing it point by point. Clearly, the
      penis is a complex organ with many different parts, each
      specialized for a specific role.</p>

      <p class="text2">The prepuce provides a large and important
      platform for several nerves and nerve endings. The
      innervation of the outer skin of the prepuce is impressive
      [<a href="#ref16">16</a>]; its sensitivity to light touch and
      pain are similar to that of the skin of the penis as a whole.
      The glans, by contrast, is insensitive to light touch, heat,
      cold [<a href="#ref17">17</a>] and, as far as the authors are
      aware, to pin-prick. Le Gros Clark [<a href="#ref18">18</a>]
      noted that the glans penis is one of the few areas on the
      body that enjoys nothing beyond primitive sensory
      modalities.</p>

      <p class="text2">Here, the overall anatomy of the prepuce is
      partly repeated, to provide a framework for the `ridged band'
      of mucosa and ancillary structures; one of these, the Dartos
      fascia, keeps the delicate mucosal surface of the prepuce
      pressed flat against the glans [<a href="#ref19">19</a>].
      Whether this flattening, or closure, is important depends on
      the functions of glans and prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">We postulate that the `ridged band' with its
      unique structure, tactile corpuscles and other nerves, is
      primarily sensory tissue and that it cooperates with other
      components of the prepuce. In this model, the `smooth' mucosa
      and true skin of the adult prepuce act together to allow the
      `ridged band' to move from a forward to a `deployed' position
      on the shaft of the penis. In short, the prepuce should be
      considered a structural and functional unit made up of more
      and less specialized parts.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is generally thought that the prepuce
      protects the glans. However, it is equally likely that the
      glans shapes and protects the prepuce. In return, the glans
      and penile shaft gain excellent if surrogate sensitivity from
      the prepuce. Possibly, the `ridged band' helps mediate the
      afferent limb of the ejaculatory reflex. Another use has to
      be found for the infantile prepuce, which contains muscle
      bundles, blood vessels and nerves in profusion; its internal
      organization is poorly understood but a case can be made for
      sensory tissue with the rigidity and form associated with
      specific function.</p>
