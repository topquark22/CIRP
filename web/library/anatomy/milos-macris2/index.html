        <h3>CIRCUMCISION: MALE - EFFECTS UPON HUMAN SEXUALITY</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision, once accepted as the norm in
      the United States, has become controversial. Technically,
      circumcision is the surgical removal of the skin that
      normally covers and protects the head, or <i>glans</i>, of
      the penis. At birth, the penis is covered with a continuous
      layer of skin extending from the pubis to the tip of the
      penis where the foreskin (prepuce) folds inward upon itself,
      creating a double protective layer of skin over the glans
      penis. The inner lining of the prepuce is mucous membrane and
      serves to keep the surface of the glans penis (also mucous
      membrane) soft, moist, and sensitive. The prepuce is often
      erroneously referred to as ``redundant'' tissue, which allows
      the medical community and society-at-large to consider the
      foreskin an optional part of the male sex organ and,
      therefore, to condone its routine removal in a variety of
      procedures collectively known as ``circumcision.''</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision, however, was also a part of
      religious ritual, including Judaism and Islam as well as
      others. However, 85 percent of the world's male population is
      not circumcised. Circumcision in 1992 was still the most
      commonly performed surgical procedure in America, where 59
      percent of newborn males underwent this operation.
      Circumcision reached its peak of 85 to 90 percent during the
      1960s and 1970s. The surgery, usually performed on baby boys
      within the first few days of life, is often considered
      "routine." The most popular methods, the <a
      href="/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco</a> clamp and the <a
      href="/library/procedure/plastibell/">Plastibell</a>
      procedures, differ somewhat in technique and instrumentation
      but the effects on the penis and the baby are basically the
      same. Most of the American circumcisions are not done for
      religious reasons, but rather, for hygienic ones.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Medical Procedure</b><br />
       Usually, the procedure for circumcision in America involves
      the baby being strapped spread-eagle to a plastic board, with
      his arms and legs immobilized by Velcro straps. A nurse
      scrubs his genitals with an antiseptic solution and places a
      surgical drape - with a hole in it to expose his penis -
      across his body. The doctor grasps the tip of the foreskin
      with one hemostat and inserts another hemostat between the
      foreskin and the glans. (In 96 percent of newborns, these two
      structures are attached to one another by a continuous layer
      of epithelium, which protects the sensitive glans from urine
      and feces in infancy and childhood.) The foreskin is then
      torn from the glans. The hemostat is used to crush an area of
      the foreskin lengthwise, which prevents bleeding when the
      doctor cuts through the tissue to enlarge the foreskin
      opening. This allows insertion of the circumcision
      instrument. The foreskin is crushed against this device
      circumferentially and amputated.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anesthesia was not used to alleviate infant
      suffering until recently because it was believed that babies
      do not feel pain. Additionally, it was recognized that
      anesthesia was risky for the newborn, thus contributing to
      the medical reluctance to use it for painful procedures on
      infants, such as circumcision. Currently, some doctors use a
      dorsal penile nerve block to numb the penis during infant
      circumcision. While not always effective, this anesthesia may
      afford some pain relief during the surgery, although it
      offers no pain relief during the recovery period (which can
      last up to 14 days) when the baby urinates and defecates into
      the raw wound.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Function of the Foreskin</b><br />
       To understand the function of the prepuce, it is necessary
      to understand the function of the penis. While it is commonly
      recognized that the penis has two functions - urination and
      procreation - in reality, it is essential only for
      procreation, since it is not required for urination.</p>

      <p class="text2">For procreation to occur, the normally
      flaccid penis must become erect. As it changes from
      flaccidity to rigidity, the penis increases in length about
      50 percent. As it elongates, the double fold of skin
      (foreskin) provides the skin necessary for full expansion of
      the penile shaft. But microscopic examination reveals that
      the foreskin is more than just penile skin necessary for a
      natural erection; it is specialized tissue, richly supplied
      with blood vessels, highly innervated, and uniquely endowed
      with stretch receptors. These attributes of the foreskin
      contribute significantly to the sexual response of the intact
      male. The complex tissue of the foreskin responds to
      stimulation during sexual activity. Stretching of the
      foreskin over the glans penis activates preputial nerve
      endings, enhances sexual excitability, and contributes to the
      male ejaculatory reflex. Besides the neurological role of the
      preputial tissue, the mucosal surface of the inner lining of
      the foreskin has a specific function during masturbation or
      sexual relations.</p>

      <p class="text2">During masturbation, the mucosal surface of
      the foreskin rolls back and forth across the mucosal surface
      of the glans penis, providing nontraumatic sexual
      stimulation. During heterosexual activity, the mucosal
      surfaces of the glans penis and foreskin move back and forth
      across the mucosal surfaces of the labia and vagina,
      providing nontraumatic sexual stimulation of both male and
      female. This mucous-membrane-to-mucous-membrane contact
      provides the natural lubrication necessary for sexual
      relations and prevents both the dryness responsible for
      painful intercourse and the chafing and abrasions which allow
      entry of sexually transmitted diseases, both viral and
      bacterial.</p>

      <p class="text2">When normal, sexually functioning tissue is
      removed, sexual functioning is also altered. Changes of the
      penis that occur with circumcision have been documented.
      These may vary according to the procedure used and the age at
      which the circumcision was performed, nevertheless penile
      changes will inevitably occur following circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision performed in the newborn period
      traumatically interrupts the natural separation of the
      foreskin from the glans that normally occurs somewhere
      between birth and age 18. The raw, exposed glans penis heals
      in a process that measurably thickens the surface of the
      glans and results in desensitization of the head of the
      penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">When circumcision is performed after the
      normal separation of the foreskin from the glans, the damage
      done by forcible separation of these two parts of the penis
      is avoided, but the glans must still thicken in order to
      protect itself from constant chafing and abrasion by
      clothing.</p>

      <p class="text2">The thickened, drier tissue covering the
      glans of the circumcised penis may necessitate the use of
      synthetic lubricants to facilitate nontraumatic sexual
      intercourse. Often, it is erroneously considered the woman's
      lack of lubrication that makes intercourse painful rather
      than the lack of natural male lubrication, which is more
      likely the cause. During masturbation, the circumcised male
      must use his hands for direct stimulation of the glans, and
      this may require synthetic lubrication as well.</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to the predictable physical
      changes that occur with circumcision, there are inherent
      risks and potential complications from the surgery. These
      include, but are not limited to, hemorrhage, infection,
      surgical damage and, while rare, death. Surgical damage and
      healing complications can result in extensive scarring, skin
      bridging, curvature of the penis, and deformities of the
      glans penis and urethral meatus (urinary opening). Extreme
      mutilations have resulted from inappropriate electrocautery
      use in circumcision, causing loss of the entire penis.
      Sex-change operations have been used as a ``remedy'' for this
      iatrogenic condition.</p>

      <p class="text2">While circumcision has potential risks and
      alters normal, sexual functioning of the penis, proponents of
      the practice consider it to confer many "prophylactic"
      benefits on the recipient. This rationale was initiated in
      the English-speaking countries during the 19th century when
      the etiology of diseases was unknown. At that time,
      circumcision evolved from a religious ritual or puberty rite
      into routine surgery for "health" reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">Within the miasma of myth and ignorance, a
      theory emerged that masturbation caused many and varied ills,
      so some physicians thought it logical to perform genital
      surgery on both sexes to stop masturbation. In 1891, P.C.
      Remondino advocated circumcision to prevent or to cure
      alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, hernia, gout, rheumatism,
      curvature of the spine, and headaches. As scientific research
      uncovered legitimate pathological etiology for diseases
      previously thought to be prevented or cured by circumcision,
      new rationales were postulated to validate the practice.
      Prophylactic circumcision of females fell out of vogue in
      English-speaking countries, but the incidence of male
      circumcision steadily rose. In the early 20th century,
      circumcision was advocated as a hygienic measure. Though
      criticism of the practice mounted, it was not until <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975</a> that the
      American Academy of Pediatrics came out in opposition,
      arguing that good personal hygiene would offer all the
      advantages of routine circumcision without the attendant
      surgical risk. The advent of antibiotics negated the
      rationale that circumcision was needed to prevent venereal
      disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">As a religious ritual, circumcision is
      practiced by Jews and Moslems in accordance with the biblical
      account of Abraham's covenant with God. Even so, the
      ``purpose'' of the Jewish ritual of circumcision has been
      argued by Jews throughout history. Noted Rabbi Moses
      Maimonides, in the <a
      href="/library/cultural/maimonides/"><i>Guide of the
      Perplexed</i></a>, explains a rationale for circumcision that
      merits attention when circumcision is considered relative to
      human sexuality.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">As regards circumcision... [s]ome people
        believe that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's
        formation; but every one can easily reply: How can products
        of nature be deficient so as to require external
        completion, especially as the use of the foreskin to that
        organ is evident. This commandment has not been enjoined as
        a complement to a deficient physical creation, but as a
        means for perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The bodily
        injury caused to that organ is exactly that which is
        desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does
        it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply
        counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that
        circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and
        sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment; the organ
        necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is
        deprived of its covering from the beginning.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The Moslems, who also circumcise in
      accordance with the biblical covenant between Abraham and
      God, traditionally circumcised their males at age 13. More
      recently, however, Moslem boys are circumcised at varying
      ages from birth to puberty.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the United States, the religious rights
      of parents are being questioned in regard to the
      constitutional rights of infants and children. Freedom of
      religion became a legal issue when it was introduced in a
      circumcision lawsuit claiming a male had been denied
      <i>his</i> right to freedom of religion when his body was
      marked by circumcision in accordance with <i>his parents'</i>
      religion.</p>

      <p class="text2">The inalienable body ownership rights of
      infants and children continue to be addressed within the U.S.
      legal system in lawsuits asserting that the only person who
      can legally consent to a circumcision is a person making this
      personal decision for himself. The reports of dissatisfaction
      with parental circumcision decisions by circumcised men help
      to illustrate this point. Performed on their penises without
      their consent, thousands are now undergoing foreskin
      restoration, either medical or surgical, to reconstruct what
      they consider was violently taken from their bodies early in
      their lives. <a
      href="/pages/intactivist/declaration/">The Declaration of
      the First International Symposium on Circumcision</a>
      acknowledges the unrecognized victims of circumcision and, in
      support of genital ownership rights of infants and children,
      states: ``We recognize the inherent right of every human
      being to an intact body. Without religious or racial
      prejudice, we affirm this basic human right.'' Due to the
      lifelong consequences of the permanent surgical alteration of
      children's genitals, it becomes imperative that children have
      the right to own their own reproductive organs and to
      preserve their natural sexual function.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">These, then, are the human genitals.
        Considering their great delicacy, complexity and
        sensitivity, one might imagine that an intelligent species
        like man would leave them alone. Sadly, this has never been
        the case. For thousands of years, in many different
        cultures, the genitals have fallen victim to an amazing
        variety of mutilations and restrictions. For organs that
        are capable of giving us an immense amount of pleasure,
        they have been given an inordinate amount of pain. (Morris,
        1985)</p>
