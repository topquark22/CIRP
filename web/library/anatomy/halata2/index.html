      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This article is mis-named. In
      reality, only the innervation of the glans penis is
      described. No mention is made of the important nerves in the
      foreskin. This file does not include two illustrations
      published with the original article.]</p>

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Male reproductive
      behaviour has a complex neural organization. The penile
      erection and ejaculation require the integration and proper
      sequencing of somatic, sympathetic, and parasympathetic
      innervation</span> (Johnson and Halata, 1991). In the present
      poster we try to answer two questions: 1. which type of
      sensory nerve endings occur and 2. how they are distributed.
      We have concentrated on the sensory nerves of the glans
      penis.</p>

      <h4>MATERIAL AND METHODS</h4>

      <p class="text">In total 4 specimens of human penis were
      studied. One penis was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
      formaldehyde, after embedding in paraffin, 8&micro;m thick
      sections were obtained and stained with a silver impregnation
      technique (Spaethe, 1984). Small cubes (side length ca. 3 mm)
      from three cases of sex reversal between 22 and 28 years,
      were processed for electron microscopy.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS AND SUMMARY</h4>

      <p class="text">The glans penis skin is covered by a thin
      keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (Fig. 1). The
      epithelium has rete ridges varying in height depending on the
      region of glans and the age. The epithelium over the ventral
      surface surrounding the frenulum is thinner than that of the
      dorsal aspect. The rete ridges are higher and narrower in
      younger than in older individuals.</p>

      <p class="text">The dermis underlying the epithelium consists
      of a dense connective tissue. The papillary layer forms the
      overlying rete ridges. The dense reticular layer of the
      dermis blends with the trabeculae separating the blood
      sinuses of the corpus spongiousum. Sensory nerve endings in
      the skin of glans penis are located in all tissue layers. In
      the epidermis and dermis free nerve endings are to be found
      (Fig. 1 asterisks); in the dermis genital end bulbs (Fig 1
      arrows; Fig 2 asterisks), Pacinian corpuscles and rarely
      Ruffini corpuscles can be identified. Free nerve endings are
      located throughout the glans penis ad represent the most
      common type of sensory nerve endings. They are derived from
      thin myelinated axons (diameter 1-3 &micro;m) or from
      unmyelinated C fibers. Two different types of genital end
      bulbs are to be recognized. Corpuscles tightly abutting the
      overlaying epithelium are small and lack a perineural
      capsule. Large genital end bulbs are situated deeper in the
      dermis and are completely surrounded by a multilayered
      perineural capsule (Fg. 2-2). Occasionally small and large
      Pacinian corpuscles are to be found deep in the dermis of the
      dorsal aspect and corona glandis region. Ruffini corpuscles
      are only occasionally to be observed in the dense connective
      tissue of the dermis by means of electron microscopy. The
      afferent myelinated axon has a diameter of 2-4 &micro;m (Fig.
      2-1). Most of the corpuscles have an incomplete perineural
      capsule.</p>

      <p class="text">In contrast to typical glabrous skin, the
      so-called mucocutaneous tissue of the glans penis contains a
      predominance of free nerve endings, numerous genital end
      bulbs and rarely Pacinian and Ruffinian corpuscles. <span
      class="yellow">Merkel nerve endings and Meissner corpuscles
      are not present.</span></p>
