        <h2>What exactly is circumcision and what is it not?</h2>

        <p><b>by Francisco Garcia</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>Infant circumcision is made more acceptable by believing
      the notion that there is a flap of skin at the end of the
      penis called the foreskin which hangs over the glans and
      circumcision simply removes that flap. This is factually
      incorrect. By thinking that the foreskin is separate or
      "extra" tissue it is easier to believe that its removal does
      little to impact or change the rest of the skin of the
      penis.</p>

      <p>There is really no separate anatomical structure called
      the foreskin. Rather there is one single continuous skin
      sheath of the penis which is called the skin system. This
      single, uninterrupted skin sheath may, at any given time,
      fold to varying degrees over the glans or retract to reveal
      it. The amount of the skin system that is folded over can be
      referred to as the forefold of the skin system. Its extent
      changes often to accommodate degrees of erection, and it is
      never a separate structure from the skin of the shaft.</p>

      <p>What the operation called circumcision actually does then
      is to interrupt and significantly reduce the skin system of
      the penis to a fraction of its normal anatomical and
      functional extent.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>The skin system of the penis</h3>

      <p>The intact penis is covered by one single continuous skin
      sheath or skin system. The skin sheath is partly folded at
      different times. This folded part of the skin system is
      called the foreskin or prepuce.</p>

      <p>The fold of skin is often mistaken as a single layer, or a
      flap of skin. This is wrong. Instead, it is a free, two-layer
      fold that forms when the skin coming down the penis from the
      shaft folds underneath itself somewhere near the tip of the
      penis then travels back to an attachment point behind the
      glans (see figures 6 and 4). The two sides of the fold do not
      adhere to each other even though they lie flat against each
      other appearing to form a single flap of skin.</p>

      <p>Also, in the adult the skin system does not adhere to the
      glans so it can unfold back off of the glans, leaving it
      fully exposed. When we speak of this skin sheath we are not
      talking about the surface of the glans itself in the same way
      that we talk about the surface of the shaft, because the
      glans has no real skin. When we talk about the skin covering
      of the glans, this can only mean the foreskin. The foreskin
      is its skin covering.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>The fictitious foreskin</h3>

      <p>A significant anatomical error has been made historically
      and continues today in describing the penis by delineating
      the "foreskin" as a separate anatomical structure from the
      shaft skin. People talk about the "foreskin" separately from
      the shaft skin. This is a mistake. It is not correct.</p>

      <p>The foreskin is not a separate anatomical structure from
      the rest of the skin of the penis. This is actually an
      artificial separation. When the word foreskin is used, rather
      than referring to a separate part of the penis, it means the
      part of the continuous skin system which happens to be folded
      over the glans at any given time. So there is no real
      anatomical border to the "foreskin." Since the proportion of
      the skin system that is folded over the glans increases and
      decreases by folding and unfolding to various degrees all the
      time, we realize that "foreskin" is a poor way of describing
      the anatomy of the penis. Instead, more accurate terminology
      might be to describe that part of the skin system which
      covers the glans as the "forefold of the skin system."</p>

      <p>Unlike the false border between "foreskin" and shaft skin,
      there is a real anatomical border which exists in the skin
      system. It is between the mucosal, or non-keratinized, part
      of the skin system (which consists of the inner lining of the
      foreskin along with the surface of the glans) and the
      keratinized part (which is the outer penile skin, including
      the outer foreskin). That border is at the most distal part,
      or tip, of the skin system - it is the tip of the forefold
      (see figures 6 and 7).<br />
      </p>

      <h3>The mobility of the skin system</h3>

      <p>The entire skin system moves freely. In the intact
      (uncircumcised) male, the penis has a low friction gliding
      plane immediately beneath the surface of the skin which is
      like no other body structure. This means that the skin of the
      penis does not adhere to the underlying tissue the way that
      skin adheres to other parts of the body. This unique quality
      allows the entire skin of the penis to move as a unit back
      and forth longitudinally or around the shaft
      circumferentially making it the most mobile skin in the
      intact male.</p>

      <p>The skin system covers the head of the penis to varying
      degrees depending on moment-to-moment factors such as the
      state of erection and temperature. The free fold of the skin
      system which we call "foreskin" unfolds and re-folds
      constantly to varying degrees, adjusting to the current state
      of the penis. It is a very dynamic system. The foreskin,
      among other functions, provides the penis with a reservoir of
      skin which is needed during erection. The skin of the erect,
      intact penis is still mobile and loose, allowing the mucosal
      inner foreskin to roll back and forth over the glans (see
      figure 7).</p>

      <p>Thus, the dividing line between what we call the skin of
      the shaft and foreskin is regularly crossed by the "shaft
      skin" or "foreskin." The delineated "foreskin" may become
      entirely "shaft skin" when the penis becomes more erect
      because it is now around the shaft. And if the penis shrinks
      momentarily beyond its usual flaccid state, perhaps due to a
      cold swim at the beach, some of the "shaft skin" is now
      "foreskin" because it covers the glans. The skin system is a
      dynamic, mobile and flexible skin sheath that moves and
      adjusts to the momentary needs of the penis (see figure 7).
      Such a system is not normally observed in the circumcised
      male.</p>

      <p>Another anatomical error is committed in describing the
      foreskin as a flap of skin protruding from the shaft skin
      (figure 6a). This notion presumes that the foreskin is a
      single layer of skin, like the skin of the shaft, which grows
      from the shaft to cover the glans. In describing the foreskin
      this way it is easier to see it as redundant or "extra skin"
      and it is more difficult to see how removing it might impact
      the rest of the penis. This description of the foreskin is
      inaccurate. The foreskin is not "extra" skin which protrudes
      from the shaft. There is no extra skin on the body - this is
      a silly notion. Instead, it is a free, double-layered fold -
      an integral part of the skin system. The foreskin extends
      from a point on the shaft behind the glans to cover the glans
      then folds back underneath itself to the same attachment
      point on the shaft, usually near the glans (see figure 6).
      The eyelid works much the same way. The eye lid is not a
      single flap of skin, but rather two freely moving layers of a
      fold of skin, so that both the foreskin and the eyelid have
      two layers. That's why it is more appropriate to refer to the
      "foreskin" as the forefold of the skin system.</p>

      <p>In reality then, infant circumcision does not remove the
      "tip of the penis" or "redundant skin" nor does it remove a
      separate structure called "the foreskin." Rather, infant
      circumcision deletes a significant percentage of the skin
      system of the penis, rendering the skin system relatively
      dysfunctional and rendering the penis less dynamic.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>The "triple whammy"</h3>
      The circumcised penis loses sensitivity in three ways: 

      <ol>
        <li><b>Loss of the foreskin nerves themselves.</b> As has
        been demonstrated by studies such as the one by Dr. Taylor
        and by the testimonials of the majority of intact men, the
        inner foreskin possesses a greater density of nerve
        endings. It is thought to be more erogenous than even the
        glans. The is no question that the foreskin is a highly
        erogenous tissue. This tremendous amount of sensitivity is
        lost completely when the forefold of the skin system is
        amputated. In addition to this, the most sensitive part of
        the penis, the frenulum of the foreskin, is either
        partially or totally removed in most infant circumcisions.
        The frenulum is the continuation of the inner foreskin
        which attaches to the underside (ventral part) of the
        glans. Thus, a significant percentage, if not the majority,
        of erogenous nerve supply to the penis is removed in
        circumcision at birth.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><b>Damage to the glans.</b> The erogenous sensitivity
        that remains after circumcision is primarily in the glans.
        This is further reduced by removal of the protective
        foreskin which leaves the glans permanently exposed. Unlike
        the shaft of the penis, and most of the rest of the body,
        the head of the penis, does not posses its own attached
        skin. This structure, like the eye ball and the gums of the
        mouth, is a somewhat naked structure. Its surface is
        non-keratinized, like that of the gums, the eye ball, and
        the clitoris in women. That means that it does not posses a
        protective thick layer like the keratinized skin of the
        outer penile skin system. Like the gums and the eye ball,
        the glans of the intact penis has a retractible skin
        covering. The skin covering of the glans <em>is</em> the
        foreskin. The eyelid is very similar in architecture to the
        foreskin. If the eyelid were removed and the eyeball were
        to become keratinized, you'd have a much harder time
        seeing. The same is true of the glans. It becomes
        artificially keratinized (dry, ha rdened, discolored, and
        wrinkled) as a result of permanent exposure, and thus less
        sensitive. Because most American men are circumcised and
        have a glans of this nature, it is harder to notice the
        abnormality. But just compare the glans of an intact man
        with that of a circumcised man next to each other and
        you'll notice a big difference. Thus, in addition to
        removing lots of erogenous nerve endings in the inner
        foreskin and frenulum, circumcision further desensitizes
        the remaining sensitivity of the glans by leaving it
        exposed.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><b>Loss of skin mobility.</b> The nerve endings in the
        glans are predominantly complex touch receptors also known
        as mechanoreceptors. This is different from the light touch
        receptors of the skin which detect surface friction. The
        mechanorecptors are best stimulated by massage action
        rather than surface friction. Thus, the glans is best
        stimulated to feel pleasure by a rolling massage action.
        With an ample and highly mobile skin system that rolls over
        the glans with pressure from the opposing surface, this
        optimal stimulation of the glans is achieved while avoiding
        direct friction of the delicate glans surface. Direct
        friction tends to fire off pain receptors causing
        irritation and also causes further keratinization of the
        glans. With the skin system of the penis significantly
        reduced by circumcision, the mobility is essentially gone
        and now the penis is a static mass with no dynamic self
        stimulation mechanism. Now, it must be rubbed. Direct
        friction is now the primary form of stimulation. So then
        circumcision further reduces erogenous sensitivity in the
        penis by reducing skin mobility and thus the ability to use
        the foreskin to massage the glans. The combination of
        foreskin and glans in concert results in an even higher
        level of stimulation which is unknown to the circumcised
        male.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      Circumcision of an infant male significantly reduces
      erogenous pleasure potential in his penis when he becomes
      sexually active and continues to be reduced as he ages until,
      in many cases, he is left with relatively little
      sensation.<br />

      <h2>Adult Circumcision vs. Infant Circumcision</h2>

      <p>A common misperception is that infant circumcision is
      preferable to adult circumcision because it spares a man pain
      and trauma. Many physicians however say the opposite and
      critics admit that most of their objections to infant
      circumcision cannot be applied to the adult procedure. Here's
      why:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>More precise with better outcome.</b> Circumcision
        of an adult can be more precise and less risky than for the
        infant. This is because the adult penis is fully formed.
        Many plastic surgeons operate on the penis in the erect
        state because this way it is clear to what extent the skin
        is stretched during erection. In the infant, this more
        precise method cannot be employed. Also, based on the
        knowledge of his own penis, the adult patient can specify
        how much tissue to remove, the infant cannot. In terms of
        how much tissue to remove, there is much more guess work
        involved in the infant and often too much skin is removed.
        In adult circumcision precise instruments are used. In the
        infant, usually more cumbersome and less precise
        instruments like the Gomco clamp are used. The results of
        operating on a fully formed penis, in the erect state, with
        precise instruments by a trained surgeon, benefit the adult
        and not the infant.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><b>Reduced risk of injury.</b> For the same reasons
        mentioned above, injury to the penis is less likely in
        adult circumcision than in infant circumcision. It is less
        likely that too much or too little tissue will be removed
        and the chances of lacerating the glans itself are also
        minimized. Scarring is also reduced in the adult.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><b>Reduced loss of sensitivity.</b> Because in the
        adult, the penis has had many years to develop with a
        foreskin covering, the glans is fully sensitive at the time
        of the circumcision. The glans has grown with its
        protective covering and the foreskin has already separated
        naturally from the glans. This spares the adult some of the
        sensitivity loss that occurs when circumcision is performed
        at birth. At birth, the foreskin must be torn away from the
        glans to which it is normally adhered. Then, the denuded
        glans of the infant spends much time exposed to caustic
        urine while in diapers. In adult circumcision this early
        damage to the glans is avoided.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><b>Personal choice.</b> With adult circumcision the
        patient is making a personal choice to have himself
        circumcised. He has the option of comparing the pros and
        cons and has had the opportunity to know what having a
        foreskin is like. This eliminates the "lack of choice"
        objection made by critics. With elected adult circumcision,
        critics see no violation of rights.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><b>Reduced potential psychological effects.</b> With
        adult circumcision potential psychological effects are
        reduced. This is because the patient understands the
        experience. He knows why it is happening and that he has
        chosen this. Anesthesia is used in the adult and is usually
        omitted or ineffective in the infant. In contrast, the
        infant has an experience of inexplicable pain and terror
        which he cannot rationalize as an adult. Some speculate
        that this intensely painful experience for the infant can
        lead to problems later on. Although on the surface it may
        seem that an infant is less sensitive to or unaware of the
        circumcision experience, he does experience it fully and
        because of his very formative and psychologically sensitive
        age, the experience is thought to be potentially more
        impacting than it is for the adult.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Even though the facts do not support the claim that adult
      circumcision is "worse" than infant circumcision, some
      pro-circumcision advocates contend that adult circumcision is
      painful, traumatic and dangerous, and that for this reason
      most adult men who are intact choose to remain uncircumcised.
      But when intact men are asked about the idea of being
      circumcised, most say that they have no desire to give up
      this part of their body - there is no reason to even consider
      it. Their foreskin gives them no more trouble than their
      eyelids, lips or testicles. Instead it affords them pleasure
      and comfort. Anti-circumcision advocates say that it is
      ridiculous to presume that the idea would even cross an
      uncircumcised man's mind. To them, it is the same as asking
      why intact women don't think about having the clitoral
      foreskin removed.</p>
