      <blockquote>
        For various reasons, penile and clitoral prepuces have been
        amputated from children in certain human societies for
        thousands of years. Although the justifications for male
        and female circumcision have changed over the last several
        thousand years, the practice of circumcision has not been
        examined from the perspective of primate evolution. Why do
        primates have a prepuce, and what function does it have?
        The comparative anatomy between human and non-human
        primates will be reviewed with a specific focus on the
        sensory innervation of the prepuce and glans.

      <h3>1. HISTORY OF THE PRIMATE PREPUCE</h3>

      <p class="text">Since the prepuce is a common feature in the
      primate external genitalia of both sexes, it is likely that
      the prepuce has been present and has provided specialised
      functions for at least the last 65 million years of primate
      evolution.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The human penis, in
      particular, has retained and modified its prepuce over a
      period of extraordinarily rapid evolution.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> The rapid divergence in external
      genital anatomy between humans and ancestral apes is thought
      to have occurred in the last seven million years.</p>

      <h3>2. SENSORY FUNCTION OF THE PREPUCE</h3>

      <p class="text">The prepuce provides a complete or partial
      covering of the glans clitoridis or penis. For over a hundred
      years, anatomical research has confirmed that both the penile
      and clitoral prepuce are richly innervated, specific
      erogenous tissue with specialised encapsulated (corpuscular)
      sensory receptors, such as Meissner's corpuscles, Pacinian
      corpuscles, genital corpuscles, Krause end bulbs, Ruffini
      corpuscles, and mucocutaneous corpuscles. These receptors
      transmit sensations of fine touch, pressure, proprioception,
      and temperature.<sup><a href="#n3">3-13</a></sup> Although
      autonomic nerves accompany the sensory nerves in the
      genitalia, this paper will not discuss their important
      functions.</p>

      <p class="text">The two primary sensory receptors in primate
      skin are free nerve endings and encapsulated or corpuscular
      receptors. While free nerve endings (pain, itch, and
      temperature receptors) are found in most skin, the
      encapsulated receptors are concentrated in regions that
      require specialised touch sensitivity, such as at the
      fingertips, lips, external genitalia, perianal skin, and
      transition areas between skin and mucous membranes.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> In this paper, corpuscular receptors
      will be used as a generic term to include Meissner's
      corpuscles, mucocutaneous receptors, genital corpuscles, and
      Pacinian corpuscles. All of these receptors have a capsule
      and an inner core composed of both neural and non-neural
      elements. Although the Pinkus corpuscle (also referred to as
      Haarscheibe, or hederiform ending) does not have a true
      capsule, it is a genital sensory receptor associated with
      Merkel cells.</p>

      <p class="text">The capsule of corpuscular receptors is a
      continuation of the perineurium and the core includes
      preterminal and terminal portions of the nerve fibres
      surrounded by laminated layers of modified Schwann cells
      (laminar cells). The Meissner corpuscles, genital corpuscles,
      and mucocutaneous receptors are similar in that there is a
      complex branching of the nerves within the corpuscular core.
      In contradistinction, the Pacinian corpuscle has a single
      nerve through the core, which is surrounded by laminar cells
      to form an onion bulb configuration.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> It was not until 1991 that the
      ridged bands of the male prepuce were identified as a
      concentrated area of corpuscular receptors.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16-17</a></sup> At that time, it was unknown
      whether the ridged band existed in the female prepuce or in
      other non-human primates. A later histologic study of the
      penile and clitoral prepuce, carried out on human and
      non-human primates, showed that corpuscular receptors are
      concentrated at the prepuce/glans penis and the prepuce/glans
      clitoridis interface in humans and rhesus monkeys.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Surprisingly different patterns of
      innervation, however, are seen between human and non-human
      male primates.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text">The rhesus monkey has fewer corpuscular
      receptors in the prepuce and more corpuscular receptors in
      the glans. In humans, however, the glans penis has few
      corpuscular receptors and predominant free nerve
      endings,<sup><a href="#n19">19-20</a></sup> consistent with
      protopathic sensibility. Protopathic simply refers to a low
      order of sensibility (consciousness of sensation), such as to
      deep pressure and pain, that is poorly localised. The cornea
      of the eye is also protopathic, since it can react to a very
      minute stimulus, such as a hair under the eyelid, but it can
      only localise which eye is affected and not the exact
      location of the hair within the conjunctival sac. As a
      result, the human glans penis has virtually no fine touch
      sensation and can only sense deep pressure and pain at a high
      threshold. This was first reported by the inventor of the
      aesthesiometer,<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> and led Sir
      Henry Head to make his famous comparison with the back of the
      heel.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> While the human glans
      penis is protopathic, the prepuce contains a high
      concentration of touch receptors in the ridged band. In
      addition, intraepithelial nerves are identified in the common
      fused prepuce/glans penis epithelium of the three-month old
      rhesus monkey. In the female, the prepuce/glans clitoridis
      interface contains many corpuscular receptors in both humans
      and rhesus monkeys.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text">The preputial interface between the glans
      penis and glans clitoridis is an area of specialised
      innervation.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Winkelmann's
      anatomical investigations have identified the prepuce as a
      primary erogenous zone in humans.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> In other mammals, it is known that
      the male prepuce is important for normal copulatory function,
      because surgical removal of the prepuce disturbs normal
      copulatory behaviour in male mammals,<sup><a
      href="#n25">25-26</a></sup> and similarly alters sexual
      behaviour in humans.<sup><a href="#n27">27-28</a></sup> Most
      likely, the changes in copulatory behaviour in circumcised
      male mammals are explained by the sensory alterations caused
      by preputial loss. In the human penis, the prepuce is known
      to have ten times more corpuscular sensory receptors than the
      glans penis.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> Therefore, the
      amputation of the prepuce results in the loss of the majority
      of fine-touch neuroreceptors found in the penis, leaving only
      the uninhibited protopathic sensibility of the artificially
      externalised glans penis. The imbalance caused by not having
      the input from the now ablated fine-touch receptors may be a
      leading cause of the changes in sexual behaviour noted in
      circumcised human males.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup>
      Animal studies must be interpreted with caution, however,
      because of the marked difference in genital sensory
      innervation between humans and many other mammals. In
      particular, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and baboons would be
      poor animal models to study behavioural effects of
      circumcision because of the different pattern of corpuscular
      receptors in the glans penis and prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text">In addition to the changes in sexual
      behaviour, it has been shown that an infant's response to
      pain can be altered for years as a consequence of
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n31">31-32</a></sup> As noted by
      Taddio, "postsurgical central sensitization (allodynia and
      hyperalgesia) can extend to sites of the body distal from the
      wound," suggesting a supraspinal effect.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> How the central nervous system is
      altered in humans to account for these behavioural changes is
      not understood, but in addition to central nervous system
      changes, peripheral nervous system damage is also exhibited
      by loss of the preputial corpuscular receptors and by
      amputation neuromas at the circumcision scar.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> This is consistent with the large
      numbers of nerve bundles in the male prepuce, which range
      from 6/nm dorsally to 18/nm ventrally. Although Taddio's work
      suggests a central nervous system change, it is unclear
      whether circumcision alters sexual behaviour by central
      nervous system changes, local sensory alterations of the
      external genitalia or a combination of both central and
      peripheral nervous system changes. <span
      class="yellow">Alteration in penile sensitivity most likely
      explains the sexual behaviour alteration associated with
      circumcision. Because of the sexual behaviour changes
      associated with circumcision, veterinary medicine avoids
      circumcising breeding stock and carefully repairs preputial
      damage.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> Non-human primate
      breeding programs do not use circumcision.</span></p>

      <h3>3. SEXUAL SELECTION AND DIVERSITY OF EXTERNAL
      GENITALIA</h3>

      <p class="text">Before discussing the vast diversity of the
      external genitalia of primates, it is necessary to review the
      basic theories of evolution. The vast diversity of living
      organisms is explained by the theory of natural selection,
      which was put forth by Charles Darwin (and independently by
      Alfred Russell Wallace) in 1858-1859.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> This theory states that a process of
      evolution has produced the variation that is documented by
      the fossil record and among living organisms.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> Darwin states, "This preservation of
      favourable individual differences and variations, and the
      destruction of those which are injurious, I have called
      Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest." In
      addition to natural selection, Darwin proposed sexual
      selection to explain why in some species the males have such
      magnificent ornaments and in some species such impressive
      weapons. Darwin proposed that either females choose
      particularly ornate males (female choice), or alternatively,
      females accept the winner of fights among males (male-male
      competition). Darwin describes female choice as accepting
      "not the male which is most attractive to her, but the one
      which is least distasteful."<sup><a
      href="#n38">38-39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Certain secondary sexual characteristics
      (larger size, large antlers, brightly coloured plumage)
      appear to provide a breeding advantage, and, likewise, it can
      be assumed that the primary sexual characteristics of the
      external genitalia must also provide a reproductive advantage
      for each species. Stated another way, the characteristics of
      the male and female external genitalia have evolved over time
      to produce the most effective system of transferring sperm to
      ovum. If Darwin is correct, the external genitalia of each
      species have evolved solely for the purpose of effective
      reproduction. Since primates have been on earth for at least
      65 million years, it can be assumed that the prepuce has been
      present since the earliest primate ancestors. As all male and
      female primates retain a prepuce, it can be safely postulated
      that the prepuce provides a reproductive advantage and is not
      a disadvantageous trait.<sup><a href="#n40">40-41</a></sup>
      As Diamond has pointed out, "anatomical structures and
      instincts that promote survival and reproductive success tend
      to become established (genetically programmed) by natural
      selection."<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The external genitalia of primates are marked
      by an astounding variety of specialised structures, but over
      the past 65 million years, the prepuce has not only withstood
      the test of time, it has also evolved in its complexity. The
      survival and further development of the human penile prepuce
      in the face of the extraordinarily rapid evolution of humans
      over the last 7 to 9 million years is particularly
      noteworthy, especially against the background of a fourfold
      increase in penile size.<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Other than the prepuce, the only other
      structures of the primate external genitalia that are also
      present in all primates are the erectile corpora cavernosum
      of the penile shaft and the clitoris. Since chimpanzees (Pan
      troglodytes) and Bonobos (Pan paniscus) lack a true glans
      penis,<sup><a href="#n44">44-45</a></sup> the corpora
      cavernosa and the prepuce are the only two universally common
      characteristics of the primate penis. Although it is stated
      that the chimpanzee shares 98.4 percent of its genetic
      material (similar DNA) with humans, it is unclear why
      chimpanzees and Bonobos do not retain a bulbous glans penis
      while rhesus monkeys and baboons do have a distinctive glans
      penis. It is likewise unclear why chimpanzees share so much
      common DNA with humans and yet have a single corpus
      cavernosum. In contrast to chimpanzees, humans, rhesus
      monkeys, and baboons have paired corpora cavernosa.</p>

      <p class="text">Of interest, the penis of most primates, with
      the exception of humans, Brachyteles, and Langothrix,
      contains a baculum (os penis). while humans do not have a
      baculum, a rare congenital os penis has been reported in
      human males.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> This is assumed
      to represent atavism, or the appearance of a characteristic
      found in remote ancestors but not in nearer ancestors. Human
      penile calcification can also occur in Peyronie's disease,
      signifying penile pathology occurring at a younger
      age.<sup><a href="#n47">47-48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Other structures found in the primate penis
      include: glans penis spines;<sup><a
      href="#n49">49-50</a></sup> specialised adornments such as
      lappets that surround the urinary meatus;<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup> specialised preputial glands
      (Tamarins); brightly coloured prepuce (Cercopithecus,
      Mandrillus, Papio, and Pongo); horny papillae of chimpanzees
      and baboons; distinctive penile curvatures;<sup><a
      href="#n52">52-53</a></sup> and prominent frenulum. Studies
      suggest that the evolution of these complex penile
      morphologies has been influenced by female choice,<sup><a
      href="#n54">54-56</a></sup> and that the penile morphology
      (especially penile spines) may contribute to improved sperm
      competition.<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The female external genitalia of primates
      also show a wide variety of characteristics, which include:
      tumescent sex skins of the vulva; specific preputial glands;
      well-developed hymen; and a penis-like clitoral urethra
      (Lemur).<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> The female external
      genitalia are important for visual communication in
      chimpanzees, and the maximal sex skin swelling occurs at the
      most fertile, periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.
      Dixson believes the female sex skin swellings are responsible
      for the prominent, elongated, filiform penis of the
      chimpanzee, which is required to reach the vagina.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> Common features of the female
      primate external genitalia include the corpora cavernosum of
      the clitoris, the prepuce, and the labial structures. The
      labia and frenulum are not always well developed in all
      female primates.</p>

      <p class="text">The divergent sensory innervation of the
      prepuce and glans penis between humans and other primates has
      not been previously reported, but further studies may be able
      to correlate the difference in sensory innervation of the
      penis and prepuce with sexual behaviour. The concentration of
      corpuscular receptors in the prepuce/glans clitoridis
      interface also needs to be correlated with sexual behaviour.
      <span class="yellow">The male and female prepuce has
      persisted in all primates, which strongly supports the
      contention that the prepuce is valuable genital sensory
      tissue.</span></p>

      <h3>4. EVOLUTION AND THE HUMAN PREPUCE</h3>

      <p class="text">Remondino (1846-1926), an early crusader for
      universal male circumcision, considered the prepuce an outlaw
      that required "summary surgical execution" by
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> Because of
      man's "gradual evolution to a higher sphere," Remondino
      believed that clothes by the "invention of the manufacture of
      the perineal band [loincloth], which not only protected the
      glans in its thorny passage through life, but acted like a
      protective aegis to the scrotum and its contents," made "the
      prepuce superfluous."<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup>
      Remondino states, "The first innovation in civilization
      [clothing] was to the prepuce the beginning of its decay and
      fall."<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The belief that the prepuce was an unnatural,
      vestigial appendage, and that man had evolved beyond the
      prepuce has been and remains a common argument that
      proponents of universal circumcision, such as Edgar I
      Schoen,<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> have used in an
      attempt to justify mass circumcision. Remondino and Schoen's
      theory of evolution suggests that the invention of clothes
      makes the prepuce no longer necessary.</p>

      <p class="text">In a similar view, Talbot believed that the
      acquired characteristics of the circum cised penis could be
      passed on to progeny.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup> His
      belief in the Lamarkian theory of evolution suggested an
      explanation for the rare occurrence of a congenitally
      incomplete foreskin in newborn Jews by the "transfer of
      circumcision effects" to male Jewish offspring. In fact,
      Talbot was most likely describing hypospadias rather than
      true aposthia. Hypospadias may occur with complete prepuce
      development,<sup><a href="#n65">65-66</a></sup> but true
      aposthia with normal penile development is very rare. This
      rarity of aposthia further suggests that the prepuce has been
      well conserved by evolution.</p>

      <p class="text">Recently, Cox has postulated that the prepuce
      in humans has been modified through natural selection to form
      an obstacle to early coitus, and, concomitantly, the foreskin
      has developed to facilitate masturbation.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> That is, the foreskin has evolved to
      provide a specific alternative for sexual release via
      masturbation. Unfortunately, Cox's thesis is based on two
      erroneous assumptions, namely that masturbation is more
      common in males with foreskins, and that a foreskin delays
      sexual activity. Recent studies from the University of
      Chicago have shown both of these assumptions to be
      erroneous.<sup><a href="#n68">68-69</a></sup> Although Cox is
      one of the few modern authors to hypothesise about the
      evolution of the male prepuce, no scientific research has
      demonstrated that the male prepuce is a factor in
      masturbation or delayed sexual activity. <span
      class="yellow">Some advocates of mass circumcision have,
      likewise, considered the prepuce to be a "mistake of
      nature,"<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> but this notion has
      no validity because the prepuce is ubiquitous in primates and
      because it provides functional advantages.</span></p>

      <h3>5. CIRCUMCISION OF PRIMATES</h3>

      <p class="text">Male and female circumcision involves the
      removal and disruption of normal anatomical structures that
      are primary areas of sexual sensation.<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> As noted above, however, preliminary
      studies of non-human primates show that the innervation of
      the glans penis and prepuce may be species specific.<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> The protopathic sensibility of the
      human glans penis is unique among primates studied,<sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup> since we have found the glans penis
      to have many corpuscular receptors in other primates such as
      rhesus monkeys, baboons, and chimpanzees. The rhesus monkey
      does not have a ridged band of the prepuce, but does have a
      large number of corpuscular receptors of the glans penis.
      Likewise, the chimpanzee does not have a well developed
      ridged band of the prepuce, but does have a large number of
      corpuscular receptors under the horny papillae (hertine
      spines) of the penis.</p>

      <p class="text">The divergence of the penile/prepuce
      neuroanatomy in these three primates suggests that penile
      evolution was influenced by sexual selection for different
      somatosensory innervation. In the chimpanzee, copulation
      consists of one intromission with an average of nine pelvic
      thrusts, which lasts for a total of 5 to 10 seconds and
      results in ejaculation.<sup><a href="#n74">74-75</a></sup> It
      may be that rapid ejaculation is associated with the dense
      concentration of corpuscular receptors associated with the
      coronal papillae of the chimpanzee glans penis. How the
      sensory innervation of the external genitalia influences the
      copulatory reflexes (including the bulbocavernosal reflex) is
      not well understood.<sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup> Although
      male primates show great divergence of penile morphology and
      innervation, the innervation of the glans clitoridis and
      clitoral prepuce is similar in humans and rhesus monkeys.
      Further studies, to correlate the sexual behaviour of
      primates with the somatosensory innervation of the external
      genitalia, are needed to explain the differences in males and
      the similarities in females. Although, to our knowledge,
      non-human primate studies of circumcision have not been
      reported, we would expect an alteration in sexual behaviour.
      Since this experiment has been done on humans, non-human
      primate studies of circumcision do not seem warranted.</p>

      <h3>6. CONCLUSION</h3>

      <p class="text">It is believed that sexual selection has
      resulted in specialised modifications of the primate
      genitalia in certain species. These include the baculum (os
      penis), os clitoris, preputial glands, penile spines, penile
      horny papillac, periurethral lappetts, paired corpora
      cavernosum, perineal estrus sex skin swellings, ornate glans
      penis, absent glans penis, and a clitoral urethra. The
      prepuce and corpora cavernosum are the two features common to
      all male and female primate external genitalia. This
      observation confirms that, over the last 65 million years,
      the prepuce has offered reproductive advantages. Although
      advocates of mass circumcision hypothesise that the prepuce
      represents a design flaw, it is more likely that sexual
      selection has refined the external genitalia of each primate
      species for reproductive excellence. Removal of the prepuce
      disturbs normal copulatory behaviour in mammals, including
      humans. The neuroanatomy of the penile prepuce and glans form
      a complex sensory platform that is important for normal
      sexual behaviour.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> The
      prepuce/glans clitoridis interface also provides sensory
      information, which appears to be important for a completely
      normal sexual response.</p>

      <p class="text">Obviously, sensory innervation of the
      external genitalia is just one component of a very complex
      neural network that results in normal reproductive behaviour.
      Differences in the genital sensory innervation (such as the
      protopathic innervation of the human glans penis versus the
      dense corpuscular receptors found in the rhesus monkey) may
      help explain sexual behavioural differences between primate
      species that cannot be fully explained by morphology
      alone.<sup><a href="#n78">78-80</a></sup> The reproductive
      advantages provided by the prepuce during the last 65 million
      years should not be taken lightly. <span class="yellow">The
      results of this study demonstrate that the human prepuce is
      not "vestigial" but is, in fact, an evolutionary advancement
      over the prepuce of other primates. This is most clearly seen
      in the evolutionary increase in corpuscular innervation of
      the human prepuce and the concomitant decrease in corpuscular
      receptors of the human glans relative to the innervation of
      the prepuce and glans of lower primates.</span></p>
