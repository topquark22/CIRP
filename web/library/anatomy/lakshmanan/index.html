      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

      <p>The prepuce, a cowl like fold of the skin, covering the
      glans penis, has received scant attention from the anatomists
      or surgeons. Most of the male infants (96%) are born with a
      non-retractile prepuce but it becomes retractile
      subsequently, in most of the children, by the age of three,
      unless prevented by epithelial debris. (<a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner, 1949</a>). In
      spite of the remarkable changes to which the glans penis is
      subjected to regarding its size and shape, and the prepuce
      being retracted frequently as the result of erection or
      manually, the prepuce covers the glans completely and snugly
      like a hosiered material and continues to do so through the
      entire span of life of the male. The glans is bared of the
      prepuce spontaneously in erection and the latter is held
      obliquely against the engorged corona glandis, with the
      frenulum acting as a hitch or a check rein. This structure
      has been ritually sacrificed by some communities while the
      ancient ROMANS went to the extent of infibulation - locking
      or muzzling of the prepuce (Rogers, 1973). The surgeons have
      diametrically opposite views about its conservation.
      Carcinoma is known to be completely prevented by an early
      circumcision but in view of its other advantages, its
      conservation by a plastic procedure has been recommended by
      others (Zaveleta, 1966; <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/parkash3/">Parkash,
      1972</a>; Emmett, 1975). <span class="CIRPnote">[CIRP Note:
      <a href="/library/disease/cancer/">Penile carcinoma</a> in
      circumcised men has been reported by several researchers. The
      risk factors for penile carcinoma are now known to be the
      presence of the HPV virus, and tobacco use.]</span> The
      secretory function associated with this structure is a myth.
      <a href="/library/anatomy/parkash/">(Parkash et al, 1973)</a>
      The morphometric study of tissue components has been reported
      by Elias and Pauly (1966) and this knowledge has not been
      fully utilised in histo-pathological studies.</p>

      <p>The present study was undertaken to find an explanation as
      to what makes the prepuce fit the glans so closely and the
      qualitative and quantitative changes in its structure in
      relation to age.</p>

      <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>

      <p>Postmortem specimens of normal prepuce collected from five
      neonates, five children under seven years of age and five
      adults were studied. Each piece was cut into smaller pieces
      of less than one square centimeter in size and not less than
      five random pieces per specimen from the adults and all the
      pieces from the younger subjects were processed and sectioned
      in different planes (Fig. 1). The sections were studied after
      staining with Haematoxylin and Eosin, Van-Geison's trichrome,
      Orcein, P.A.S. and Toludine Blue. By point count method,
      using an eyepiece line grid, following the morphometric
      principles (Elias &amp; Pauly, 1966) the volumes of outer
      epidermis, inner epidermis, free muscle fibres, elastic
      fibres and blood vessels were computed and the observations
      were analysed statistically.</p>

      <h3>OBSERVATIONS</h3>

      <p><span class="yellow">Free bundles of smooth muscle fibres
      arranged in a whorled pattern were observed in all the
      specimens</span> (Figs. 2 &amp; 3). Statistically significant
      increased volumes of smooth muscle fibres in the younger
      group and elastic fibres in the older group were noted (Fig.
      5 and Table 1). The volume of outer epidermis was less in all
      the groups and this difference was significantly more in the
      adult specimens (Figs. 4 &amp; 5). No secretory tissue or
      glands were found in any specimen. The epidermis of the
      prepuce beyond the glans was of the same thickness on both
      aspects.</p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p>The presence of smooth muscle fibres in the prepuce has
      been reported in most of the text books of histology. <span
      class="yellow">However the mosaic pattern of arrangement of
      this tissue, its abundance in the younger individuals and an
      increase in the elastic fibres in adults appears to be a
      significant observation.</span> The normal tone of the muscle
      arranged in this fashion and supplemented by elastic tissue
      offers a legitimate explanation for the close fit of the
      prepuce through the ages. The inner lining of the prepuce is
      thicker and firmer, which again is in accordance with its
      function, since <span class="yellow">it impinges against the
      corona, during erection and coitus</span>. <span
      class="yellow">The outer layer of the prepuce in common with
      the skin of the shaft of the penis glides freely in a to and
      fro fashion</span> and has to be delicate and thin, as was
      observed in this study. The tight frenulum helps to retain
      the obliquely placed loop of retracted prepuce in position.
      The inner lining of the projecting tubular part has the
      structure of the outer layer and adds to the thin gliding
      skin when retracted.</p>

      <p>The skin and muscular tissue are held together elsewhere
      also but the skin is tethered to the underlying fascia which
      encloses the deeper tissue. This is not likely to be
      applicable here since the fold is free from the underlying
      glans and the requirement of retraction is very peculiar to
      this part.</p>

      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

      <p>A study was made to explain the interesting feature of the
      prepuce snugly covering the glans through all the ages of
      man, although apparently, it looks just like a double fold of
      the skin, projecting a little beyond the glans as a fluted
      and corrugated tube. <span class="yellow">This can be
      explained by the presence of a mosaic of muscle tissue and
      the elastic fibres contained between the two layers.</span>
      The epidermis of the inner layer till the level of the apex
      of the glans is thicker while that of the tubular part beyond
      it as well as the outer layer is remarkably thin and delicate
      like the skin on the rest of the penis.</p>
