      <h2>I. DEPTH, DISTRIBUTION AND PROBABLE IDENTIFICATION IN THE
      PREPUCE OF SENSORY END-ORGANS CONCERNED IN SENSATIONS OF

      <p>In a recent paper (Bazett, McGlone and Brocklehurst[<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]), data were reported of the temperature
      changes that accompany temperature sensations, and it was
      pointed out that inferences as to the mode of stimulation
      were unwarranted until the end-organs were more surely
      identified. and their depth established. In that work the
      skin of the forearm was employed; in the present work the
      prepuce has been selected, since histologic study of fresh
      tissue removed at circumcision is possible. The prepuce has
      the additional advantage that a fold of two layers of skin
      may be obtained which is less than 2 mm. thick. Consequently,
      the rate of penetration of heat may be measured and yet the
      abnormalities introduced by buried thermocouples may be
      avoided. It is proposed in this paper to present physiologic
      evidence with a brief account an anatomic data. A more
      detailed account of the anatomic structures demonstrable in
      the prepuce will be presented in a later paper.</p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP note: This paper has a long technical
      discussion of a histologic study, a physiologic study, and
      followed by comments. There are tables, graphs and
      mathematical sections that cannot be satisfactorily
      transcribed in a text file. For both technical reasons and
      perceived lack of general interest, CIRP will not present
      these parts and will only transcribe the conclusions.</p>

      <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

      <p>1. A brief preliminary description is given of the various
      sensory organs demonstrable in the prepuce and of their
      distribution.</p>

      <p>2. The spots sensitive to cold in the prepuce and dorsal
      skin of the penis vary in number from six to twelve per
      square centimeter. Estimates of their depth from the reaction
      time and from the rate of thermal transmission suggest a
      depth of about 0.1 mm. If a thin double fold of skin is
      obtained, sensitive spots belonging to one layer of skin may
      be stimulated from either side of the double fold.</p>

      <p>3. Histologic studies demonstrate that end-bulbs of the
      Krause type are distributed in the prepuce, so that their
      average number is about 15 per square centimeter, and they
      have a depth of about 0.1 mm. Many of these occur in groups
      so that several might be identified as a single cold spot.
      They lie in the arteriovenous region immediately below the
      papillae of the corium. Their distribution agrees with that
      of the cold spots.</p>

      <p>4. Spots sensitive to warmth in the prepuce and dorsal
      skin of the penis are few in number (one or rather less per
      square centimeter). They may be stimulated from either side
      of a thin double fold of skin. Their depth may be calculated
      by comparing the reaction times from the two sides with the
      rates of thermal transmission, and a depth of 0.3 mm. is thus
      determined. In a few instances the results appear to indicate
      a greater depth, in the subdermal tissue at about the center
      of the fold. These sensory spots are commonly definitely
      related to visible veins, and a spread of thermal changes
      along the veins is apt to give mild and somewhat diffuse
      sensations of warmth.</p>

      <p>5. Histologic studies demonstrate that Ruffini end-organs
      have a distribution agreeing fairly well with that of the
      warm spots. They have a depth of about 0.28 mm. or more and
      lie in between the second and third venous plexuses of
      Spaetholtz. Some also occur subdermally,</p>

      <p>6. In any square centimeter ruled in square millimeters,
      sixty-two of the squares gave negative responses to touch
      stimuli when a stimulus slightly above the threshold value
      was employed. The threshold stimulus has been from 1.5 to 2.
      Gm. per millimeter radius of the hair employed (0.12 mm.
      diameter).</p>

      <p>7. Non encapsulated end-bulbs have been identified
      histologically are are distributed fairly evenly (fifty-two
      per square centimeter) at a depth of about from 0.03 to 0.04
      mm. In a square centimeter the number of square millimeters
      deficient in this kind of end-bulb agreed well with the
      average number of squares found to be deficient in touch
      sensation in the physiologic experiments.</p>

      <p>8. Some values are given illustrating the character and
      degree of thermal transmission across a double fold of skin
      in this area.</p>
