      <h2>THE CUTANEOUS INNERVATION OF HUMAN NEWBORN PREPUCE*</h2>

      <h3>R. K. Winkelmann, M. D.<sup>+</sup></h3>
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>The study of cutaneous innervation has passed through
      several phases. The earliest period was marked by the
      description of numerous discrete structures, together with
      detailed and elaborate representations of these bodies. Great
      stress was placed on the ways in which these endings were to
      be distinguished from one another. The second period began
      with the more or less unitarian idea of Stohr (1927) that the
      salient feature of these sensory endings was not their
      conformation, but rather the surface enlargement of nervous
      tissue which they provided. He believed that all afferent
      endings were expressions of a basic idea of stimulus
      reception, and that the various forms served as examples of
      specific structural development in the broad range of simple
      to more complex endings. His thoughts were well supported for
      transition forms between all separate bodies had been
      described from the time of Wilhelm Krause. The most recent
      era began with the introduction of the methylene blue method
      in the study of cutaneous innervation by Woollard, and the
      use of it in such a manner by him, and by Weddell that photo
      micrographs might be taken. They were able to correlate
      physiologic findings with histologic work as a routine
      experience The intravital methylene blue method has its
      limitations, and recently by means of new silver impregnation
      methods Weddell and his group (Weddell and Zander 1950;
      Sinclair et al, 1952; Hagen et al, 1953) and the author
      (Winkelmann, 1955 a and b) have been able to confirm and
      extend the findings in various cutaneous areas and to
      delineate the sensory bodies that are present.</p>

      <p>The prepuce was chosen for this work because of its
      natural advantages. It is free from hair at its distal end,
      it is frequently available, and <span class="yellow">it is a
      region of great sensitivity and possessed of an abundant
      nerve supply.</span> It is on the basis of studies of prepuce
      that much of the present correlation between specific sensory
      structure and specific function rests (Rothman, 1954).</p>

      <p>The data available on the innervation of the prepuce is
      limited. While many articles have been written on the other
      regions of the external genitalia little has been said about
      this structure. Kantner (1953) reviewed the literature on
      genital innervation, and it is quite apparent from his
      discussion and the original papers that there continues to be
      much confusion about the sensory innervation of the area. The
      general review articles which covered the early descriptive
      work and from which the major portion of textbook discussions
      are taken say little about the genital area and nothing about
      prepuce specifically (Dogiel, 1903; Ruffini, 1905; Botezat,
      1912; Stohr, 1927; Pincus, 1927; and Boeke, 1932). Ohmori
      (1924) stated that all that is true for the glans penis is
      true for the prepuce. Under such circumstances the work of
      Krause and his pupils on the genital body and the outer
      genitalia (Krause, 1866; Bense, 1866; Finger, 1868) and all
      succeeding work could be taken as a basis for discussion of
      the present findings.</p>

      <p>Probably the first reference to innervation of the prepuce
      is the notation by Bichat (1801) of the division of the
      genital nerves into finer branches which lose themselves
      eventually in the glans penis and the prepuce. Until the
      description of the genital body and endbulbs in the genital
      region by Krause and his school, little was added to the
      knowledge of the area. Krause distinguished the genital
      bodies from endbulbs by their larger size and by the presence
      of constrictions on their surface; these bodies were similar
      in location, nerve supply and form, and basic construction.
      It is interesting that such definitive work could have been
      done with only dilute alkali or acetic acid solutions
      together with the occasional use of Berlin blue.</p>

      <p>In 1893 Dogiel published his work on the outer genitalia
      of man with methylene blue technic. He found in the inner
      surface of the prepuce and the frenulum preputii, Meissner
      corpuscles, genital bodies, and endbulbs. <span
      class="yellow">The Meissner corpuscles were more common on
      the external skin surface.</span> All of the statements he
      made for the prepuce of man were also true for the prepuce of
      white mouse, rat, and albino rabbit. In the following year
      Sclavunos (1894) published work on this region with the Golgi
      method, and he makes no mention of any special endings other
      than the subepithelial plexuses. He does state that there are
      peculiar star-shaped cells with branches which penetrate the
      epidermis in close relation to the nerves of the superficial
      plexus.</p>

      <p>The work of Ohmori (1924) has been the most comprehensive
      to date, but as in all other cases the data on the prepuce is
      incidental to information on the rest of the region. He used
      human material from the 80 mm. embryo through various ages up
      to 77 years old. In every instance he used only one example
      of the tissue of each age group. He made use of methylene
      blue methods and the silver methods of Cajal and
      Bielschowsky. In an 11.5 cm. embryo he found the earliest
      appearance of intraepithelial and intercellular nerve fibres.
      One month after birth he saw Folgi-Mazzoni bodies. In this
      same specimen he saw little bodies on the outer surface which
      he did not describe but called Meissner corpuscles. He
      described Pacinian corpuscles which were present by the fifth
      month, and at ten months he saw what he termed true Meissner
      corpuscles in the outer skin and nerve balls (Nervenknauel)
      in the inner surface. In a 5 year old boy he found a typical
      genital body, and then in a 14 year old boy he found several
      typical genital bodies. No diminution occurred with advanced
      age. It was his conclusion that the chief development of
      genital bodies is accomplished in postfetal life. He believed
      the glans penis and prepuce has the same type innervation
      because they differentiated from the same mass of cells and
      had basically the same, rich innervation. He mentions finding
      no Krause endbulbs, and he omits reference to
      melanocytes.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/bazett/">Bazett</a>
      and his coworkers (1932) did an interesting piece of work on
      the sensation of the prepuce and endeavoured to correlate
      their physiologic findings with anatomical structures. They
      used the methylene blue technic of Woollard on whole mounts
      of skin with subcutaneous tissue cut away. <span
      class="yellow">On the basis of their preparations they stated
      that 7 types of endings existed in the skin of the human
      prepuce.</span> No statement of age of the specimens was
      made, but one may assume on the basis of their physiologic
      studies that it was adult tissue. The camera lucida drawings
      they produced and the descriptions they gave do not
      correspond to classical descriptions of sensory bodies as
      will be discussed later. They were not able to state with
      certainty whether intraepithelial endings existed, but they
      thought on the basis of their depth measurements that they
      did not exist. In the later communication (1935) these
      authors stress small nonencapsulated endings as possible
      receptors for touch, on the basis of their appearance.</p>

      <p>In an article by F. John (1950) an illustration shows a
      neurovegetative fibrillar network with neurohormonal cells in
      the prepuce. No further elaboration of this data with
      reference to this region has been found.</p>

      <p>It is evident therefore that many diverse judgments have
      been made about this region, and no photomicrographs have
      been published to support the data obtained. Ohmori states
      that there are no Krause endbulbs present; Dogiel and Bazett
      have found them. Ohmori and Dogiel have found genital bodies;
      they are not mentioned by Bazett. Meissner corpuscles have
      been found by Dogiel, Ohmori, and Bazett, but the several
      descriptions do not agree. Ohmori and Dogiel stated that
      intraepithelial endings existed; Bazett believed they were
      not present. Melanocytes were not mentioned by any of these
      authors. The questions these descrepancies raise will be
      discussed in relation to the present findings.</p>

      <h4 align="center">METHODS</h4>

      <p>The specimens of normal human, newborn prepuce were slit
      open, spread flat on cardboard squares, and dropped into 10
      per cent formalin or Bouin's fluid immediately after
      circumcision. From such specimens, sections tangential and
      vertical to the skin surface were cut at thicknesses ranging
      from 10 to 100 mu. Several specimens were left intact, and
      frontal sections were cut from these, allowing observation of
      the whole external surface of the prepuce at that level. Over
      30 specimens were left intact, and frontal sections were cut
      from these, allowing observation of the whole external
      surface of the prepuce at that level. Over 30 specimens were
      sectioned and examined.</p>

      <p>The frozen section method (Winkelmann, 1955a) and the
      paraffin section method of Bodian (1948) were used
      concurrently in order to compare and confirm the results. The
      average thickness of the frozen sections was 50 mu, while no
      sections thicker than 20 mu were made for the Bodian method.
      The temperatures of impregnation and reduction were
      controlled in both silver impregnation methods. All paraffin
      section were serial sections.</p>

      <p>Several specimens were stained with the Masson trichrome
      method, the iron alum hematoxylin method, and the Verhoeff
      elastic stain.</p>

      <h4 align="center">OBSERVATIONS</h4>

      <p><i>Nerve networks</i></p>

      <p>In the subcutaneous tissue the major nerve trunks show a
      great preponderance of myelinated nerve components. There is
      no tendency for the nerve at this level to form a network.
      They lie in parallel, wavy courses as may be seen in figure
      1. In the center of this figure is a collateral fibre running
      from one trunk to another. These connecting fibres occur
      occasionally. The only other type of innervation at this
      level is the meshwork of fine fibres which surrounds the
      large vessels. This in in the form of a large network about
      the advential, and shows dividing and ramifying fibres from
      many directions in the tissue forming a net at the vessel. No
      specific endings are present. This network about the vessels
      is present in the lower left hand corner of figure 2.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Nerve fibres of the dermis are
      arranged into a deeper and a more superficial network. These
      networks constitute the chief form of innervation of human
      prepuce of this age. The deeper net is oriented with the rete
      of arterioles in the reticular layer and may be considered
      limited to this portion of the dermis. It blends
      indistinguishably into the more superficial network of nerve
      fibres which is found in the papillary layer of the dermis.
      The superficial net extends to a subepidermal position and
      may lie immediately adjacent to the epidermal cells in its
      final ramifications. The nerves of the superficial network
      may enter the papillae along the dermal-epidermal junction or
      with the blood vessels.</span> The deeper network has the
      highest portion of myelinated fibres, in comparison with the
      superficial network. If one begins deep within the dermis, it
      is possible to observe the diminution in the size of the
      myelin sheath and its disappearance as the nerve fibres rise
      in the thick frozen sections. To the left in figure 3 is the
      wide-spaced meshwork characteristic of the deeper layers, and
      in the right portion the fine network with smaller meshes and
      nonmyelinated fibres is visible. Nerves come from several
      quadrants to run in the same sheath making up the sides of
      these nerve nets as in figure 4. Both myelinated and
      nonmyelinated fibres participate in the formation of the
      networks. Any single area is thus supplied from several
      directions and by several main nerve trunks.</p>

      <p>Changes occur in these networks which may be evidence of
      degeneration. The myelin sheath disappears abruptly to
      reappear after a distance. Rough varicosities are present. A
      more usual observation is the gradual diminution of the
      myelin sheath not associated with a change in the level of
      the nerve fibre. It is probable that these changes represent
      the degeneration which Weddell and Glees found (1941) found
      in nerve fibres of normal skin as a natural occurrence.</p>

      <p>In thick sections of the skin it is possible to trace the
      nerve fibres from deep in the dermis to their ramifications
      over the rete ridges of the epidermis. The gradual change in
      diameter of the nerve fibre as it approaches the epidermis
      may be observed, as well as the ramification of the fibre
      over the portion of the rete ridge which meets the dermis.
      The nerve fibres rise to the dermal-epidermal junction from
      many sources. They appear to mingle at this level and can be
      traced no further.</p>

      <p>The most superficial nerve nets contain only
      non-myelinated fibres, which show irregular, varicose,
      enlargements termed</p>

      mu frozen section shows nerve trunks deep in the subcutaneous
      tissue. Collaterals join two trunks in the center of this
      photomicrograph.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 2 X 180. The nerve
      trunks in this area of a frozen section are at a more
      superficial higher level than those in Figure 1. In the lower
      left, net formation is beginning near a large vessel
      wall.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 3 X 160. This
      frozen section shows both types of network formation in the
      dermis. The deeper network with wide spaced meshes and
      myelinated and non-myelinated innervation is to the left, and
      to the right is the beginning of the more superficial network
      with small meshes and nonmyelinated nerve fibers.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 4 X 300. An area
      of the deeper network in Figure 3 is shown. It shows both
      myelinated and nonmyelinated nerve fibers running in the same
      sheath in the sides of the nerve rete. The innervation of any
      large area comes from several sources and several
      directions.</p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p>beading. These fibres form irregular networks which follow
      the dermal-epidermal junction as far as it has been possible
      to trace them. There has been no definite observation which
      would support the idea of the anastomosis of these fibres
      into a peripheral continuum as Ruffini (1905) and Woollard
      (1936b) suggested. The fibres in these final terminal
      networks may be only one or two epidermal cell diameters
      apart.</p>

      <p><i>Intraepidermal fibrils.</i> No intraepidermal fibrils
      could be observed in thick or this sections cut in either the
      vertical or horizontal plain and stained with either of the
      two silver methods employed. In no instance have neurofibrils
      been present in the same plane of focus as epidural cells.
      Fine fibres course over the basal cells in close relationship
      to them as in Figure 5. They never pass into the cells of the
      epidermis or between them. Many times the appearance of nerve
      fibres within the epidermis has been due to the way in which
      the section was cut and by the way in which the papillae turn
      or change the direction of their extension. In such cases, it
      has always been possible to show by serial section or thick
      section that the nerve continues on in the papilla, and that
      the papilla does change form. In figure 6 the confusion
      between melanocytes and fine nerve fibres is clearly pointed
      out. There is no question in this preparation as to the
      dermal continuity of the nerve, and just as clearly the
      dendrites rise vertically into the epidermis from the exact
      point where the nerve reaches the dermal-epidermal junction.
      In figure 7 the course of such a nerve following the rete
      ridge is shown.</p>

      <p><i>Papillary nerve.</i> In the papillae a variety of
      nonencapsulated endings ranging from simple loops to complex
      forms with multiple innervation was observed. In almost all
      instances evidence of the nerve leaving as well as entering
      the papillae could be found either in thick frozen section or
      in serial section. No sign of structural components of a
      cellular type was found. Beading of the finer fibres occurs
      as well as rough varicosities in the more complex endings.
      The simple endings consist only of nonmyelinated nerve fibres
      while the more complex forms possess myelinated as well as
      nonmyelinated nerve supply. In all the endings the nerve
      fibres which compose them are twisted and interlaced with one
      another, and occasionally</p>

      seen from below in a transverse cut of the tissue. The
      beaded, non-myelinated nerve fibres forming the network are
      clear and run over the epidermal
      cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 6 X 1012. In
      this 50 mu frozen section a nerve fibre (N) winds up to the
      rete ridge. One can see that it bifurcates at the epidermis.
      Its further course is not clear. At that point where the
      nerve becomes lost to view, the dendrites (D) of the
      melanocytes begin and extend into the epidermis. Their thick
      knob-shaped endings and general appearance are distinct from
      that of nerve structure in this region.<br />

      <p>produce multiple fine divisions which appear at times to
      show anastomoses. These papillary endings are the only form
      of organized ending visible in the papillae of the human
      prepuce at this age. They are not infrequent, but they do not
      occur with such frequency as to lead one to suppose that they
      would have a specific function. The range from simple loops
      to more complex endings is shown in figures 8, 9, and 10.
      None of the classical bodies of the dermis were observed;
      that is the Meissner corpuscle, the Krause endbulb, the
      Dogiel body, the Golgi-Mazzoni body, and the genital
      corpuscle. While one would not expect the Ruffini body in the
      papillae, no evidence of its existence or the existence of
      the Golgi-Mazzoni body was found in deeper layers of the
      dermis and subcutaneous tissue where these bodies have been
      described.</p>

      <p><i>Vater-Pacinian corpuscle.</i> The only classical ending
      recognized in the prepuce of the human newborn was the
      lamellated corpuscle described by Vater and by Pacini. These
      bodies were frequent in the deeper layers of the skin. Their
      presence in the deeper layers of the skin. Their presence in
      the deep layers was associated with the large vessels, and
      the bodies appeared to be in close relationship with them.
      The body in figure 11, for example, lies in the curve of the
      large adjacent vessels. In frontal sections of prepuce left
      intact after circumcision, it was always possible to find
      these bodies somewhere in the circumference of the
      specimen.</p>

      <p>The remarkable thing about these bodies is their form. In
      all cases they had an arciform to coiled appearance, although
      at times they ended in a single long arm. Figure 11 shows a
      sagittal section through such a Vater-Pacinian corpuscle. At
      the right is the small convoluted stalk which leads after a
      winding course into the main section of the body. Figure 12
      shows a section cut across the stalk of such a body with the
      Verhoeff technique. This shows the cut edges of the tortuous
      path of entrance of the nerve in the lower left and in the
      background the lamellar appearance of the normal Pacinian
      corpuscle cross section into which the stalk finally leads.
      The appearance of the cut edges in the inner bulb of the
      stalk is like the cross</p>

      The nerve enters at the lower left and follows a twisted path
      until it enters the main portion of the body. The tortuous
      pathway has been cut across many times, as is shown by the
      staining of the inner bulb in the form of circles. In the
      background are the lamellae of the main portion of the
      body.<br />

      <p>section of myelinated nerves because of light elastic
      staining of the inner bulb fibres. No specific elastic
      structures were found in these bodies. Figure 13 shows a
      cross section of a Vater-Pacinian body where several right
      angle turns occur. By the use of serial sections it has been
      possible to construct wax models of these corpuscles; and two
      representative bodies are shown in figure 14 and in figure
      15. Special connective tissue stains did not produce new data
      about the composition of the capsule.</p>

      <p>The inner nerve fibre was observed in several bodies to be
      constituted of a number of fibrils all running closely
      parallel in the inner bulb. Generally, however in the silver
      preparations only on solid fibre could be seen. It is notable
      that no accessory nerve fibres of any type were seen. No
      terminal enlargements or expansions of the classical
      descriptions have been noted, but then the form of the bodies
      described here is quite distinct from the classical,
      ellipsoid form.</p>

      <h4 align="center">DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p>The system of nerve networks in the skin has been well
      described by various authors (Dogiel, 1903; Ruffini, 1905;
      Woollard, 1935; Woollard et al., 1940 Weddell, 1941). There
      is no need to elaborate on the descriptions they have given.
      Demonstration by photomicrograph of these structures in
      sections prepared by silver impregnation methods is what has
      been added here. Our work confirms in every respect the
      beautiful preparations from methylene blue of Woollard,
      Weddell and their co-workers.</p>

      <p>It is obvious that there is overlap in the area supplied
      by separate nerve fibres. The fact that fibres appear to
      retain their separate identity at lower levels of the nerve
      networks is conducive, but not convincing, evidence that this
      condition is maintained superficially. The final rete of
      beaded nerve fibres appears to have connections is so many
      directions it is hard to state anything about it with surety.
      It was not easy to find the "free" nerve endings of which
      others speak.</p>

      <p>That epithelial nerve endings are present in the prepuce
      from the state of the 11.5 cm embryo onward was stated by
      Ohmori. We have not found intra-epidermal endings in
      specimens prepared by two selective silver methods. It is
      possible to show nerve fibres of very fine diameter
      immediately below the epidermis. Bazett et al (1932) did not
      find epithelial endings in their methlylene blue
      preparations. Woollard (1936a) concluded from his study that
      in man such endings are rare. Weddell (1941) and his
      coworkers have stated that such endings exist and pass at
      times even to the granular layer, but more recently have
      stated that nerves pass only in close relation to the
      epidermis. (Hagen et al., 1953). It does not seem probable
      that intraepithelial fibres exist on the basis of the present
      evidence.</p>

      <p>The present photomicrographs allow one to think that the
      melanocytes most probably have been confused with nerve
      terminals. Both Ohmori and Dogiel who described thick and
      knob-ended intraepithelial nerve fibrils fail to mention the
      melanocyte. Besides melanocytes, there are other substances
      as reticulum and elastic fibres which will impregnate
      selectively with silver treatment. It would be quite easy to
      confuse structures in this region of one does not use a
      staining method which is selective enough to allow definitive
      observation and photography.</p>

      <p>The papillary nerve which has been described is similar to
      that pointed out by Ruffini as "Fiochetti Papillare" or
      literally papillary floccules (Ruffini, 1905). Dogiel (1903)
      also described such entities. In the literature are many
      references to similar end organs which have been termed small
      Meissner corpuscles and small Krause endbulbs. Actually there
      is no truly distinguishing feature. This ending resembles the
      nonencapulated body described by Bazett et al (1935) as
      serving the function of touch in the prepuce. The simple
      term, papillary nerve, is a descriptive and accurate one
      which hoes not indicate physiologic specificity, and it has
      therefore been used here. Weddell and his coworkers (1953)
      have said it is a gradation of these bodies from simple to
      more complex, and this work agrees with their
      description.</p>

      <p>No classical nerve endings were observed in the papillary
      layer of the skin of this region. The specimens may be too
      young for Meissner corpuscles to be present inasmuch as
      Ohmori did not find them as typical Meissner corpuscles until
      the age of 10 months. However, he saw, but did not describe,
      small bodies he termed Meissner corpuscles. one month after
      birth. In his five months' specimen he does not mention the
      bodies at all, this one may believe the time is not well
      fixed for the development of these bodies. According to
      Krause (1860) new touch corpuscles do not develop after
      birth. He found them first in a seven month fetus. Ranvier,
      however, was of the opinion that they develop chiefly after
      birth and are well developed by the sixth month (Ranvier,
      1880). Dogiel saw typical Meissner corpuscles in adult human
      prepuce with his methylene blue preparations.</p>

      <p>The figure presented by <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/bazett/">Bazett
      <i>et al</i></a> (1932) as a Meissner corpuscle is surely not
      a typical example of such a body. Also they found these
      bodies 200 mu below the skin surface, below all the other
      endings they described. No Meissner corpuscle of typical
      structure has ever been described out of close relation to a
      papilla. One is constrained to view the body described by
      Bazett el al as probably not a Meissner corpuscle. It fits
      more closely the appearance and location of the genital body
      which had been described in adult prepuce by both Ohmori and
      Dogiel.</p>

      <p>The genital body was lacking in our preparations. This may
      well be caused by our limiting the work to one very young age
      group. That the methods are adequate is evidenced by the
      illustration of such a body in human adult clitoris.
      (Winkelmann, 1954b) which is comparable to that figured by
      Ohmori in his article. No trouble should arise in identifying
      the genital body since it is unlike any other nerve structure
      observed to date. It is hoped that further information will
      be gained from adult tissue.</p>

      <p>Ohmori found no Krause endbulbs in any of his specimens,
      while both Dogiel and Bazett stated that they had seen them.
      The drawings and descriptions are vague in both the latter
      instances to allow us to believe that no specific evidence,
      including our own data, exists for the presence of these
      bodies in this area. The Krause endbulb in man may have no
      distinctive morphology. Workers have great trouble
      distinguishing this body. It has been described as resembling
      papillary nerve, the Meissner corpuscle, the genital
      corpuscle and finally because of the picture in other
      mammals, it has been confused with the Golgi-Mazzoni body and
      the Vater-Pacini corpuscle. Weddell recently doubted his
      early demonstration of this endorgan (Hagen et al.,
      1952).</p>

      <p>The form of the Vater-Pacini corpuscle in this tissue was
      observed with great interest. The morphology did not agree
      with the description in any current texts, and only on
      extensive search of the literature was it found that a varied
      external form had been recognized, chiefly by Krause (1860),
      but also by Sala (1899) and Dogiel (1903). The type 5 body of
      Bazett et al (1932) resembles this structure. No emphasis has
      been placed upon the arched external form of the Vater-Pacini
      corpuscle, and it was observed with surprise that this was
      the chief form of the body in the prepuce of this age. It is
      apparent in our material that all the bodies present have
      coiled or serpentine form that is best explained by continued
      growth in a limited space. The coils occur in relation to
      large vessels. Such a form lends itself admirably to the
      perception of changes in pressure and tension in the tissue,
      as the coils are oriented in three dimensions. In 110 mm. and
      140 mm. human embryos it has been possible to see similar
      coiled bodies in the fingertip. A study of wax
      reconstructions of the bodies of the fingertip of man has
      been made to show the morphologic variation of the body
      (Winkelmann and Osment, 1955).</p>

      <p>In Ohmori's work are presented several bodies which are
      labeled Golgi-Mazzoni bodies. These are identical with figure
      15 which shows a section of the coiled stalk through which
      the nerve passes to reach the main portion of the
      Vater-Pacinian body. Lack of emphasis on the stalk of the
      Vater-Pacinian body have been described, and the present
      study seems to indicate that these structures as well as the
      Golgi-Mazzoni bodies of Ohmori are Vater-Pacinian bodies
      alone. This raises the question as to whether the
      Golgi-Mazzoni body exists outside of the tendon, the site of
      its original description. No Golgi-Mazzoni bodies which
      accord with the original description were found in the
      newborn prepuce.</p>

      <p>The results of this work show that in the newborn prepuce
      there exist three types of endings: the nerve nets, the
      papillary nerve, and the Vater-Pacinian body. The nerve nets
      and the papillary nerve contain the same components, and they
      differ only in the location in which they have developed. The
      nerve nets develop unhindered in the dermis, while the
      papillary nerve developed in a confined space which forced
      the elements into a close association. The prepuce is chiefly
      a glabrous region, and only in the glabrous region have
      special papillary structures been described. This indicates
      that the nerves, which elsewhere would surround hair
      follicles, developed close to the surface epithelium to form
      the structures found in the lip, palm, finger, and genital
      skin and prepuce.</p>

      <p>Our findings correspond with those of Weddell and his
      group, if we consider our papillary nerves as a form of
      "organized" ending. They found only two types of endings in
      hairy skin; free nerve nets, and endings about hair
      follicles; and only two types of glabrous skin: free nerve
      nets and "organized" endings. They do not mention the
      Vater-Pacinian body in their work. They stated that the
      "organized" endings possessed a non-specificity of structure
      similar to that ascribed here to the papillary nerve. On the
      basis of the present and prior work, it seems advisable to
      broaden the term "organized" endings to include the Meissner
      corpuscles, the genital body and the Vater-Pacinian
      corpuscle. All of these have a specific structure that must
      be considered in an analysis of the sensory endings.</p>

      <p>In physiologic studies based upon the morphology of the
      innervations described in the work of Weddell and his
      colleagues a peculiar lack of correlation between structure
      and function was shown. On the basis of this work, they felt
      the theory of Von Frey, that specific function was served by
      specific structure, needed to be reevaluated. The questions
      raised about the morphologic work on the prepuce indicates
      that the work of Bazett and his group on the prepuce should
      also be confirmed.</p>

      <p>Since only one young age group has been studied, there is
      much to be done to elaborate further the morphology of the
      sensory innervation of the prepuce. Earlier age groups should
      be studied to watch the development of the papillary nerve
      from the dermis. It is necessary that a study of pubescent
      and adult tissues be done to confirm Ohmori's group of
      isolated findings about these age groups and the development
      of organized endings. The afferent nerve supply of this area
      must be known before physiology can be correlated with the
      nerve anatomy of this region.</p>

      <h4 align="center">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h4>

      <p>1. <span class="yellow">The principal form of innervation
      of human newborn prepuce consists of a deep and superficial
      network of nerve fibres in the dermis.</span><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Nonencapulated
      papillary endings were observed ranging from simple loops to
      more complex endings, but differing in no essential
      constituent from the networks of the dermis.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Dendrites of
      melanocytes were observed but no intraepithelial nerve
      terminals were noted.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Except for the
      Vater-Pacinian corpuscle, none of the classical sensory
      corpuscles were seen in this tissue. No Meissner corpuscles,
      Golgi-Mazzoni bodies, genital bodies, Krause end bulbs, or
      Ruffini bodies were observed, and these findings have been
      discussed in the light of the conflicting literature on the
      subject.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The chief form of
      the Vater-Pacinian corpuscle in this tissue is coiled and
      differs markedly from the usual textbook description of this
      body. The stalk of this corpuscle has not been sufficiently
      emphasized and has been confused with the Golgi-Mazzoni
      body.<br />
