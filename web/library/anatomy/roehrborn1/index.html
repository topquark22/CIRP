      <h2>Changes in amount and intracellular distribution of
      androgen receptor in human foreskin as a function of
      age.</h2>

      <p><b>Roehrborn CG, Lange JL, George FW, Wilson JD</b></p>

      <p>To provide insight into the factors that control growth of
      the penis we measured the amount and intracellular
      distribution of specific high affinity androgen receptor in
      foreskins obtained at circumcision from 49 males varying in
      age from newborn to 59 yr. Total (cytosolic plus nuclear
      extract) androgen receptor decreased from approximately 40
      fmol/g tissue weight in newborn foreskins to approximately 25
      fmol/g by 1 yr of age. The amount of receptor rose in
      childhood to approximately 180 fmol/g in the late teenage
      years and fell thereafter to approximately 20-40 fmol/g in
      men older than 40 yr. The amount of receptor in the nuclear
      fraction increased at the time of puberty and subsequently
      decreased in parallel with the decline in total receptor
      level. These changes in androgen-receptor amount are similar
      when expressed per milligram DNA or per milligram
      protein.</p>
