      <h2>The effect of male circumcision on the sexual enjoyment
      of the female partner</h2>
      <b>K. O'HARA and J. O'HARA</b><br />
       
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p class="cirp">CIRP note: The authors of this article have
      written a book entitled <a href="/pages/reviews/ohara/">Sex
      As Nature Intended It</a>. The book has a website at <a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/">www.sexasnatureintendedit.com</a>.</p>

      <p><font size="+1"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

      <p><a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Male circumcision, the
      most commonly performed surgery in the USA, removes 33 - 50%
      of the penile skin, as well as nearly all of the penile fine
      touch neuroreceptors</a> [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. To date no
      study has investigated whether this dramatic alteration in
      the male genitalia affects the sexual pleasure experienced by
      the female partner or whether a woman can physically discern
      the difference between a penis with a foreskin. The impact
      that male circumcision has on the overall sexual experience
      for either partner is unknown.</p>

      <p class="text2">Just as female circumcision was advocated in
      some Muslim and African countries to control women's
      sexuality, so too was male circumcision introduced into
      English-speaking countries in the late 1800s as a method of
      treating and preventing masturbation [<a href="#n2">2</a>].
      While there has been debate over whether circumcision affects
      the sexual sensations of the penis, there have been few
      relevant studies. <a
      href="/library/complications/money/">Four men circumcised in
      adulthood reported decreased sensitivity</a> [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>]. Writing under a pseudonym, a physician
      circumcised as an adult argued that the loss of sensitivity
      he experienced was favourable, as it gave him more control
      over his orgasms [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. Another man
      circumcised as an adult lamented that the decrease in
      sensation could be equated with seeing in monochrome rather
      than in colour.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a href="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann
      <i>et al</i></a>. [<a href="#n5">5</a>] found that
      circumcised men had different sexual practices from genitally
      altered men. Circumcised men were more likely to masturbate,
      to engage in heterosexual anal and oral sex, and to engage in
      homosexual anal sex. In the male rat, removal of the penile
      sheath markedly interferes with normal penile reflexes and
      copulation. When circumcised rats were paired with sexually
      experienced females, they had more difficulty obtaining an
      erection, more difficulty inserting the penis into the
      vagina, and required more mounts to inseminate than did
      unaltered males [<a href="#n6">6</a>]. Preputial secretions
      in mice and rats are a strong attractant for female mice and
      rats [<a href="#n7">7-11</a>], and may provoke the onset of
      oestrus in mature females [<a href="#n12">12</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">There may be a histological explanation for
      these findings. The tip of the foreskin, and some or all of
      the frenulum, are routinely removed as part of circumcision.
      This tissue contains a high concentration of the nerve
      endings that sense fine touch [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. After
      circumcision, the surface of the glans thickens like a
      callus. The glans is innervated by free nerve endings that
      can only sense deep pressure and pain. [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>]. Over 30 years ago, Masters and Johnson,
      using undocumented methodology, tested the sensitivity of the
      glans in men with and without foreskins and found no
      difference [<a href="#n14">14</a>]. The absence of fine-touch
      receptors in the glans could explain their findings, as
      Masters and Johnson may have been measuring the wrong
      variable. Without knowing what was measured or how, these
      results constitute little more than anecdotal evidence. A
      study from Iowa in the late 1980s [<a href="#n15">15</a>]
      found that young mothers (who had recently given birth to
      sons) preferred intercourse with a circumcised man; however,
      the importance of this study is compromised, as only 16.5% of
      the women surveyed had sexual experience with both
      circumcised and intact men. The study results may reflect the
      tendency of people to choose the familiar and shun the
      unfamiliar. In a survey conducted on the Internet,
      circumcised men were significantly more likely to use
      additional artificial lubricants during sexual activity (odds
      ratio, OR = 5.64, 95% CI = 3.65 - 8.71) [<a
      href="#n16">16</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The 12th century physician and rabbi <a
      href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">Moses Maimonides</a>
      advocated male circumcision for its ability to curb a man's
      sexual appetite [<a href="#n17">17</a>]. Further, he implied
      that it could also affect a woman's sexuality, indicating
      that once a woman had taken a lover who was not circumcised,
      it was very hard for her to give him up. The impact of male
      circumcision on the sexual pleasure experienced by both males
      and females is largely unstudied. While the brain is often
      cited as the primary 'sexual' organ, what impact does
      surgical alteration of the male genitalia have for both
      partners? Based on anecdotal reports, a survey was developed
      to determine the effect of male circumcision on a woman's
      ability to achieve vaginal orgasm (both single and multiple),
      to maintain adequate vaginal secretions, to develop vaginal
      discomfort, to enjoy coitus and to develop an intimate
      relationship with her partner. This review presents the
      findings of a survey of women who have had sexual partners
      both with and without foreskins, and reports their
      experiences.</p>

      <p><font size="+1"><b>Methods</b></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Women having sexual experience with both
      circumcised and anatomically complete partners were recruited
      through classified advertisements in magazines and an
      announcement in an anti-circumcision newletter. Respondents
      to the advertisements were mailed a survey to complete and
      return, the comments then compiled and the responses analysed
      statistically. The survey is continuing and this article
      reports the preliminary results.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of the 284 surveys, 139 were completed and
      returned; no attempts were made to characterize the
      demographic details of those who did not respond. The women
      completing the surveys were aware that their responses and
      comments could later be published anonymously in a
      forthcoming book. The survey included 40 questions; the
      results were analysed for age, number of lifetime partners,
      preputial status of the most recent partner, preference for
      vaginal orgasms (as defined below) and their preference for a
      circumcised or intact penis. Multiple choice answers were
      assigned numeric values, i.e. 'increased', 'stayed about the
      same' and 'lessened' of 1,0, and -1 respectively. Likewise,
      questions with answers of 'mostly yes', 'mostly no', 'rarely'
      and 'never' were assigned values of 3, 2, 1 and 0.</p>

      <p class="text2">The survey defined 'vaginal orgasm' as 'an
      orgasm that occurs during intercourse, brought about by your
      partner's penis and pelvic movements and body contact, along
      with your own body's pelvic movements, with no simultaneous
      stimulation of the clitoris by the hands'. Premature
      ejaculation was defined as the man 'usually (50 -100% of the
      time) has had his orgasm within 2 -3 minutes after
      insertion'. The survey included three sets of responses for
      the respondents to rate their sexual experiences with their
      circumcised and unaltered male partners; the questions and
      possible responses are listed in Appendix 1. Comparisons
      between responses are expressed as the OR and 95% CI.</p>

      <p><font size="+1"><b>Results</b></font></p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: The results of this survey are
      somewhat obscurely stated. This survey surveyed 138 women. Of
      that group 20 (14.5%) preferred non-intact circumcised sexual
      partners while 118 or (85.5%) preferred intact
      non-circumcised sexual partners. This means that about 6 out
      of 7 women preferred intact non-circumcised partners while
      about 1 out of seven preferred non-intact circumcised
      partners.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of the 139 surveys returned, one considered
      a man who was undergoing foreskin restoration as having a
      foreskin; this survey was excluded from analysis. Not all
      questions were answered by all respondents. Contradictory
      answers showed that not all respondents understood the
      questions; the responses and unanswered questions were
      excluded from the analysis. The demographic profile of the
      respondents is shown in Table 1.</p>

      <p class="text2">Comparisons of experiences with circumcised
      or intact males are shown in tables 2 and 3. With their
      circumcised partners, women were more likely not to have a
      vaginal orgasm (4.62, 3.69-5.80). Conversely, women were more
      likely to have a vaginal orgasm with an unaltered partner.
      Their circumcised partners were more likely to have premature
      ejaculation (1.82, 1.45-2.27). Women were also more likely to
      state that they had had vaginal discomfort with a circumcised
      partner either often (19.89, 5.98-66.22) or occasionally
      (7.00, 3.83-12.79) as opposed to rarely or never. More women
      reported that they never achieved orgasm with circumcised
      partners (2.25, 1.13-4.50) than with their unaltered
      partners. Also, they were more likely to report never having
      had a multiple orgasm with their circumcised partners (2.25,
      1.13-4.50). They were also more likely to report never having
      had a multiple orgasm with their circumcised partners (2.22,
      1.36-3.63). They were also more likely to report that vaginal
      secretions lessened as coitus progressed with their
      circumcised partners (16.75, 6.88-40.77).</p>

      <p class="text2">During prolonged intercourse with their
      circumcised partners, women were less likely to 'really get
      into it' and more likely to 'want to get it over with'
      (23.32, 11.24-48.39). On the other hand, with their unaltered
      partners, the reverse was true, they were less likely to
      'want to get it over with' and considerably more likely to
      'really get into it.'</p>

      <p class="text2">When the women were divided into those older
      or younger than 40 years, the older women were more likely to
      rate their frequency of orgasm as higher with an unaltered
      partner (Z=2.04, <i>P</i>=0.02). Women 29 years or younger
      were more likely to prefer orally induced orgasms (2.61,
      1.14-5.97), while women over 40 years preferred vaginally
      induced orgasms more than those aged <u>&lt;</u>29 years
      (3.00, 1.16-7.32). The older women also had more lifetime
      unaltered partners (Z=2.95, <i>P</i>=0.002). This may have
      reflected the decreased availability of unaltered men of
      similar age for the younger women.</p>

      <p class="text2">When the women were divided into those with
      more or fewer than 10 lifetime partners, those with &gt;10
      were more likely to have orgasms with their circumcised
      partners than those with fewer partners, but still less
      frequent orgasms than they had with their unaltered partners.
      Women who preferred a circumcised partner overall were more
      likely to have had <u>&lt;</u>10 partners (3.52,
      0.92-13.50).</p>

      <p class="text2">When women who preferred vaginal orgasm were
      compared with those preferring orally or manually induced
      orgasm, the former rated unaltered men higher (Z=2.12,
      <i>P</i>=0.016), had more positive post-coital feelings (Set
      3; Z=2.68, <i>P</i>=0.003) with their unaltered partners, and
      rated these men higher overall (Z=2.12, P=0.016). These women
      were more likely to prefer being on top during coitus to
      achieve vaginal orgasm (2.46, 1.21-4.98). They were also more
      likely to have an unaltered man as their most recent partner
      (1.74, 0.87-3.47).</p>

      <p class="text2">The women who preferred circumcised partners
      (as elicited in one of three questions, n=20) were more
      likely to have had their first orgasm with a circumcised
      partner (8.38, 2.88-24.35) than those who preferred unaltered
      partners. Although these women preferred circumcised
      partners, they still found unaltered partners to evoke more
      vaginal fluid production, a lower vaginal discomfort rating
      and fewer complaints (Sets 1 and 2, Table 3) during
      intercourse than their circumcised partners. In women who
      preferred circumcised men, there was no difference in their
      comparison of circumcised and unaltered men other than
      overall rating and a higher rate of premature ejaculation in
      their unaltered partners (4.63, 2.36-9.07) These women had
      fewered unaltered partners (2.47 vs. 3.78, Z=-1.68,
      <i>P</i>=0.045), which suggests that their limited exposure
      to unaltered men may have been a consequence of 'premature
      ejaculation'. The inability to detect a difference in orgasm
      frequency, coital duration, coital complaints or
      satisfaction, and 'yet to formulate a preference', suggests
      that factors of conformity may be influential.</p>

      <p class="text2">When women were grouped based on the
      preputial status of their most recent partner, women with
      unaltered partners had a higher rate of orgasms with them, at
      a mean (SEM) of 70 (31%)vs 56 (40%) (Z=2.28, P=0.01). They
      were more likely to rate circumcised partners lower (Z=-2.61,
      <i>P</i>0.0047) and unaltered partners higher (Z=2.83,
      <i>P</i>=0.002). When only women whose most recent partner
      was circumcised, the results were consistent with the results
      from the entire study population.</p>

      <p><font size="+1"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

      <p class="text2">These results show clearly that women
      preferred vaginal intercourse with an anatomically complete
      penis over that with a circumcised penis; there may be many
      reasons for this. When the anatomically complete penis
      thrusts in the vagina, it does not slide, but rather glides
      on its own 'bedding' of movable skin, in much the same way
      that a turtle's neck glides in and out of the folder layers
      of skin surrounding it. The underlying corpus cavernosa and
      corpus spongiosum slide within the penile skin, while the
      skin juxtaposed agaist the vaginal wall moves very little.
      This sheath-within-a-sheath alignment allows penile movement,
      and vaginal and penile stimulation, with minimal friction or
      loss of secretions. When the penile shaft is withdrawn
      slightly from the vagina, the foreskin bunches up behind the
      corona in a manner that allows the tip of the foreskin which
      contains the highest density of fine-touch neuroreceptors in
      the penis [<a href="#n1">1</a>] to contact the corona of the
      glans which has the highest concentration of fine-touch
      receptors on the glans [<a href="#n18">18</a>]. This intense
      stimulation discourages the penile shaft from further
      withdrawal, explaining the short thrusting style that women
      noted in their unaltered partners. This juxtapostion of
      sensitive neuroreceptors is also seen in the clitoris and
      clitoral hood of the Rhesus monkey [<a href="#n19">19</a>]
      and in the human clitoris [<a href="#n18">18</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">As stated, circumcision removes 33-50% of
      the penile skin. With this skin missing, there is less tissue
      for the swollen corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum to
      slide against. Instead the skin of the circumcised penis rubs
      against the vaginal wall, increasing friction, abrasion and
      the need for artificial lubrication. Because of the tight
      penile skin, the corona of the glans, which is configured as
      a one-way valve pulls the vaginal secretions from the vagina
      when the shaft is withdrawn. Unlike the anatomically complete
      penis, there is no sensory input to limit withdrawal. Because
      the vast majority of the fine-touch receptors are missing
      from the circumcised penis, their role as ejaculatory
      triggers is also absent. <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/letters.html#vanhowe">The loss
      of these receptors creates an imbalance between the deep
      pressure sensed in the glans, corpus cavernosa and corpus
      spongiosum and the missing fine touch</a> [<a
      href="#n20">20</a>]. To compensate for the imbalance, to
      achieve orgasm, the circumcised man must stimulate the glans,
      corpus cavernosa, and corpus spongiosum by thrusting deeply
      in and out of the vagina. As a result, coitus with a
      circumcised partner reduces the amount of vaginal secretions
      in the vagina, and decreases continual stimulation of the
      mons pubis and clitoris.</p>

      <p class="text2">Respondents overwhelmingly concurred that
      the mechanics of coitus was different for the two groups of
      men. Of the women, 73% reported that circumcised men tend to
      thrust harder and deeper, using elongated strokes, while
      unaltered men by comparison tended to thrust more gently, to
      have shorter thrusts, and tended to be in contact with the
      mons pubis and clitoris more, according to 71% of the
      respondents.</p>

      <p class="text2">The responses in Sets 1, 2 and 3 (Table 3)
      are more a measure of intimacy than physical differences in
      thrusting patterns. While some of the respondents commented
      that they thought the differences were in the men, not the
      type of penis, the consistency with which women felt more
      intimate with their unaltered partners is striking. Some
      respondents reported that the foreskin improved their sexual
      satisfaction, which improved the quality of the relationship.
      In addition to the observations of Maimonides in the 12th
      century, one survey found that marital longevity was
      increased when the male had a foreskin [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>]. Why the presence of the foreskin
      enhances intimacy needs further exploration.</p>

      <p class="text2">When this information is compared with that
      collected by Laumann <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n22">22</a>] in
      the same period the women in the present survey had more
      lifetime partners (a median of 2 and 10 respectively). When
      the women with one partner in the former study were excluded
      (because having sexual experience with both a circumcised
      partner and an unaltered partner necessitates at least two
      partners), the women in the present survey were more likely
      to have had &gt;4 partners (7.26, 4.46-11.83), &gt;10
      partners (5.83, 4.02-8.48), and &gt;20 partners (4.16,
      2.48-6.98). The high incidence of lifetime partners is a
      consequence of the inclusion criteria for the present study.
      If a woman were to randomly find partners among American
      sexually active males, 70-90% of whom are circumcised, 3-7
      partners would be needed for a woman to have an even chance
      of having had both a circumcised and unaltered male partner.
      However, women do not procure their sexual partners randomly.
      Most sexual partners are found within a fairly close social
      network [<a href="#n22">22</a>]. Likewise, circumcision does
      not occur randomly; within some of these networks,
      circumcision rates can approach 100%. For a woman to have a
      sexual partner with an anatomically complete penis involves
      having partners outside her immediate social network, which
      is uncommon. For these reasons, a median number of partners
      of 10 is not unexpected.</p>

      <p class="text2">While this study shows clearly that women
      prefer the surgically unaltered penis, it does have
      shortcomings. The respondents were not selected randomly and
      several were recruited using a newsletter of an
      anti-circumcision organization. However, when the responses
      from respondents gathered from the mailing list of the
      anti-circumcision organization were compared with those of
      the other respondents, there were no differences. This
      selection bias may be compensated to the degree that each
      respondent acted as her own control, using her subjective
      criteria on both types of penises. The findings cannot be
      completely attributed to selection bias.</p>

      <p class="text2">In asking women to evaluate their experience
      based on all of their lifetime sexual partners, there may be
      an element of recall bias, but the circumcision status of the
      most current sexual partner did not alter the findings.
      Because the surveys were not completed 'face-to-face', not
      all questions were completed by all respondents. There were
      also several other questions that were misunderstood by the
      respondents, but these were only a very small proportion of
      the respondents. Women who preferred vaginal orgasms had a
      strong preference for unaltered partners. Women who preferred
      circumcised partners were half as likely to prefer vaginal
      orgasms, but there were too few women preferring circumcised
      partners to make any valid statistical claims. This would
      suggest that the foreskin makes the most positive impact
      during vaginal intercourse.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another weakness of the survey is its
      preoccupation with vaginal intercourse. Several respondents
      commented that the foreskin also makes a difference in
      foreplay and fellatio. Although this was not directly
      measured, some respondents commented that unaltered men
      appeared to enjoy coitus more than their circumcised
      couterparts. The lower rates of fellatio, masturbation and
      anal sex among unaltered men [<a href="#n5">5</a>] suggests
      that unaltered men may find coitus more satisfying [<a
      href="#n20">20</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Clearly, the anatomically complete penis
      offers a more rewarding experience for the female partner
      during coitus. While this study has some obvious
      methodological flaws, all the differences cannot be
      attributed to them. It is important that these findings be
      confirmed by a prospective study of a randomly selected
      population of women with experience with both types of men.
      It would be useful to examine the role of the foreskin in
      other sexual activities. Because these findings are of
      interest, the negative effect of circumcision on the sexual
      enjoyment of the female partner needs to be part of any
      discussions providing 'informed consent' before
      circumcision.</p>
