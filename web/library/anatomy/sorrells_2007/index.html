      <p class="bjuheading1">OBJECTIVE</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">To map the fine-touch pressure thresholds
      of the adult penis in circumcised and uncircumcised men, and
      to compare the two populations.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Adult male volunteers with no history of
      penile pathology or diabetes were evaluated with a
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament touch-test to map the
      fine-touch pressure thresholds of the penis. Circumcised and
      uncircumcised men were compared using mixed models for
      repeated data, controlling for age, type of underwear worn,
      time since last ejaculation, ethnicity, country of birth, and
      level of education.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">RESULTS</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The glans of the uncircumcised men had
      significantly lower mean ( SEM ) pressure thresholds than
      that of the circumcised men, at 0.161 (0.078) g ( <i>P</i> =
      0.040) when controlled for age, location of measurement, type
      of underwear worn, and ethnicity. There were significant
      differences in pressure thresholds by location on the penis (
      <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The most sensitive location on the
      circumcised penis was the circumcision scar on the ventral
      surface. Five locations on the uncircumcised penis that are
      routinely removed at circumcision had lower pressure
      thresholds than the ventral scar of the circumcised
      penis.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">CONCLUSIONS</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The glans of the circumcised penis is
      less sensitive to fine touch than the glans of the
      uncircumcised penis. The transitional region from the
      external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region
      of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most
      sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision
      ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis.</p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: This paper, which was published on
      Monday, March 19, 2007, is likely to be a landmark in the
      understanding of penile innervation and penile sensitivity.
      This file is incomplete at this time. Two graphic
      illustrations, three tables, and one graph will be added in
      the near future to complete the file. The abstract, text, and
      references are complete.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">INTRODUCTION</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Infant male circumcision, the most common
      medical procedure in the USA, might also be the most
      divisive. The long-term health impact of neonatal
      circumcision has received little study, while the
      consequences of circumcision on sexual function in the adult
      male have received even less attention.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">A poorly documented study by Masters and
      Johnson, briefly mentioned only in their book [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>] and never subjected to peer-review, claimed
      to find no difference in the finetouch perception of the
      glans of circumcised and uncircumcised men. Several studies
      assessed the impact of circumcision on sexual function in
      adult men [<a href="#n2">2&ndash;6</a>]. These studies had
      few subjects, a relatively short follow-up and a reliance on
      subjective self-reporting obtained from men with a history of
      penile and sexual dysfunction. Notable in these studies is
      the high percentage (27.3% [<a href="#n4">4</a>] to 64.2% [<a
      href="#n6">6</a>]) of subjects who were circumcised to
      correct a penile problem, and who reported no improvement
      after surgery, a decrease in penile sensitivity, or a
      reduction in erectile function.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Bleustein <i>et al.</i> [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>], in a comparison study of men with and with
      no erectile dysfunction (ED), using quantitative
      somatosensory testing that included vibration, pressure,
      spatial perception, and warm and cold thermal thresholds,
      found that uncircumcised men had worse vibratory sensation
      and better fine-touch sensation. These differences
      disappeared when controlled for age, hypertension and
      diabetes.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Whether the penis is circumcised or not
      might also affect coitus. For women, having a male partner
      with a foreskin increased the duration and comfort of coitus
      and increased the likelihood of achieving single and multiple
      orgasms [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. A recent multinational
      population survey using stopwatch assessment of the
      intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) found that
      Turkish men, the vast majority of whom are circumcised, had
      the shortest IELT. When Turkish men were excluded from the
      analysis, there was no difference between circumcised and
      uncircumcised men [<a href="#n9">9</a>]. Likewise, in a
      London population, men from Islamic countries were more
      likely to have premature ejaculation [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>].</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The type of nerve endings in the penis
      vary with location. The glans penis primarily has free nerve
      endings that can sense deep pressure and pain [<a
      href="#n11">11</a>]. The transitional area from the external
      to the internal surface of the prepuce, or &lsquo;ridged
      band&rsquo;, has a pleated appearance that is continuous with
      the frenulum and has a high density of fine-touch
      neuroreceptors, such as Meissner&rsquo;s corpuscles [<a
      href="#n12">12&ndash;14</a>]. Based on this histology, the
      transitional region and the ventral surface of the prepuce
      would be expected to have lower thresholds for light
      touch.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Controversy over the sensory consequences
      of infant male circumcision on adult sexual function has been
      fuelled by a lack of objective data. By objectively measuring
      penile sensitivity, the present study aimed to map the
      fine-touch pressure thresholds of the penis and quantify the
      differences in penile sensitivity between men with and
      without foreskins.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</p>

      <p>Subjects were recruited by posting &lsquo;fliers&rsquo; at
      the San Francisco Bay Area medical school. Also,
      announcements were made on a medical radio programme, and
      advertisements were placed in local Bay Area general
      circulation newspapers.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Subjects were men aged &gt; 18 years in
      good health, with no genital alterations, except for
      circumcision, as determined by healthscreening questions. A
      short questionnaire was completed to determine ethnicity,
      place of birth, highest education degree obtained, type of
      underwear worn, timing of last ejaculation, referral source,
      and health status. Circumcision status was determined by a
      physical examination.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Exclusion criteria were: transsexuals;
      intersex individuals; males born with abnormal genitals, e.g.
      hypospadias; a history of diseases or conditions known to
      affect sexual sensitivity and function, e.g. diabetes
      mellitus; a history of genital, prostate, or urinary tract
      disease of any kind, including but not limited to sexually
      transmitted diseases, open sores, or lesions at the time of
      screening; prostatitis; prostate cancer; BPH; spinal cord
      injury; peripheral nerve injury; peripheral neuropathy;
      sciatica; any penile piercing; penile enlargement surgery;
      any form of psychiatric condition; or a history of alcohol or
      substance abuse. Informed consent was obtained before
      testing.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The fine-touch sensitivity of 19
      locations on the penis was measured using Semmes- Weinstein
      monofilament touch-test sensory evaluators (North Coast
      Medical Supply, Morgan Hill, CA, USA) [<a
      href="#n15">15&ndash;17</a>] to create a penile sensitivity
      map (Figs 1 and 2) On the dorsum of the penis, these
      locations were: (1) the shaft proximal to coronal ridge; (2)
      the outer prepuce; (3) the rim of the preputial orifice; (4)
      the muco-cutaneous junction; (5) the ridged band; (6) the
      preputial mucosa; (7) the coronal sulcus; (8) the coronal
      ridge; (9) the middle of dorsal aspect of the glans; (10) the
      glans at the meatus; on the ventral surface of the penis, the
      locations were (11) the coronal ridge; (12) the frenulum at
      the urethral slit; (13) the frenulum near the ridged band;
      (14) the frenulum at the mucocutaneous junction; (15) the rim
      of the preputial orifice; (16) the outer prepuce; (17) the
      shaft proximal to the coronal ridge; and locations pertaining
      to circumcised men only (18) the circumcision scar on the
      dorsal surface and (19) the circumcision scar on the ventral
      surface. Locations 2&ndash;5 and 13&ndash;16 were measured
      only in uncircumcised men because these locations are ablated
      by circumcision.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Because of the method of data collection,
      it was impossible for the physician measuring the fine-touch
      thresholds to be unaware of the circumcision status of the
      subject. Likewise, because of the number of locations
      sampled, it was also impossible for the statistician to be
      unaware of the circumcision status of the subject.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Based on unpublished pilot data, it was
      determined that sampling 50 uncircumcised and 150 circumcised
      men would have 80% power to show a difference of 0.046 g with
      a type I error of 5%. Demographic information by circumcision
      status were compared using Mantel-Haenszel, Fisher&rsquo;s
      exact, chi-square and <i>t</i> -tests. Fine-touch pressure
      thresholds by location were compared using <i>t</i> -tests
      and linear regression. Mixed models for repeated data on
      single subjects stratified by location of measurement, which
      control for withinsubject variability, were developed using
      locations present in both the circumcised and the complete
      penis. Models were assessed using forward, backwards and
      stepwise selection. Similar models were developed using only
      locations on the glans penis. This study protocol was
      approved by the Western Institutional Review Board.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">RESULTS</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In all, 163 subjects were enrolled; one
      uncircumcised man was excluded for diabetes, two
      uncircumcised men and one circumcised man were excluded for
      hypospadias. All of the men completed the testing once it
      started. A comparison of the demographic information by
      circumcision status is shown in Table 1. Men born outside the
      USA were eight times more likely to be uncircumcised.</p>

      <p>Fine-touch pressure thresholds for each of the penile
      positions is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. The region most
      sensitive to fine touch on the circumcised penis was the
      circumcision scar. The ventral scar was more sensitive than
      the dorsal scar ( <i>t</i> -test and signtest <i>P</i> &lt;
      0.001). In all but one position, finetouch pressure
      thresholds were greater in the circumcised penis. The most
      sensitive regions in the uncircumcised penis are those
      removed by circumcision. There was no interaction between age
      and circumcision status.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">When compared with the most sensitive
      area of the circumcised penis, several locations on the
      uncircumcised penis, which are missing from the circumcised
      penis, were significantly more sensitive (Table 2).</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">There was no association between
      fine-touch pressure threshold and the ambient room
      temperature at the time of the examination, the time since
      the reported last ejaculation ( <i>P</i> = 0.659), or the
      country of birth.</p>

      <p>Using a mixed model to evaluate repeated measures,
      location of the measurement, age, wearing briefs, level of
      education, being Hispanic, and circumcision status were all
      statistically significant in the multivariate models (Table
      3), e.g. with each year of age, the fine-touch pressure
      threshold increased by 0.011 or 0.013 g.</p>

      <p class="bjuheading1">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The glans in the circumcised male is less
      sensitive to fine-touch pressure than the glans of the
      uncircumcised male. The most sensitive location on the
      circumcised penis is the circumcision scar on the ventral
      surface. Five locations on the uncircumcised penis that are
      routinely removed at circumcision were more sensitive than
      the most sensitive location on the circumcised penis.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Despite the controversy over the
      long-term impact of male circumcision, no thorough,
      objective, quantitative studies measuring the long-term
      sensory consequences of infant circumcision have hitherto
      been reported. The present study provides the first extensive
      mapping of the fine-touch pressure thresholds of the adult
      penis. This information provides a baseline for future
      comparison studies and provides investigators with the
      testing locations that provide the most differentiation.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments are
      individually calibrated to deliver a targeted force within a
      5% SD. They have been used to test female genital sensitivity
      [<a href="#n17">17</a>] and can be used to determine changes
      in sensitivity over time.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">It is difficult to compare our data and
      results with those claimed by Masters and Johnson [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]; no method is documented, only their
      assertion of no difference in fine-touch reception on the
      glans. Nevertheless, their results, even if they were
      verifiable, are of little value to the question of the
      long-term sensory consequences of infant circumcision. First,
      the glans has virtually no fine-touch neuroreceptors [<a
      href="#n11">11&ndash;14</a>]. Second, when determining the
      aggregate sensory impact of circumcision, the sensory effects
      of circumcision on the glans are of secondary significance,
      because the glans is not removed during circumcision. Instead
      of measuring changes in the glans after circumcision, it is
      more important to measure the sensory investment of the parts
      of the penis removed by circumcision.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In a subjective study with only a 44%
      response rate, Fink <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n2">2</a>]
      questioned men, using an unvalidated survey tool that they
      hoped would measure sexual function. Compared to before
      circumcision, men reported reduced erectile function (
      <i>P</i> = 0.01), decreased penile sensitivity ( <i>P</i> =
      0.08), no changes in sexual activity, and improved
      satisfaction after circumcision. The circumcisions were for
      &lsquo;medical reasons&rsquo; in 88%. For a procedure that
      was expected to correct their problem, entirely favourable
      outcomes would be expected, but 38% reported a perceived
      problem or difficulty as a result of the procedure.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Collins <i>et al.</i> [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>] studied 15 men who were circumcised as
      adults; all but one had a penile problem. The patients
      completed the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory, an
      unvalidated measure of sexual function, before and at least
      12 weeks after the procedure. Not surprisingly, this
      underpowered study failed to find any differences in sex
      drive, erection, ejaculation, problem assessment, or overall
      satisfaction. This is an intriguing finding because the men
      were circumcised expecting an improvement in sexual function
      and satisfaction.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In a study designed to measure the impact
      of anterior urethroplasty on erectile function, Coursey <i>et
      al.</i> [<a href="#n4">4</a>] included a control group of men
      who were circumcised for &lsquo;phimosis or other benign
      indication&rsquo;. Of the 48 men circumcised, only 22 (46%)
      completed the survey. Using an internally validated survey,
      27% reported worsening satisfaction with their erectile
      function after a procedure.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In a Turkish population of 42 men in
      their third decade undergoing circumcision, 39 of whom sought
      circumcision for religious reasons, the Brief Male Sexual
      Function Inventory, measured before and at least 12 weeks
      after the procedure, showed no difference in any of the five
      areas assessed by the instrument. However, the mean IELT was
      significantly longer after circumcision (<i>P</i>=0.02) [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. As noted earlier, Turkish men had the
      shortest mean IELT of the countries assessed [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>].</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In a study of 95 men undergoing
      circumcision in China, erectile function was measured before
      and after surgery. Eighteen patients reported mild erectile
      dysfunction before circumcision, while 28 reported from mild
      to moderate erectile dysfunction after circumcision (<i>P</i>
      = 0.001). Also reported were increased problems with weakened
      erectile confidence (<i>P</i> = 0.04), difficult insertion
      during coitus ( <i>P</i> = 0.03), prolonged intercourse in 31
      cases ( <i>P</i> = 0.04), and improved satisfaction in only
      34 patients (<i>P</i>=0.04) [<a href="#n6">6</a>].</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In a study of 125 men drawn from a
      urology clinic, Bleustein <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n7">7</a>]
      found that uncircumcised men, both with and with no erectile
      dysfunction, had lower thresholds for pressure using the same
      device as used in the present study. The differences they
      found were no longer statistically significant when adjusted
      for age, diabetes, and hypertension. Their age difference (7
      years) was greater than in the present population. Their
      population consisted of patients referred to a urologist; the
      present subjects were drawn from the general population, and
      diabetics were excluded. We did not enquire about
      hypertension nor measure blood pressure. Bleustein <i>et
      al.</i> only sampled two locations, the meatus and the dorsal
      glans halfway between the meatus and the corona, in
      circumcised men, with an additional sample in uncircumcised
      men at the &lsquo;dorsal midline foreskin&rsquo; with the
      prepuce in its natural position over the glans. In
      uncircumcised men, there were no significant differences
      between the measurements taken at the glans with the foreskin
      retracted and those taken at the level of the glans with the
      foreskin in its normal position. The positions used in that
      study correlate to positions 9, 10 and 16 in the present
      study. In our mixed model, controlling for location of the
      measurement, age, wearing briefs, being Hispanic, and
      circumcision status, position 10 had a lower threshold than
      position 9 (0.243 g, SEM 0.079, <i>P</i>&lt;0.002). The
      present data indicated that the location on the uncircumcised
      penis measured by Bleustein <i>et al.</i> had one of the
      highest thresholds of the locations found only on the
      uncircumcised penis. We found that the age-adjusted
      thresholds were significantly lower in location 16 than
      either 9 or 10 (location 9, - 0.75 g, SEM 0.184, <i>P</i>
      &lt; 0.001; location 10, - 0.56 g, 0.17, <i>P</i> &lt;
      0.002).</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The studies detailed above share several
      important flaws: (i) a low response rate to opportunities to
      complete surveys (it is speculative as to how the half who
      did not complete these surveys would have responded); (ii)
      the lack of agreed upon, externally validated instruments to
      measure erectile function; (iii) small population sizes that
      limit the study power; (iv) the subjective nature of
      instruments used; (v) short followup times; and (vi) the
      patients in the studies were not genitally healthy.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The last three items deserve special
      comment. Self-reporting is notoriously unreliable, and all
      but one of the reported studies relied on patient testimony
      rather than objective measurements. Patients are highly
      susceptible to suggestions or inferences that surgery or
      treatments used to correct a problem will, in fact, correct
      that problem. Also, otherwise healthy men who seek
      circumcision for other than medical reasons are predisposed
      to reporting a favourable outcome. Furthermore, surveys with
      subjective measures are dependent on the respondent&rsquo;s
      state of health. When asked to rate quality of life of
      various impaired health states, healthy individuals will rate
      the quality lower than will a person in that particular
      health state. In these studies, it would be expected that the
      men rate their genital performance higher when in the
      genitally impaired condition than if they were not genitally
      impaired.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The short follow-up might have precluded
      changes in genital response and sensitivity that take longer
      to develop. Likewise, the acute changes from surgery and scar
      remodelling are known to take up to 12 months to resolve [<a
      href="#n18">18</a>]. Finally, except for the Turkish study,
      the men in these studies had penile pathology. Consequently,
      improvements in this population would be expected regardless
      of the intervention, due to what is commonly referred to as
      the &lsquo;floor effect&rsquo; (more room for improvement
      than deterioration). Consequently, the worsening in so many
      subjects is remarkable. It could be concluded that
      circumcision might be an invalid intervention for these
      medical conditions.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The present subjects, while drawn from
      the general population, were men who showed the initiative to
      participate. This might introduce a population and selection
      bias, but the objective nature of the measure should not have
      been affected. In the USA, uncircumcised men are
      demographically different from circumcised men. They tend to
      be younger and from certain ethnic backgrounds. They might
      also be from families with either higher or lower parental
      education levels, depending on the decade of their birth [<a
      href="#n19">19,20</a>]. Younger men might have been less
      willing to participate in the study due to their increased
      modesty. As there are many more circumcised than
      uncircumcised men in the USA, recruiting equal numbers of
      subjects from each group was challenging. The measurement of
      fine touch using pressure thresholds might be limited. Fine
      touch transmitted through Meissner&rsquo;s corpuscles might
      be dynamic, using a network of nerve endings. For example,
      the fingertips, which have a high density of Meissner&rsquo;s
      corpuscles, are able to interpret Braille when moving
      <i>over</i> raised dots, not merely by pressing <i>on</i>
      them. Consequently, a static measurement of pressure
      threshold can miss much of what the Meissner&rsquo;s
      corpuscles are capable of transmitting. An instrument that
      measures the sensitivity to light brushing or that can
      discriminate surface texture when rubbing might be needed to
      measure this dynamic sensation.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">The differences in age, based on
      circumcision status, were expected. In their study, Bleustein
      <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n">7</a>] found that uncircumcised
      men were a mean of 7 years older. Based on the fluctuations
      of circumcision rates over the past century, we expected
      genital integrity to be more prominent among older men and
      among men in their twenties. Because the confidence,
      sufficient to volunteer for mapping of genitalia, might not
      come until the later twenties, this population might have
      been under-represented in our study.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">Additional study with vibratory, hot and
      cold thresholds on a wider variety of positions on the penis
      is needed. Furthermore, development of a reliable method of
      measuring dynamic sensation is needed to identify, elucidate
      and quantify the sensory capacity of the various nerve
      endings in all parts of the penis, and to provide a greater
      understanding of the dynamic sensory interplay between the
      various parts of the uncircumcised penis during sexual
      activity. Finally, prospective real-time stopwatch
      assessments of the IELT at coitus in men, investigated in the
      laboratory by the Semmes- Weinstein touch test, would provide
      additional objective information of their sexual and
      particularly ejaculatory performance. Long-term monitoring of
      numerous factors of sexual pattern, including sexual pattern
      films, would provide additional information. Ideally, such
      investigations could be undertaken on adult subjects before
      and after elective circumcision, and in whom there is no
      preoperative pathology.</p>

      <p class="bjutext1">In conclusion, circumcision removes the
      most sensitive parts of the penis and decreases the
      fine-touch pressure sensitivity of glans penis. The most
      sensitive regions in the uncircumcised penis are those parts
      ablated by circumcision. When compared to the most sensitive
      area of the circumcised penis, several locations on the
      uncircumcised penis (the rim of the preputial orifice, dorsal
      and ventral, the frenulum near the ridged band, and the
      frenulum at the muco-cutaneous junction) that are missing
      from the circumcised penis were significantly more
      sensitive.</p>
