      <b>Back and Forth</b> 

      <p>Dear Dr. Wilkoff:</p>

      <p class="text2">You indicated that family doctors are in a
      dilemma because there are not clear guidelines on the
      benefits and hazards of infant male circumcision ("The
      Foreskin Wars," May 2000, p.27).</p>

      <p class="text2">This is true, if only for the reason that
      existing guidelines are oblivious to the idea that the
      prepuce may be worthy of preservation in itself, irrespective
      of other considerations.</p>

      <p class="text2">My associates and I have made a few
      observations: The true skin surface of the prepuce provides
      the distal half of the penis with its only means of detecting
      light touch, heat, and cold. A distinctive band of mucosa
      lining the tip of the prepuce is deeply ridged, highly
      vascular, and especially rich in Meissner (genital) nerve
      endings (<a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Brit. J. Urol.
      77: 291-95, 1996</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">We have postulated that
      this "ridged band" is designed to respond to movement of
      adjacent mucosa and the skin of the penis.</span> Similar
      nerve ending are found in the glans and it seems likely that
      the sensory and reflex functions of the ridged band are much
      the same as, but spatially distant from, those of the
      glans.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Parents should be left
      in no doubt that circumcision always removes a large sexually
      significant portion of the penis.</span></p>
