      <p class="text2">As is well known, <span class="yellow">the
      prepuce in the human penis is adherent to the glans at
      birth</span>, a layer of stratified squamous epithelium being
      interposed, and shortly after birth these parts become
      separated so that the prepuce may be retracted. Failure of
      the prepuce to separate from the glans spontaneously or
      neglect to separate the parts by artificial means results in
      phimosis or inability to retract the prepuce. Frequently, the
      customary retraction about the eighth day of infancy exposes
      irregularly distributed bleeding points, indicating
      incomplete separation.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is the purpose of this study to ascertain
      more definitely the nature of this cleaving process, the time
      of its onset, and the age when ultimate separation is
      completed.</p>

      <h3 align="center">LITERATURE</h3>

      <p class="text2">Numerous papers dealing primarily with
      certain other phases of the embryology of the human penis
      make only secondary reference to the mechanism of preputial
      separation. For the most part these observations are based on
      one or at best few age periods only and usually refer to
      material before birth. In no instance is the process followed
      from beginning to end in a serial study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Bokai (1860) was the first to direct
      attention to the physiological adherence of the foreskin.
      Schweiger and Seidel (1866) gave the first description of the
      development of the prepuce in the human. In the later stages
      of foetal development, they noted the appearance of
      `concentric masses' of cells within the epithelium
      intervening between the glans and the prepuce. <span
      class="yellow">The centers of these masses were found to
      break down and the resulting cavities to coalesce to effect a
      separation.</span> These observations were confirmed by
      Tourneux (1877), Retterer (1890), Hart ('07), Fleischman
      ('07), Jones ('10), and Johnson ('22). Edington ('10) noted
      clinically in circumcision that spontaneous separation does
      not always progress to the same degree in children of the
      same age. <span class="yellow">In many instances he found
      considerable bleeding on retracting the prepuce.</span> The
      consistent finding of a free prepuce for a variable distance
      in the region of the meatus and in the area back of the
      corona, designated as the sulcus in the adult, led Edlington
      to think that separation begins anteriorly and posteriorly
      and processes toward the center.</p>

      <h3 align="center">MATERIALS</h3>

      <p class="text2">A series of twenty-nine penes from infants,
      with ages ranging from 6 months prematurity to six months
      after birth were prepared and studied. Of this number,
      fourteen were taken from stillborn infants and eleven from
      negro babies. The specimens were fixed in Bouin's fluid,
      blocked in paraffin and sectioned serially at 10 mu. Every
      fourth section was mounted and stained with haemotoxylin and
      eosin.</p>

      <h3 align="center">EMBRYOLOGY</h3>

      <p class="text2">It is necessary to recall the development of
      the prepuce briefly so that its subsequent separation may be
      followed to better advantage. The prepuce is often
      incorrectly described as growing forward as a free unattached
      sheath. In a 75-day foetus, the end of the penis is not
      covered by a prepuce but by a thick epidermal layer
      continuous with the anterior body wall. The distal end of the
      penis, or phallus, as it is referred to at this age,
      represents the glans, but no prepuce is in evidence (Fig.
      1A). In a 55-mm. embryo, the glans is delimited from the
      shaft on its dorsal and lateral walls by a constriction. Here
      the epithelium present a semicircular thickening, the
      glandular lamella of Fleischman, which projects into the
      mesenchyme of the penis (Fig. 1 B). Gradually this point of
      origin of the glandar lamella shifts toward the tip, so that
      in general direction in sagittal section is no longer
      transverse but longitudinal. The deep or free margin does not
      change from it original position so that the glandar lamella
      becomes curved. This curve marks the corona of the glans. The
      shifting continues, so that in a 170-mm. embryo the attached
      margin of the glandar lamella is found at the external
      urinary meatus, thereby completing the development (fig. 1 D
      and E). The lamella thickens during the shifting process,
      epithelial pearls appear and the process of separation is
      inaugurated.</p>

      <h3 align="center">OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROCESS OF
      SEPARATION</h3>

      <p class="text2">The youngest penis studied was taken from a
      6-month premature foetus. This already shows evidence of a
      beginning separation. The glandar lamella is well defined,
      terminating posteriorly in a bulb-like enlargement at the
      site of the sulcus in the adult penis. At various levels, a
      large, single, concentric epithelial mass or epithelial pearl
      occupies this enlargement (fig. 2). The center of the pearl
      shows a densely eosin-staining laminated mass of keratin, an
      evidence of early degeneration. Anterior to the enlargement,
      numerous nodular thickenings occur along the course of the
      lamella. In these thickenings, the cells are again arranged
      in whorl-like fashion, but these pearls are of much smaller
      size and show no central degenerative changes. Their
      incidence varies with the level of the section. At one level
      eighteen pearls were observed in one arm of the lamella and
      seven in the other. Anteriorly, where the glandar lamella
      joins the epidermis, cellular changes also indicate some
      separation (fig. 4). There is a ragged indentation at the
      junction filled with loose strands of hyalinized squamous
      cells continuous with the outer layers of the epidermis of
      the prepuce. It is clear, then, that the separative process
      begins earlier than the 6-month stage of foetal
      development.</p>

      <p class="text2">The cellular makeup of the larger pearls in
      the posterior enlargement is of interest. The layers of cells
      of these pearls correspond to the layers of the epidermis
      (fig. 3). The peripheral layer of the glandar lamella
      corresponds to the basal cell of the stratum germinativum.
      Its cells are columnar in shape; its nuclei spherical and
      prominent. Within this basal cell layer, the cells are more
      rounded or polyhedral in shape; its nuclei spherical and
      prominent. Within this basal cell layer, the cells are more
      rounded or polyhedral in shape -- the prickle cell layer. The
      intercellular bridges are especially prominent. As the pearl
      is approached the cells gradually assume a flat shape, the
      cytoplasm becomes granular and the nuclei spindle-shaped,
      simulating the stratum germinativum of the skin. Immediately
      surrounding the hyalinized center of a pearl are several
      layers of very flat cells with prominent eleidin granules,
      resembling the stratum granulosum of the skin. The
      periphereal portion of the hyalinized center is made up of
      several layers of squamous cells whose cytoplasm is
      distinctly hyaline and whose nuclei are pyknotic. The central
      part of the hyalinized center is laminated and shows few
      fragments of disintegrated nuclei. It corresponds to the
      horny layer of the epidermis.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the stillborn specimens varying degrees
      of pearl formation and separation are present. In the smaller
      specimens the pearls are very numerous but little
      keratinization is found in their centers (fig. 8). All of
      these smaller specimens exhibit also some degree of anterior
      separation, cornified material lining the break, which is
      significant of keratinization. In several specimens, the
      anterior separation extends posteriorly half the length of
      the glandular lamella. In the larger stillborn specimens, the
      pearls are larger and more numerous. In many instances their
      centers show extensive keratinization (fig. 2). The loose
      arrangement of the keratin resembles the laminations of a
      Meisner's corpuscle. The anterior separation is pronounced in
      most instances.</p>

      <p class="text2">In two of the larger stillborn specimens and
      in one from a child which had lived several hours, a large
      specimen also, the pearls are elongated and almost
      approximate each other. The day-old penis shows even more
      extensive separation. Along one arm of the lamella the
      prepuce is completely free at all levels studied. The other
      arm shows an anterior separation for some distance (fig. 7).
      The pearls along the course of the lamella are again
      elongated and almost approximate one another. Their centers
      show keratization. Between the pearls the cells are flattened
      longitudinally and show a granular cytoplasm. In some
      sections the cells appear hyalinized. Apparently, this is an
      interpearl keratization, serving to link the degenerated
      centers of the pearls into a continuous separation. (fig.
      6).</p>

      <p class="text2">The 10-day penis shows almost complete
      separation (fig. 9). Small areas of adhesions persist
      posteriorally in both arms at various levels. A free, thick
      stratum of keratin occupies the interval between the
      separated prepuce and glans. In the remaining older
      specimens, varying degrees of adhesions persist, even a
      slight amount at the age of 4 and 6 months (fig. 10). These
      adhesions are confined to a small portion of the posterior
      third of the glandar lamella. In this persisting area,
      degenerating pearls are again in evidence.</p>

      <h3 align="center">SUMMARY</h3>

      <p class="text2">The separation of the prepuce is the human
      penis is essentially a process of keratization of the
      intervening epithelium. It begins anteriorly and posteriorly
      at about the same time and proceeds toward the center. When
      confined on all sides the separation manifests itself as an
      epithelial pearl formation. On the surface, as is possible in
      the anterior region, it appears as a desquamation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Pearl formation is first seen in the
      enlarged posterior extremity of the glandar lamella, the site
      of the sulcus in the adult, approximately the sixth month of
      foetal life. Later pearl appear at intervals anteriorly along
      the course of the lamella. At first they are mere
      arrangements of cells in whorl-like fashion, but later their
      centers keratinize and leave a cavity. To effect a continuous
      separation of the prepuce, these cavities may actually
      coalesce or they may be united by a longitudinal
      keratinization of the epithelium intervening between the
      pearls.</p>

      <p class="text2">Separation is not completed at birth, but is
      accomplished sometime during infancy or early childhood.
      Unless the prepuce has been retracted, slight adhesions may
      persist in the posterior regions of the glandar lamella at 5
      and 6 months.</p>

      <p>Separation is sufficient at the 10-day stage to allow
      mechanical retraction without danger of a tear, apparently an
      important factor in completing the division.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nutrition or size of the infant is a
      definite factor in the advancement of the process. The larger
      specimens at birth show more separation than the smaller
      ones.</p>

      <p class="text2">No degree of difference is apparent in the
      character and rate of separation in the white and negro
      races.</p>
