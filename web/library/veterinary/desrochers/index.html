<PRE>Abstract
The purpose of this study was to compare success
rates for preputial surgery depending on the initial
diagnosis, ability to extend the penis, use of sedation
and local anesthesia versus general anesthesia for
surgery, and surgical technique. Medical records of
51 bulls treated surgically for preputial injury were
reviewed. The mean age of the bulls was 2.5 years
ranging from 1 to 5 years. Bos taurus breeds (82.3% )
were more often affected than Bos indicus breeds
(17.7%). The most common breeds represented in this
study were Angus (45.1% ), Simmental (11.8% ), and
brangus (9.8% ). The seasonal incidence of preputial
injuries was higher during the period of May-July
(52.9% ) and November-February (33.3% ). The over-
all success rate was 70%. Posthioplasty was more suc-
cessful than circumcision (90% to 43% ) (P < 0.05).
The success rate for surgeries performed under
inhalation anesthesia in the surgery suite was 100%
compared with a success rate of 63% fQ~ those ani-
mals operated on with injectable and local anesthe-
sia in a rotary chute (P < 0.05). The success rate
was 88% if the penis could be extended before
the surgery and 36% if extension was not achieved
(P < 0.05).
Introduction
preputial injury is common in beef bulls and can
cause problems with copulation, resulting in economic
loss for the producer. Preputial injuries occur during or
immediately after coitus, or are secondary to chronic pro-
lapse ( 1,2). Bas indicus breeds are more often affected
than Bas taurus breeds because of their anatomical dif -
ferences (3-6). The prepuce of Bas indicus is longer
(mean of 55 cm compared with 49.5 cm for Bas taurus),
the preputial orifice is larger, and the sheath is pendulous
( 4,7,8). However, certain breeds of Bas taurus are pre-
disposed to preputial injuries. Polled breeds, includ-
ing Angus and polled Hereford, have a rudimentary
caudal (retractor) preputial muscle, resulting in preputial
prolapse and thereby exposing the prepuce to injury
(8,9).
The therapeutic approach is influenced by the nature
and chronicity of the injury, the breed, the presence of
infection, the ability to extend the penis, and the value
of the animal. Medical treatment consists of controlling
infection, decreasing inflammation, and preventing
preputial prolapse. Surgical intervention is indicated
if medical treatment has failed or if fibrous tissue result-
ing from the healing process prevents normal movement
of the prepuce. Circumcision (preputial amputation)
and posthioplasty (resection and anastomosis, or reefing)
are 2 surgical techniques used to reestablish the normal
function of the prepuce (2,3, 10, II ). The success rate of
surgical treatment for preputial injuries has been reported
to be between 76% and 87%, and no difference was
reported between circumcision and posthioplasty (3-6).
The breeds affected in those reports were principally
Bas ;nd;cus. Limited information is available on surgi-
cal treatment of preputial injuries in Bas taurus breeds.
The purpose of this study was to compare breeds, success
rates for preputial surgery depending on the initial diag-
nosis, ability to extend the penis, use of sedation and local
anesthesia versus general anesthesia for surgery, and
surgical technique.
Material and methods
Medical records of 51 bulls treated surgically for preputial
injury were reviewed (February 1986 to April 1994).
Follow-up data were obtained after evaluation by the
surgeon or telephone conversation with the owner after
at least I breeding season. Successful outcome was
based on return to previous activity (semen collection or
pasture breeding).
The surgical techniques used in this study were post-
hioplasty, circumcision, scar revision, primary closure,
abscess drainage, and penile hematoma evacuation
when present with preputial prolapse. The surgery was
performed under sedation or general anesthesia, based
on the severity of the injury, the animal's value, and the
surgeon's preference. Food was withheld for 48 to 72 h
(except for preputial avulsion) and water for 12 to 24 h.
Bulls operated on in a rotary chute received a combi-
nation of anesthetic drugs composed of acepromazine
(0.04 mg/kg/body weight (BW), IV), xylazine (0.05 to
0. I mg/kg/BW, IV), and ketamine (2.2 mg/kg/BW. IV).
The bulls operated on under inhalation anesthesia in a
surgery suite were induced with IV injection of a mix-
ture of glycerol guaiacolate 10% (70 to 80 mg/kg/BW)
and thiopental sodium (5 mg/kg/BW). Anesthesia was
maintained with halothane in oxygen in a semiclosed
circle system.
Posthioplasty was performed as previously described
(2, 10). The bull was placed in lateral recumbency. The
penis was extended and held with a penetrating towel
clamp placed under the apical ligament of the free por-
tion of the penis. The surgical site was aseptically pre-
pared. Circumferential incisions were made proximal
and distal to the lesions, and I simple suture was placed
on the dorsal aspect of each pan of the remaining prepuce
to ensure correct alignment. A longitudinal incision
united the 2 circumferential incisions. The flap of pre-
puce was removed by blunt and sharp dissection. The
elastic tissue layers were carefully dissected-and
hemorrhage was controlled by ligature or electrocautery .
Anastomosis of the prepuce was performed with
2-0 polyglactin 910 or polydioxanone in a simple inter-
rupted or cruciate pattern. A Penrose drain was sutured
to the free portion of the penis. A polyvinyl tube (2.5 cm
outside diameter, 15 cm long) was inserted in the preputial
orifice, taped with elastic adhesive, and secured to the
skin with 4 simple interrupted-sutures. The bandage
was removed 4 to 5 d after surgery.
Circumcision was also performed as previously
described (2, 11 ). The prepuce was extended to expose the
affected part to be resected. A line for amputation was
defined between the prepuce to be resected and the
preputial orifice. Mattress sutures with #lor
#2 polyglactin 910 or polydioxanone were placed
through the .external and the internal preputial layers
along the intended resection line. The prepuce was
amputated distal to the sutures, and the external and inter-
nal layers were sutured together with #1 or #2 poly-
glactin 910 or polydioxanone in a simple continuous
pattern.
The chi-square test was used to compare success
rates for the following variables: diagnosis, ability to
extend the penis before or during surgery, sedation or
general anesthesia, and comparison between post-
hioplasty avd circumcision. Fisher's exact test was
used, instead offhe chi-square test, when the expected
count in lor more cells was <5. p < 0.05 was considered
significant.
Results
The affected breeds were Angus (n = 23), Simmental
(n = 6), brangus (n = 5), Hereford (n = 3), Limousin
(n = 2), Santa Gertrudis (n = 2), amerifax (n = 1 ), beef-
master (n = I ), Charolais (n = 1 ), gelbvieh (n = 1 ),
Holstein (n = I ), Maine Anjou (n = 1 ), Red Angus
(n = 1 ), Romagnol (n = I ), salers (n = 1 ), and shorthorn
(n = 1 ). The affected population was 82.3% Bas taurus
and 17.7% Bas indicus breeds. Angus (27% ), Hereford
(22% ), and Simmental ( 16.8% ) were the predominant
beef breeds seen in our hospital based on information
obtained from the Veterinary Medical Database for the
same period of time. The mean age was 2.5 y (range, 1 to
5 y). Twenty-seven bulls (52.9%) were admitted to the
hospital during May to July, and 17 bulls (33.3% )
during November to February <A HREF="fig1.gif">(Figure I)</A>. The mean
duration of clinical signs was 15 d (range, 1 to 90 d).
Fifteen bulls had been treated medically with antibiotics
and local treatment before admission. Phimosis was
the most common preputial abnormality (n = 14),
followed by laceration (n = 11 ), prolapse and lacera-
tion (n = 7), prolapse and posthitis (n = 6), parapenile
abscess (n = 4), avulsion of the prepuce from the attach-
ment to the penis (n = 4), paraphimosis (n = 3), and
preputial prolapse secondary to penile hematoma (n = 2).
The hospitalized bulls were treated medically for a
mean period of 5 d (range. 1 to 14 d) before surgery.
Treatments consisted of systemic antibiotics and non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydrotherapy, gentle
debridement, topical antiseptic ointment, and bandaging
with a polyvinyl tube (2.5 cm outside diameter, 15 cm
long) placed within the preputial lumen to prevent pro-
lapse recurrence or to reduce edema. Eighty-two percent
(n = 42) of the surgeries were performed in a rotary
chute, and 18% (n = 9) were performed in a surgery suite.
Posthioplasty was performed on 25 bulls, and circum-
cision on II bulls. The preputial sheath was incised in
5 bulls to gain access to infected or adhered peripreputial
tissue for debridement and lavage. The 4 bulls with
preputial avulsion were admitted shortly after the injury
had been noticed by a technician at a semen collection
center. Blood was either observed in the artificial vagina
after semen collection or seen dripping from the prepuce.
Avulsions were repaired by primary closure. Scar revi-
sion was performed on 3 animals. Two bulls with penile
hematoma were circumcised because of recurrent
preputial prolapse, and a V -plasty was made on the
preputial orifice of I bull to allow correction of a para-
phimosis. The penis was extended before or during the
surgery in 32 bulls. Penile extension was not obtained or
performed in 19 bulls. A mean of 7.5 cm of prepuce was
removed during circumcision or posthioplasty (n = 15,
range, 2.5 to 12 cm). The bulls were treated postopera-
tively for a duration of 7 d (range, I to 29 d). Postopera-
tive treatment consisted of systemic antibiotic and non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical application
of antiseptic ointment, and hydrotherapy. Decisions to
maintain a preputial retaining tube and bandage were
based on the type of lesion, surgery performed, and
the surgeon's preference. The bulls were hospitalized for
a mean period of 11 d (range, I to 38 d).
Follow-up information was obtained on 40 animals.
The average period of sexual rest after release from
hospital was 5 mo (range, 2 to 12 mo). Successful out-
come was obtained in 28 bulls. At the time. Qf follow-up,
12 animals were still being used in the herd. Bulls were
used for a mean of 2 breeding years (range, 1 to 4 y}.
The reasons for unsuccessful outcome were: unable to
resume natural breeding (n = 7); hematoma and dehis-
cence after surgery (n = 3); prolapse recurrence shortly
after the surgery (n = I ); and prepuce too short, leaving
the penis outside the sheath (n = 1). Two bulls from the
successfut group were culled later for recurrence of
prolapse during the year following the surgery. The
success rate was 88% if the penis was extended before
the surgery, compared with 36% if extension was not
achieved (P < 0.05). The success rate for surgeries per-
formed under inhalation anesthesia in the surgery suite
was 100% compared with a success rate of 63% for
surgeries performed with injectable anesthesia in a
chute (P < 0.05). The success rate for posthioplasty
was 90% compared with 43% for circumcision
(P < 0.05) (Table 1 ). Sixty-three percent of bulls affected
with phimosis returned to breeding soundness. Surgery
on bulls with preputial laceration had an 86% success
rate. Preputial prolapse with and without laceration
was treated successfully in 83% and 75% of the animals,
respectively. Incision of the sheath was necessary in bulls
with no penile extension and abscess of the elastic lay-
ers. The 2 bulls that returned to breeding soundness
ha4. a localized abscess with minimal adhesion of the
elastic layers. All the animals with preputial avulsion
were used successfully in a semen collection center.
Recurrence was observed in 1 bull, 4 mo after the
surgery, but it was used successfully for 1 y after recur-
rence. Scar revision was successful in 2 of 3 bulls. One
bull with concurrent penile hematoma returned to pas-
ture breeding. A V -shaped incision had been performed
on the preputial orifice to correct a paraphimosis, but the
bull had severe adhesions due to the injury itself and was
unable to extend his penis.
Discussion
The breed populations in this study differ from those of
previous studies (3-6,12). The proportion of Bos taurus
breeds (82.3% ) to Bos indicus breeds ( 17.7% ) was in pro-
portion to the breed population in Kansas (Spire, personal
communication). Posthioplasty was preferred over cir-
cumcision in Bos taurus animals, because the prepuce
is shorter, compared with that of Bos indicus, and the pro-
cedure is more appropriate to prevent excessive preputial
resection. This is supported by our greater success rate
for posthioplasty (90% ) compared with circumcision
( 43% ). Posthioplasty allows thorough evaluation of the
prepuce and the penis after extension and prior to
resection. The type of injuries encountered in those
2 breeds is probably different, thus influencing the
choice of the appropriate surgical technique. Bos indi-
cus breeds are anatomically more susceptible to chronic
prolapse, where circumcision is appropriate. Our over-
all success rate (70% ) was slightly lower than that
previously reported (3-6). This may be explained by the
predominance of Bos taurus breeds and the different
type of preputial lesions.
When penile extension was performed, the success rate
was significantly higher. This differs from results of a
previous study that included mostly Bos indicus breeds
(3). The same preputial lesions on Bos taurus breeds may
have a detrimental effect on penile extension because of
a smaller preputial diameter. Extension of the penis
provides thorough assessment of the extent of preputial
injury and the integrity of the elastic layer. We recognize
that extension of the penis is not always necessary
when performing an elective circumcision for chronic
preputial prolapse, but, according to our results, it may
be a useful prognostic indicator .
Operations done under inhalation anesthesia in a
surgery suite had a better outcome than those done
under sedation and local anesthetic in a rotary chute.
Inhalation anesthesia allows the surgeon to perform
optimal hemostasis and more precise tissue handling, and
prevents any movement from the animal during surgery ,
thus reducing the chance of contamination. Surgery
performed under sedation requires infiltration of local
anesthetic, which may interfere with tissue healing
( 13). We recognize that case selection may have influ-
enced our results. The options of inhalation anesthesia
versus sedation and local anesthesia were usually given
to owners. In the situation where the bull had a poor prog-
nosis, the decision could have been driven toward the less
expensive option.
The mean age of 2.5 y for injured bulls was similar to
that in previous studies (3,5). The incidence of preputial
injuries increased after the spring and fall breeding
seasons; spring is the predominant breeding season in the
Midwest.
Our success rate of 50% with surgery for preputial
abscesses was similar to that reported previously (5).
Severe abscesses can be drained by a lateral incision of
the sheath or an incision through the preputial orifice to
access the infected layers. Although infection can be dealt
with successfully, severe adhesions develop during the
healing process and prevent nor-mal penile extension.
All bulls with preputial avulsion in this study returned
to semen collection. These bulls were brought for treat-
ment shortly after the injury , which may explain the good
outcome of the surgery. The wound should be evaluated
before the animal is returned to semen collection, and the
artificial vagina should be lubricated carefully (14).
Based on the results of this study, posthioplasty is
recommended over circumcision in Bos taurus breeds of
cattle. Penile extension should be performed, if possible,
at the time of surgery for complete evaluation of the
preputial and penile injury. Surgery should be per-
formed under general anesthesia in an operating room,
if the animal is of sufficient economic value. CVJ
