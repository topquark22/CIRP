      <p class="abstract"><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Recently,
      topical steroid application has been shown by a small number
      of studies to be an effective alternative to circumcision for
      the treatment of phimosis. However, only potent or very
      potent corticosteroids have been more thoroughly studied in
      this treatment option. A prospective study was conducted to
      determine whether comparable results could be achieved using
      a weaker steroid cream.<br />
      <br />
       <strong>METHODS:</strong> Boys, 3-13 years of age, with
      non-retractable foreskin due to a tight ring at the tip were
      offered the regimen of twice-daily preputial retraction and
      topical application of 0.02% triamcinolone acetonide cream.
      The degree of preputial retractability was assessed at
      presentation and at 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. Success was
      defined as full retraction or free retraction up to
      agglutination of the foreskin to the glans.<br />
      <br />
       <strong>RESULTS:</strong> Eighty-three boys completed the
      treatment. Successful retraction was achieved in 48/83 (58%)
      patients after 4 weeks and 70/83 (84%) patients after 6 weeks
      of application. The overall response rate aggregated from six
      published series using 0.05% betamethasone was 87% at 4 weeks
      and 90% on completion of treatment. Thus, the results appear
      inferior when analysed at 4 weeks but compare favourably with
      those reported for a more potent steroid on completion of the
      full course of treatment.<br />
      <br />
       <strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Even though the triamcinolone
      cream used in the present study is less potent than the more
      commonly used 0.05% betamethasone valerate cream, it could
      effect comparable improvements in foreskin retractability
      after 6 weeks of treatment.</p>
