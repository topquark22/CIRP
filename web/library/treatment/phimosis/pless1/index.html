      <blockquote>
        The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
        steroid application in the treatment of childhood phimosis.
        In a consecutive study 91 boys were treated with
        application of topical betamethason 0.05% cream twice
        daily. The foreskin was treated for one month, with an
        attempt at foreskin retraction after fourteen days.
        Treatment was controlled after one month and six months.
        Sixty boys achieved full retraction of the foreskin and
        nine had partial retraction and relief of symptoms.
        Twenty-two boys had unsatisfactory response and had an
        operation. Forty-five boys were controlled after six
        months, 13 had recurrence, of these nine were satisfied and
        free of symptoms, two had a new steroid treatment with full
        success, and two wanted a circumcision. A total of 74% did
        not need an operation after topical steroid treatment. No
        side-effects or complications were registered. Childhood
        phimosis can be successfully treated with steroid
        application, and the treatment should be offered prior to
        an operation.<br />
