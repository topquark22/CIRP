      patients followed for up to 20 years.</b></p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p align="justify">Circumcision is one of the oldest and
      still one of the commonest surgical operations worldwide.
      Although it is usually performed as a religious or
      sacrificial rite <i>(1)</i>, the main medical indication is
      organic-narrowing of the preputial orifice. As several
      authors have recently noted <i>(2)</i>, the foreskin is often
      removed unnecessarily, when there is no true fibrous
      phimosis. Even when there is genuine narrowing, phimosis in
      children often lends itself to the lesser proceduer of
      prepuceplasty, which I have been offering to parents for the
      past 20 years.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      operation of prepuceplasty relies on the fact that organic
      phimosis is often due not to widespread scarring of the
      foreskin but to a localised band of fibrosis just at the end
      of it. This allows correction of the stenosis by the standard
      surgical ploy of longitudinal division and transverse repair.
      The end result is a normal uncircumcised appearance.</p>

      <p><b>Technique</b></p>

      <p align="justify">The operation is carried out as a day case
      under general anaesthesia. Using fine scissors, a short full
      thickness longitudinal incision is made in the end of the
      narrowed prepuce, on the dorsal aspect (Figure 1A). This must
      be in the midline, exactly opposite the ventral raphe, and
      extends just far enough backe to allew complete and easy
      retraction--a 'mini-dorsal slit'. Adhesions to the glans are
      broken down if present. The prepuce is draw forwards again
      and the inner and outer layers of skin sutured together
      transversely (Fig. 1B) to produce permanent widening of the
      opening, starting at the apex of the cut and using five to
      seven interrupted sutures of 0000 polyglycolic acid.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1." />
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
      incising the outer layer slightly farther than the inner, and
      adjusting the needle bites appropriately, the suture line can
      be turned outward so that contact between the two halves and
      subsequent bridging, is prevented. The aim is to produce a
      supple scar with minimal fibrosis, so the skin edges should
      be accurately apposed and the sutures tied snugly rather than
      tightly.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Postoperatively, no attempt is made at first to retract the
      foreskin fully, lest the healing scar be torn. The two sides
      of the suture line are gently separated in the bath daily to
      remove any exudate or decomposing urine and prevent bridging.
      The parents are warned that the end of the foreskin will look
      puffy for a week or so--otherwise the patient is liable to
      receive an unnecessary course of antibiotics. The wound can
      be inspected after a few days to check for bridging by
      fibrinous adhesions, and in 3 or 4 months to confirm full
      retractability.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p align="justify">Analysis of the first persons treated in
      this way, 20 years ago, confirms the usefulness of the
      procedure and reveals some limitations. Sixty consecutive
      childhood prepuceplasty operations performed between 1973 and
      1976 have been reviewed. Age at operation ranged from 1 to 14
      years (median age 5 years). All patients had organic
      narrowing of moderate or severe degree.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      patients were nearly all see within the first week after
      operation. Fifty-seven patients were seen after 3 months, and
      most again at 5-8 years. In addition, 46 patients responded
      to a postal/telephone questionnaire in 1993 to determine if
      further surgery had been needed, if the prepuce retracted
      easily and if the owner was happy with the cosmetic
      appearance. In total, 55 patients were reviewed either at 5+
      or 17+ years, or both.</p>

      <p align="justify">Four patients needed subsequent
      circumcision, at between 1 and 5 years after the
      prepuceplasty. Of these, three were noted initially to have
      extensively fibrosed foreskins which were never supple enough
      after the operations to allow easy retraction. The fourth
      experienced postoperative bridging but falied to return for
      follow-up until the two halves of the incision had firmly
      joined, reproducing the phimosis.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One patient who had
      an over generous prepuceplasty, amounting to a traditional
      dorsal slit, ended up with an appearance exactly like a
      circumcision.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
      the time of their latest follow-up, the remaining 50 patients
      had needed no further treatment, had easily retractable
      foreskins and were happy with the appearance (except for one
      who thought it looked 'dog-eared"). Functionally there were
      no adverse comments--rather the contrary.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p align="justify"><a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood2/">Rickwood <i>et
      al</i></a>. (2) have shown that many boys referred for
      circumcision do not have true phimosis, merely a
      non-retractable foreskin due to preputial adhesions, which
      break down spontaneously in later childhood. This applies
      especially in the first few years of life. Nevertheless, most
      surgeons would confirm that genuine fibrous phimosis may be
      seen at quite a young age. This is usually the result of
      inflammation after prolonged contact with nappies soaked with
      decomposing urine; well-intentioned attempts to retract the
      foreskin in babies, sometimes on medical advice, can also
      cause fissuring and fibrosis. The changes vary from localised
      narrowing at the tip of the foreskin to severe scarring with
      thickening and deformity--the latter more commonly seen in
      older boys after repeated episodes of posthitis.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Circumcision has a definite <a
      href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/">morbidity</a>,
      including haemorrhage and meatal ulceration and stricture
      <i>(4)</i>. Prepuce plasty has produced none of these; it is
      a lesser and relatively painless procedure and is quick to
      perform. The usual indication for choosing prepuceplasty has
      been parental preference, based on cosmetic rather than
      medical indications. As a tribe, boys of school age are
      fiercely conformist and prone to harass any of their number
      who departs from the anatomical norm. Perhaps for this reason
      a surprising number of parents opt strongly for saving the
      foreskin when they know that there is a choice. Others, it
      mus be said, are equally determined for their son to be rid
      of it. This is the age of consumer choice and the surgeon may
      be in a position to respond to their preference.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      However, experience has shown that prepuceplasty is not
      applicable to every patient with phimosis. Where the foreskin
      is visibly scarred and thickened the stenosis is difficult to
      overcome and tends to recur, even after a wide plasty. Most
      adult phimosis is of this type by the time the patient
      presents; here the cause is a combination of fungal infection
      and repeated splitting of the skin on intercourse.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Prepuceplasty may also be less satisfactory in a very
      redundant foreskin where urinary stasis and decomposition
      lead to ammoniacal dermatitis, inflammation and eventual
      recurrence of the deformity. A long stenosed foreskin is
      probably better treated by circumcision. Failures in early
      cases were attributable to two factors, 1, very severe
      fibrosis or 2, excessive length of foreskin, and a later,
      more selective approach has eliminated the problem of
      recurrent phimosis. The long follow-up of from 6 to 20 years
      in this series of patients indicates that the successful
      results are lasting.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Cuckow <i>et al. (5)</i> have recently pleaded eloquently on
      behalf of the foreskin and recommended the operation of
      'preputial plasty', which they claim is a well-recognised
      procedure in (mainland) Europe. It should extend to the
      repertoire of British surgeons.</p>
