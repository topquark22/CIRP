      <h2>Phimosis&mdash;a diagnostic dilemma?</h2>

      University</a>,<br />

       Canada.</p>

      <p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Phimosis is defined as the inability
      to retract the foreskin. Differentiating between
      physiological phimosis and pathological phimosis is
      important, as the former is managed conservatively and the
      latter requires surgical intervention. Referrals of patients
      with physiological phimosis to urology clinics may create
      anxiety regarding the need for surgery amongst patients and
      parents, while unnecessarily expanding the waiting list for
      specialty assessment.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To determine the ability of referring
      physicians to differentiate physiological from pathological
      phimosis, and to see whether there is any difference in this
      ability between generalists versus specialists.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> A retrospective chart review
      of 284 consecutive referrals for phimosis to the <a
      href="http://www.cheo.on.ca/" target="_blank">Children's
      Hospital of Eastern Ontario</a> (CHEO) Urology Clinic during
      November 2000 - April 2003 was conducted. Referral sources
      included family physicians (FP), pediatricians (PD),
      emergency physicians (ER), and other subspecialists (SS).
      Data for this study were obtained from the original referral
      letters and cross-referenced with the impressions of the
      pediatric urologist following the initial patient encounter.
      The accuracy in diagnosing phimosis was evaluated among the
      various types of referring physicians.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> A total of 284 phimosis referrals were
      reviewed of patients ranging from 2 months to 16 years of age
      (mean = 6.6 years). The referral sources consisted of 222-GP,
      33-PD, 23-ER, and 6-SS. The majority of referred cases were
      diagnosed by the attending pediatric urologist as
      physiological phimosis across all referral sources, with the
      exception of subspecialists (FP = 75.2%, PD = 81.8%, ER =
      56.5%, SS = 33.3%). Second to this was the diagnosis of
      pathological phimosis across all referral sources except SS
      (FP = 14.9%, PD = 12%, ER = 34.8%, SS = 50%). Overall, the
      circumcision rate for the 284 phimosis referrals reviewed was
      14.4%.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Our findings
      reveal that many physicians continue to face difficulties in
      distinguishing physiological phimosis from the pathological.
      As a result, many unnecessary referrals are made for phimosis
      . We suggest the implementation of improved educational
      measures regarding preputial pathophysiology in the medical
      curriculum. Such measures would serve two purposes: first, to
      reduce the number of unnecessary specialty referrals and
      secondly, to aid primary care physicians in recognizing the
      presence of physiological phimosis so that patients and
      families may be reassured of normalcy.</span></p>
