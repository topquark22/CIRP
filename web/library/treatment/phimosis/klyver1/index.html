      <p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> The current treatment of phimosis in
      Denmark is surgical. Reports of success rates of 70-80% with
      topical steroids have prompted us to carry out the present
      study.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Parents of boys, who were referred because
      of phimosis, volunteered to participate in an open trial of
      topical clobetasol 0.05%, along with gentle mobilisation of
      the foreskin once daily for 4-6 weeks. Fifty-five boys
      completed the treatment. The results were recorded at
      clinical follow-up four and six weeks later, and a long-term
      follow-up was done by questionnaire sent after 9-11
      months.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> At six weeks of treatment, 42 had a fully
      retractable foreskin, 11 a partially retractable foreskin,
      and two had unchanged phimosis. Ten patients had a
      circumcision or plasty. At long- term follow-up, 12 had a
      symptomatic recurrence. Four of these were given surgical
      treatment and eight had a repeat topical treatment, which was
      effective in six. The overall effect was independent of the
      degree of phimosis. Four patients with obvious scarified
      foreskin failed. Twelve patients had agglutinations, which
      became apparent after the treatment for phimosis. We recorded
      no systemic and very few local side effects. The patients and
      parents found the treatment convenient and satisfactory.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Topical clobetasol 0.05% once a day for
      4-6 weeks can be recommended as primary treatment in phimosis
      in boys without scarification of the foreskin. The treatment
      may be repeated as necessary.</p>
