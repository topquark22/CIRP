      <blockquote>
        <font face="ARIAL, helvetica">Summary--Phimosis, defined as
        scarring of the tip of the prepuce, was studied
        prospectively in a series of 23 boys aged 4 to 11 years.
        There was little to support the contention that the
        condition is caused by trauma, or by ammoniacal or
        bacterial inflammation of the prepuce, could any other
        aetiological factor be identified. Histological examination
        of the foreskin showed the appearances of Balanitis
        Xerotica Obliterans in 20 of the 21 specimens submitted for
        study.</font>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The usual reason for referral, and the
      commonest indication for circumcision, is "phimosis", but
      experience suggests that this condition is over-diagnosed and
      many unnecessary circumcisions performed in consequence.
      True, from its Greek derivation
      (<i>&phi;&iota;&mu;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</i>,
      muzzling), the term might be applied whenever the foreskin
      cannot be retracted to reveal the glans penis, but <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> (1949)
      demonstrated that in young boys non-retractability of the
      foreskin is a normal finding and is due to the persistence of
      developmental adhesions between glans and prepuce. These
      break down spontaneously with the passage of time and,
      without interference, full retractability of the foreskin can
      be expected in almost all boys by their early teens (<a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Oster</a>, 1968).
      Non-retractability of this type requires no treatment and the
      term phimosis is best avoided in this situation since it
      implies the existence of pathology when there is none. On the
      other hand, there are cases where the tip of the prepuce
      loses its normal suppleness and becomes scarred, resulting in
      secondary non-retractability. The appearances are
      unmistakable (Fig. 1) and clearly pathological; we confine
      the term "phimosis" exclusively to cases of this type.</p>

      <p class="text2">Little is known of this condition. Its
      aetiology has been variously described to the trauma of
      forcible retraction (Twistington Higgins <i>et al</i>.,
      1951), to ammonia dermatitis (Robarts, 1962) or to repeated
      episodes of bacterial balanoposthitis (Campbell, 1951). Its
      natural history is unknown and its histological features have
      not been adequately described. That circumcision is the only
      possible treatment has never been questioned. In view of this
      lack of knowledge we elected to study a series of cases in
      detail.</p>

      <p><b>Patients and Methods</b></p>

      <p class="text1">A prospective analysis was made of 23
      consecutive new cases of phimosis seen in the first 9 months
      of 1978. At the initial out-patient attendance full details
      of the history and physical examinination was entered on a
      pro forma. All of the patients proceeded to circumcision,
      where the operative findings were noted, the urine and the
      bacterial flora of the prepuce cultured, and the operative
      specimen submitted for histological examination.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Clinical Findings</i><br />
       The Age distribution of the patients is shown in Figure 2.
      The mean duration of symptoms was 3.1 months (range 2 days to
      14 months. Seven patients complained of poor urinary stream,
      6 of dysuria, 4 of irritation or soreness of the prepuce, 2
      of non-retractability of the foreskin and one of haematuria,
      whilst 3 boys admitted to no symptoms. One boy described a
      vesicular eruption on his prepuce at the onset of the
      disease, but in the remainder the process began insidiously.
      There were no apparent precipitating factors, nor any history
      of a change of clothing or washing methods. In 11 patients
      the foreskin had previously been fully retractile, in 4
      partially retractile and in 4 non-retractile, whilst 4
      patients had no recollection of the previous state of
      retractability of their foreskin. Five patients gave a past
      history of balanoposthitis, one of ammonia dermatitis and 6
      of forcible retraction, but in each case the last episode of
      any one of these had been separated from the onset of
      phimosis by a period of years. All were fully continent by
      day and night. Two patients had a skin disease (psoriasis)
      and 3 an allergy (2 penicillin, 1 pollen). The fathers of 3
      boys had been circumcised for reasons unknown. In a total of
      14 brothers over the age of 5 years there were no instances
      of phimosis. All of the patients were prepubertal and
      physical examinations were unremarkable apart from the
      presence of phimosis, which was confined to the tip of the
      prepuce and did not extend from more than 0.25 cm
      proximally.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Operative Findings</i><br />
      Adhesions between the glans and foreskin were present in 6
      cases and retained smegma in 2 cases. The underlying glans
      appeared normal except in one patient where there was a
      suggestion of involvement of the urethra meatus.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Laboratory Findings</i><br />
      An excess of leucocytes in sterile urine was found in one
      patient, but in the remainder the urine was free of bacteria
      or other abnormal constituents on routine laboratory testing.
      Pathogenic bacteria were cultured from the prepuce in 4
      instances (<i>beta haemolytic streptococci</i> 2,
      <i>Proteus</i> 2). In other cases culture was either sterile
      or produced mixed growths of conventionally non-pathogenic
      organisms.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Histological Findings</i><br />
      Twenty-one specimens were submitted for histological
      examination, all but one of which showed the features of <a
      href="/library/treatment/BXO/">Balanitis Xerotica
      Obliterans</a> (BXO). The histological criteria for this
      diagnosis was oedema and homogenisation of collagen in the
      upper dermis, inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes and
      histiocytes in the mid-dermis, atrophy of the stratum
      malpighi and hydropic degeneration of the basal cells
      (Bainbridge et al., 1971; Lever and Schaumburg-Lever, 1975).
      A typical example is shown in figure 3. The only atypical
      finding was that although the stratum malpighi was atrophic
      in some areas, other parts of the epidermis were of normal
      width or even acanthotic. A patchy non-specific outer dermal
      infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells was often present
      in other parts of the prepuce not affected by BXO. The single
      specimen not affected by BXO had minimal chronic inflammatory
      changes in the outer dermis and marked dilation of the
      lymphatic channels near the inner surface of the prepuce. The
      foreskins of 11 other boys aged 8 months to 11 years, who had
      been circumcised for religious reasons, were also examined
      histologically: none showed the changes of BXO.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The findings of a previous survey (Rickwood,
      1977) confirm that phimosis in the pathological sense is
      rarely seen in pre-school boys. Its aetiology remains
      obscure. Our data do not support previous contentions that it
      is due to forcible retraction, ammonia dermatitis or
      recurrent balanoposthitis. There appears to be no familial
      predisposition or any relation to the changes of puberty, nor
      is there any evidence of its being a form of contact
      dermatitis, a local manifestation of general allergy or a
      reaction to retained smegma. It is not related to the
      presence or otherwise of preputial adhesions. If a bacterial
      organism is involved it is not a conventional pathogen. A
      viral aetiology remains a possibility.</p>

      <p class="text2">The finding of BXO is almost all cases was
      unexpected, since this is a condition mainly reported in
      adults and childhood cases have been thought to be
      exceptional. (Caterall and Oates, 1962; Schinella and
      Miranda, 1964; Mikat et al., 1973; <a
      href="/library/treatment/BXO/mckay1/">McKay et al.</a>,
      1975). BXO histologically resembles Lichen Sclerosis et
      Atrophicus, and may affect the prepuce (Bainbridge et al.,
      1971), the anterior urethra (Staff, 1970) or both
      simultaneously. Although there are changes in the dermal
      collagen, there is no evidence that the condition is related
      to the general collagenoses (Leven and Schaumburg-Lever,
      1975), and the notion that is is primarily an inflammatory
      disease is supported by the lymphocytic and histiocytic
      infiltration which is especially marked in its early stages
      (Staff, 1970). If so, however, the nature of the inflammatory
      agent is unknown.</p>

      <p class="text2">It has been assumed that acquired phimosis
      persists or progresses. In this series, where all patients
      were circumcised within two months of presentation, no
      changes for better or worse were noted, but at a time when
      waiting lists were longer a few examples of spontaneous and
      apparently permanent regression were seen. On the other hand,
      in adult patients progression of the disease to involve the
      anterior urethra may occur, and the likelihood of this
      happening may possible be increased as a result of
      circumcision (Stuhmer, 1928; Staff, 1970). The literature
      does not contain any examples of this occurring in
      childhood.</p>

      <p class="text2">These considerations have some bearing on
      the management. Treatment is undoubtedly required, not only
      for the long-term problems associated with a permanently
      non-retractile foreskin, but because boys with phimosis are
      often much troubled with their present symptoms. Although
      spontaneous regression may occasionally occur, and although
      the changes of BXO have been reversed by the local
      application of corticosteroids (Caterall and Oates, 1962;
      Poynter and Levy, 1967), circumcision is undoubtly the most
      efficacious treatment and there seems little reason to doubt
      its safety in the long term.</p>

      <p><b><font color="navy">[CIRP Note: This excellent
