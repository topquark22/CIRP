          <p align="justify"><b><i>Background</i>: Non-retractile
          foreskin comprise a significant number of referrals by
          pediatricians and general practitioners to pediatric
          surgical centers. In attempts to find alternatives to
          widely practiced circumcision, various procedures have
          been developed over the years in order to relieve the
          non-fibrotic narrowing of the foreskin.<br />
           <i>Patients and Methods</i>: In a 13-year period from
          1984-1997, we treated 2554 patients with non-retractile
          foreskin at our center. Dorsal relieving incision was the
          technique of choice and was performed in 2177 patients,
          circumcision in 73 patients and preputial adhesiolysis
          was sufficient to retract the foreskin in 284
          patients.<br />
           <i>Results</i>: Satisfactory esthetic results, an
          extremely low rate of postoperative complications (1.8%)
          with a recurrence rate of only 0.8% (18 patients) was
          observed in our series with dorsal relieving
          incision.<br />
           <i>Conclusions</i>: Dorsal relieving incision operation
          was found to be less invasive, safe and effective
          procedure for non-retractile foreskin not affected by
          extensive secondary scarring. This technique has fewer
          complications in comparison to circumcision and can be
          performed as an ambulatory procedure.</b></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The "dorsal relieving incision"
      procedure discussed in this article appears essentially to be
      similar to the "dorsal slit with tranverse closure" procedure
      that is discussed by other authors.]</p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="6">C</font>areful evaluation
      of patients referred to our center over the past 13 years
      with non-retractile foreskin show that physiological
      preputial adhesions are present in most boys between the ages
      of 1 and 2 years and persists in 1 in 30 males after the age
      of two years. Narrowing of the preputial opening accompanied
      with a circular non-fibrotic ring is observed in 1 in 200
      boys making it impossible or painful to retract the foreskin,
      leading to emergencies such as balanitis. In the absence of
      an infectious narrow preputial opening, <a

      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> have been
      shown to be effective. However, preputial fibrosis secondary
      to iatrogenic or forced retraction, paraphimosis, balanitis
      and failed conservative therapy attempts have all been
      indications for the preputial-sparring dorsal relieving
      incision.</p>

      <p>Patients and Methods</p>

      <p align="justify">In the 13 year period from 1984-1997,
      dorsal relieving operation procedures were performed on 2177
      patients at the Pediatric Surgical University Clinic,
      Munster. Circumcision was performed on 71 patients on request
      of the parents, frequently for religious reasons and, in 2
      cases, secondary to balanitis xerotica obliterans. In the
      case of 284 patients, a simple preputial adhesiolysis was
      sufficient to relieve the pathology and no further surgical
      intervention was undertaken as the foreskin could be
      retracted with ease. The age of presentation of patients at
      the time of surgical intervention ranged from 1 to 14 years
      with the mean age being 4.6 years. Nine patients presented
      with non-reducible paraphimosis and were operated as
      emergencies. At least one episode of balanitis was documented
      in 128 patients. The rest could either not retract their
      foreskins fully or partially. Sixty-seven boys were operated
      at the time of other operations (22 inguinal herniotomy, 12
      orchiopexy, 10 umbilical hernia repair, 6 paracentesis, 5
      adenectomy, 4 hemangioma-laser therapy, 3 esophagus
      dilatation, 3 central cathether implantation and 2
      ventriculo-peritoneal shunt implantation).</p>

      <p><i>Operative technique</i></p>

      <p align="justify">Under general anesthesia, the foreskin is
      retracted carefully and held under mild tension (Fig. 1). A
      longitudinal incision (a few millimeters) is then made using
      a scalpel on the dorsal preputial skin at the maximum point
      of tension. After the outer preputial skin has been incised,
      a white circular and constricting fibrous ring can be
      visualized which is completely divided, again using a scapel.
      The inner preputial skin now visible is then divided using
      scissors (Fig. 2). Bleeding is controlled with microsurgical
      forceps using a minimum diathermy strength and contact time.
      The retractability of the foreskin is tested and all
      adhesions between the preputium and the glans are separated
      using a blunt mosquito clamp, the tip of which is slightly
      wet in physiological saline to prevent glans abrasions. Using
      a wet swab and a pair of forceps, smegma present between
      inner preputial skin and glans in the sulcus is removed. The
      frenulum is evaluated and if its point of attachment is close
      to the uretheral orifice, it is divided carefully (2-3 mm)
      using a fine needle diathermy close to the glans while being
      held under tension. The retractability of the foreskin is
      tested and the longitudinal incision is then closed
      transversely with 5/0 Vicryl (Vicryl Rapid<font
      size="2"><sup>&reg;</sup></font>, Ethicon, Norderstedt,
      Germany) maintained under mild tension (Fig. 3) Finally,
      dextpanthenol ointment (Bepanthen Roche<font
      size="2"><sup>&reg;</sup></font>, Hoffman-La Roche,
      Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) is applied directly on the glans
      before the foreskin is returned to its normal anatomical
      position. This ointment application prevents the formation of
      new adhesions, between the glans and the inner preputium,
      that may be produced by fibrin secretion resulting from
      micro-traumatic adhesiolysis caused by the mosquito
      clamp.</p>

      <p>Results</p>

      <p align="justify">Dorsal relieving incision is a simple and
      minimally invasive procedure for the surgical management of
      non-retractile foreskin. Postoperative pain was mild and the
      majority of patients did not require any strong analgesics.
      Acetominophen as adequate for the postoperative pain
      management. Since 1994, this operation has been prefromed as
      an ambulatory procedure with local anesthetic blocks (dorsal
      nerve) considerably relieving the early postoperative
      pain.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font>
      There were no immediate post-operative complications, but
      minimal to mild edema was observed in 40 patients (1.8%) and
      two boys had mild bleeding. The follow-up period was 1-7
      years (mean 4.2 years). Recurrence was seen in 18 patients
      (0.8%) and cosmetically unacceptable foreskin due to long
      incisions was documented in 6 patients (0.27%). There were no
      other complaints about the esthetic results of this procedure
      (Fig. 4).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      the 284 patients where it was possible to relieve the
      non-retractile foreskin by simple preputial adhesiolysis as
      well as those patients managed with dorsal relieving
      incision, we encouraged application of dexpanthenol ointment
      after a 10 min 'sitz' bath followed by regular retraction one
      daily for a ten day period to prevent the formation of
      adhesions. On the other hand, mild to severe edema in 28
      patients (38.4%), mild bleeding in 5 patients (6.8%),
      administration of strong analgesics (Pethedine) in 5 patients
      (Pethedine) in 5 patients and longer hospital stay (2 days)
      in 14 patients (19.2%) in 14 patients (19.2%) were observed
      in our series with patients who had undergone circumcision.
      Two patients returned to the operation room for revision
      after bleeding.</p>

      <p>Discussion</p>

      <p align="justify">Over the years, surgeons have attempted to
      deal with the problem of non-retractile foreskin by devising
      a variety of prepuce-sparing operations with the intention of
      easy retraction using minimum surgical intervention. These
      procedures ranged from <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/he-zhou/">balloon
      dilation</a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> to simple dorsal slit,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> Z-plasty,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/hoffman/">multiple Y-V
      plasties</a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> and full dorsal slit. The
      dorsal relieving incision practised at our center is a simple
      procedure of minimal surgical intervention with satisfactory
      results and a lower rate of complication. A <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/wahlin/">triple incision
      plasty</a> described by Wahlin claimed to have better
      esthetic results than single incision plasty, but this
      procedure was associated with a higher rate of complication
      and the series reported was rather small.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></font> Furthermore,
      we would agree with Holmland that a limited dorsal incision
      is sufficient to divide the fibrous ring.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> Our
      experience also shows that excessive manipulation of the
      foreskin during surgery almost always leads to postoperative
      edema, and minimal or adequate dorsal incisions of 3-4 mm are
      generally sufficient to relieve the constriction and produce
      satisfactory esthetic results. All prepuce-sparing procedures
      employed to date are reported to be less traumatic when
      compared with circumcision. This was evident in our series,
      as we had fewer complications associated with dorsal
      relieving incision in comparison to circumcision (edema 1.8%
      versus 38.4 percent and bleeding 0.1% versus 6.8%).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
      of the boys were referred to our center by pediatricians and
      59.5% were operated only after previous attempts to treat
      with non-steroidal ointments, hCG, or corticosteroid creams
      had failed. In 18.2% of patients, the type of cream used in
      the conservative treatment was not known. In the local
      population, since it is considered important to preserve the
      foreskin, this ambulatory procedure has gained acceptance by
      the referring pediatrician and the parents. All the parents
      were informed about the two procedures and social demand was
      the major consideration for them to opt for the dorsal
      incision procedure. Also, a high standard of hygiene in the
      local population and regular retraction of the foreskin
      during bathing is responsible for the reduced risk for both
      phimosis and balanitis after the prepuce sparing
      procedure.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
      retrospective analysis of our 18 patients with recurrent
      non-retractile foreskin after dorsal relieving incision
      procedures, we conclude the main reasons for recurrence are
      (i) incomplete division of the fibrous ring; (ii) longer
      dorsal incision that leads to larger scar formation; (iii)
      disproportional incision of the inner or outer preputial
      layer; (iv) improper transverse suture adaptation; or (v)
      fibrinous adhesion due to (a) inadequate postoperative
      retraction and (b) no ointment application between glans and
      prepuce. Satisfactory esthetic results of dorsal relieving
      incision along with this procedure being performed as a
      day-case have rendered this technique widely acceptable by
      parents, pediatricians and, most of all, school-age
      children.</p>
