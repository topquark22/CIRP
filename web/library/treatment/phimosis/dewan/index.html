      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Circumcision has been the traditional
        treatment for phimosis, but now is not the only management
        option, the best of which appears to be topical steroid
        application. Importantly, the literature suggests that
        phimosis is over-diagnosed, indicating that a prospective,
        randomized controlled study is needed to compare the
        non-circumcision options. Such a study would require
        consensus on the diagnostic criteria for phimosis;
        therefore, a more exacting definition would be needed and
        is suggested. Despite the non-controlled data on medical
        treatment of true phimosis, there seems little doubt that
        surgical intervention is not needed for all male infants
        with adherence of the foreskin to the glans, a
        non-retractable foreskin or, indeed true phimosis.</p>

        <p><b>Key words:</b> betamethasone; circumcision; foreskin,
        hydrocortisone, phimosis.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is thought that the prepuce is a vestigial structure
      that, at birth, is nearly always adherent to the glans and is
      non- retractable.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> This is the
      result of there being a common layer of squamous epithelium
      between the glans and the inner surface of the
      prepuce.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Thus, the foreskin
      completely clothes the glans during the years the child is
      incontinent, protecting the glans against injury by
      minimizing contact with sodden clothes or nappies.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, only one in
      seven males is circumcised,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> a
      rate which varies from country to country. In Australia and
      Canada, 40% of boys are circumcised, 80% in the United States
      of America and only 6% in the United Kingdom.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Non-surgical indications are common
      and include religious, cultural and social reasons. Thus it
      is not surprising that circumcision is the oldest and most
      widely performed operation in he world.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> However, the circumcision rate in
      Australia has declined over the last decade, partly due to
      the statements by the American Academy of Paediatrics and the
      Australian College of Paediatrics that routine neonatal
      circumcision is not medically indicated.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> This is supported by Metcalf <i>et
      al</i>. who argued that good penile hygiene offers all the
      advantages of routine circumcision without the risks
      associated with the surgical procedures.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> As a result, circumcision for
      non-medical reasons, other than religious reasons, is not
      encouraged.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> exceptions include
      recurrent balanitis and paraphimosis which are considered
      relative indications, and balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)
      which is usually regarded as an absolute indication.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,6</a></sup> The most common stated medical
      indication for circumcision is phimosis; however, the
      definition of this condition is obscure in most
      publications.<br />
      </p>

      <h4>DEFINING PHIMOSIS</h4>

      <p>The normal prepuce gradually becomes detached from the
      glans, and thus retractable, as keratinization of the
      epithelial layers occurs, aided by smegma, which helps to
      dissect the space between the glans and the foreskin,
      preventing re-adherence.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      Gairdner<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and
      &Oslash;ster<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> found that the
      prepuce is retractable in only 4% of newborn males, 20% at
      age 6 months, 50% at 3 years and 99% at 17 years of age.
      Therefore a certain proportion of any age group have a
      non-retractable foreskin, especially before 2 years of
      age.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Little is known or written
      about the etiology of true phimosis, despite the supposed
      frequency of phimosis varying from 4 to 10%.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his textbook in
      1948, Winsbery-White defined phimosis as the congenital or
      acquired narrowing of the preputial opening, characterized by
      a non-retractable foreskin without adherence, which can lead
      to accumulation of secretions under the foreskin resulting in
      irritation and balanitis. Interference with micturition can
      subsequently cause back-pressure on the bladder, ureters and
      kidneys.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more precise,
      practical guide to the difference between a non-retractable
      and a phimotic foreskin is as follows; when the normal but
      non-retractable infant foreskin is examined, attempted gentle
      retraction results in the distal part of the foreskin
      pouting, and the narrow portion is proximal to the tip of the
      prepuce (Fig. 1). Forced retraction of such a foreskin can
      result in splitting as is well demonstrated in the figure
      presented by Stenram <i>et al</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> In contrast, true phimosis produces
      a coneshaped foreskin during the same gentle retraction
      manoeuvre, with a fibrotic, circular band that forms the most
      distal and narrowest part of the prepuce (Fig. 2). Minor
      narrowing of a retractable foreskin, which does not split
      during attempted complete retraction, probably does not
      require intervention (Fig. 3).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusion about the
      definition of true phimosis is highlighted by the study of
      Griffiths and Frank, who found that of 128 boys with a
      medical reason for referral to a paediatric urologist for
      circumcision, only 30 had true phimosis (although they did
      not give an exacting definition). They suggested that
      ballooning and non-retractability is often over interpreted.
      In some cases, the referring practitioner may have used the
      term `phimosis' to facilitate referral, thus further
      confusing the debate on the appropriate management of
      phimosis.</p>

      foreskin in the neutral position. (b) A lateral view showing
      the narrow portion proximal to the tip of the
      prepuce."</font><br />
       &nbsp; 

      <h4>CONSEQUENCES OF PHIMOSIS</h4>

      <p>In 100 cases of balanitis, <a
      href="/library/disease/balanitis/escala1/">Escala and
      Rickwood</a> recorded recurrent attacks in only 36%, leading
      them to suggest that circumcision was indicated only in
      recurrent cases.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Also, they
      reported that, while 4% of boys will develop balanitis, only
      1% have true phimosis.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phimosis in the short
      term can cause ballooning during micturition, discomfort with
      voiding, infection, and pain on erection. In the long term,
      renal damage and BXO can occur, and carcinoma of the penis
      has been thought to be more common when phimosis is present.
      Poyter and Levy stated that BXO can develop at any age and
      appears to have little relationship to circumcision
      status;<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> in appears, however,
      to be rare in boys aged less than 5 years and cure is often
      affected by circumcision of a phimotic foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15,16</a></sup>. In examining multiple
      circumcision and postmortem specimens Reddy <i>et al</i>.
      suggested that a non-phimotic foreskin in conjunction with
      regular hygiene had no increased risk of penile
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Further arguments
      against circumcision for the prevention of carcinoma of the
      penis are given in two recent letters in the Canadian
      literature,<sup><a href="#n18">18,19</a></sup> emphasizing
      the rarity of penile cancer.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision is
      considered by many to be the least problematic alternative
      way of managing the foreskin. This view is not supported by
      an 8 year longitudinal study of over 500 boys in New Zealand;
      penile problems occurred in 11.1% of uncircumcised and 18.8%
      of the circumcised boys.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

       &nbsp; 

      <h4>TECHNIQUES OF PHIMOSIS MANAGEMENT</h4>

      <p><b>Operative</b></p>

      <p>A number of studies have looked at different ways of
      managing the foreskin surgically, including routine
      circumcision, sutureless circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> modifications of
      preputial-plasty,<sup><a href="#n22">22-24</a></sup> dilation
      with a balloon,<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> or artery
      forceps<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> and forced retraction
      with a local, general or no anaesthetic.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27-29</a></sup> Unfortunately, none of these
      studies have been prospective randomized trials.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of
      circumcisions in America are carried out as a neonatal
      procedure, prior to discharge from the maternity ward. In a
      10 year review of circumcision on 5521 of 5882 male infants
      from 1963 to 1972, Gee and Ansell recorded the treatment
      outcome for a group circumcised either with a Plastibell or
      the Gomco device.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup>
      Complications included a 1% haemorrhage rate and less than 1%
      other complications.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> In
      contrast, <a href="/library/complications/persad/">Persad
      <i>et al</i></a>. found an 8% meatal stenosis rate with the
      operation performed before 1 month of age.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> Overall complication rates range
      from 0.2 to 0.6%, reaching 35% if minor complications are
      also considered.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Some of these
      include ulceration of the meatus, infection (local and
      systemic), haemorrhage, removal of excessive or inadequate
      amount of skin, wound dehiscence, electrocautery damage to
      the penis, partial amputation and complications from
      anaesthesia.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3,11,32,33</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Non-operative</b></p>

      <p>Steroid cream is a painless, less complicated and more
      economical alternative to circumcision for the treatment of
      phimosis. Wright had a success rate of 80% (89 of 111 boys)
      using 0.05% betamethasone.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup>
      Kikiros <i>et al</i>. reported an improvement in 33 of 42
      boys (78%) with 0.05% betamethasone, and in 18 of 21 boys
      (86%) with hydrocortisone, but they considered that the
      betamethasone worked more quickly.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Another steroid cream, 0.05%
      clobetasol propionate, has also been used successfully by
      (70%, 54 boys) by J&oslash;rgersen and Svensson.<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a retrospective
      study of 20 boys with phimosis diagnosed according to the
      more vigorous definition given earlier and treated earlier,
      we found 13 (65%) had resolution of their phimosis and
      retained their foreskin (unpubl. data). Most required only 1%
      hydrocortisone cream three times each day for 6 weeks,
      although some required a second course, and one required a
      course of betamethasone cream when the standard first
      hydrocortisone course failed. All boys were reviewed at least
      2 weeks after the cessation of the steroid cream, making
      subsequent retraction unlikely. Failure may have occurred in
      some because they had not understood that the foreskin should
      be `unrolled' to reveal the narrow portion before the cream
      was applied. In those who failed, or in whom their was a
      recurrence, the foreskin was treated with 0.05% betamethasone
      which, subjectively, seemed more effective.</p>

      <p>We concur with the view that BXO does not respond to
      topical steroid treatment,<sup><a href="#n3">3,34</a></sup>
      and that circumcision is indicated.</p>

       &nbsp; 

      <h4>ACTION OF TOPICAL STEROIDS</h4>

      <p>There may be two possible mechanisms involved in the
      action of steroid cream resulting in the resolution of
      phimosis. First there is an anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive effect. According to Kragballe,
      corticosteroids stimulate the production of
      lipocortin.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> The lipocortin
      formed inhibits the activity of phospholipase A2, which
      releases arachidonic acid, the precursor of prostanoids and
      leukotrienes (mediators of skin inflammation), from
      phospholipid.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> Corticosteroids
      also inhibit the mRNA responsible for interleukin-1 formation
      and several types of T lymphocyte activities, including
      interleukin-2 production and mitogen-induced T-cell
      proliferation.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> These actions
      of corticosteroids on arachidonic acid metabolism and
      interleukin-1 formation produce the anti-inflammatory and
      immuno-suppressive effects. Corticosteroids not only inhibit
      the early phenomena of then inflammatory process (oedema),
      fibrin deposition, capiliary dilation, migration of
      leucocytes into the inflamed area and phagocytic activity)
      but also its later manifestations (proliferation of
      capillaries and fibroblasts, depletion of collagen and
      cicatrization).<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a
      skin thinning effect. Steroids inhibit the dermal synthesis
      of glycosaminoglycans (especially hyaluronic acid) by
      fibroblasts, resulting in the loss of ground substance
      secondary to decreased binding of tissue fluid to the
      hyaluronic acid.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup>
      Consequently, the dermal extracellular matrix is reduced and
      collagen and elastin fibres become tightly packed and
      rearranged. Steroids also bind to intracellular receptor
      proteins in fibroblasts, which are involved in the control of
      the cell growth and specifically in the inhibition of
      collagen sythesis.<sup><a href="#n39">39,40</a></sup> In
      addition, steroids have anti/proliferative effects on the
      epidermis, resulting in a thin epidermis with virtual
      deletion of the stratum corneum.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed recurrence of
      phimosis after topical steroid treatment may result from the
      rebound phenomenon described by Lehmann <i>et al</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> After prolonged steroid application,
      the horny layer is reduced severely and rehydration of the
      tissue unlying this functionally defective barrier probably
      contributes to the rebound dermatitis and epidermal
      thickening. This mechanism does not seem to play a part in
      phimosis recurrence, but the transient nature of the
      inhibition of proliferation of cultured human skin
      fibroblasts<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> and the observed
      cutaneous restitution of the epidermis and dermis within 14
      days after the termination of steroid treatment may play a
      part.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> The knowledge of this
      rebound effect makes it important to commence retraction of
      the foreskin a number of times each day, once the phimosis
      has resolved.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>SUMMARY</h4>

      <p>Effective steroid treatment of phimosis is becoming
      increasingly important. <span class="yellow">First, the
      majority of boys are now uncircumcised, with the
      uncircumcised state becoming the accepted norm.</span>
      Second, in the current economic climate of finite health
      dollars, the cost savings for steroid treatment should be
      considered. Third, steroid treatment does not appear to have
      significant complications and is painless. From the published
      results thus far 0.05% betamethasone cream appears to be more
      effective than 1% hydrocortisone. It would appear that
      regular retraction of the foreskin is necessary after initial
      success has been achieved and circumcision seems to be
      indicated when topical steroid treatment fails. However, a
      double blind randomized control study of different steroids
      and placebo is needed to assess the relative effectiveness of
      each of the steroid options. Long-term follow up is needed to
      assess the recurrence risk, a view supported by
      others.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> Further research to
      elucidate the mechanism of corticosteroid action on the
      foreskin would also be appropriate.<br />
