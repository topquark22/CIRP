      ABSTRACT 

      <p><b>Purpose:</b> Topical steroids have been advocated as an
      effective economical alternative to circumcision in boys with
      phimosis. We evaluated the effectiveness of topical steroid
      therapy as primary treatment in 194 patients with
      phimosis.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> Between January 1996 and November 2000,
      228 boys 16 years old or younger were referred for
      consideration of circumcision. When intervention was
      determined to be necessary, a 6-week course of topical
      steroids was used as primary treatment. Efficacy of treatment
      was evaluated at 3 months from initiation of therapy.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Of the 228 patients 15 had such a mild
      degree of phimosis that no intervention was believed to be
      necessary, 19 were scheduled directly for circumcision due to
      cosmetic reasons, parent wishes, or severe phimosis with
      associated voiding problems and the remaining 194 received
      topical steroids as primary treatment. Of these 194 patients
      25 had coexisting balanitis and 4 had a history of urinary
      tract infection. Conservative treatment was successful in
      87%, 88% and 75% of patients with phimosis alone, coexisting
      balanitis and history of urinary tract infection,
      respectively. Overall, circumcision was avoided in 87% of
      patients treated with topical steroids.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <span class="yellow">Topical steroids
      are becoming the standard conservative measure for treating
      phimosis.</span> Our study supports this trend, with an
      overall efficacy of 87%.</p>

      <p><b>Review:</b></p>

      <p>Although neonatal circumcision has been a standard
      practice in North America for many years, the incidence has
      been declining over the past decade. This change has created
      a new set of problems for primary healthcare givers and
      urologists who must treat foreskin problems associated with
      the uncircumcised penis. The traditional approach for
      managing phimosis and other associated problems has been
      circumcision under general anesthesia. This procedure has
      become less acceptable, as the same population that has
      elected to not circumcise their infants have similar
      objections to childhood circumcision for "minor" or transient
      foreskin problems.</p>

      <p>This report examines the success of topical steroid
      treatment in 194 patients that were referred for circumcision
      because of persistent phimosis, balanitis, urinary tract
      infection, or for cosmetic reasons. Betamethasone ointment
      (0.1%) was applied to the foreskin twice a day for up to 6
      weeks. No adverse reactions to the steroid cream were cited.
      After 3 months follow-up, the degree of phimosis was either
      insignificant or had resolved completely in 87%, and only 13%
      of the patients eventually required circumcision. Prior
      balanitis or urinary tract infection did not affect the
      outcome of the steroid therapy.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">This report is another study that
      demonstrates the success of topical steroid therapy in an
      effort to avoid circumcision under anesthesia in older
      children.</span> This article is an important contribution,
      as it is a report from a North American institution, where
      the threshold to proceed to circumcision has historically
      been lower than other countries, where the parent's desire to
      avoid late circumcision could potentially overstate the
      outcome or benefits of the topical steroid therapy. This
      therapy could also be applied to other foreskin problems such
      as persistent penile adhesions with similar expected
      results.</p>
