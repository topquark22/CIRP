      <p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Circumcision has been the traditional
      treatment for phimosis. Recent reports of medical management
      of phimosis with topical steroids quote success rates of
      67%-95%. We present our results with topical steroid therapy
      for treatment of phimosis.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> Retrospective review of 69
      boys between the age of 3 and 13 years (average 7.4) who were
      referred to Urology clinic over a one year period (August
      1999-2000) with phimosis. Boys without a distal preputial
      ring were excluded. A course of triamcinolone cream was
      prescribed and parents/patients were instructed to apply it
      to the preputial outlet twice daily for one month. Six weeks
      after treatment initiation patients were reassessed. Results
      were classified as follows: Full retraction (FR)-entire glans
      and coronal margin seen, Moderate retraction (MR)-proximal
      glans seen, residual preputial adhesions, Partial retraction
      (PR)-distal glans and meatus seen, and Failure (F)-no change.
      FR, MR, and PR were considered successful outcomes.
      Statistical analysis was performed with Splus software using
      the prop.test and ordinal logistic regression procedures.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Follow-up ranged from 1-12 months, and 8
      patients were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 61 boys,
      82% (12 FR, 26 MR, 12 PR) were successfully managed with
      topical steroid (95% confidence interval: 69%-90%). Scarring
      on examination was observed to negatively impact outcome (92%
      versus 67%) and was statistically significant using ordinal
      logistic regression (Chisquare test=4.48, p-value=0.034). Two
      boys with severe balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) and two
      boys with buried penis and penoscrotal webbing failed
      treatment and required surgery. There was an association
      noted between older age and poorer outcome but this was not
      statistically significant. There were no local or systemic
      side effects noted.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Local application of steroid cream to
      the phimotic foreskin may allow some degree of retraction and
      avert the need for circumcision. Although the length of
      follow-up is insufficient to decree ultimate success, topical
      steroid appears to be a safe and effective treatment for boys
      over three years of age with evidence of a tight preputial
      ring. Boys with severe BXO or buried penis and penoscrotal
      webbing should be considered primarily for surgery.</p>
