      <p class="text1"><b>A retrospective study was conducted of 92

      </b></p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text1">It is perhaps surprising that a surgical
      procedure with a history extending back almost 4000 years can
      still be a subject of controversy, yet this is true of
      circumcision in childhood. Fibrous stenosis of the preputial
      orifice remains a clear indication for circumcision, but this
      is not a common problem in the first decade of life. In this
      age group, a foreskin which cannot be retracted over the
      glans is more often due to a delay in the natural process by
      which these structures become separate and it is not
      necessarily a pathological condition.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> None the less, it may by associated
      with urinary symptoms or attacks of balanoposthitis, which
      may be aggravated by the process of separation itself.
      Excision of the foreskin because it has not yet become
      detached from the glans is a radical measure, though it is
      common for boys to be referred with this request.</p>

      <p class="text2">Acceleration of the natural processes by
      formally retracting the prepuce under general anaesthesia is
      a logical approach to the problem of symptoms due to a
      non-retractable, non-fibrosed foreskin in childhood. Review
      of the world literature over the past decade, however,
      yielded only one reference to the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> We have reviewed the experience of
      surgeons at this hospital in the use of the technique and
      results over the past six years.</p>

      <p><b>Patients and methods</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Between January 1976 and March 1982, 106
      boys underwent retraction of their foreskin under general
      anaesthesia. Of these, 93 had presented with symptoms and 13
      had been referred because of non-retractable foreskins alone
      (see table).</p>

      <p class="text2">Retraction was performed at ages ranging
      from 6 months to 11 years 11 months (mean 4 years 9 months).
      Adhesions between prepuce and glans were separated carefully
      by means of traction using a gauze swab or by gentle sweeping
      with a probe. Collections of desquamated material were
      removed from the subpreputial space and petroleum jelly
      applied. In 10 cases the prepuce was stretched with forceps.
      In many cases parents were asked to retract their child's
      foreskin and apply petroleum jelly daily for a week after the
      operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">From a review of the case records 13 boys
      were found to have been circumcised at a later stage.
      Information of 78 of the remaining patients was obtained at a
      review clinic (54), by questionnaires to the parents (14), or
      by letter from their general practitioner (10). Questions
      were asked about the outcome of the procedure and a gentle
      attempt made to retract the foreskin. Fifteen boys were lost
      to follow-up.</p>

      <p class="text2">For comparison, the complications occurring
      after 100 circumcisions selected at random from those
      performed in 1980 were reviewed retrospectively. The
      indications for circumcision were non-retractable foreskin,
      balanoposthitis, urinary symptoms, and phimosis. The median
      age at operation was 4 years eleven months. The technique
      used was excision of the foreskin and wound closure with
      interrupted absorbable sutures.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The table gives the outcome of the procedure
      in relation to the presenting features. Of the 79 boys with
      symptoms, 67 (85%) had obtained relief. Information on
      retractablity of the foreskin was obtained in 73 boys, and in
      45 (62%) of these it was fully retractable in 19 of the 28
      patients whose prepuce remained incompletely retractable
      symptoms had been improved by the procedure; nine of these 28
      boys were later circumcised. Five of the eight boys examined
      who had presented with a non-retractable foreskin alone still
      exhibited some degree of this, and two were circumcised as a
      result. None developed symptoms consequent on retraction. The
      age at operation had no clear effect on the outcome. The
      follow-up interval ranged from one month to six years and one
      month, with a mean of one year seven months.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">Altogether 13 boys were circumcised. In 12
      cases the result of retraction was considered to be
      unsatisfactory due either to symptomatic recurrence (eight
      cases) or to persistent non-retractablity of the foreskin
      (four). The remaining child had a redundant dorsal prepuce
      associated with coronal hypospadias but had had a perfect
      result for retraction. The mean age at circumcision of the 12
      "failures" was 5 years 10 months, and the mean interval since
      retraction was 11 months.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of 100 boys undergoing primary circumcision,
      seven had troublesome complications; two children required
      reoperation to arrest haemorrhage from the wound, four
      developed wound infection, and one had severe dysuria
      associated with a meatal ulcer.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The work of Gairdner<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> and &Oslash;ster<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> has resulted in a clearer
      understanding of the normal development of the foreskin. A
      common layer of squamous epithelium between the glans and the
      deep surface of the prepuce is the reason why 96% of male
      neonates have a non-retractable foreskin. As keratinisation
      of the epithelial layer occurs, the prepuce gradually becomes
      detached from the glans and retractable over it. This process
      has been completed by the age of 5 in 90% of boys.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: This article represents an
      early attempt to avoid unnecessary post-neonatal circumcision
      of boys. Even so, the authors have accepted Gairdner's
      inaccurate values while citing &Oslash;ster who provides
      accurate values and contradicts Gairdner. Many of these boys
      were quite young. Had they been left alone, their prepuces
      would have matured normally and spontaneously become
      retractable without medical or surgical intervention.<br />
      <br />
       Ballooning and retention of sub-preputial smegma are now
      known to be normal in boys. Neither is an indication for
      treatment.]</p>

      <p class="text2">The term phimosis (Greek: "muzzled") may,
      semantically be used to describe either the normal state of
      non-separation of the prepuce from the glans or fibrous
      stenosis of the preputial orifice, but this leaves ambiguity.
      We prefer to use the "non-retractable foreskin" for the
      former state and "phimosis" for the latter, which we regard
      as pathological and relatively uncommon. Some boys are
      referred for a surgical opinion simply because they have a
      non-retractable prepuce, but most have associated symptoms.
      We believe that the process of natural separation of the
      foreskin itself plays a part in the genesis of pain and
      inflammation by exposing incompletely epithelialized surfaces
      to the urine and bacterially populated smegma. Ballooning of
      the foreskin during micturition has been attributed to
      malalignment of the external urethral meatus and the
      preputial orifice<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and may arise
      solely because of the length and laxity of the foreskin. When
      phimosis is not present, retraction of the foreskin under
      anaesthesia is a logical means of relieving symptoms, yet it
      receives little attention in the standard textbooks of
      paediatric surgery; in our series 67 out of 79 patients with
      symptoms (85%) benefited from it.</p>

      <p class="text2">The best way to differentiate a
      non-retractable from a phimotic foreskin is to draw it
      anteriorly away from the glans, as suggested by
      Spence.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> In almost every case
      this shows an adequate preputial orifice. If symptoms are
      mild the parents are reassured with an explanation of normal
      development. and the child kept under review to allow natural
      separation of the foreskin, failing which retraction under
      anaesthesia at about 5 years of age is advised. We believe
      that a case can also be made for therapeutic retraction in an
      asymptomatic child of 5 years or more in that it facilitates
      bathing of the area.</p>

      <p class="text2">The procedure requires only brief admission
      to hospital and causes very little discomfort. Gentleness is
      important, and stretching of the prepuce is unnecessary and
      possibly harmful. Applying petroleum jelly may relieve
      immediate postoperative discomfort and lessen the chance of
      readhesion, but some parents find this difficult and
      distasteful.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision in childhood carries a risk of
      complications: <i>Index Medicus</i> has listed 21 case
      reports in English of the more exotic post-circumcision
      problems over the past decade but we were unable to find a
      recently published series of circumcisions with which to
      compare results. Complications disrupted the convelescence of
      seven patients in our review of 100 cases. Unless the need
      for circumcision subsequent to retraction is attributed to
      this procedure, therapeutic retraction of the foreskin was
      without complication.</p>

      <p class="text2">In conclusion, retraction of the foreskin
      under general anaesthesia is a simple and effective
      alternative to circumcision in most boys with symptoms due to
      a non-retractable prepuce. We recommend its wider use.</p>
