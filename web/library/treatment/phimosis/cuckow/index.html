       A Good Alternative to Circumcision</h1>

      <p>Since 1991, boys needing surgery for tight nonretractile
      foreskin have been offered a choice of preputial plasty or
      circumcision, providing that there is no clinical evidence of
      preputial scarring. We compared two similar groups of 50 boys
      that underwent each procedure, through our routine audit and
      questionnaires sent to their parents. Of the boys with
      circumcisions, 20% required an overnight stay after the
      operation; 14% had anesthetic complications, and 6% required
      reoperation because of bleeding. Only 8% of patients with
      preputial plasty had an overnight stay, and no bleeding was
      observed. <span class="yellow">Parental assessment of both
      operations showed that morbidity was significantly less and
      of shorter duration for the preputial plasty group.</span>
      Two patients in the preputial plasty group (4%) had recurrent
      narrowing of the foreskin caused by scarring and contraction
      of the incision. Parents were pleased with the long-term
      results of both procedures. This simple alternative to
      circumcision is easy to perform and allows full mobilization
      of the foreskin, preserving its function and providing an
      excellent cosmetic result.<br />

      <p>Treatment for the complications of a tight nonretractile
      foreskin in British boys is almost exclusively circumcision.
      With this radical approach, some patients experience
      postoperative complications and have poor cosmetic results.
      <span class="yellow">Moreover, the normal protective and
      sexual functions of the foreskin are lost, and irreversible
      changes occur in the epithelium of the glans.</span> Less
      radical approaches have failed to gain general acceptance
      because of their often complex and specialized nature or
      allegedly poor cosmetic results. A small number of our
      patients, in whom scarring of the prepuce has occurred
      because of recurrent infection or, rarely, from balanitis
      xerotica et obliterans, are always treated by circumcision.
      The parents of the remainder have been given a choice between
      circumcision and a conservative technique - preputial plasty.
      This policy has enabled the study and comparison of two
      similar groups of patients.</p>

      <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>

      <p>The technique of preputial plasty is illustrated in <a
      href="#fig1">Fig 1</a>. The foreskin is mobilized, dividing
      glanular adhesions, and retracted to show the tight
      constricting band. This is incised longitudinally, along the
      dorsum of the penis. The underlying tissue is spread with
      artery forceps to expose Bucks' fascia, and the incision is
      closed transversely with absorbable sutures. This widens the
      tube of the prepuce and allows its free movement. Apart from
      lignocaine gel applied to the glans and suture line, no other
      local anesthetic is used. Parents are advised to mobilize the
      foreskin regularly, once the initial discomfort has subsided.
      A standard technique is used for circumcision, and these
      patients are given either a caudal or penile local anesthetic
      block. All operations were performed or directly supervised
      by a senior surgeon, and all patients had follow-up in the
      outpatient department, between 4 and 6 weeks after
      surgery.</p>

      </center>

      <p>The results of the first 50 patients undergoing each
      procedure were reviewed retrospectively. There was no
      significant difference in age distribution between the two
      groups (range, 19 months to 12.3 years for preputial plasty,
      and 2.7 to 14.2 years for circumcision; mean 6.34 years and
      6.63 years, respectively). The distribution of in patient and
      day surgery cases was also similar (38% and 62% for preputial
      plasty, 40% and 60% for circumcision). Data from the
      department's clinical audit database and outpatient follow-up
      clinics provided objective information about postoperative
      complications. More information regarding operative morbidity
      and patient satisfaction was obtained by sending a
      questionnaire to all parents, who were asked to answer
      questions by selecting from graded responses. There was also
      the opportunity for more detailed description of problems and
      further follow-up in the clinic, if desired. Forty completed
      questionnaires were received from the preputial plasty group
      (80%) and 38 from the circumcision group (76%). The data
      obtained were analyzed and expressed as percentages to enable
      direct comparisons between the two groups.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p>The reported surgical complications are listed in <a
      href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. Our normal practice is to discharge
      patients the evening after their surgery. Twenty percent of
      those who underwent circumcision required an overnight stay
      because of bleeding or anesthetic complications (nausea,
      vomiting, drowsiness) compared with 8% in the preputial
      plasty group. Interestingly, there were no overnight
      admissions from the day surgical unit during the study
      period, and no patient required catheterization for urinary
      retention. Infection or inflammation of the penis seen in
      outpatients, and presenting as gross preputial edema in one
      patient after preputial plasty, was treated by bathing in
      aqueous chlorhexidine solution. Recurrent adhesions were
      divided in the clinic, using topical lignocaine. Two patients
      who did not attempt foreskin mobilization after preputial
      plasty (4%) had recurrent narrowing of the foreskin, which
      resulted from scarring and contraction of the incision. Both
      were offered circumcision. Poor cosmetic results were due to
      an excess of mucosa (two circumcisions) or scarring (one
      preputial plasty).</p>

      Over the next month, patients with preputial plasty suffered
      less discomfort than those with circumcision, manifested by
      an earlier return to wearing normal underwear <a
      href="#tab3">(Table 3)</a>. The majority could mobilize their
      foreskin freely without discomfort soon after surgery (2.5%
      within 2 days, 52% within 1 week, and 87.5% within 2 weeks).
      All parents were satisfied with the final result of their
      son's operation. Preputial plasties were judged excellent in
      57.5%, good in 27.5%, and acceptable in 15%. Circumcisions
      were judged excellent in 47.5%, good in 42%, and acceptable
      in 10.5%. When asked to assess the cosmetic appearance of
      their son's penis, parents noted <i>normal</i> in 70%,
      <i>acceptable</i> in 25%, and <i>slightly scarred</i> in 5%
      of preputial plasties. Parents of circumcised boys reported

      <h2><br />
       Discussion</h2>

      <p><span class="yellow">Circumcision is associated with
      considerable morbidity.</span> It is often performed by
      unsupervised junior surgeons in district hospitals, and the
      actual complication rate may be much higher than that
      reported from specialized pediatric centers <a
      href="#ref1">[1]</a>, <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. There is no
      doubt that far too many patients are referred for
      circumcision because of a lack of understanding of normal
      preputial development <a href="#ref3">[3-5]</a>. However,
      even when strict criteria are adopted, many tight unscarred
      prepuces are still subjected to circumcision on medical
      grounds or because of parental pressure <a
      href="#ref6">[6]</a>. Although the clinically scarred
      prepuce, because of recurrent infection or balanitis xerotica
      et obliterans <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>, represents an absolute
      indication for circumcision, the remainder are suitable for
      more conservative treatment.</p>

      <p>Several alternatives to circumcision have been proposed,
      all aimed at widening the prepuce to allow its easy
      retraction and better hygiene, while retaining the normal
      cosmetic appearance of the penis. These range from local
      resection of the phimotic ring <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/cuckow/#ref8">[8]</a> to
      more complex V-Y and Z plasties of the prepuce <a
      href="#ref9">[9-11]</a> and helicoid plasty <a
      href="#ref12">[12]</a>. Unfortunately, there is little
      objective data to support the claims of excellent results
      with these procedures, and no complication rates are
      reported. The complicated nature of many of these procedures
      has almost certainly limited their acceptance to enthusiasts
      and specialists in plastic surgery. Most recently, a
      technique of triple incision plasty was reported, together
      with the results of 63 cases <a href="#ref13">[13]</a>, one
      of which bled and four (6.3%) required reoperation.</p>

      <p>Preputial plasty by a single dorsal incision of the
      prepuce has already been described <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>,
      and is used widely throughout Europe <a
      href="#ref15">[15]</a>. Its simplicity and, in particular,
      the avoidance of the frenular area of the penis make it a
      quick, easy, and safe operation, with few complications even
      in inexperienced hands. In our study, its success is evident
      by the absence of serious bleeding problems, the improvement
      in post-operative morbidity, and the high level of patient
      satisfaction. The poor cosmetic results used to justify more
      complex procedures <a href="#ref13">[13]</a> are not borne
      out by our patients or by the long-term results observed in
      our clinic.</p>

      <p>Attention is now being given to the physiological role of
      the foreskin by groups in the United States that oppose
      circumcision <a href="#ref16">[16]</a>. <span
      class="yellow">It certainly protects the sensitive skin of
      the glans, provides additional lubrication, and allows
      greater freedom of movement during sexual intercourse.</span>
      Although meatal stenosis has not developed in any patient in
      the circumcision group, six patients have returned for
      meatoplasty in the past 2 years. Preputial plasty is a quick
      and safe method of preserving preputial function in patients
      needing surgical relief of a tight but unscarred foreskin.
      <span class="yellow">Compared with circumcision, preputial
      plasty has few complications, and functional and cosmetic
      results are good, providing the prepuce is mobilized
      regularly after surgery.</span></p>
