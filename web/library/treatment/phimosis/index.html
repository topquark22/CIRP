      <h1>Conservative Treatment of Phimosis:<br />
      Alternatives to Radical Circumcision</h1>

      <p>This page provides information on conservative treatments
      of foreskin problems such as phimosis and preputial stenosis.
      In accordance with standard medical ethics, these treatments
      avoid unnecessarily radical surgery, and preserve normal
      physiologic function of the patient's body.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Reports suggest that external
      irritants and other environmental factors may cause the
      foreskin to tighten. One such irritant that is suspected are
      the chemicals contained in bubble bath. Intact boys are urged
      to avoid the use of bubble bath. When tightness of a
      previously loose foreskin occurs (acquired phimosis),
      environmental factors and general state of health should be
      investigated before circumcision or conservative treatment is
      considered. For example, circulatory problems may cause edema
      of the prepuce and result in non-retractable foreskin.</p>
      <img alt="redline" src="/gif/hline.png" /> 

      <h2>What is "phimosis?"</h2>

      <h4><i>This section was written by pediatrician Robert Van
      Howe, MD, FAAP.</i></h4>

      <p>"Phimosis" is a vague term. In common usage, it usually
      means any condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot
      be retracted.</p>

      <p>Most infants are born with a foreskin that does not
      retract. <a href="/library/normal/"><strong>This is
      normal!</strong></a></p>

      <p>"True" phimosis&mdash;better termed "preputial stenosis,"
      because "phimosis" has so many different definitions it now
      is devoid of any useful meaning&mdash;occurs in less than 2%
      of intact males. The incidence of preputial stenosis in
      circumcised men is actually similar.</p>

      <p>Of these 2%, 85&ndash;95% will respond to topical
      steroids. Of those who fail this, at least 75% will respond
      to stretching under local anesthesia, either manually or with
      a balloon. The arithmetic is simple: At the very most 7 boys
      in 10,000 may need surgery for preputial stenosis. No wonder
      the Canadian Paediatric Society calls circumcision an
      "obsolete" procedure!</p>

      <p>There are several alternatives to radical circumcision
      which preserve the function of the prepuce and result in less
      morbidity (pain, bleeding, complications). The best article
      to check out is the 1994 piece by <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/cuckow/">Cuckow et al.</a>
      After all, why would you want to lose all of those <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Meissner corpuscles</a>, the
      same nerve complexes which provide fine touch to the
      fingertips?</p>
      <img alt="redline" src="/gif/hline.png" /> <a id="phony"
      name="phony"></a> 

      <h2>The ``Phony Phimosis Diagnosis''</h2>

      <p>The prepuce of boys may be tight until after
      puberty.<sup><a href="#n1">1,7,8</a></sup> This is an
      entirely normal condition and it is <b>not</b> phimosis.
      According to the experience in cultures where circumcision is
      uncommon, this tightness rarely requires treatment.
      Spontaneous loosening usually occurs with increasing
      maturity.<sup><a href="#n1">1,7,8</a></sup> One may expect 50
      percent of ten-year-old boys; 90 percent of 16-year-old boys;
      and 98-99 percent of 18 year-old males to have full
      retractable foreskin. Treatment is seldom necessary. If
      treatment should be necessary, it should not be done until
      after puberty and the male can weigh the therapeutic options
      and give informed consent.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p>It is important to note that the immature foreskin of a
      child <i>must not be forced back for "cleaning" or for any
      other reason,</i> because this will cause damage to the
      developing tissues. The child should be instructed that his
      foreskin will eventually retract. The first person to retract
      the foreskin should be the child himself.</p>

      <p>Rickwood and colleagues provide a specific medical
      definition of phimosis: True phimosis is tight
      non-retractable foreskin caused by <a
      href="/library/treatment/BXO/">Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans
      (BXO)</a> and is distingished by a whitish ring of hardened
      sclerotic skin at the tip of the prepuce.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,10</a></sup> Histologic examination by a
      pathologist is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> If BXO is not present, then true
      phimosis is not present.<sup><a href="#n2">2,10</a></sup></p>

      <p>A number of reports in the medical literature of the
      United Kingdom indicate that medical doctors are not trained
      to distinguish between normal developmental tight prepuce in
      boys and pathological phimosis.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,4,5,6,11</a></sup> This results in cases of
      misdiagnosis of normal developmental preputial tightness as
      pathological phimosis in the UK.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,4,5,6,11</a></sup></p>

      <p>CIRP has received numerous reports to indicate that normal
      preputial narrowness in boys in the United States is
      frequently being misdiagnosed as pathological phimosis. CIRP
      believes that the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/321/7264/792#EL1">situation
      in the United States</a> is certainly not better, and
      probably much worse, than the situation in the United
      Kingdom. Parents of intact boys are also frequently
      improperly instructed to force the immature foreskin back for
      cleaning, contrary to the <a
      href="/library/normal/aap/">recommendations</a> of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>

      <p>As a consequence of misdiagnosis and confusion of normal
      developmental narrowessness and non-retractablity with
      pathological phimosis, many unnecessary circumcisions are
      performed. Shankar and Rickwood found that the number of
      circumcisions being performed in the United Kingdom is 8
      times greater than the number required.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> The number of unnecessary
      circumcisions performed in the United States is unknown.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is now recommended <b>only</b> in confirmed
      cases of phimosis caused by <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/BXO/">balanitis
      xerotica obliterans</a> (BXO), however newer treatments may
      eliminate the need for circumcision. BXO is recognized by a
      hardened area of whitish skin near the tip of the foreskin
      which prevents retraction.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,9,10,11</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/shankar1/">Shankar and
      Rickwood</a> found a low incidence of only 0.4 of 1000 boys
      per year, and only 6 in 1000 by age 15.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> See <a
      href="/library/treatment/BXO/">Balanitis Xerotica
      Obliterans</a> for more information. Other cases of
      non-retractile foreskin respond to conservative,
      non-destructive, non-traumatic, less costly treatment.</p>

      <h2>Treatment of Phimosis</h2>

      <h3>Contemporary Medical and Surgical Treatment</h3>

      <p>Medical science has developed three classes of treatments
      other than radical circumcision for a narrow foreskin. The
      first treatment is medical by topical application of an
      ointment to the prepuce; the second is gradual stretching of
      the opening of the prepuce to make it wider; and the third is
      surgical reshaping of the prepuce opening to make it wider.
      The three treatments are discussed below.</p>

      <h4>Topical Medication</h4>

      <p>The 1990s have seen the advent of the use of topical
      steroidal and nonsteroidal medication for the treatment of
      narrow foreskins (phimosis) in boys. <span
      class="yellow">Topical steroid ointment is now the treatment
      of choice for phimosis, due to low morbidity, lack of pain or
      trauma, and low cost.</span></p>

      <p>Reports in the medical literature from Sweden, Norway,
      Denmark, Italy, France, Australia, Serbia, and the United
      States have demonstrated the efficacy of topical steroid
      ointment in the relief of preputial stenosis in boys. The
      application of steroid ointment to the foreskin has the
      effect of accelerating the normal growth and expansion of the
      foreskin that occurs over several years and which usually
      results in the spontaneous relief of the non-retractile
      condition. Narrow foreskins usually eventually widen without
      treatment.</p>

      <p>The treatment is non-surgical. There is no trauma and no
      surgical risk. The treatment is inexpensive. The foreskin and
      all of its protective, erogenous, sensory, and sexual
      physiologic functions are preserved. A success rate in the
      range of 85-95 per cent is reported. Treatment of narrow
      non-retractile prepuce with topical steroid ointment is now
      recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in its 1999
      <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">Circumcision Policy
      Statement</a>.</p>

      <p>CIRP presents a bibliography of the medical articles on
      the use of topical steroid ointment in the treatment of
      phimosis. Scientists in have conducted research in the use of
      topical steroid ointment in the medical (not-surgical)
      treatment of non-retractile foreskin. All have found that the
      medical treatment is safe, and has about an 85% success rate.
      <a href="/library/psych/yilmaz1/">Yilmaz <i>et al.</i></a>
      recommend the use of topical steroid ointment to avoid the
      anxiety, stress, and trauma caused by circumcision. Articles
      are listed in the approximate order of publication.</p>

      <h4>Dilation and Stretching</h4>

      <p>Skin that is under tension expands by growing additional
      cells. A permanent increase in size occurs by gentle
      stretching over a period of time. The treatment is
      non-traumatic and non-destructive. Manual stretching may be
      carried out without the aid of a medical doctor. The
      treatment is inexpensive. Relief of phimosis by a stretching
      technique has the advantage of preserving all foreskin tissue
      and the sexual pleasure nerves. The <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge2/">Beaug&eacute;
      method</a> has proved successful for many.</p>

      <h4>Conservative Surgical Alternatives</h4>

      <p><i>Preputioplasty</i> is the medical term for plastic
      surgery of the prepuce or foreskin. It is a more conservative
      alternative to the traditional circumcision or dorsal slit
      for the treatment of preputial stenosis or phimosis. Many
      doctors have proposed surgical alternatives to circumcision
      because of the many problems, risk, complications, and
      disadvantages inherent in circumcision.</p>

      <p>Advantages claimed for preputioplasty are more rapid, less
      painful recovery, significantly less morbidity, and
      preservation of <a href="/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/">the
      foreskin</a> and its various protective, erogenous, and
      sexual physiologic functions.</p>

      <p>There are a number of articles is the medical literature
      describing various preputioplasty techniques. CIRP presents
      below a bibliography of articles known to us (there may be
      others.) The articles are listed in the approximate order of
      their appearance.</p>

      <p>Some of the procedures such as Y- and V- plasties are
      complex and require a skilled surgeon to perform properly.
      Consequently, they have not won favor.</p>

      <p>Many doctors recommend the "dorsal slit with transverse
      closure" procedure described by <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/cuckow/">Cuckow, Rix, and
      Mouriquand</a>. The American Academy of Pediatrics now
      recommends the Cuckow procedure in its 1999 <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">Circumcision Policy
      Statement</a>. The procedure is relatively simple to perform
      and gives good results. The newer lateral procedure described
      by <a href="/library/treatment/phimosis/south1/">Lane et
      al.</a>, however, may offer a cosmetic improvement over the
      Cuckow procedure. It moves the "slit with tranverse closure"
      from the top to the sides.</p>

      <h3>Traditional treatment of phimosis in Western
      medicine</h3>

      <p>For many years, before modern methods had been developed,
      radical circumcision was the only treatment offered for tight
      foreskin. However, radical circumcision is now obsolete. It
      is more painful and has a more difficult recovery than the
      newer conservative treatments. Radical circumcision also
      destroys much functional tissue, results in severe loss of
      sexual sensation, and destroys normal male sexual-mechanical
      functioning. According to cost-benefit studies, radical
      circumcision is also the <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/102/4/e43"
      target="_blank">most expensive</a> method of treating tight
      foreskin, but is still promoted by many medical doctors.
      Holman and Steussi provide us with an excellent description
      of this traditional but outmoded procedure. Choe and Kim
      provide a description and images of the traditional
      procedure.</p>

      <h3>Paraphimosis</h3>
      <i>Paraphimosis</i> is the term used to describe the
      condition that occurs when a tight foreskin is <a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/6pam.pdf">forcibly
      prematurely retracted</a> and becomes trapped behind the head
      of the penis. <b>Forcible retraction of a tight foreskin
      should be avoided.</b> According to John P. Warren, MD,
      "Education concerning proper care of the prepuce is the most
      effective way of preventing paraphimosis from occurring."
      Parents, doctors, and other caregivers should be instructed
      to avoid forcible retraction of a boy's foreskin. Prolonged
      paraphimosis can become an emergency condition.<sup><a
      href="#pp1">1,3</a></sup> 

      <p>If this condition persists the tissue may become
      oedematous and swell thus further aggravating the
      problem.<sup><a href="#pp3">3</a></sup> First aid for this
      condition is simple. The head of the penis must be squeezed
      very tightly between thumb and forefinger. This forces blood
      out of the head and reduces the size. The foreskin can then
      be brought forward to its normal position.</p>

      <p>Application of ice may also be helpful.<sup><a
      href="#pp3">3</a></sup> Hospital treatment with injection of
      hyaluronidase has been shown to be successful.<sup><a
      href="#pp1">1,3</a></sup> Hyaluronidase works by reducing the
      oedema, after which the foreskin may be returned to its
      normal position. When the foreskin has been returned to its
      normal position, no further treatment is necessary. Some
      doctors recommend circumcision but there is no evidence in
      the medical literature to support this recommendation.</p>

      <p>Reynard and Barua recommend the puncture technique.<sup><a
      href="#pp2">2</a></sup> Incisions are not necessary. Improved
      cosmetic outcome is claimed. Again no circumcision is
      necessary.</p>
