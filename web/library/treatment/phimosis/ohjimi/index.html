      <p align="center">ABSTRACT</p>

      <p class="text2">Infantile circumcision is not ordinarily
      performed in Japan. Adult circumcision causes esthetic
      problems with scarring and color change, especially in Asian
      patients. We report our experience with ten adults who
      underwent a new method of surgery for correction of phimosis
      via a longitudinal circumcision of the prepuce along the
      constricted area ventrally to release constriction, followed
      by tranverse closure of the wound; removal of excess skin by
      pinching at the dorsal root of the penis, incising
      circumferentially except for 2 cm. of ventral skin, and
      closing the dorsal wound. Functional results in all cases
      were satisfactory and preputial constriction was fully
      relieved. Cosmetic results were superior to those of
      conventional circumcision and dorsal slit methods of adult
      circumcision because contrasting coloration was obscured
      behind pubic hair and scarring was coincidental with or
      beneath the pubic hairline.</p>

      <p align="center">K<font size="1">EY</font> W<font
      size="1">ORDS</font>: circumcision, penis, phimosis</p>

      <p>Operations to alleviated phimosis are usually performed
      for urological hygiene and/or because of religious or social
      custom. Worldwide this operation is known as circumcision and
      it is usually performed immediately after birth or before
      adolescence.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Infantile
      circumcision is not ordinarily performed in Japan but many
      adults with phimosis elect circumcision. The resultant 2-tone
      color change and/or conspicuous scar is often deemed to be
      disadvantageous, especially in Asians because of the obvious
      contrast between the inner part of the prepuce and proximal
      penile skin color (fig. 1). We report a new surgical method
      for the relief of adult phimosis.</p>

      <p align="center">MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>

      <p class="text2">All patients were evaluated clinically
      before surgery for retractability of preputial skin. If the
      prepuce could be retracted, a longitudinal incision was made
      along the constricted area at the penile raphe ventrally to
      release the constriction. (fig. 2,<i>A</i>). This incision
      extended into the skin and the fibrosis of the stenosis to
      relieve fully constriction of the prepuce (fig. 2,<i>B</i>).
      If the prepuce could not be retracted, a longitudinal
      incision was made ventrally though the outer layer of the
      prepuce. After retracting the prepuce the incision was
      extended along the inner layer. Bleeding was controlled
      through the use of an electrocoagulator, after which the skin
      was approximated transversely with absorbable sutures (fig.
      2,<i>C</i>). If necessary, any dog ear deformity was
      corrected at this stage. If the frenulum was shortened, we
      released it fully by transection. Subsequently, we retracted
      the glans completely, measured the excess skin by pinching
      dorsally at the root of the penis and removed the excess skin
      above the loose connective tissue circumferentially except
      for 2 cm. of ventral skin (fig 2,<i>D</i>). The resultant
      wound was then closed (fig. 2,<i>E</i>).</p>

      who underwent conventional circumcision. Resultant 2-tone
      color change at shaft of penis is especially conspicuous in
      Asian patients.</font></p>

      <p class="text2">From 1988 to 1993, 10 patients underwent
      surgery for phimosis. Patient age ranged from 16 to 38 years
      (mean 23.2). The patients included 4 with true phimosis and 6
      with pseudo-phimosis with preputial stenosis. The 10 patients
      who underwent this type of surgery had better cosmetic
      results than those who underwent traditional circumcision
      because the surgical wound was hidden behind pubic hair.
      Preputial stenosis was relieved fully in all cases.</p>

      <p align="center">CASE HISTORIES</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Case 1.</i> An 18-year-old man presented
      with true phimosis. Intraoperatively, forcible retraction of
      the prepuce by the surgeon showed constriction of the glans
      penis proximally. A longitudinal skin incision was made along
      the constricted area ventrally and the wound was closed
      transversely. Five cm. of skin were removed at the dorsal
      root of the penis. During 2 years of followup the patient
      expressed satisfaction with the cosmetic result. Preputial
      stenosis was relieved fully after surgery. (fig. 3).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Case 2.</i> A
      38-year-old man presented with phimosis. When the prepuce was
      retracted constriction resulted within the penile shaft.
      Intraoperatively, constriction was released fully and excess
      skin was removed at the dorsal root of the prepuce and the
      postoperative cosmetic result (fig. 4).</p>

      <p align="center">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite conservative recommendations by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of
      Obstetricians,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> the proportion
      of circumcisions performed on neonates approaches 80% in the
      United States.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Routine neonatal
      circumcision is not preformed in Japan. Inflammatory diseases
      of the foreskin (balanitis and phimosis) comprise the major
      indications for adult circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4,5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The two surgical methods predominating the
      treatment of phimosis are circumcision and the dorsal slit
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup> As an alternative
      to circumcision in the treatment of phimosis, many different
      operative methods can be used, including Y-V<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> and 4 V-flap repairs.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> As a rule, a retractable prepuce,
      results. However the 2-tone color change with a conspicuous
      scar on the dorsal penis becomes an embarrassment to some
      patients who undergo circumcision or a dorsal slit procedure,
      especially Asian patients in who there is an obvious contrast
      between the inner layer of the prepuce and proximal penile
      skin color (fig. 1.). Patients also are embarrassed by the
      appearance of the surgical wound on the dorsal penis which is
      easily noticed at public baths in Japan.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The treatment of phimosis has
      changed radically since this paper was published in 1995. The
      treatment of choice for phimosis is now medical treatment
      with topical steroid ointment. The favored surgical treatment
      is a dorsal slit with transverse closure.]</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1981 we reported a method of treatment
      for adult phimosis consisting of circumferential excision of
      the skin at the root of the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Good cosmesis resulted because the
      surgical wound was hidden behind pubic hair. However, in some
      cases delayed swelling of the prepuce and/or insufficient
      relief of preputial stenosis occurred. we now report a new
      method of surgery for relief of phimosis in adults such the
      inner prepuce covers the dorsal penis postoperatively. We
      remove no part of foreskin except for minimal revision of the
      dog-ear deformity caused by the ventral incision and closure.
      Therefore there is no color contrast because the foreskin is
      gradually pulled back. Skin color gradually changes from the
      glans penis to the root of the penis without a scar on the
      dorsal distal penis. The appearance of the penis is natural.
      The ventral skin is not redundant after surgery since it is
      pulled longitudinally by a longitudinal incision made
      ventrally, which is then closed transversely (figs. 2 and 4).
      Postoperative swelling of the penile skin is reduced rapidly
      by leaving part of the ventral skin at the root of the
      penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">This new method resolved both postoperative
      problems that occurred using our previously reported
      treatment for adult phimosis.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      Cosmesis was satisfactory. Overall results were deemed to be
      an improvement over circumcision and the dorsal slit
      procedure for the relief of adult phimosis.</p>
