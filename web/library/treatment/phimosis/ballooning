Having researched this topic extensively, the medical literature
describes "ballooning" as part of the normal development of the
penis. It should only be treated if urine will only come out as fine
mist.

There have been only three cases reported in the literature of
"phimosis" causing obstructive uropathy. Ballooning does not
necessarily equate preputial stenosis ("phimosis").

If treatment is needed, radical circumcision is now considered
obsolete.  80-95% of boys with preputial stenosis will respond to
topical steroid creams. 75% of boys will respond to stretching
under local anesthetic. If surgery is needed, preputioplasty has
been shown to be effective with less pain and morbidity, and does
not remove any tissue. Instead, the tissue is moved around to allow
a larger opening.

If there is a concern of kidney disease, non-invasive baseline
studies should be performed now.
