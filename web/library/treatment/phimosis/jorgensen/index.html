      <p class="text2">The preputium is almost never retractable at
      birth, but this congenital normal phimosis generally
      disappears before 4 years of age<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. However the incidence of phimosis is
      8% in 6-7 year olds and falls to 1% in 16-17 year olds<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In operated cases phimosis is caused by
      lichen sclerosis et atrophicus in a frequency up to
      90%.<sup><a href="#n3">3-11</a></sup> <span class="yellow">To
      the best of our knowledge, no other <i>histological
      proven</i> skin disease causing phimosis in boys has been
      reported.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the penis
      was first described in 1908 by Delbanco as Kraurosis glandis
      et praeputii.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The term
      balanitis was used by Stuhmer 1928 <sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup>, and some years later Layman &amp;
      Freeman showed that balanitis xerotica obliterans was the
      same disease.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus has been
      treated successfully with clobetosol propionate cream and
      other local steroids.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15&ndash;18</a></sup> The aim of this study was
      to investigate if clobetasol propionate cream could cure
      phimosis in boys.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Between May 1985 and December 1990, 54 boys
      between 2 and 15 years (mean age 6,9 years) were included in
      this consecutive and prospective open study of patients
      referred for surgical treatment of phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Phimosis was defined an unretractable
      foreskin without adherences and/or a circular band of tight
      prepuce making complete retraction impossible.</p>

      <p class="text2">At 4 years of age about 10% of boys have
      adherences of the foreskin to the glans penis<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. Patients with this problem were not
      included in this study. This was the only exclusion
      criteria.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: The authors use the pathological
      term "adherences" to describe a normal developmental
      condition. The normal physiological bonds between the
      underlying glans penis and the inner mucosal layer of the
      foreskin persist in some boys to until much later. This is
      normal and does not require treatment.]</p>

      <p class="text2">Treatment was given with clobetasol
      propionate 0,05% (Dermovate) cream. Parents were instructed
      to apply the cream in a thin layer on the outside of the
      prepuce from the distal margin to the corona glandis once
      daily. Attempts should be made to retract the foreskin and in
      such way dilate it as much as possible without pain.</p>

      <p class="text2">The patient was seen after one month of
      treatment. If phimosis persisted, the treatment was continued
      and the patient was examined each month up to a maximum
      treatment of 3 months. Patients were regarded as cured if the
      prepuce was fully retractable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Patients not cured after 3 months were
      referred to the surgical department.</p>

      <p class="text2">In June 1991 a letter was sent to all
      parents of the boys whose phimosis had disappeared on
      treatment with the local steroid cream only. The parents were
      asked if the patients were still symptom-free or if an
      operation had been performed after the last visit. Two
      parents, who did not answer the letter were asked the same
      question on the telephone.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Local treatment with clobetasol propionate
      was successful in 38 of 54 boys. For these cured patients the
      mean follow-up time was 3.9 years. (range 0.8-5.6 years). The
      mean time of treatment was 49 days. Nobody showed skin
      atrophy or other side effects at the end of the treatment
      period.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">In 4 patients the
      phimosis was caused by a highly sclerotic prepuce, regarded
      as typical of lichen sclerosis et atrophicus. Of these 4
      patients 3 were cured with clobetasol propionate.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">After three months of treatment with
      clobetasol propionate cream 16 boys showed persistent
      phimosis and were referred to the department of surgery. Of
      the excised prepuces 3 were histologically examined, all
      showing lichen sclerosis et atrophicus.</p>

      <p class="text2">No significant difference in the age
      distribution was found between those who responded and those
      who did not respond to the steroid treatment.(Fig. 1)</p>

      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>

      <p class="text2">This study has, to the best of our knowledge
      for the first time shown that local steroid application is an
      effective treatment of phimosis in boys. The main symptoms of
      the patients were the same as in others, i. e. recurrent
      infections, pain when urinating, difficulty in directing the
      stream of urine and foreskin blowing up like a balloon
      leaving urine in the trousers<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>.
      Congenital phimosis does disappear spontaneously in many
      cases even after 4 years of age <sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>. But this spontaneous resolution
      takes several years and is impossible to predict which
      phimosis will resolve and when. All of the patients had or
      had had symptoms and the parents claimed some form of
      treatment instead of an uncertain expectation. Since there is
      no tradition in Sweden for circumcision the parents were very
      pleased to try a local steroid application instead of
      surgery.</p>

        <p><i>Fig. 1.</i> Age distribution of the two groups of
        patients.</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">All patients were also instructed to retract
      the prepuce as much as possible without pain. Oster <sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> has suggested that such a procedure
      could have caused phimosis to progress in 3 out of 1968 boys.
      In our comparatively small group nobody experienced such a
      deterioration. Further studies are needed to reveal the
      effect of this mechanical manipulation involved in the
      treatment procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our material only 4 patients showed
      lesions that by examination could be classified as lichen
      sclerosis et atrophicus. Since the study was designed to
      avoid surgery, no biopsies were taken for histologic
      examination. In a study by Chalmers et al.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> 14 of 100 boys treated for phimosis
      had lichen sclerosis et atrophicus according to histologic
      examination. In another 10 patients the histologic
      examination showed a non-specific chronic inflammatory
      infiltrate. They stated the clinical symptoms were almost the
      same in all patients, although always more pronounced in the
      group with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.</p>

      <p class="text2">Clemmensen et al.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> made a histologic investigation of
      the prepuces of 78 patients operated upon because of
      phimosis. In 15 patients the histologic examination was
      compatible with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, in 27
      non-specific and in 36 normal. No correlation was found
      between the clinical and the histologic changes.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is not known if lichen sclerosis et
      atrophicus can disappear spontaneously, like congenital
      phimosis. Lichen sclerosis et atrophicus lesions start with a
      slight redness<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>, and because
      the inside of the preputium is always red it is impossible to
      diagnose early lichen sclerosus et atrophicus without biopsy.
      The study has not revealed why some patients do not respond
      to the steroid treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The treatment with
      clobetasol propionate is simple and showed no atrophy or
      other side effects in our material. Therefore it should be
      the first choice of treatment for boys with problems of
      phimosis.</span></p>
