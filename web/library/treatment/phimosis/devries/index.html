<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of hyaluronidase facilitates reduction of paraphimosis. It 
  acts by dispersing extracellular edema, permitting easy reduction of the 
  foreskin. Its use is applicable both in the hospital and out- patient setting. 
  Hyaluronidase is widely available and keeps well if refrigerated. It is 
  effective for children and adults. UROLOGY 48: 464-465, 1996. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote>
<P>Paraphimosis is painful, and reduction of it by classical methods even more 
so (Fig. 1). Recommendations for its reduction involve reassurance, followed by 
wrapping the penis with elastic, squeezing the prepuce or exerting considerable 
pressure to force the foreskin over the glans.<SUP>1,2</SUP> The use of 
hyaluronidase for reduction of paraphimosis is not well known, although it has 
been used for this purpose for at least 11 years (C. D., personal experience, 
and personal communication with Robert Kindrachuk, M. D.). Subdermal 
introduction of hyaluronidase obviates the need for forceful reduction of the 
prepuce or a dorsal slit procedure. 
<P align=center><B>TECHNIQUE</B> 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A topical anesthetic such as 2% 
lidocaine gel or EMLA cream (2.5% prilocaine and 2.5% lidocaine, Astra 
Pharmaceuticals, Westboro, Mass) may be applied to the skin for several minutes 
to 1 hour with an occlusive dressing such as plastic film. Using a tuberculin 
syringe, approximately 1 cc of hyaluronidase (150 U/cc available as Wydase; 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA is injected into one or more sites 
in the edematous prepuce. Resolution of the edema is almost immediate, and the 
foreskin can then be gently retracted over the glans with minimal patience 
discomfort (Fig. 2). 
<P align=center><B>COMMENT</B> 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyaluronidase has been used in 
ophthalmology and plastic surgery for many years as a spreading agent. It is the 
natural protein responsible for hydrolysis of the extracellular 
mucopolysaccharide, hyaluronic acid. The commercially available enzyme is 
prepared from mammalian testes and is available as a lyophilized powder or as as 
stabilized clear solution or injection.<SUP>3,4</SUP> Hyaluronidase acts by 
modifying the permeability of intercellular ground substance in connective 
tissue. The breakdown of the viscous hyaluronic acid decreases tissue resistance 
and enhances diffusion of substances between tissue planes. Clinically, it has 
been used to enhance the effects of locally infiltrated toxins from intravenous 
sites.<SUP>4</SUP> In paraphimosis, it immediately reduces preputial edema. 
Adverse effects are exceedingly rare<SUP>4</SUP> Hyaluronidase is 
contraindicated in the presence of infection or cancer because it could 
facilitate the spread of bacteria or malignant cells. Increase in ecchymosis has 
been reported, as have isolated cases of anaphylaxis, shock, and hypovolemia 
when the medication is given intravascularly. There have been no complications 
in our experience or in the experience of other series where hyaluronidase has 
been used to facilitate local anesthetic block for dermatologic 
surgery.<SUP>5</SUP>
