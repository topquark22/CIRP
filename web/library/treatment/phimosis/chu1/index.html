      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> We evaluate whether steroid application
      alone or retraction and hygiene are responsible for
      successful results in boys treated with topical steroids for
      phimosis.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> A prospective study was
      performed, which included a control group of 42 patients with
      phimosis seen at our outpatient department from January to
      June 1997. During that time we trained the parent to retract
      and clean the foreskin only. From July 1997 to June 1998
      topical steroid cream was prescribed in addition to
      retraction and hygiene in 276 boys with phimosis. All cases
      were divided into 3 subgroups of asymptomatic, symptomatic
      and buried penis.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> <span class="yellow">The response rate was
      greater than 95% in patients who received topical steroid
      treatment in addition to improved hygiene.</span> Only 13
      boys (less than 5%) had no response to steroid treatment. Of
      the control patients 23 (55%) had no response to gentle
      retraction and personal hygiene. There was a significant
      difference (p&lt;0.001) in response rate between the study
      and control groups. However, the subgroup with a buried penis
      responded poorly to steroid, retraction and hygiene
      treatment. There was significant difference (p&lt;0.001) in
      response rate between the buried penis and other steroid
      groups but no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in the
      control group.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Phimosis is a physiological condition
      in neonates due to natural adhesion between the foreskin and
      the glans. Chronic infection due to poor hygiene is
      responsible for most cases of childhood phimosis.
      Circumcision is the traditional treatment of choice for
      phimosis or unretractable foreskin, although it is not always
      desired by parents or surgeons. <span class="yellow">Topical
      steroid cream is an easy, safe and nonsurgical alternative
      for phimosis.</span> However, boys with a buried penis are
      not good candidates for steroid treatment.</p>
