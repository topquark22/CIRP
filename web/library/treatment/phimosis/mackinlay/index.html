        ABSTRACT 
        <hr width="100%" size="1" color="black" />
        In most boys referred for circumcision preputial adhesions
        are the only problem, but these can predispose to recurrent
        balanitis. A simple technique using EMLA cream (eutectic
        mixture of lignocaine and prilocaine) has been devised
        which allows the adhesions to be separated painlessly in
        the outpatient clinic. The technique was used on 39 boys
        aged 2 to 12 years referred for circumcision, none of which
        had a retractable foreskin. The cream was applied under an
        occlusive dressing and left for 60 minutes before the
        adhesions were separated with a probe and a gauze swab. The
        procedure was completely pain free in 32 boys. One boy had
        to undergo a repeated procedure because he failed to
        retract his foreskin in the three weeks after the
        procedure. Only one boy had to undergo circumcision later
        because of fibrous phimosis.<br />
        <br />
         In many boys referred for circumcision separation of
        preputial adhesions is all that is needed, and the use of
        this local anesthetic technique avoids the need for general
        anaesthesia.<br />

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text1">Non-retractability of the foreskin has has
      been a common pretext for circumcision. A non-retractable
      prepuce is not, however synonymous with phimosis and it
      should not be used as an excuse for "lopping off an innocent
      and useful appendage."<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> It has
      been claimed that the difference between intercourse with a
      circumcised penis and an uncircumcised penis is "the
      difference between slipping a foot into a sock that has been
      rolled up and one that is held open a the top."<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Bokai in 1860, was the first to draw
      attention to the physiological adherence of the
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1927 Hamilton and Middleton reported from
      this hospital an investigation into phimosis and dysuria in
      infancy and concluded that circumcision was carried out too
      frequently.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> In many cases
      separation of the adhesions is all that is required. Deibert
      showed in 1933 that separation of the prepuce is due to
      keratinisation of the subpreputial epithelium,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> a process not complete at birth but
      accomplished during early childhood.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Apart from religious or tribal reasons
      there are few indications for circumcision, and its incidence
      is declining.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> A fibrous
      phimosis with scarring undoubtedly necessitates surgery, even
      in other species.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Balanitis,
      however, is often quoted as an indication for surgery, in my
      opinion wrongly.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The author, citing Gairdner,
      reports that the separation of the prepuce is accomplished in
      early childhood. We now know that Gairdner was in error. In
      many instances, separation of the prepuce is accomplished in
      later childhood or adolesnces.]</p>

      <p class="text2">In cases of recurrent balanitis with a
      non-retractable foreskin separation of adhesions and
      subsequent preputial hygiene will prevent further attacks
      without the necessity of circumcision, which may itself
      predispose to meatitis and possible meatal stenosis.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Preputial adhesions have commonly
      been separated under general anaesthesia,<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> since separation in the outpatient
      department is traumatic to the child, even with the use of 5%
      lignocaine cream.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> The
      introduction of Emla cream (eutectic mixture of local
      anaesthetics; Astra Pharmaceuticals), however, led me to
      investigate its value in allowing painless separation of
      preputial adhesions.</p>

      <h3>Patients and methods.</h3>

      <p class="text2">Emla is a formula of lignocaine and
      prilocaine designed to alleviate the pain of
      venepuncture.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Unlike previous
      available topical preparations, it penetrates intact skin to
      produce intradermal anesthesia. It not only reduces the pain
      of venepuncture in children but also makes the procedure
      easier.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> It has been evaluated
      in a variety of other indications, in particular split skin
      grafting and minor skin operations.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> It must be applied under an
      occlusive dressing at least 60 minutes before the
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">The procedure is as follows. The child first
      empties his bladder. He then lies on a couch with his parent
      at the head end for reassurance. The boy is told that some
      "magic cream" is going to be applied to his penis and warned
      that it may feel cold. The foreskin is drawn forward over the
      small open end of the tube of cream and held firmly between
      thumb and forefinger to prevent any cream from escaping. Any
      excess is carefully removed with a gauze swab, and a 3 M
      Tegaderm dressing (supplied with the cream) is applied, the
      printed paper having been removed to expose the adhesive
      surface. The dressing is applied with the backing paper in
      situ. This enables it to be folded in half over the penis,
      the sides of the dressing being squeezed together to ensure
      that a large quantity of the cream is retained in and around
      the prepuce. The child is then allowed to play for an
      hour.</p>

      <p class="text2">The dressing is easily removed an hour later
      and excess cream mopped away. The adhesions can then be
      separated with a probe or using a gauze swab. It is
      preferable to use the latter, at least to clear the coronal
      sulcus. Complete anaesthesia of the glans and prepuce enables
      the procedure to be completely pain free. In the vast
      majority of patients the anaesthesia includes the coronal
      sulcus. A few might feel discomfort at this site. The boy and
      his parents are then advised to retract the foreskin fully
      and apply petroleum jelly at bathtime daily for seven days,
      followed by a week of simple retraction in the bath. The
      patient is reviewed at two weeks and if the treatment has
      been successful. then advice about normal preputial hygiene
      is given and he is discharged.</p>

      <p class="text2">So far 39 boys with preputial adhesions have
      been treated. The reasons for their referral is shown in
      table I. In each case the method was explained to the parents
      and had their consent obtained.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: Balloon on micturition is no
      longer regarded as an indication for circumcision. Ballooning
      on micturition is now understood to be part of the normal
      developmental process. Ballooning cannot occur unless the
      prepuce has started the normal physiological developmental
      process of separating from the glans penis. Ballooning on
      micturition is a transient condition that goes away as the
      child matures.]</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p class="text2">None of the 39 boys had a retractable
      foreskin. Their ages ranged from 2-12 years (table II). The
      procedure was completely pain free in 32 cases. Seven had
      mild discomfort, particularly on separation of the coronal
      component of the adhesions. Only one boy shed any tears. In
      most the complete anaesthesia achieved instilled great
      confidence.</p>

      <p class="text2">One 3 1/2 year old child returned to the
      accident and emergency department with paraphimosis. This was
      reduced, and surprisingly, at review at two weeks his
      foreskin was lax and easily retractable. The parents of
      another child, the 4 year old who had cried at the initial
      procedure reported great difficulty in retracting the
      foreskin. At the two week review the boy remained very
      frightened and at three months he had scarring and a fibrous
      phimosis necessitated circumcision. Nevertheless, three other
      patients who had slight splitting and bleeding from a tight
      constrictive band at the initial procedure had a freely
      retractable unconstricted foreskin at two weeks. Recurrent
      dense adhesions in one boy, due to failure of retraction at
      home, were successfully separated by repeating the procedure.
      One mother found the method so successful on her 7 year old
      son that she brought his 5 and 9 year old brothers to the
      follow up clinic requesting the same technique.</p>

      <p class="text2">No patient showed any sign of toxicity,
      although plasma concentrations of lignocaine and prilocaine
      were not measured. Studies have shown that even in children
      aged under 1 year (in whom use of the lignocaine-prilocaine
      cream is not recommended) the application of a full 2 g of
      cream over a wide area of skin for four hours leads to a
      maximum plasma concentration of 149 ug/l, far below the toxic
      concentration (5000-6000 ug/l (Rodgers B, Astra
      Pharmaceuticals, personal communication).</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text2">General anaesthesia is not without risk
      (however small) and if it can be avoided for a simple
      procedure such as separation of preputial adhesions then that
      is an advantage. If circumcision can be prevented that is a
      further bonus. Many doctors, of course advocate neonatal
      circumcision without the need for anaesthesia and believe
      that this prevents later foreskin problems. There are, none
      the less, still risks in neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> The technique described here has
      proved to be effective, simple and cheap - the cost of one
      tube of lignocaine-prilocaine cream (around pounds sterling
      2) compared with the cost of day case surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">The infrequent true fibrous phimosis is one
      of the few medical indications for circumcision. Separation
      of adhesions is not, however, to be advocated for all other
      cases referred for possible circumcision on medical grounds.
      Separation should rarely be required under the age of 3
      years. The 2 year old included in this series had had
      ballooning on micturition and recurrent balanitis. Careful
      hygiene was advocated but he returned three months later
      having had two further episodes of balanitis. Separation of
      adhesions should also prove unnecessary in many cases of a
      non-retractable foreskin where the simple technique advocated
      in 1950 by <a href="/library/general/spence1/">Sir James
      Spence</a> to assess the foreskin will suffice<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup>: "Retract the prepuce and you will
      see a pinpoint opening but draw it forward and you will see a
      channel wide enough for all the purposes for which the infant
      needs the organ at that early age. What looks like a pinpoint
      opening at 7 months will became a wide channel of
      communication at 17 years."</p>

      <p class="text2">In symptomatic cases this method of freeing
      the adhesions can prove worthwhile. It enables one to discuss
      preputial hygiene with the child, apparently a procedure that
      is often not performed.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> It
      should be something that is discussed at school medical
      examinations.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> Circumcision is
      all too frequently performed without good reason: it is
      rarely required.</p>
