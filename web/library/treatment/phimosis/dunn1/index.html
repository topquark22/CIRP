        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>It is not generally known that, in the management of
      phimosis, there is an alternative to circumcision. This
      knowledge can be useful in circumstances where for various
      reasons operation is inappropriate or unavailable.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>Case report</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>The patient was a 22 year old man in a Royal New Zealand
      Navy cruiser during World War II. He complained of penile
      pain and discharge and wondered if he had accidentally
      contracted venereal disease, but in fact he had not been
      exposed to this risk.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examination showed
      that his problem was one of phimosis with recurrent
      balanitis. The diameter of the orifice in the prepuce was
      only about 0.5 cm. As we were at sea, frequently in action
      against the Japanese, and because at that time no one was
      able to get ashore for 3 months on end, there was no
      possibility of performing any non-urgent operation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an alternative
      management was therefore tried, based on the observation that
      the plastic capability of skin is unlimited. This has been
      demonstrated by the lower lip deformity gradually introduced
      by some primitive tribes, and also by the ear lobe elongation
      produced by heavy earrings.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient reported
      to the Sick Bay daily and for 2-3 min. the preputial orifice
      was put on stretch with a small artery forceps. This was a
      painful procedure but not unbearable. For a week no obvious
      improvement was noted but then the resistance at the margin
      of the orifice was suddenly overcome and by the end of the
      second week its diameter had increased to about 2.5 cm.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time
      the prepuce was able to be retracted. With daily washing the
      balanitis soon cleared up. When the patient was followed up 6
      months later, the anatomy appeared to be quite normal and
      there was no recurrence of phimosis or balanitis. The orifice
      was so slack that there was no risk of paraphimosis.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>Discussion</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>Although it cannot be claimed that this was one of the
      most notable advances in naval medicine or that it
      contributed significantly to ultimate victory, it was
      nevertheless a matter of considerable satisfaction to the
      patient.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the modern
      decline in infant circumcision, phimosis problems will be
      seen more frequently. Adult circumcision may sometimes be
      avoided by this simple technique.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teleological
      purpose of the prepuce remains a debatable area. Do we really
      know better than nature when we amputate so cavalierly?</p>
