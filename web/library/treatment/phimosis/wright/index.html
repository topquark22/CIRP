      <h2>THE TREATMENT OF CHILDHOOD PHIMOSIS<br />
       WITH TOPICAL STEROID</h2>

      <p>A prospective study of the efficacy of topical steroid in
      the treatment of childhood phimosis is reported. Boys
      referred to a paediatric surgical practice with pathological
      non-retractable foreskins were treated with topical beta
      methasone cream.</p>

      <p>One hundred and thirty-patients were treated and 111
      completed the study. A satisfactory result, defined as
      foreskin retractability appropriate for the boys' age, was
      achieved in 80% of patients. In 10% the response was
      inadequate at the end of the study period, but these boys
      were still under treatment or surveillance because their
      parents declined circumcision. In 10%, circumcision was
      performed because of failure of treatment. In six patients
      this was due to balantis xerotica obliterans (lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus) which does not respond to
      conservative treatment.</p>

      <p>Successful treatment depends upon the presence of a normal
      supple foreskin at the outset, and on parental
      compliance.</p>

      <p>Key words: circumcision, phimosis, topical steroid.</p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p align="center">INTRODUCTION</p>

      <p>Until recently in Australia, most males were circumised
      routinely at birth. With reduction in this practice, medical
      practitioners have had to advise parents on the management of
      the normal foreskin and to recognize and treat abnormalities.
      Until ever more recently, the treatment of most of these was
      circumcision. However topical steroids provide alternative
      treatment in the management of phimosis.</p>

      <p>To assess its effectiveness, a prospective study was
      performed in a referral paediatric surgical practice in New
      Castle, New South Wales, Australia. The protocol was based on
      that of Kikiros, Beasley and Woodward.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p align="center">METHODS</p>

      <p>The patients were boys referred for circumcision or for
      advice concerning penile problems. They were admitted to the
      trial if they had true phimosis at any age, or a
      non-retractable foreskin beyond the age of three years. True
      phimosis was defined as non-retractablity with some degree of
      obstruction to urine flow evident as ballooning on
      micturition.</p>

      <p>Assessment and classification of the pathology was based
      on the degree of retractability of the foreskin and the state
      of the skin itself. Following the same plan as Kikiros,
      Beasley and Woodward retractability was classified into six
      groups.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        (1) No retractability.<br />
         (2) Some retraction leaving a gap between the tip of the
        prepuce and the glans.<br />
         (3) Retraction sufficient to see the glanular
        meatus.<br />
         (4) Retraction to allow partial exposure of the
        glans.<br />
         (5) Full retractablity but tight.<br />
         (6) Full and free retraction.
      </div>

      <p>The state of the foreskin was considered as (i) normal;
      (ii) 'cracking' and tendency to bleed on attempted
      retraction; (iii) scarring, and (iv) balanitis xerotica
      obliterans or lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.</p>

      <p>When considering retractability, adhesions between the
      glans and the foreskin were discounted, particularly in early
      age groups. Treatment consisted of the application of topical
      steroid three times a day, particularly at night before going
      to bed. The parent was shown how to apply the cream to the
      pink tip of the foreskin with gentle massage. No attempt was
      made to insert it internally. By the very nature of the
      pathology this is impossible, at least initially. The cream
      used was betamethasone valerate 0.5% (betnovate 1/2; Duncan
      Flockhart, Division of Glaxo Aust. Pty Ltd., Boronia, Vic.,
      Aust.).</p>

      <p>The boys were reviewed after a month of treatment and if
      there had been progress but not to a satisfactory end point,
      a further month of treatment was offered.</p>

      <p>The treatment was deemed successful if it produced the
      normal degree of retractability expected for the age of the
      child, and at all ages a wide, open supple foreskin with no
      obstruction to micturition. Over 3 years of age,
      retractability, either full and free or to the limit of
      persistent glanular adhesions, was considered normal.</p>

      <p align="center">RESULTS</p>

      <p>The age distribution was as follows: 31 patients under 3
      years of age: 41 between 3 and 6 years of age; 26 between 6
      and 9 years of age; and 12 between 9 and 14 years of age.</p>

      for the child's age) was achieved in 80 percent of patients
      (89 of 111). Eighty-one of these achieved full
      retractability, limited in some patients by persisting
      adhesions between glans and prepuce deemed normal for their
      ages. The remainder were boys less than 3 years of age whose
      foreskins, though not fully retractable, were well open and
      no longer obstructing urine flow. No patient with
      recognizable lichen sclerosis et atrophicus responded to
      treatment. Apparent 'scarring' and cracking of the skin on
      attempted retraction were not adverse factors. <font
      color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: Dr. Wright uses the word
      <i>adhesions</i>, which is normally used to describe a
      pathology, to describe a normal developmental condition. This
      may be confusing to some readers.]</b></font> 

      <p>Eleven boys required circumcision, six for lichen
      sclerosis and five for failed treatment. Three of these
      failures were deemed to be due to poor parental
      compliance.</p>

      <p>The study concluded after one or two courses of treatment,
      so no long-term assessment of recurrence was made.</p>

      <p align="center">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">The study has shown that 80% of boys
      with phimosis can be successfully treated
      non-operatively.</span> In the current social climate where
      neonatal circumcision is less frequently performed than
      previously, this provides another important modality of
      treatment. Most parents, having made the decision not to have
      their newborn male baby circumcised, are understandably even
      more reluctant to agree to it in later years. They not only
      recognize the discomfort the child suffers from circumcision,
      but the necessity of the procedure makes the parents feel
      that the original decision was wrong, thereby disadvantaging
      their son.</p>

      <p>Kikiros, Beasley and Woodward published similiar results
      of therapy with half strength betnovate.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Seventy-nine percent of their patients
      improved and 12% required circumcision.</p>

      <p>It is important at the beginning of treatment to explain
      the natural history of the foreskin to the parents. If the
      child is less than three years of age they must be advised
      that full retraction cannot be expected. They must be told
      that natural adhesions between glans and foreskin will not be
      separated by the treatment.</p>

      <p>While it is possible that phimosis, especially in younger
      age groups may resolve with age, this process is slow. The
      rapid response over the 1 or 2 months of the study can be
      attributed beyond reasonable doubt to the treatment.</p>

      <p>The scarred fibrotic foreskin of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans must be recognized at the outset for this will not
      respond to treatment and circumcision is required.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> This should not be delayed by
      prolonged conservative therapy.</p>
