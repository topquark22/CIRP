      <h2>Medical management of phimosis in children: our
      experience with topical steroids</h2>

      University Hospital</a>,<br />
       Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,<br />
       USA.</p>

      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> Circumcision has traditionally been
      regarded as primary therapy for persistent phimosis in boys.
      Recently groups in Europe and Australia have advocated the
      use of topical steroids as conservative treatment in
      children. We report our experience with this approach.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> Between July 1997 and
      February 1998, 25 boys with a mean age of 8.3 years who
      presented to our clinic with phimosis were started on a
      topical steroid. After counseling the family regarding
      treatment options we prescribed a 1-month course of 0.05%
      betamethasone cream applied twice daily.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Of the 25 patients 24 completed the
      treatment and were evaluated. A total of 16 boys (67%) had a
      normal appearing foreskin that was easily retracted, while in
      the remaining 8 the outcome was unsuccessful and circumcision
      was scheduled.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Our study
      demonstrates that the application of topical steroids is a
      viable alternative for treating phimosis in children.</span>
      Appropriate candidates for this therapy include boys older
      than 3 years who have persistent phimosis and no evidence of
      infection.</p>
