      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> We evaluated the effectiveness of
        topical application of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
        ointment for phimosis.</p>

        <p><b>Materials and Methods:</b> A total of 52 children
        with phimosis was included in this study. Phimosis was
        graded according to severity. Of the patients 32 were given
        locally a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ointment prepared
        in ophthalmic usage form from sterile diclofenac sodium
        ampules (not commercially available). The control group
        comprised 20 patients given sterile petrolatum ointment.
        Patients were seen before and after treatment, and graded
        according to retractibility and appearance of the foreskin.
        Treatment continued for 4 weeks with 3 applications
        daily.</p>

        <p><b>Results:</b> Of the 32 patients 24 responded to
        therapy and 8 remained unchanged or had insufficient
        improvement. Three controls responded to therapy and 17 did
        not. There were no side effects.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusions:</b> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
        ointment application for phimosis may be an alternative to
        surgery and steroid application.</p>

        <p><b>Key words:</b> penis; phimosis; anti-inflammatory
        agents, non-steroidal</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Phimosis is a condition in which the
      narrowed foreskin cannot be retracted.[<a href="#n1">1</a>]
      In neonates it is accepted as physiological due to inability
      to retract the foreskin because of natural adhesions between
      the prepuce and glans.[<a href="#n2">2</a>] Phimosis can
      develop at any age, usually as a result of chronic
      inflammation due to poor local hygiene. When infection
      develops, antimicrobial agents and circumcision are
      treatments of choice. We present an alternative therapy to
      surgery, which may be preferable because of safety and high
      success rates.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</b></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Diclofenac sodium ointment was applied to 32
      boys 2 to 6 years old (mean age 4.57) with phimosis who were
      admitted to our urology and pediatric clinics. Patients were
      seen by one of us (M. K. A.) We used the phimosis grading
      scale of Kikiros et al, which applies 2 scores according to
      foreskin retractability and appearance (see Appendix).[<a
      href="#n3">3</a>] Phimosis secondary to incomplete
      circumcision was excluded from study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sterile ointments were prepared elsewhere
      using 0.075 gm. diclofenac sodium, 3 gms. lanolin, 9 gm.
      petrolatum and 15 gm. distilled water. The petrolatum and
      lanolin were sterilized at 150C for 1 hour. This mixture was
      homogenized to a liquid state. As it cooled sterile
      diclofenac sodium from ampules was poured in drops, mixed and
      homogenized until the preparation reached an ointment state.
      Later this mixture was placed in sterile tubes containing 15
      gm. of ointment.</p>

      <p class="text2">A total of 20 patients (mean age 4.23 years)
      with phimosis served as controls and sterile petrolatum
      ointment was applied. Study and control groups were allocated
      randomly. Parents were informed how to use the ointments but
      the initial application was made by the physician. Parents
      did not know whether the ointment was therapeutic or placebo.
      The ointment was applied by parents 3 times daily for 4 weeks
      over the stenotic part of the foreskin using gentle
      retraction. Patients were seen by the same physician, who was
      blinded to the type of ointment applied, after completion of
      treatment and phimosis was graded again according to the same
      criteria. Patients were considered responders when there was
      improvement to a normal or near normal state, as
      characterized in our study by a minimum improvement of 2
      points in the retractability score or at least 1 point in
      each score. Other patients were graded as nonresponders,
      including those who required circumcision. The Wilcoxon test
      was used for statistical analysis.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>RESULTS</b></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Five patients in the study group and 3
      controls had symptoms, such as a forceful stream and
      prolonged voiding time. The table shows the average grades of
      both groups before and after treatment. Of the 32 patients 24
      responded to diclofenac sodium application. Most responders
      had improvement to almost normal foreskin retractability and
      appearance. According to retractibility scores, 5 boys with a
      score of 1 and 3 with scores of 2, 3 and 4 respectively, did
      not respond to therapy with improvements in only 1 patient
      from a score of 2 to 1. According to appearance scores, 1, 4,
      and 3 patients with scores of 2, 1 and 0 respectively, did
      not respond to therapy with improvement in only 2 patients
      from a score of 1 to 0. After treatment voiding symptoms were
      relieved in 3 of 5 patients. The other 2 patients were
      nonresponders who required immediate circumcision. The table
      also shows the average grade of responders and nonresponders
      before and after treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of the 20 patients treated with petrolatum 3
      responded to therapy. According to retractibility scores,
      there was no change in 17 patients (scores of 1 in 5, 2 in 6,
      3 in 4 and 4 in 2) with improvement in only 1 from a score of
      2 to 1 (see table). Voiding symptoms were not relieved after
      petrolatum application. Of the 17 nonresponders circumcision
      was necessary in 6 because of recurrent urinary tract
      infections or voiding symptoms. Petrolatum application did
      not seem to cure foreskin retractibility, since it remained
      almost unchanged, but surprisingly, it seemed to have a
      positive effect on foreskin appearance.</p>

        <p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">In the majority of neonates with phimosis
      the condition is physiological but approximately 10% of boys
      have nonretractable foreskins and less than 1% have phimosis
      at puberty[<a href="#n4">4</a>] Most cases occur in
      uncircumcised penises. Infection from poor local hygiene,
      cicatricial preputial ring due to recurrent adhesions as a
      result of early forceful retraction of the foreskin and
      sometimes excessive skin remaining after circumcision, which
      becomes stenotic, may cause phimosis in young boys.[<a
      href="#n5">5</a>] In older men, especially those with
      diabetes, chronic balanitis may lead to phimosis. Generally
      the recommended treatment is antibiotics if infection
      persists and circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">It has been reported that circumcision has
      advantages including better hygiene[<a href="#n6">6</a>] and
      the prevention of penile cancer,[<a href="#n7">7</a>]
      phimosis, urinary tract infection and sexually transmitted
      diseases.[<a href="#n8">8</a>] Although <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">Thompson <i>et
      al</i></a> indicated that there was no absolute medical
      indication for routine circumcision of the newborn,[<a
      href="#n9">9</a>] this procedure still seems to preserve its
      popularity in the United States. In Turkey circumcision is
      routinely performed for religious reasons. While it is not a
      common procedure to circumcise infants in Turkey, it has been
      popular to perform circumcision for phimosis after infection
      resolves. On the other hand, circumcision may lead to
      complications, such as hemorrhage, meatal stenosis, and
      excessive skin remnants, leading to secondary phimosis and
      infection. In Turkey circumcision of a boy with hypospadias
      by incompetent persons, electrocautery damage to the penile
      tissue and a damaged glans are common complications.</p>

      <p class="text2">Local application of a nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory ointment has advantages. It is easy and
      avoids the complications of a minor operation. It makes
      circumcision unnecessary in the majority of patients whose
      parents are unwilling to allow immediate circumcision for
      phimosis. Others have described that local steroid
      application or even injection of steroids into the prepuce
      decreased phimosis. Kikiros <i>et al</i> reported on 63 boys
      with phimosis of whom 51 had improved foreskin retractibility
      with local steroid application.[<a href="#n3">3</a>] We
      treated phimosis in 32 boys with improvement to a normal
      state in 24. The other eight boys did not respond to therapy
      and 6 required immediate circumcision. Petrolatum application
      improved the appearance score in 3 patients, which we cannot
      explain, but it is not noteworthy since retractibility was
      not improved to a normal state, as in the diclofenac
      group.</p>

      <p class="text2">Generally, we found that responders had
      newly formed phimotic rings, especially with inflammation.
      Older, thick and fibrous rings did not respond well to
      therapy. Thus antiinflammatory drugs have a range of action.
      While in some patients with slightly tight foreskins (for
      example retractibility scores of 0 to 2) the condition may
      have been described as physiological due to young age, we
      used scores for evaluation.[<a href="#n3">3</a>] Patients
      less that 2 years old must be examined carefully, since they
      have narrow preputial openings that resemble phimosis. We
      excluded such cases from study.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are few previous series on the use of
      diclofenac sodium in children, almost all involving the
      management of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Although oral
      administration is not contraindicated, diclofenac sodium is
      not recommended for children less that 18 months old.[<a
      href="#n10">10</a>] In our study we used it in ointment form,
      which is less harmful than any other form, and we did not
      detect any side effects rising from the application. We chose
      declofenac sodium for study because it is one of the few
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs commercially produced in
      ampule form in Turkey.</p>

      <p class="text2">Application of a nonsteroidal drug may be
      preferable to that of a steroid due to safety despite
      systemic absorption from the application, which occurs with
      either substance. Further study is needed that is beyond the
      scope of this article. In conclusion, nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory ointment application may be an alternative
      to surgery and steroid application, since it is a safer
      choice with high success rates for treating phimosis.</p>
