      technique</h2>

      <p><b>Indications</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The traditional treatment of paraphimosis
      which cannot be easily reduced is a dorsal slit followed by
      circumcision, either under the same anaesthetic or later,
      when the preputial oedema has resolved. As an emergency
      procedure this traditional treatment can be time-consuming.
      In addition, distortion of tissue planes by marked preputial
      oedema can make such surgery technically difficult and may
      result in a less than perfect cosmetic result. We report a
      simple technique for the reduction of paraphimosis, which we
      have termed the Dundee technique in recognition of the
      hospital in which we first became aware of its use.</p>
      <b>Method</b> 

      <p class="text1">Between January 1996 and August 1998, 17
      males presenting with paraphimosis to the Emergency
      Departments of the Royal London Hospital, Harold Wood
      Hospital and more recently Christchurch Hospital, New
      Zealand, had their paraphimosis reduced using the Dundee
      technique. Previous attempts at reduction by the application
      of lubricants and ice-packs combined with manual manipulation
      of the prepuce had failed to reduce the paraphimosis in all
      cases. In most cases, ring-block local anaesthesia using
      10-20 ml of 0.5% marcain was used; in three cases general
      anaesthesia was used, in two boys aged 8 and 10 years and in
      another case at the request of the patient. The oedematous
      prepuce (Fig. 1 A) was cleaned with an antiseptic cream. A 26
      G needle (outer diameter 0.45 mm) was used to make 20
      puncture holes in the oedematous prepuce (Fig. 1 B). Using
      gentle but firm pressure, the oedema fluid was expressed from
      the foreskin (Fig. 1 C) until it had been completely
      decompressed, allowing easy reduction of the prepuce (Fig. 1
      D).</p>

      <p class="text2">The patients ranged in age from 8 to 81
      years; the median (range) duration of paraphimosis was 48
      (24-168) hrs. Three patients had indwelling catheters. The
      paraphimosis was reduced successfully in all patients, in 14
      of them under local anaesthesia, and they were discharged
      from the Emergency Department. The three patients who
      underwent reduction under general anaesthesia were discharged
      the following morning. Five patients underwent elective
      circumcision for phimosis; this was technically easy to
      perform with a good cosmetic result. The remaining 12
      patients had no evidence of phimosis and circumcision was
      unnecessary. None of these 12 patients returned with
      recurrent paraphimosis during this study.</p>

      <p><b>Advantages and disadvantages</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Paraphimosis is a common condition, but it
      is our perception that many doctors who treat it are unaware
      of alternatives to the dorsal slit. Hamdy and Hastie [1]
      first reported the use of this technique to reduce A
      paraphimosis and we have shown that it can be successfully
      applied in A group of men many of whom have had A prolonged
      (more than 24 H) paraphimosis. Many urologists perform
      circumcision under local anaesthetic ring block or dorsal
      nerve block and this method of anaesthesia is therefore a
      familiar one. Reduction of paraphimosis using the Dundee
      technique is easy to perform in an emergency department and
      obviates the need for general anaesthesia in most cases.
      <span class="yellow">Subsequent circumcision is often
      unnecessary</span>, but when it is required it can be done as
      an elective procedure which is technically easier, so
      allowing a good cosmetic outcome.</p>
