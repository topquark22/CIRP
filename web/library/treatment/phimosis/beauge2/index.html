            <h1>The causes of adolescent phimosis</h1>

            <p class="1"><b>In the course of practicing preventive
            medicine over the past 15 years, I have carried out
            many routine examinations of students in the first year
            of higher education. Among males aged 18-22, I have
            discovered around 300 cases of phimosis.</b></p>

            <p class="2">The condition occurs in approximately 10%
            of the population and is recognized to be present when
            the diameter of the preputial orifice is smaller than
            the diameter of the erect glans.</p>

            <p class="2">The classic treatment for phimosis is
            surgical - either circumcision or a simple plastic
            surgical procedure that retains the foreskin but widens
            its excessively tight orifice.</p>

            <p class="2">In view of the fact that this treatment is
            essentially bloody and traumatic (and sometimes
            mutilating), it seemed appropriate to study the
            aetiology of the condition to find out why these males
            retain a an infantile foreskin and to determine whether
            some alternative simpler and less traumatic treatment
            could be devised.</p>

            <p class="1"><b>Unusual masturbatory
            practices</b><br />
            The history obtained from these patients invariably
            showed that their practice of masturbation differed
            from the usual manipulation that mimics the dynamics of
            coitus and tends to force the preputial orifice back
            toward the base of the penis, thus exposing the
            glans.</p>

            <p class="2">Masturbatory methods used by boys with
            phimosis are of several types and I have classified
            them as follows.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Some never masturbate.</li>

              <li>Some stroke the glans through the foreskin in the
              usual way, but attempt to pull the skin towards the
              tip of the penis instead of pulling it back toward
              the pubis. In these males the long, tubular foreskin
              of infancy persists.</li>

              <li>In some cases, they roll the penis between two
              palms or between one hand and another surface such as
              the abdomen, the thigh, a table, the edge of a chair
              or the toilet. It is usual in these cases for the
              raphe on the underside of the penis not to be in the
              midline, but more or less displaced to one side or
              even spiral. The preputial orifice is often
              displaced.</li>

              <li>Mechanical stimulation without the use of the
              hands is commonly found. This occurs, for example,
              when they lie prone on a pillow and thrust into
              it.</li>

              <li>Interfemoral stimulation is found.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="1"><b>Correcting phimosis</b><br />
            As a result of this discovery, it seemed logical to
            recommend that these patients practise conventional
            masturbation. <span class="yellow">Within a few weeks
            (three at the most) it was found that the preputial
            orifice became wider, thus correcting the
            phimosis.</span></p>

            <p class="2">The method is similar to the kinesitherapy
            of soft tissues and is remarkably simple. It is
            surprising that it has not been described before.</p>

            <p class="2">However, I have known some patients who
            have used their common sense and have themselves
            modified their practice of masturbation during
            adolescence. Furthermore, broaching the topic of
            masturbation helps to remove the guilt associated with
            a sexual practice that is widespread but often carried
            out shamefully because of the taboo attached to it,
            particularly in Western society.</p>

            <p class="1"><b>Preserving sexual sensation</b><br />
            This medical treatment of adolescent phimosis seemed to
            be successful in all cases unless there was some
            pathological condition of the foreskin. As a result,
            the many problems caused by the amputation of the
            foreskin can be avoided.</p>

            <p class="2"><span class="yellow">The nerve supply of
            the foreskin and its role in sexual sensation are
            preserved and, more importantly, the mobility of the
            penile sheath that is necessary to prevent irritation
            of the partner's vaginal mucosa is
            preserved.</span></p>
