        <b>SATYA PARKASH*</b>
      </center>

      <p>Phimosis is a word of Greek origin meaning muzzled and is
      used for a condition when the prepuce is non-retractile.</p>

      <p>The development of the prepuce (separation from the glans
      is generally not completed at birth. In only 4 percent of
      infants the prepuce is retractable. The prepuce become
      retractable between the age of 6 months and 3 years in most
      children and it is only in 10 percent that non-retractility
      persists. On the other hand a study made at Pondicherry
      (Chaudhuri, 1965) revealed that 51 out of 335 male adults had
      non-retractile and 77 had partially retractable prepuce.
      Removal of this part of the anatomy, even if normal, has been
      practised for various reasons for at least 6000 years.
      Evidence of circumcision has been seen in ancient mural in
      Egypt, and also noticed in mummies dated to 2300 B.C.
      One-sixth of the population of the world is, perhaps,
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>The non-retractility of the prepuce in early life has a
      protective function to perform in view of the child being wet
      at this stage (<a href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner,
      1949</a>; <a href="/library/general/BMJeditorial/">Editorial,
      1949</a>). Pain, if any, is usually due to ammoniacal
      dermatitis in babies, where napkins are used. Circumcision is
      not without its complications, such as meatal stenosis and
      urinary fistulae are not unknown. On the other hand, in older
      males, the prepuce is a useful source of skin cover for
      various conditions such as hypospadias (removed only as a
      ritual as no phimosis is possible), acquired fistulae and
      strictures of the urethra, traumatic loss of skin of the
      penis, extensive warts of glans, filiarsis involving the
      penis wher preputial skin is practically never involved.</p>

      <p>Sixty-four cases were studied in the last 18 months. This
      operation was performed on fifteen of those patients who
      preferred retaining the prepuce. Two of theses cases were
      infants who had a marked ballooning and difficulty in
      mictirition. A relatively long prepuce with a champagne glass
      shape (the narrow portion distal to the glans, forming the
      stem of the glass) was found in the majority of cases.
      "Smegma", commonly associated with phimosis, was found in
      only four out of 64 cases studied. Accretion or minimal dry
      epithelial debris was present in 6 cases, scarring and meatal
      stenosis in three. Most of these patients were adults.</p>

      </center>

      <p>Besides a ritual removal, circumcision has been
      recommended for various other conditions:</p>

      <p>Therapeutic -- (1) In infancy, non-retractility of the
      prepuce is normal and would correct itself in most cases or
      dealt with easily by just passing a probe gently under the
      prepuce after the age of three years.</p>

      <p>(2) Posthitis is a result of ammoniacal dermatitis,
      trauma, insect bites, or a cellulitis. Circumcision is not
      necessary. Balanitis is rare.</p>

      <p>(3) There is no rationale for circumcision in treatment of
      conditions like enuresis, convulsions and masturbation.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>Prophylactic--(a) Paraphimosis is a relatively uncommon
      condition and does not justify a routine circumcision. The
      operation recommended can be used for subjects with a tight
      prepuce. (b) Circumcision has no value in preventing venereal
      diseases. ( Males, circumcised before age 5, are known to be
      practically immune to carcinoma. On the other hand the
      disease is associated with phimosis or a poor personal
      hygiene. A retractile prepuce and a good personal hygiene
      should be sufficient safeguards against a carcinoma. (d)
      There is not enough evidence to incriminate the prepuce in
      causation of carcinoma of the cervix. (e) Circumcision leads
      to a darker, drier and less sensitive glans. A bare
      corona-glandis in a skin-short penis after a badly performed
      circumcision leads to discomfort. There is no proof to
      suggest that these changes are an advantage.</p>

      <p>The operation consists of multiple "Z" plasties. The cuts
      in the outer layer of the prepuce and the inner layer are
      alternated to give three outer and inner flaps, respectively.
      The edges are trimmed (a bit more generously in a long
      champagne glass prepuce). The flaps are interdigitated and
      stitched with 3 "O" chromium catgut. This procedure results
      in some of the outer part of the skin being turned inside.
      The scar is not annular and the opening is, therefore,
      adequate and not tight. No special postoperative care is
      indicated. A revision operation had to be done in two cases
      having a very long prepuce where the trimming was
      inadvertantly inadequate.</p>

        D<font size="1">ISCUSSION</font>
      </center>

      <p>The prepuce is not a useless structure. If proper personal
      hygiene is observed, the risk of malignancy is not high
      enough to justify its ritual excision. Besides the prepuce
      provides valuable spare skin for cover in various conditions.
      Conservation of the prepuce is fully justified even in cases
      with phimosis which does not resolve spontaneously or which
      is not giving rise to symptoms.</p>

      <p>Partial circumcision is known to lead to a tight
      nonretractile prepuce with partial baring of the glans,
      because of an annular scar. Operations based on a dorsal
      stitch with trimming of edges given a poor result
      cosmetically and functionally. This technique of "Z" plasty
      is based on sound principles and gives an effectively
      retractile and cosmetically good prepuce. The observation
      that smegma does not usually collect under the foreskin in
      phimotic subjects is significant and needs further study.</p>

      <center>
        S<font size="1">UMMARY</font>
      </center>

      <p>A plea is made for retaining the prepuce, even in older
      phimotic subjects, by correction of the tight prepuce by a
      plastic procedure consisting of multiple "Z" plasties.</p>
