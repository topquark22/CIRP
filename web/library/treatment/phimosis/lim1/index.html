<B>OBJECTIVE:</B> To see if a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) could be used effectively for the release of preputial adhesions as a day case procedure.<P>
 <B>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</B> A total of 36 consecutive symptomatic children had their preputial adhesions separated under local anaesthetic with EMLA.<P> 
<B>RESULTS:</B> The procedure was successful in 27 children. Of these, 16 remained symptom free at 9 to 12 months follow up although five children had slight recurrence of adhesions. The other 11 children were listed for circumcision at 2 weeks following the procedure because of marked recurrence of adhesions.<P> 
<B>CONCLUSION:</B>  EMLA cream is a good alternative to general anaesthetics in the separation of preputial adhesions. The technique is operator-dependent and better results were obtained when one person was using it regularly. Separation of adhesions is a worthwhile procedure in boys with symptomatic non-retractile foreskins.<P>
