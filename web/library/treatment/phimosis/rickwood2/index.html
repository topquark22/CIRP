      BALANOPOSTHITIS</span></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Summary</b><br />
       <i>Thirty thousand circumcisions are performed annually in
      England and 70% of these are upon boys under 15 years of age.
      In the Mersey Region some 950 boys are circumcised each year
      for medical indications, the commonest being 'phimosis',
      which accounts for 87% of cases, of whom almost one-half are
      under 5 years of age. Regional practice is compared with that
      of our Unit, where the majority of referrals had
      developmentally non-retractile foreskin rather than true
      phimosis, where circumcisions for phimosis and for
      balanoposthitis occurred in almost equal numbers, and where
      no example of true phimosis was seen in boys under 5 years of
      age. <span class="yellow">It appears that in the Mersey
      Region many boys are circumcised for development
      non-retractability of the prepuce rather than for true
      phimosis and that in consequence some two-thirds of the
      operations are unnecessary.</span></i></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This file does not contain
      figures 1,2, and 3.]</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Introduction</b><br />
       Currently, some 30 000 circumcisions are performed annually
      in England under the aegis of the National Health Service,
      8000 on a day case basis and 22 000 as inpatients; 21 000 are
      upon boys under 15 years of age <i>(<a href="#n1">1</a>)</i>.
      At a cost of say &pound;100 for a day case procedure, or
      &pound;200 for an overnight stay <i>(<a
      href="#n2">2</a>)</i>, this represents an annual call upon
      Exchequer funds of the order of &pound;5 200 000.
      Circumcision, it seems is big business: but is it good
      business?</p>

      <p class="text2">In the Mersey region, approximately
      two-thirds of the 1500 circumcisions undertaken each year are
      upon boys of which 94% are for medical indications, the
      commest, phimosis, accounting for 87% of cases. We suggest
      that many of these circumcisions are unnecessary owing to the
      overdiagnosis of phimosis. This hypothesis is explored.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Patients and methods</b><br />
       The Mersey region has a male population of 1 166 600 of
      which 238 950 are boys under 15 years of age. Regional
      statistics relating to circumcision for the years 1984 to
      1986, inclusive, were retrieved from Hospital Inpatient
      Enquiry data. Material from our unit for the period 1984 to
      1987, inclusive, derives from personal diagnostic and
      operative indices, including both circumcised patients and
      those referred for consideration for circumcision but where
      this was not performed.</p>

      <p class="text2">A diagnostic category employed by our unit
      is non-retractile foreskin, where the prepuce is wholly or
      partially non-retractable due to persistence of developmental
      adherence between glans and foreskin ('preputial adhesions')
      <i>(<a href="#n3">3,4</a>)</i>; this is often associated with
      a preputial orfice which, although somewhat narrow, is supple
      and unscarred ('physiological phimosis') (Fig. 1). This
      category does not feature in Regional statistics since it is
      not recognized by the International Classification of
      Diseases <i>(<a href="#n5">5</a>)</i> as an entity distinct
      from true, pathological, phimosis, where the tip of the
      prepuce is scarred and indurated (Fig. 2) and has the
      histological features of Balanitis xerotica obliterans <i>(<a
      href="#n6">6</a>)</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The policy on our unit is to recommend
      circumcision where there is true phimosis or recurrent,
      troublesome episodes of acute balanoposthitis. In other
      cases, parents are advised that, although there is no medical
      reason why their son needs to be circumcised, we will
      undertake the procedure (provided there is no
      contraindication) if that is their wish.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Results</b><br />
       During the period reviewed, 4371 medically indicated
      circumcisions were performed in the Mersey Region, with an
      annual average of 948 procedures upon boys under 15 years of
      age. This, 0.4% of boys in the Region are circumcised each
      year and, if present practice continues, 6% will have been
      circumcised by their fifteenth birthday.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of 420 boys referred to our unit for
      consideration of circumcision, the procedure was performed in
      116 (28%). The majority of the referrals had non-retractile
      foreskin. These boys were usually asymptomatic, although
      some, usually in the age range 2-4 years, had ballooning of
      the prepuce during micturition. Only a minority had true
      phimosis and ballooning of the prepuce was not a feature of
      these cases. General practitioners consistently overdiagnosed
      phimosis; no boy referred under 5 years of age had true
      phimosis. Of older boys, only 42% had true phimosis with the
      proportion rising from 15% of 5-6 year olds to 73% of
      13-14-year-olds.</p>

      <p class="text2">If age distribution curves (Fig. 3) of our
      unit's cases of non-retractile foreskin and phimosis are
      compared with Regional circumcisions for phimosis, two
      features are evident. First, the Regional curve for cases of
      phimosis bears strong resemblance to ours for non-retractile
      foreskin; second, whereas 1164 (47%) of Regional
      circumcisions for phimosis were on boys under 5 years of age,
      our unit saw no example of true phimosis in boys so young.
      The age distribution for our cases of true phimosis is very
      similar to that previously recorded in another series
      <i>(6)</i>.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Discussion</b><br />
       The well-rehearsed arguments favouring routine circumcision
      of male neonates are not germane to our hypothesis, although
      in passing it may be observed that the only proposition
      commanding universal acceptance relates to the virtual
      elimination of the risk of penile carcinoma, a rare disease
      with only some 200 new cases in England each year.</p>

      <p class="text2">As for immediate medical indications for
      circumcision of boys, the major issue clearly turns upon what
      is, and what is not phimosis. The Greek derivation
      (&phi;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;, muzzling)
      allows application whenever the foreskin cannot be fully
      retracted, but such all-embracing usage is misconceived as it
      implies the existence of pathology where very often there is
      none. In reality, there is a clear-cut distinction between
      true, pathological, phimosis <i>(<a href="#n6">6</a>)</i>,
      for which circumcision is unquestionably indicated, and
      partial or non-retractability of the foreskin caused by
      persistence of developmental adhesions between glans and
      prepuce. Almost 40 years ago, Gairdner <i>(<a
      href="#n3">3</a>)</i> demonstrated this state to be both
      normal and self-limiting in boys. Perhaps it was unfortunate
      that he followed his patients to only five years of age, at
      which time the foreskin is still wholly non-retractable in
      some boys while many more retain preputial adhesions <i>(<a
      href="#n4">4</a>)</i>. As a result, there remains
      misconception that persistence of this condition beyond this
      age requires action, be it 'preputial stretching', 'freeing
      of adhesions' or even circumcision. Oster's <i>(<a
      href="#n4">4</a>)</i> study, involving almost 2000 schoolboys
      followed to physical maturity, showed otherwise; by the age
      of 17 years, and without any form of intervention the
      foreskin had become fully retractable in all boys except in
      1% who had developed true phimosis as a secondary phenomenon
      and, by virtue of its natural history, requires no treatment,
      least of all circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Once the distinction between non-retractile
      foreskin and true phimosis is clear, it becomes evident that
      few, if any, of the 390 or so boys under 5 years of age
      circumcised annually in the Mersey region for 'phimosis' can
      have had this condition in reality and very probably the some
      applies to a number of older boys. Although the proportion
      cannot be calculated with any precision, available data
      provides strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence for our
      hypothesis that phimosis is much overdiagnosed and that many
      unnecessary circumcisions are performed in consequence. An
      idea of the somewhat arbitrary nature of the process may be
      gleaned from the fact that the annual rate of circumcision of
      boys, for medical indications varies among health districts
      in the Region from as low as 0.3% in some to as high as 0.9%
      in others.</p>

      <p class="text2">What proportion of operations would be
      unlikely to survive critical scrutiny? Perhaps the simplest
      approach is to estimate the requirement for circumcision of
      boys and to compare this to the number actually performed.
      True, pathological phimosis is the one absolute indication
      for circumcision, and in Oster's large series <i>(<a
      href="#n4">4</a>)</i> occurred in 1% of boys by their
      seventeenth birthday. Analysis of data from a series of cases
      reported from Sheffield <i>(<a href="#n6">6</a>)</i> suggests
      a somewhat similar incidence, 0.9% by 15 years of age.
      Balanoposthitis affects not more than 3% of boys <i>(<a
      href="#n7">7</a>)</i> and here indications for circumcision
      are less certain. Some consider that the operation can be
      entirely avoided by lysing preputial adhesions so as to allow
      retraction of the foreskin, and giving appropriate attention
      to preputial hygiene. <i>(<a href="#n8">8</a>)</i>. We advise
      circumcision in the event of multiple recurrences and this
      occurs in less than one-third of cases <i>(<a
      href="#n7">7</a>)</i>. Since other indications for
      circumcision involve negligible numbers <i>(<a
      href="#n3">3</a>)</i>, at a generous estimate not more than
      2% of boys require the operation and perhaps as few as 1%. It
      is therefore likely that if 6% of boys in the Mersey Region
      have indeed been circumcised by their fifteenth birthday then
      two out of every three operations were unnecessary.</p>

      <p class="text2">Practice in this Region appears to reflect
      that in England as a whole, where the population of boys
      under 15 years of age is of the order of 4 500 000. If the
      portion of religious circumcisions (6%) in the Mersey Region
      is typical, then some 19 750 boyhood circumcisions nationally
      are medically indicated, giving a circumcision rate of 0.44%
      of boys annually, and cumulatively 6.6% by 15 years of age.
      On this basis about 13 750 circumcisions each year would lack
      justification. Any claim that an appreciable number are
      performed at parental insistence runs counter to our
      experience, namely that initiative for circumcision almost
      always comes from the health care industry (general
      practitioner, health visitor, school medical officer, etc);
      parents, we find are usually delighted to be informed that
      their son does not need circumcising.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: The incidence of childhood
      circumcision has declined in England since the publication of
      this article in 1989. The decline is attributed to the
      increased use of evidence-based medicine (i.e., better
      physician education). For updated information see <a
