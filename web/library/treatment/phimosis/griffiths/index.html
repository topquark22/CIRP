        <h2>NON-SURGICAL SEPARATION OF PREPUTIAL ADHESIONS</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="text1">Sir, - We should like to report our
      outpatient technique for the separation of preputial
      adhesions using specially prepared lignocaine cream 25% (1 g
      lignocaine hydrocloride in 4 g cetomacrogol) in a tube with a
      long nozzle.</p>

      <p class="text2">An explanation is given to the parents and
      child and the child placed on a couch. The parent stands at
      the head of the couch, holding the boy's hand and trying to
      distract his attention. An important point is to warn the boy
      that the procedure may sting or hurt a little. We talk to the
      child, reassuring him all the time whilst applying the cream
      to the juncture of foreskin and glans and under the foreskin
      if any separation has occurred. A momentary stinging
      sensation may be felt on application (mainly at the area of
      the urethral meatus) or on freeing any adhesions, but one
      cream is applied to the raw area anaesthesia is almost
      instantaneous. Separation is done, until the entire glans is
      exposed, by retracting the foreskin from the glans using a
      gauze swab or the nozzle of the tube as a probe. As each area
      separates more cream is applied; usually 0.5-1.0 g is needed.
      No side effects of lignocaine absorption have been noted.
      Most mothers and children tolerate the procedure well.
      Afterwards, the mothers are instructed to wait 24-36 h and
      then continue with full retraction daily after a hot bath.
      Chloramphemicol eye ointment is applied to the raw surface of
      the glans and foreskin for 2-3 weeks, to prevent readherence
      while epithelialisation occurs.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since Gairdner's classic paper,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> most people would agree to leaving the
      foreskin alone until the age of 3-4 years. After this gentle
      retraction should be started to separate any remaining normal
      preputial adhesions to allow routine penile hygiene. To
      facilitate this, Gairdner used a probe with no anaesthetic
      whereas others use a general anaesthetic.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The authors rely on Gairdner's
      1949 data, which we now know is incorrect. The normal infant
      preputial fusion with the glans frequently lingers into late
      childhood and adolesence without adverse effect. No treatment
      is necessary in the absence of symptoms.]</p>

      <p class="text2">The procedure we describe is safe, simple,
      relatively atraumatic, cheap, and easily repeated if
      adhesions recur. Only 4 boys (2.5%) came to circumcision and
      can be regarded as failures. Between March, 1973 and
      November, 1980 we treated 161 patients in this way, achieving
      complete separation in 150 and partial separations in 11.
      Complications were severe trauma in 9 and slight discomfort
      in 15. 2 mothers fainted. Apart from the 4 failures, the
      procedure had to be repeated in 4 children and paraphimosis
      was recorded in 1.</p>

      <p class="text2">Wider adoption of this procedure would save
      money spent on hospital admissions and anaesthetics and
      possibly reduce the number of unnecessary circumcisions.</p>
