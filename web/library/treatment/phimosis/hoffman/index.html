      <blockquote>
        Summary - The operation for phimosis aims at achieving
        normal preputial retractability and the prepuce need not be
        removed. A method is described in which multiple
        Y-V-plasties relieve the phimosis without resecting any
        preputial tissue.<br />
        <br />
         

        <p>The indications for circumcision may be non-medical or
        medical. The former include ritual, religious and family
        traditional reasons and the latter include phimosis,
        recurrent post-coital ulceration of the prepuce, protection
        against penile carcinoma, and the occasional need to
        facilitate cystoscopy, urinary bladder catheterisation or
        sub-preputial hygiene.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Method</h4>

      <p><b>The Ebbeh&oslash;j Procedure</b></p>

      <p class="text1">A local anaesthetic (with noradrenaline) is
      injected subcutaneously around the penile root.</p>

      <p class="text2">If the prepuce cannot be retracted (Fig. 1)
      four longitudinal incisions, are made in the outer layer as
      far as the distal rim of the preputial constriction. (Fig
      1B). After cautiously incising the edge, the prepuce can be
      retracted. (Fig. 1C) The incisions are now continued in the
      inner layer, all four curving a little to the same side (Fig.
      1D). From the middle of this curve incisions are made that
      reach the proximal end of the neighbouring curved incision.
      The ventral incision in the outer layer is done in the penile
      raphe, so that the ventral curved incision in the inner layer
      is clear of the frequently insufficiently anaesthetised and
      often bleeding area around the frenulum. The procedure is
      continued as described below (Fig. 2D.E).</p>

      <p class="text2">If the prepuce can be retracted (Fig. 2),
      this is done and a saw-toothed incision is made along the
      circumference of the preputial stenosis, the angle between
      adjoining limbs being about 90 degrees and at equal distances
      from the stenosis (Fig. 2B). The Vs of the saw-toothed
      incision are now converted into Ys by longitudinal incisions
      in both directions (Fig. 2C,D). The incisions extend only
      through the skin and fibrosis of the stenosis, thereby
      avoiding the subcutaneous vessels. Due to the looseness of
      the tissue the flaps can now be advanced without undermining
      (Fig. 3), and the tips of the flaps are fastened with corner
      stitches in the bottoms of the stems of the Ys (Fig. 2E).
      Thus, each Y is transformed into a tall narrow V and the
      circumference is normalised at the site of the stenosis. Four
      Y-V plasties are usually sufficient. The wound is closed with
      a continuous 4/0 catgut suture. The prepuce is reset and
      retained in this position with two catgut stitches, this
      rendering dressing unnecessary and providing sufficient
      compression of the suture lines against the glans. The
      patient is advised to micturate in the sitting position until
      these stitches burst, normally within 3 to 5 days and to
      avoid sexual activity for 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Unnecessary removal of human tissue should
      be avoided and the prepuce is no exception. In traumatic skin
      loss the prepuce may serve as a convenient and sufficient
      source of wound cover.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision apparently reduces the risk of
      penile carcinoma. However, this reduction is less marked if
      the operation is performed later than infancy (Boczko and
      Freed, 1979). The retained smegma is believed to be the
      carcinogenic agent, but inadequate penile hygiene is due to
      preputial non-retractability, not to the prescence of the
      prepuce. A number of prepuce-saving techniques for the repair
      of phimosis have been suggested. They include the dorsal slit
      (Diaz and Kantor, 1971), oblique dorsal incision (Schloffer,
      1901), modified Z-plasties (Marschner, 1971); Kodega and Kus,
      1973), Multiple Z-plasties (Parkash, 1972) and the four
      V-flap plasty (Emmett, 1975). Because of the good cosmetic
      result and the very low risk of haematoma formation, we
      prefer our procedure. It is easy to perform, takes less than
      30 minutes, and the functional and cosmetic results are
      excellent (Fig 4A,B). During the last three years this
      method, with minor modifications has been used in our
      department on 44 patients (aged 10-73 years). Any one
      recurrence has been encountered and that was in a patient who
      had balanitis xerotica obliterans.</p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: When this paper was written in
      1984, smegma was still suspected as a carcinogenic agent.
      Today we know that smegma is NOT carcinogenic. The major risk
      factors for penile cancer are the use of tobacco and
      infection with human papilloma virus (HPV).</p>
