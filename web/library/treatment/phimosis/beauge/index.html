      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>Being in charge for over ten years of the routine
      examination of college freshmen as part of the preventive
      medicine programme of the university, I diagnose a
      significant number of phimoses among older children and young
      adults.</p>

      <p>Among this male population aged 18 to 22, we have observed
      that nearly 10% have various degrees of tightness of the
      foreskin, ranging from total inability to expose the glans to
      a simple ring which gets stuck in the sulcus. In this report
      the word phimosis is used to mean the diameter of the
      inferior preputial ring is smaller than the diameter of the
      erect glans.</p>

      <p>From the interviews it appears that the great majority of
      these subjects are virgin, and that among those who have had
      sexual experience, many have failed, with difficulty in
      penetration, pain and loss of erection; except perhaps in
      cases of the tightest phimoses who were successful in penile
      penetration with the glans covered. The remainder expose
      themselves to considerable risks of paraphimosis by
      persevering in intercourse. This possibility and the
      difficulties in carrying out successful intercourse make it
      necessary to intervene medically.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 2 ---</i></font></p>

      <h3>Treatment</h3>

      <p>The conventional treatment of phimosis is surgical:</p>

      <p>Circumcision which removes the foreskin, or simple plastic
      surgery which preserves the fold of skin but opens the
      ring.</p>

      <p>For a number of reasons I have come to reject this
      therapeutic procedure:</p>

      <p>* Surgical intervention:<br />
       - is traumatic, brutal, and irreversible<br />
       - necessitates anaesthesia<br />
       - is bloody.<br />
       These two latter features give rise to the possible
      complications of any other form of surgery.<br />
       - in the case of circumcision reduces the mobility of the
      penile skin; this factor is important and we shall return to
      it at length on <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/#page12">page
      12</a>.<br />
       - is psychologically stressful by cutting an organ which is
      highly symbolic for a male at the dawn of his sexual
      life.<br />
       - creates a mutilation: the amputation causes the penis to
      differ from that of his friends at an age where he has
      scarcely acquired knowledge of normality.<br />
       - causes brutal exposure of the mucous membrane by the
      excision of the protection of the glans.<br />
       - interferes with the pattern of masturbation which may be
      seriously traumatic.<br />
       - in the case of plastic surgery may fail due to scar
      formation.<br />
       - is expensive and requires hospitalisation.</p>

      <p>* Remodelling of the foreskin should be considered. It
      is:<br />
       - logical: in medicine we only refer for surgery failures of
      remodelling whether it be muscular, tendinous or
      cutaneous.<br />
       - painless<br />
       - gradual<br />
       - unobtrusive<br />
       - free<br />
       - not traumatic or troublesome to the patient<br />
       - preserves the foreskin which has definite functions,
      described on <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/#page13">page
      13</a>.<br />
       - allows the preservation of patterns of masturbation.<br />
       - avoids the pain of the exposed glans.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 3 ---</i></font></p>

      <h3>Reflections</h3>

      <p>The study of observed cases reveals that adolescent or
      young adult subjects suffering from phimosis have habits of
      masturbation different from others.</p>

      <p>Conventionally the pursuit of solitary pleasure is done
      with the dominant hand closed over the penis making alternate
      back and forth movement over the shaft, the hand going down
      towards the pubis, uncovering the glans which the index
      finger or thumb may now and then stroke lightly, reproducing
      the sensation of intercourse.</p>

      <p>This exercise results in moving the penile skin in the
      same way as will occur in vaginal intercourse, and therefore
      it is a preparation for adult sexual relations. We shall see
      later that this training is not only mechanical, but also
      participates in the psychological development of the
      individual.</p>

      <p><br />
       I have established a classification of the other methods of
      masturbation and have often seen them among patients with
      phimosis.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Some boys never masturbate! We may doubt their
        assertions, but the tightness of their phimosis suggests
        their statements are correct. Ejaculation takes place
        during sleep (nocturnal emissions), and more rarely
        spontaneously while awake prompted by stimulating events,
        among those subjects who attach guilt to contact with the
        penis.</li>

        <li>Others stroke the glans through the foreskin in the
        usual way, but attempt to pull the skin towards the tip of
        the penis instead of pulling it back toward the pubis. We
        find among these boys the persistence of a long tubular
        foreskin such as is seen in infants.</li>

        <li>In some cases the boy rolls the penis between two palms
        or between one hand and another surface such as the
        abdomen, the thigh, a table, the edge of a chair (in
        particular the toilet). It is usual in these cases for the
        raphe on the underside of the penis not to be in the
        midline but more or less displaced to one side or even
        spiral; the preputial orifice is often displaced: figure
        1.</li>

        <li>Mechanical stimulation without use of the hands is
        perhaps found most frequently (perhaps causing less guilt).
        In general, the boy, flat on his face on his bed, labours
        as if for intercourse with the help of his pelvic
        musculature, and rubs his penis against the mattress, the
        bolster or a pillow, often through a cover in which -- sign
        of the times -- he has placed a disposable paper tissue to
        avoid stains which would betray his activities to his
        mother.</li>

        <li>Interfemoral stimulation is found, facilitated by a
        penis curved downward (figure 2), unless it is this
        activity which determines this anatomical anomaly. This
        technique has the advantage that it can be carried out in
        company, much as some females have orgasms by squeezing
        their thighs, while climbing a rope, or while riding a
        bicycle.</li>

        <li>Instrumental masturbation: this can be achieved by
        vibro-masseur or by showering, but it has never been
        demonstrated in this population studied and therefore must
        be rare or of occasional practice.</li>

        <li>For the record: auto-fellation when mobility allows
        it.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 5 ---</i></font></p>

      <h3>Roles of Masturbation</h3>

      <p>Following this analysis, we may consider the purposes of
      masturbation.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>It serves of course to evacuate the semen secreted by a
        pubescent boy. The tension felt by men after a certain time
        following the last ejaculation is well known.</li>

        <li>It is enjoyable; a boy who has discovered that he can
        bring on pleasure by the mechanical stimulation of his
        penis recreates the conditions of this pleasure, and this
        effort is gratified by orgasm.</li>

        <li>For the future masturbation allows the subject to learn
        to obtain orgasmic sensations and also to recognise the
        erogenous stimuli which create them, to perceive the
        beginning of ejaculation, and therefore to find ways to
        prevent it. No doubt the regular practice of this activity
        forms the basis for the avoidance of premature ejaculation.
        Variations are possible on the theme of sexual pleasure and
        give the opportunity to explore the field of
        eroticism.</li>

        <li>To be sure masturbation has a role in preparing the
        penis for its future purpose. It seems to me that we could
        draw a parallel between athletic training which affects the
        development of the athlete who is preparing himself for
        competition, and the technique of masturbation which,
        during adolescence, serves to overcome organic obstacles to
        penetration.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of the therapeutic procedure I
        propose to describe is based on this understanding of the
        effects of the handling of the penis on the development of
        the foreskin and the elimination of phimosis.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed it is apparent that the number of
        phimoses observed in a population of boys decreases with
        age. Inability to retract the foreskin is normal in
        infants, common among young boys, but only persists in
        about 10% of the subjects at the end of adolescence.</li>

        <li>Finally masturbation contributes to fantasy life and
        helps the subject to structure himself mentally in his
        future life.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 6 ---</i></font></p>

      <h3>Therapeutic Procedure</h3>

      <p>Faced with a man suffering from phimosis, I propose:</p>

      <p>After analysis of the patient's method of masturbation, it
      is necessary to explain to him the roles of masturbation
      during adolescence, such as are described in the five
      preceding points. The discussion has the advantage of
      removing feelings of guilt, if necessary.</p>

      <p>Next it is advisable to instruct him on the technique that
      seems to be most useful, attempting thus to pull back the
      foreskin by exposing the tip of the glans. In fact it is only
      rarely possible for a boy who has developed for himself a
      method that leads to orgasm to replace it initially by
      another. Generally the new method fails to give pleasure and
      may even tend to impair the quality of the erection. This
      could explain why boys fail in their first attempts at sexual
      intercourse; a man who has become accustomed to rotational
      movements on his penis for several years will be quite unable
      to use this technique in the vagina. Therefore I advise
      "prescribe" alternating a few pleasurable manipulations known
      to be stimulative with the remodelling manipulations. It is
      of course essential that the preputial opening be stretched
      round the circumference of the fully erect glans. This
      technique meets the requirements of the kinesitherapy of soft
      tissues, gradual stretching. In some cases I have recommended
      instrumental dilatation with the use of a dilator in patients
      who agree to this procedure, or I have advised the
      introduction of two fingers into the opening of the foreskin
      to stretch it. Figure 18.</p>

      <p>Perhaps it is logical to draw a parallel between the
      preputial ring of the boy and the hymen of the girl. In both
      cases there is a mucocutaneous stricture obstructing
      intercourse, but allowing the passage of urine and in the
      case of the hymen the flow of menses. The opening of the
      hymen may occur through traumatic rupture during brutal
      penetration, or by gradual and gentle dilatation when the
      lover is careful or shy.</p>

      <p>Prepuce or hymen, it is the erect glans acting as a mould
      (or mandrel) which dilates (and models) the orifice.</p>

      <p>Thus the boy can progressively expand his foreskin until
      the diameter is equal to that of the erect glans, allowing
      him subsequently to proceed to sexual intercourse without
      risk of paraphimosis.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 7 ---</i></font></p>

      <p>During the course of this remodelling there will come a
      time when the foreskin is sufficiently dilated to uncover the
      distal part of the glans but is still too tight to go over
      the proximal and larger part; due to the conical shape of the
      glans we can then imagine that a strong enough pull might
      succeed in sliding the ring into the sulcus, but that the
      reverse movement might be impossible, causing paraphimosis
      during masturbation. This appears to me unlikely for several
      reasons:</p>

      <p>- the manipulation is done under visual control of the
      subject who is well able to detect the degree of tension in
      the foreskin, unlike the situation during sexual intercourse,
      particularly when it occurs for the first time;</p>

      <p>- if paraphimosis nevertheless did occur in these
      conditions it could only be moderately tight and would be
      reduced immediately by the subject who is free to readjust
      himself at his convenience. Furthermore in this situation
      orgasm would not occur (masturbation would be stopped at
      once) and so the secondary increase in volume and firmness of
      the glans would not take place; whereas in coital
      paraphimosis the foreskin enters the sulcus during
      intercourse and then orgasm causes further increase in volume
      and firmness of the glans making reduction more difficult.
      And finally the boy's embarrassment at manipulating himself
      in the presence of his partner to reduce the foreskin,
      explains the delay during which oedema collects and the
      condition becomes established.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 8 ---</i></font></p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p>I had to recommend this treatment for 30 to 40 boys
      annually and therefore have observed several hundred cases.
      Follow-up in preventive medicine is not usual and many were
      not seen again. However about half did return to report a
      satisfactory outcome. Some of them grateful to have benefited
      from such a gentle and discreet treatment method entrusted me
      with other problems and therefore have provided accounts of
      the success of the treatment over a longer period.</p>

      <p>With regard to patients from the town a number were given
      the same advice and I reckon that in 15 years of practice I
      never had to refer a single one for surgery.</p>

      <p>In a few cases patients agreed to be photographed with the
      foreskin stretched on the erect glans at the start, with a
      second photograph taken four weeks later. These demonstrate
      that retraction of the foreskin was achieved as a rule within
      this time.</p>

      <p>The illustrations that follow (Figures 7 to 16) show the
      outcomes occurring in the same time as that of the scar
      formation after surgery. These results encourage therefore
      the use of this technique.</p>

      <p>I did not come across any failures, but this does not mean
      that they did not occur since such cases may have failed to
      reattend. It should be pointed out that an attempt at
      conservative treatment does not prevent subsequent recourse
      to surgery should this prove to be necessary.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 9 ---</i></font></p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>If we must criticise this method of treatment of
      adolescent phimosis by the masturbation technique, we must
      ask ourselves two questions:<br />
       - Is it permissible to discuss masturbation with these
      boys?<br />
       - Should circumcision be rejected?</p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <h4>About masturbation</h4>

      <p>* Masturbation is universal in humans.<br />
       - It occurs in all young children and is the usual form of
      sexual expression among Western adolescents. Georges Mendel
      in "Anthropologie Differentielle" points out that "If we
      recall the universality of infantile masturbation during the
      first years and the near- universality in adolescent boys, we
      realise then what a role it must take."</p>
      <br />
       In our society adolescence tends to be prolonged voluntarily
      into the third decade and masturbation continues in these
      young single men.<br />
       - Some married men often make up for the difference in
      libido compared with their partner by taking a mistress as
      well.<br />
       - Mention should also be made of men temporarily or
      permanently alone whether willingly or unwillingly as a
      result of life's vicissitudes. 

      <p>* We know that masturbation also forms part of the sexual
      relationship of couples and often the woman will masturbate
      her partner to avoid intercourse which may be undesirable for
      various reasons:</p>

      <p>- A young girl who wants to defer her first real
      relationship,<br />
       - menstruation,<br />
       - vulvo-vaginal irritation<br />
       - fear of pregnancy or finally just because of a plain and
      simple attraction for the penis which she can own or
      tame.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 10 ---</i></font></p>

      <p>Masturbation is also a well known means of obtaining or
      reviving an erection when mental stimulation is
      insufficient.</p>

      <p>Masturbation is still the main method of "Safe Sex" as
      described for the avoidance of HIV infection and even
      recommended by certain governments e.g. Canada.</p>

      <p>* Masturbation is in fact advised twice weekly as adjuvant
      treatment of chronic prostatis in single men.</p>

      <p>* The symbolism of masturbation is found everywhere in
      daily life and humour: for example the shaken champagne
      bottle ejaculating foam in the hands of the winner of a motor
      race.</p>

      <p><br />
       Is sexual pleasure obtained by masturbation legitimate?</p>

      <p>Our senses of sight, hearing and smell have been developed
      to ensure survival by detecting predators so that we can
      defend ourselves against them, as well as to capture prey and
      obtain food. Today in our society these senses are
      extensively exploited to obtain pleasure from pictures,
      music, sculpture and perfumes. Likewise the sense of taste
      necessary to recognise wholesome food is exploited in cooking
      and even in tobacco smoking and the enjoyment of wine.</p>

      <p>We admit that civilisation allows us this leeway in the
      use of our sense organs. We have freed sexual and sensual
      pleasure from the confines of reproduction and survival of
      the species (who would be satisfied with intercourse three or
      four time in their life?); we can therefore allow sexuality
      to be expressed freely by individual choice (within the
      limits of the liberty of others of course) and free ourselves
      from the biblical guilt of sex.</p>
      Masturbation has its place within the range of sexual
      expression and morality has no rational arguments to displace
      it.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>To quote Sigmund Freud's Birth of Psychoanalysis: <i>"I
      have come to believe that masturbation was the only great
      habit, the primitive need and that other appetites, such as
      the need for alcohol, morphine, tobacco, are only
      substitutes, the products of replacement."</i></p>

      <p><br />
       Contemporary Western sexology emphasises the quality of
      loving and spiritual relationships in the success of
      sexuality. This is very laudable and noble, and also
      frequently true, but is in fact neither sufficient nor
      indispensable. Sexual technique and the characteristics of
      the genital organs also play a part in successful sex. One
      need only analyse the factors of sexual nomadism and even
      prostitution to convince oneself of this.</p>

      <p>The fact that masturbation has a role in the acquisition
      of sexual technique and contributes to morphological
      development is sufficient to justify it, we think.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><i>Page 11 ---</i></font></p>

      <p>We may often be tempted to reduce masturbation to a
      solitary pleasure derived from mechanical stimulation of the
      genitals. It is not so. Despite the fable of "The Animal Sad
      After---", there is no doubt that masturbation is
      antidepressant and anxiolytic if it is freed from guilt. This
      sexual activity distances the individual from the worries and
      constraints of daily life lulling him to sleep. whereas the
      pre-existing depressed state of mind would have prevented
      sleep. By ejaculating the adolescent sends himself to sleep
      just as infants and some older children do by sucking their
      thumb for comfort.</p>

      <p>Furthermore underlying all masturbation there is at the
      psychological level both conscious and subconscious
      fantasising. Thus the adolescent dreams and rehearses (in the
      same way as repeated theatrical performances) sexual
      relationships as yet unattainable. In this sense when he
      comes to his first sexual relationship he is not entirely
      virgin, innocent and inexperienced.</p>

      <p>Autoeroticism and fantasising are described by Gerard
      Mendel as "productions of the same nature, that is memories,
      secondary and associative." and furthermore: "masturbation is
      in the last resort only the means to recall, of renewing
      intensely the memory of the pleasure arising from the penis,
      as well as the whole range of sensory memories which, when
      stimulated, constitute fantasy."</p>

      <p>Therefore we must get rid of excessive guilt of
      socio-cultural origin, and then it seems permissible to
      advise an adolescent to direct himself towards a technique
      that relates to sexual intercourse.</p>

      <h4>About circumcision</h4>

      <p>Circumcision is seen by the patient subjected to it as a
      partial castration; it removes part of the genitals, at their
      tip, which is particularly significant at the symbolic level.
      The patient is ignorant of, as are most doctors, the
      functions of the foreskin, which means that the amount of
      loss, of damage one may even dare to call it, is unquantified
      and therefore unlimited.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is akin to amputation, which disgusts us so
      much since it is often proposed with the ulterior motive of
      preventing masturbation while preserving the ability to
      procreate. This attack on sexuality remains still present in
      people's minds, and it should be noted that even if the
      operation does not occur in France in its bloody and cutting
      form it has nevertheless been expressed until very recently
      in an insidious way of thinking with tales about ideas such
      as "that an honest woman must not enjoy any pleasure" and
      that the sexual relationship between the couple was a
      "conjugal duty" like other chores. All practitioners in the
      field of sexology are familiar with the damage which such
      ideas continue to produce in the sexual lives of a great many
      patients.</p>

      <p>Mankind in general, and especially adolescents, face a
      fear of genital abnormality, more as regards size than form
      or concerning the ability for sexual function. This fear is
      fuelled by the usual boasting of the school playground. On
      this</p>

      <p><a id="page12" name="page12"><font size="-1"><i>Page 12
      ---</i></font></a></p>

      <p>sensitive ground an amputation increases this notion of
      abnormality, the more so since we live in a country where men
      are not generally circumcised.</p>

      <p>More objectively the operation causes an aesthetic
      modification, and there is a risk of regarding the penis as
      disfigured; a circumcised man in our part of the world may
      himself be disgusted and his partners disturbed by the glans
      permanently exposed, just as we feel uncomfortable faced with
      an ectropion or a prolapse. We are used to a cutaneous
      covering of the entire body, and a break or alteration of
      this envelope creates by this raw appearance of the
      decorticated penis, a feeling of discomfort like the sight of
      blood or of a defect in the skin (the labial slit or eczema)
      well beyond what reason would lead one to expect; and when
      one considers how fragile and sensitive to emotional
      disturbances sexual function is, one gets an idea of the
      consequences that may result from this mutilation.</p>

      <p>Conversely it is important to recognise that in USA the
      sisters of a circumcised boy feel this same discomfort when
      faced with a partner whose glans is naturally covered.</p>

      <p>The foreskin is the eyelid of the glans. Its ablation
      denudes the mucosa of the glans and causes more or less
      temporarily a dreadful causalgia which the patient could well
      do without. The glans is a precious part of the male and in
      our minds we know that objects of value are kept in a case.
      Circumcision is the ablation of this case.</p>

      <p>The foreskin is also an important erogenous zone: it is
      perhaps the first such zone discovered by the infant, then it
      is the site of the erogenous trigger, particularly effective
      at producing an erection since the glans at that time has
      only a moderate sensitivity. It seems also that stroking the
      foreskin is particularly good for maintaining the erect state
      without precipitating orgasm. An informed partner discovers
      these properties and knows very well how to communicate
      lasting sensations of high quality through the foreskin.
      Circumcision removes the nerve endings of this skin surface
      depriving the subject of this delightful sensation.</p>

      <p>Apart from the foreskin's own sensitivity, the loss
      through circumcision of indirect stimulation of the glans
      must be taken into account, and the need to discover with
      more or less difficulty a new technique of masturbation.</p>

      <p>The fragility and delicacy of the mucosa of the glans
      explain why stimulation by direct digital massage becomes
      painful at once. On the other hand it is bearable and even
      delightful when the stimulation instead of being direct is
      carried out indirectly through the folds of the foreskin. In
      these conditions it is the pressure receptors that are
      stimulated. There are variations of pressure within the glans
      rather than friction or rubbing on its mucosa. The nerve
      endings are not tactile but sensitive to pressure. Note that
      some of the masturbation massages the corpus spongiosum,
      propelling blood towards the glans, and each wave increases
      the pressure there.</p>

      <p>Dr. Gerard Zwang, in "Circumcision -- whatever for?"
      expresses the same ideas in rich and well-chosen words: "The
      child acquires .... the experience of conscious sexual
      pleasure. By practising this delicious handling of the penis
      indirectly through the foreskin.</p>

      <p><a id="page13" name="page13"><font size="-1"><i>Page 13
      ---</i></font></a></p>

      <p>The only frictional contact that the glans appreciates,
      savours and tolerates is that of the moist and padded vaginal
      (or oral) mucosa. The rough, dry friction of the hand or of
      the fingers would soon become unbearable if Mother Nature in
      her wisdom had not interposed the foreskin as a screen
      between the stimulating hand and the very delicate primary
      erogenous epithelium. The to and fro movement of the foreskin
      on the glans, nicely eased by the lubricating sebaceous
      coating, gives rise to this alternating stimulation which is
      an effective method of producing orgasm."</p>

      <p>Circumcision seems to cause a rapid tensing of the frenum
      during penetration and could contribute to premature
      ejaculation.</p>

      <p>But above all it is the loss of the reserve of skin
      provided by the foreskin that damages the physiology of
      coitus. The primary function of the foreskin is not to permit
      masturbation, even though we may congratulate ourselves for
      it, but to allow vaginal intercourse to take place under
      optimal conditions without friction between the mucosal
      surfaces of the two participants.</p>

      <p>Try an experiment: holding the tip of the erect penis of
      an uncircumcised boy you can as a rule move your fingers to
      the base of the penis without causing the slightest slippage
      on the skin. The foreskin unrolls; this skin slides on the
      penis; its length and elasticity allow it to travel the
      entire length of the organ. There is no other part of the
      body where the subcutaneous tissues allow such mobility.
      (Photos 19 et seq.)</p>

      <p>This explains why sexual intercourse can be prolonged
      without causing friction and therefore irritation of the
      surfaces in contact, i.e. the penile skin and the vaginal
      mucosa. The movement does not occur between these surfaces
      but between the penile dartos muscle and its subcutaneous
      tissues specially adapted for this function.</p>

      <p>Amputation of the foreskin reduces considerably or even
      totally this mobility, by removing 4-6 cms of the reserve of
      skin and eliminates this amazing function.</p>

      <p>The effects of this loss may be slight if the man is a
      premature ejaculator, since the very brief intercourse will
      not cause irritation, the same if the penis is very short or
      moved by thrusts of small amplitude. On the other hand
      prolonged and vigorous intercourse risks causing irritation
      in spite of natural or even artificial lubrication,
      explaining certain cases of female and even male dyspareunia.
      I have examined a young man circumcised during military
      service; his erection was painful due to the sheer stretching
      of the sheath cut too short over the erect corpora cavernosa.
      His sexual capacity was as a result at least for a while
      totally destroyed, and certainly altered for the rest of his
      life.</p>

      <p>We may also question whether circumcision, so popular in
      the USA, may not be a factor encouraging erosions of the
      ano-rectal mucosa in the course of anal intercourse, and may
      thus encourage the spread of HIV, since we know that breaks
      in the skin or mucosa are the usual portals of entry of the
      virus.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>It would appear then that phimosis which is normal in
      infancy diminishes in frequency with age due to the fact of
      the manipulation of the penis. It depends therefore on the
      practice of masturbation which permits an organised
      morphological development in the direction of future adult
      sexual behaviour.</p>

      <p>In those cases where the manipulation of the penis does
      not lead to stretching of the ring of the foreskin, this part
      remains of insufficient diameter to expose the glans and
      constitutes congenital (primary) phimosis of the
      adolescent.</p>

      <p>Prescription of kinesitherapy is effective at dilating
      this ring, and results in redirecting the patient towards
      conventional masturbation. Reduction of the phimosis can be
      achieved in a few weeks.</p>

      <p>Tackling the subject of masturbation contributes to
      removing guilt from a very widespread genital activity, but
      one which is often very poorly accepted due to the taboo
      which continues without reason to weigh upon it.</p>

      <p>Medical treatment of adolescent phimosis, allows when it
      is effective (and in the absence of a cutaneous abnormality
      it seems to be always effective) the avoidance of the many
      problems caused by amputation of the foreskin that is
      circumcision. The cutaneous mobility of the penile sheath
      being no longer able to benefit from the reserve of tissue is
      restricted as a result and the dynamics of coitus are
      altered. In North America where circumcision is very
      widespread techniques to re-cover the glans by plastic
      surgery or stretching have been developed. This latter method
      by stretching the remaining skin sets out to restore the
      mobility of the sheath just as it would have been prior to
      the ablation.</p>

      <p>We can be happy that manipulation of the tissues allows
      the avoidance of surgical intervention, and in other
      circumstances the limitation of the problems when surgery has
      unfortunately occurred.</p>
