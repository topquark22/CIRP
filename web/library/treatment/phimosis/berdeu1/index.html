      <p class="text1"><b>Objective</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; To compare the
      cost-effectiveness of surgery and topical steroids as
      treatments for phimosis (defined as a clinically verifiable,
      pathological, cicatricial stenosis of the prepuce) and to
      evaluate the financial basis of these treatments.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Methods</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Data on treatment
      using topical steroids was obtained from published reports
      and those for circumcision from claims by private hospitals
      for children &lt;13 years old registered at the health
      insurance department of our facility. The estimate of the
      French national financial cost of the treatments for 1998 was
      calculated from public and private institutional
      information.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Results</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Treatment with
      topical steroids for 4&ndash;8 weeks was successful in ~85%
      of patients (mean age 5 years) and had no side-effects; the
      remaining 15% were treated by circumcision. Topical steroid
      therapy costs (in French francs) F 360 per patient. For those
      primarily treated by circumcision (81 boys, mean age 4.3
      years) and diagnosed as having phimosis, the cost was F 3330
      per patient in the private sector. The total number of
      circumcisions performed in France, regardless of sector
      (public or private) for 1998 was estimated to be 51 080,
      which represents an annual cost of F 195.7 million.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; As topical
      pharmacological treatment avoids the disadvantages, trauma
      and potential complications of penile surgery, including
      anaesthesia-related risks, the use of topical steroids as a
      primary treatment appears to be justified in boys with
      clinically verifiable phimosis. This treatment could reduce
      costs by 75%, which represents a potential annual saving of
      ~F 150 million.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">Phimosis consists of a pathological,
      cicatricial stricture of the foreskin that prevents it from
      being retracted to uncover the glans [<a href="#n1">1</a>].
      The affected foreskin has easily identifiable indurated white
      plaques or scar tissue at the preputial orifice that prevent
      its eversion. This is commonly a side-effect of lichen
      sclerosis et atrophicus, nonspecific chronic inflammatory
      processes, forcible premature retraction, or repeated
      infections that cause scarring and stricture of the foreskin
      [<a href="#n2">2</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
      is still much confusion over the definition of phimosis and
      therefore over the indications for intervention. At birth,
      the penis, like the rest of the body, remains premature. In
      the juvenile penis, developmental balanopreputial adherence,
      resistance of the preputial orifice to premature retraction,
      and the generous length of the prepuce are normal,
      physiological conditions. As such, they should not be
      designated as phimosis. The universality of these conditions
      suggests that they may serve useful functions. With or
      without balanopreputial adherence, physiological and
      developmental resistance to premature preputial retraction to
      various degrees (often unscientifically and unjustifiably
      called a 'tight' foreskin) is normal for boys from birth and
      resolves naturally over time. This process of penile
      development from less to more retractability can take almost
      two decades [<a href="#n3">3</a>]. No intervention is
      indicated and any attempts to hasten this natural process of
      development should be strongly discouraged.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;For genuine phimosis, as defined
      above, three treatment options are available, i.e. surgical
      amputation of the prepuce, topical pharmacological treatment,
      or no treatment. Because there are no studies examining the
      efficacy, benefit/risk value or cost-effectiveness of the
      last option, it is ignored for the purposes of this
      comparative study.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
      present, the most common treatment for genuine phimosis
      usually consists of the partial or total surgical resection
      of the prepuce, most often under general anaesthesia.
      However, in the past few years treatment by topical steroids
      (clobetasol or betamethasone 0.05%, applied locally) has been
      used as an alternative to circumcision [<a
      href="#n4">4-15</a>]. This pharmacological approach is rarely
      used in France, no doubt because the diffusion of information
      among paediatricians and GPs is poor. To evaluate as
      objectively as possible the potential of this new method of
      treating phimosis in risk/benefit terms, we systematically
      reviewed the available relevant publications. The medical
      community is required to improve its practices to ensure that
      patients receive treatment with the best benefit/risk value,
      and to use public health-care resources responsibly.
      Consequently, we also compared the two therapeutic approaches
      (surgery vs topical steroids) for their cost-effectiveness.
      Finally, we evaluated the magnitude of any potential savings
      from the national and regional database of the Programme de
      M&eacute;dicalisation des Syst&egrave;mes d'Information
      (PMSI) or French Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG) database in
      1998.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Methods</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">Surgery was compared with pharmacological
      treatment for genuine phimosis both as the cost (measured in
      French francs) of the resources needed for the treatment and
      as the effectiveness (measured in terms of success) of each
      strategy. Data on medical management were gathered from a
      review of the literature, based on a systematic search of
      Medline to September 2000. We used the terms phimosis,
      circumcision, phimosis-drug-therapy and glucocorticoids. Data
      relative to the surgical treatment were obtained by selecting
      all interventions corresponding to circumcision performed
      between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998 in the private
      sector, on patients aged &le;12 years and benefiting from the
      Provence department dealing with health insurance. Only those
      circumcisions confirmed by the surgeon to be for phimosis
      were included in the study.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs
      were computed from the viewpoint of the payer (national
      health insurance), over the total duration of the treatment.
      When the medical management was considered, the total
      duration of treatment was the time from the beginning of
      treatment to either certainty of cure or surgery. When the
      surgical treatment was considered, only the surgical
      admission was included. The volume of resources used (clinic
      visits, tests and drugs) was estimated from published data
      for patients treated medically. This is because
      pharmacological treatment for phimosis is presently seldom
      used in France, and the national health insurance database
      does not allow the identification of diagnoses and treatment
      patterns in outpatients. Medical resources were costed using
      the national reimbursement schedule. The costs of surgery
      were obtained directly from claims data.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      calculation of cost considered only the costs directly
      engendered by the surgical intervention (hospital stay,
      surgeon's and anaesthesiologist's fees, eventual
      supplementary medical examinations), or the cost
      reconstituted from the medical literature on the medicinal
      strategy (cost of medication and doctor's fees for two
      consultations with a specialist). The estimate of the total
      national expenditure in 1998 solely for circumcision
      (children <u>&lt;</u>12 years old) was created using the
      public and private national database. All medical admissions
      corresponding to a circumcision, regardless of the type of
      stay (full or outpatient) were selected.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Results</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">After a computerized and manual
      bibliographic search, 12 articles were obtained (all
      published in journals indexed in the Medline database),
      allowing an evaluation of the effectiveness and tolerance of
      topical steroid treatment. Among these there were two
      controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 10
      unrandomized studies, comprising a total of 1023 children and
      adolescents aged 1-15 years. The principal topical
      corticosteroids evaluated were betamethasone valerate 0.05%
      and clobetasol propionate 0.05%. Some studies recommended
      atraumatic retraction of the foreskin in association with the
      application of the drug.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 4-8
      week treatment of phimosis by topical steroids was effective
      in ~85% of patients (range 70-100%) and for a mean age at
      inclusion of 5 years. No adverse effects, either local or
      general, were reported. There was a 17% recurrence (partial
      or total) rate among the group treated successfully by a
      regimen ending after only 4 weeks. These recurrences
      generally responded favourably to a second 1-month course of
      treatment, at the end of which the success was definitive.
      The mean 15% failure rate of the pharmacological approach can
      be attributed to clinically verifiable cases of lichen
      sclerosis et atrophicus or nonspecific chronic inflammatory
      processes.</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of topical
      steroids appeared to be significantly better than that of
      placebo (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001) in one of the two RCTs [<a
      href="#n4">4</a>], whereas in the second a valid statistical
      conclusion could not be drawn, possibly because there were
      too few patients [<a href="#n5">5</a>]. The success rate for
      each age group and the mean duration of the steroid
      application can be compared, especially when the products
      used were identical; these results are presented in Table
      1.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Although it may appear that the radical surgical approach
      would be the most effective option in almost all cases,
      circumcision can lead to a recurrence of phimosis, caused
      particularly by retracted scars or incomplete circumcision
      [<a href="#n16">16</a>]. The rate of these recurrences was 2%
      [<a href="#n17">17</a>] but this could be an underestimate,
      for the values were generated in specialized centres, whereas
      in general practice it is common that circumcisions are
      carried out by young, inexperienced surgeons [<a
      href="#n18">18</a>] whose rate of complications is likely to
      be higher, although they are unreported.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Circumcision can also be followed by more serious
      complications. From published studies, there is significant
      morbidity associated with postoperative bleeding in 1-7% of
      patients [<a href="#n19">19,20</a>], infection, local or
      systemic in 4-8.5% [<a href="#n17">17,21,22</a>], meatitis
      and meatal ulceration in 8-31% [<a href="#n23">23</a>] and
      meatal stenosis in 8-11% [<a href="#n24">24,25</a>]. Some
      complications, fortunately rarer, have been described, e.g.
      urethral fistula, amputation of the glans penis, amputation
      of the entire penis, electrocautery destruction of the penis,
      ischaemia, penile necrosis, and even deaths linked to
      systemic infection [<a href="#n26">26,27</a>]. In a
      retrospective study from Sweden of children aged &lt; 12
      years and who had undergone circumcision for phimosis,
      Heinius <i>et al</i>.[<a href="#n28">28</a>] reported 34%
      with problems occurring in the first week after surgery, of
      which a third required hospitalization. Haemorrhaging
      required renewed surgical intervention in 6% of patients [<a
      href="#n29">29</a>]. In an English study conducted on 140
      children (mean age 4.3 years), the overall readmission rate
      was 5.6%, of which half were for persistent bleeding,
      vomiting and acute retention of urine, and the other half for
      meatal stenosis requiring a meatotomy [<a
      href="#n17">17</a>]. Moreover, there are also risks of
      complications inherent with local or general anaesthesia [<a
      href="#n30">30</a>], and the traumatic psychological aspects
      of such intervention in children [<a href="#n31">31</a>].
      Furthermore, because the movable foreskin plays an important
      role in the mechanical stimulation of the underlying penile
      structures, and because it is the most richly endowed part of
      the penis by specialized erogenous and tactile nerve
      structures, circumcision unavoidably results in a permanent
      reduction of erogenous sensitivity and responsiveness [<a
      href="#n32">32,33</a>]. The permanent externalization of the
      glans penis consequent to preputial amputation may also lead
      to desensitization of that structure. The nerve endings that
      lie just beneath the thin mucosal surface of the normal penis
      become progressively buried as the surface of the
      externalized glans undergoes keratinization [<a
      href="#n34">34</a>]. As such, circumcision is the least
      desirable option for the treatment of genuine phimosis.</p>

      <p><i>Evaluation of the cost of medical and surgical
      strategies</i></p>

      <p class="text1">The mean cost of the medical treatment of
      phimosis was set at F 360 per patient. In practice, this is a
      direct medical expense; this cost includes the price of the
      medication (F 60 for 20 g of betamethasone or clobetasol
      0.05% in cream or ointment) and the fees corresponding to two
      consultations with a specialist (urologist or paediatrician)
      before and after treatment (F 300).</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      study of 81 claims (mean age of the patients, 4.3 years) for
      a circumcision for phimosis (verified by the operating
      report) yield a mean (<font size="1">SD</font>) cost per
      patient of F 3330 (816) in private establishments. The cost
      of the medical stay, which is a direct cost, can be broken
      down into the price of the hospital stay, at F 2105 (562),
      fees, at F 1125 (307) and pharmacy, at F 100. This
      calculation did not include expenses attributable to eventual
      complications or recurrences. Furthermore, 27% of
      circumcisions were associated with frenuloplasty, which
      resulted in a slight increase in the total cost of the
      circumcision (+ 9.7%), and that 82% of circumcisions were
      performed under general anaesthesia. On the basis of an
      effectiveness rate of 85% for the medical treatment (at 8
      weeks) and of 100% for the surgical treatment, the savings
      brought about by the systematic use of the medicinal
      treatment would be 75%.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      1998, 3671 admissions for circumcision in those &lt;13 years
      old were recorded in our information system in the Provence
      Alpes C&ocirc;te d'Azur (PACA) region, i.e. 1550 in public
      hospitals and 2121 in private clinics; 9.2% of these medical
      stays were full hospitalizations (&gt;24 h) and the rest were
      outpatients. In the whole of France, 31 197 admissions
      uniquely for circumcision in the private sector were recorded
      for 1998. As for the public establishments, we only have
      access to the PMSI data for the PACA region. By postulating
      that there is no significant difference between the PACA
      population and the general population (the PACA region
      represents 7.67% of the population of France), the number of
      hospital stays for circumcision in the public hospitals was
      estimated to be 19 883. On the basis of an annual total of 51
      080 circumcisions, the total cost of these medical stays is
      estimated to be F 195.7 million. The mean cost of a medical
      stay, regardless of the type of reimbursement, is therefore F
      3831 (F 4885 in the public sector and F 3159 in the private
      sector).</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">The proper use of resources requires an
      evaluation of the effects and costs of any medical action.
      This is particularly true for phimosis, where the treatment
      has typically relied almost exclusively on circumcision. This
      radical approach may be among the therapeutic options in
      those cases of pathological cicatricial preputial stenosis
      subsequent to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus that have
      resisted all other means of conservative treatment, but it is
      unjustified as a 'treatment' for developmental
      balanopreputial adherence and physiological resistance to
      premature retraction. The incidence of these physiological
      stages of penile development is reportedly 4-10% [<a
      href="#n35">35</a>]. Indeed, almost all boys at birth have a
      prepuce that is adhered to the glans. In general, preputial
      adherence and resistance to premature retraction disappears
      over time, a process that can take almost two decades in some
      cases (Table 2).</p>

      <center>
        <p><img src="Table2.gif" alt="Table 2" /></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      legitimacy of the surgical approach as a primary treatment
      for genuine phimosis has recently been called into question
      by the publication of several clinical studies on the
      effectiveness of treating phimosis with topical steroids. The
      synthesis of these studies shows clearly that the topical
      steroids used are very effective (a mean of 80% success after
      4 weeks of treatment and 90% after 8 weeks) while being
      tolerated very well by young children (mean age 5 years). All
      of these studies included phimosis but only some of them
      included a subgroup analysis of the degree of severity before
      treatment [<a href="#n6">6,9,15</a>] or by age at the time of
      inclusion [<a href="#n7">7,10,12,15</a>]. As the degrees of
      severity varied depending on the study, any attempt at
      synthesis <i>a posteriori</i> would be doubtful and subject
      to criticism. However, the age of the patient does not seem
      to be a prognostic factor in the success of topical steroid
      treatment. The co-operation of the parents was not
      specifically studied, which is regrettable considering their
      important role in compliance with treatment. Similarly it is
      regrettable that the results of these studies were not
      analysed by 'intention to treat', as those children not
      complying (or more often their parents) were excluded from
      the study. However, these faults in methodology are of no
      consequence to the validity of the results or to the
      conclusions that can be drawn, because the follow-up rate is
      high and the difference in those responding or not to topical
      steroid treatment is large.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Furthermore, topical steroids, independent of their direct
      effect, seem to facilitate the atraumatic retraction of the
      foreskin by the lubricant contained in the product, as
      testified by <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/milanovic/">one</a> of the
      two RCTs [<a href="#n4">4</a>], and by a third unpublished
      controlled study [<a href="#n6">6</a>], which confirms the
      superiority of topical steroids over placebo. The mechanism
      of action of the topical steroid remains largely unknown.
      They could have an effect on the metabolism of arachidonic
      acid, a precursor to the mediators of skin inflammation, the
      prostanoids and the leukotrienes [<a href="#n36">36</a>].
      This anti- inflammatory effect is supported by a controlled
      RCT showing the specific effect on phimosis of a NSAID
      (diclofenac) topically administered as a lotion [<a
      href="#n37">37</a>]. Topical steroids can also have a direct
      effect on skin as they are capable of inhibiting the
      synthesis of hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts, and they have an
      antiproliferative effect on the epidermis [<a
      href="#n38">38</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      benefit/risk ratio for topical steroids, as estimated from
      published reports, contrasts with that of circumcision. The
      frequency of complications from circumcision (2-10%) [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>], their diversity and especially their
      potential seriousness, reduce the benefit/risk ratio compared
      with drugs, notably as a primary treatment. If only from the
      ethical perspective, it is no longer valid to consider
      treating phimosis by circumcision without having first
      attempted a minimum 4-week treatment with topical steroid,
      renewable if ineffective or for recurrence. If the such
      treatment is ineffective for confounding factors, e.g.
      clinically verifiable diseases such as lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus, then medically justified, case-specific
      therapeutic circumcision is legitimate. This new approach is
      supported by the results of the present economic
      analysis.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
      cost of treating phimosis by topical steroids is estimated as
      F 360, the savings gained by the systematic use of such
      agents as a primary treatment would be 75%, considering those
      cases resistant to drug treatment. When applied to a
      financial basis of F 195.7 million, this translates to
      savings of at least F 147 million annually. The estimate of F
      195.7 million is conservative, primarily because it does not
      include some medical stays deemed 'complicated' by other
      treatments. Additionally, circumcisions performed in some
      private offices were not included in the calculation. Most
      importantly, this estimate excludes the supplementary costs
      associated with the complications of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">Topical steroids are a real advance in the
      treatment of phimosis; this approach, which is supported by
      many studies, should induce medical decision-makers and
      practitioners to establish the local application of topical
      steroids as the standard practice for treating genuine
      phimosis. We conclude that circumcision cannot be justified,
      as it is in neither the patient's nor society's interest, and
      is incompatible with current standards of safety, ethics,
      effectiveness and rational spending.</span></p>
