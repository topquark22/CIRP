      size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></a></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">Phimosis is said to
      be the physiological condition of the newborn male with a
      tendency to spontaneous resolution. A fundamental
      misunderstanding of the normal developmental process by which
      the prepuce becomes retractile (by a process of desquamation)
      has lead to large numbers of inappropriate referrals for
      circumcision. In those symptomatic patients in which surgical
      intervention is indicated, circumcision has traditionally
      been regarded as the treatment of choice. However, there are
      many who might benefit from a more conservative approach -
      that of preputial plasty.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3"><b><a id="PATIENTS"
      name="PATIENTS">PATIENTS</a> AND METHODS</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3"><b>Selection
      Criteria</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">Children referred by
      their family doctor to the out-patient department with a
      phimosis were assessed and categorised along the lines
      described by Wahlin (1992). <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      Those with a phimosis and secondary scarring resulting in a
      stiff foreskin were listed for circumcision. Those with a
      narrow foreskin and a history of recurrent balanitis, voiding
      problems or local symptoms such as fissuration or bleeding,
      and thought suitable for a more conservative procedure, were
      recommended for preputioplasty. Those with a phimosis but
      without a history of local symptoms were reassured and
      discharged. Thirty patients recommended for preputioplasty
      were studied. All were followed up in the out-patients
      department at between 6-8 weeks following surgery.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3"><b>Operative
      Technique</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">Under general
      anaesthesia the foreskin is retracted and preputial adhesions
      released and the glans cleansed. Retraction of the foreskin
      reveals a clearly defined fibrous ring. Two laterally placed
      vertical incisions are then made directly over the fibrous
      ring and the transversely running fibrous bands divided to
      expose the underlying Bucks' fascia. With the foreskin
      retracted the defect (now transverse) is closed horizontally
      with interrupted 4-0 vicryl rapide. Postoperatively, patients
      are encouraged to retract the foreskin once comfortable to
      prevent preputial adhesions reforming (Figure 1).</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3"><b><a id="RESULTS"
      name="RESULTS">RESULTS</a></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">Thirty children
      between the ages of 1-16 years underwent lateral
      preputioplasty. All underwent day-case surgery under general
      anaesthesia. Patients were reviewed 6-8 weeks later in
      clinic.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">One patient
      developed a wound infection post-operatively and required a
      course of oral antibiotics. Following this he developed
      further preputial adhesions and subsequently underwent formal
      circumcision. All others had easily retractile foreskins and
      their symptoms resolved. Patient satisfaction was high and
      the cosmesis good. Patients were discharged with no further
      follow-up.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><a id="DISCUSSION" name="DISCUSSION"><font
      face="times new roman"
      size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></a></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">The normal
      development of the foreskin involves the separation of the
      glans and prepuce (both covered by a stratified squamous
      epithelium) by a process of desquamation which occurs at a
      variable time after birth. <sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> <sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> found that approximately 90% of boys
      by the age of five had retractile foreskins, a figure similar
      to that independently identified by <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a> some years
      later. <sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Its importance lies in
      distinguishing `pathological' phimosis from the
      `physiological' non-retractile foreskin. It has been apparent
      for some time that too many patients are referred for
      circumcision because of the lack of understanding that there
      exists of normal preputial development. Non-retractility is
      the physiological condition of the newborn male with
      spontaneous tendency towards resolution. There is no role for
      prophylactic surgical intervention.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">Indications for
      surgical intervention most frequently include recurrent
      balanoposthitis and local symptoms such as voiding problems
      and fissuration. Repeated infections may result in a rigid
      fibrous foreskin and with the changes of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans. It is characterised by dermal oedema, lymphocytic
      infiltration and basal cell degeneration with atrophy at the
      stratum malpighi. <sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> While
      medical and, more recently, laser treatment has been reported
      successful <sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>, circumcision
      remains the mainstay of treatment. However, in that the
      purpose in the majority of cases is to achieve retractility
      of a narrowed foreskin to avoid further scarring, a preputial
      `plasty' should be the preferred option.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">Circumcision is
      associated with considerable morbidity, as it is often
      delegated to unsupervised junior surgeons, and its associated
      morbidity is probably greater than that reported from the
      teaching centres. <sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> More
      recently, concern has been raised over the needless loss of
      the prepuce. <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor et
      al</a> (1996) <sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> describe the
      prepuce as a structural and functional unit, a combination of
      smooth mucosa and true skin which act together to allow a
      specialised `ridged band' to be deployed onto the shaft of
      the penis, providing a surrogate sensitivity to the glans and
      the penile shaft, possibly mediating the afferent limb of the
      ejaculatory reflex. While the clinically scarred prepuce
      (because of recurrent infection or xerotica balanitis
      obliterans) represent absolute indications for circumcision,
      the remainder are suitable for more conservative
      treatment.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">A number of
      preputial plasty techniques have been described. The dorsal
      split involves both fibrous ring and dorsal prepuce being
      divided. It is associated with an oedematous and
      hyper-trophic ventral prepuce and a poor cosmetic result.
      Holmlund (1997) <sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> modified the
      procedure describing a dorsal incision where the prepuce was
      retracted to expose the fibrous ring over which an incision
      was made. The circular fibrous strands were identified and
      divided with a knife. The incision was closed transversely
      with interrupted sutures. However, single plasty techniques
      have tended to give cosmetically unsatisfactory results with
      an apparent cleft defomity. Multiple incision plasty
      techniques are also described and are said to spread the
      deformity around the circumference. <sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> These however, along with the more
      complicated V-Y <sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>, Z-plasty
      <sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> and helicoid plasty
      techniques <sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> have failed to
      gain popular acceptance because of the complexity of the
      procedures, (although they may have a specific role when
      operating on the microphallus).</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">A lateral
      preputioplasty is a simple technique and safely carried out
      by junior surgeons. It has not been previously described. In
      particular, it avoids the frenular area of the penis making
      it a quick, easy and safe operation.</font></p>

      <p><font face="times new roman" size="3">In our experience it
      is associated with an excellent cosmetic result. Its success
      was evident by the absence of serious bleeding problems, the
      improvement in post-operative morbidity and the high level of
      patient satisfaction. While follow-up was not extended beyond
      the initial first visit, there is little evidence to suggest
      that extended follow-up is helpful, as the initial visit
      appears to accurately reflect the success or failure of the
      procedure. <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> With increasing
      evidence of the role of the foreskin a more conservative
      approach is advocated and, while a scarred prepuce will
      always need circumcision, a lateral preutioplasty is
      recommended as a more conservative measure</font></p>
