        antibiotics prescribed by his general practitioner. This
        left him with further preputial adhesions and he later

        preputioplasty when presenting with a symptomatic phimosis
        in the absence of significant scarring of the prepuce. It

        which is only now beginning to emerge.</b>

      <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

      <p>Phimosis is said to be the physiological condition of the
      newborn with a tendency to spontaneous resolution. A
      fundamental misunderstanding of the normal developmental
      process by which the prepuce becomes retractile (by a process
      of desquamation) has led to large numbers of inappropriate
      referral for circumcision. In those symptomatic patients in
      which surgical intervention is indicated, circumcision has
      traditionally been regarded as the treatment of choice.
      However, there are many who might benefit from a more
      conservative approach - that of preputial plasty.</p>

      <p><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</b></p>

      <p><b>Selection criteria</b></p>

      <p>Children referred by their family doctors to the
      out-patient department with a phimosis were assessed and
      categorized along the lines described by Wahlin
      (1992).<sup>1</sup> Those with a phimosis and secondary
      scarring resulting in a stiff foreskin were listed for
      circumcision. Those with a narrow foreskin and a history of
      recurrent balanitis, voiding problems or local symptoms such
      as fissuration or bleeding, and though suitable for a more
      conservative procedure, were recommended for preputioplasty.
      Those with a phimosis but without a history of local symptoms
      were reassured and discharged. Thirty patients recommended
      for preputioplasty were studied. All were followed up in the
      out-patients department at between 6-8 weeks following
      surgery.</p>

      <p><b>Operative technique</b></p>

      <p>Under general anaesthesia the foreskin is retracted and
      preputial adhesions released and the glans cleansed.
      Retraction of the foreskin reveals a clearly defined fibrous
      ring. Two laterally placed vertical incisions are then made
      directly over the fibrous ring and the transversely running
      fibrous bands divided to expose the underlying Bucks' fascia.
      With the foreskin retracted the defect (now transverse) is
      closed horizontally with interrupted 4-0 vicryl rapide.
      Post-operatively, patients are encouraged to retract the
      foreskin to prevent preputial adhesions reforming (Figure
      1).</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS</b></p>

      <p>Thirty children between the ages of 1-16 years underwent
      lateral preputioplasty. All underwent day-case surgery under
      general anaesthesia. Patients were reviewed 6-8 weeks later
      in clinic.</p>

      <p>One patient developed a wound infection post-operatively
      and required a course of oral antibiotics. Following this he
      developed further preputial adhesions and subsequently
      underwent formal circumcision. All others had easily
      retractile foreskin and their symptoms resolved. Patient
      satisfaction was high and the cosmesis good. Patients were
      discharged with on further followup.</p>

      <b>DISCUSSION</b> 

      <p>The normal development of the foreskin involves the
      separation of the glans and prepuce (both covered by a
      stratified squamous epithelium) by a process of desquamation
      which occurs at a variable time after birth.<sup>2</sup>
      Gairdner<sup>3</sup> found that approximately 90% of boys by
      the age of five had retractile foreskins, a figure similar to
      that independently identified by Oster some years
      later.<sup>4</sup> Its importance lies in distinguishing
      `pathological' phimosis from the `physiological'
      non-retractile foreskin. It has been apparent for some time
      that too many patients are referred for circumcision because
      of the lack of understanding that exists of normal preputial
      development. Non-retractility is the physiological condition
      of the newborn male with spontaneous tendency toward
      resolution. There is no role for prophylactic surgical
      intervention.</p>

      <p>Indications for surgical intervention most frequently
      include recurrent balanoposthitis and local symptoms such as
      voiding problems and fissuration. Repeated infections may
      result in a rigid fibrous foreskin and with the changes of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans. It is characterised by dermal
      oedema, lymphocytic infiltration and basal cell degeneration
      with atrophy at the stratum malpighi.<sup>2</sup> While
      medical and more recently, laser treatment have been reported
      successful<sup>5</sup>, circumcision remains the mainstay of
      treatment. However, in that the purpose in the majority of
      cases is to achieve retractility of a narrowed foreskin to
      avoid further scarring, a preputial `plasty' should be the
      preferred option.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is associated with considerably morbidity, as
      it is often delegated to unsupervised junior surgeons, and
      its associated morbidity is probably considerably greater
      than that reported from the teaching centers.<sup>6</sup>
      More recently concern has been raised over the needless loss
      of the prepuce. Taylor et al (1996)<sup>7</sup> describe the
      prepuce as a structural and functional unit, a combination of
      smooth mucosa and functional skin which act together to allow
      a specialized `ridged band' to be deployed onto the shaft of
      the penis, providing a surrogate sensitivity to the glans and
      the penile shaft, possibly mediating the afferent limb of the
      ejaculatory reflex. While the clinically scarred prepuce
      (because of the recurrent infection or xerotica balanitis
      obiterans) represent absolute indications for circumcision,
      the remainder are suitable for conservative treatment.</p>

      <p>A number of preputial plasty techniques have been
      described. The dorsal split involves both fibrous ring and
      dorsal prepuce being divided. It is associated with an
      oedematous and hypertrophic ventral prepuce and poor cosmetic
      result and a poor cosmetic result. Holmlund
      (1997)<sup>8</sup> modified the procedure describing a dorsal
      incision where the prepuce was retracted to expose a fibrous
      ring over which an incision was made. The circular fibrous
      strands were identified and divided with a knife. The
      incision was closed transversely with interrupted sutures.
      However, single plasty techniques have tended to give
      cosmetically unsatisfactory results with an apparent cleft
      deformity. Multiple incsion techniques have been described
      and are said to spread the deformity around the
      circumference.<sup>1</sup> These however, along with the more
      complicated V-Y<sup>9</sup>, Z-plasty<sup>10</sup> and
      helicoids plasty techniques<sup>11</sup> have failed to win
      popular acceptance because of the complexity of the
      procedures, although they may have a specific role when
      operating on the microphallus).</p>

      <p>A lateral preputioplasty is a simple technique and safely
      carried out by junior surgeons. It has not been previously
      described. In particular it avoids the frenular area and the
      penis making it a quick, easy and safe operation.</p>

      <p>In our experience, it is associate with an excellent
      cosmetic result. Its success was evident by the absence of
      serious bleeding problems, the improvement in post-operative
      morbidity and the high level of patient satisfaction. While
      follow-up was not extended beyond the initial first visit,
      there is little evidence to suggst that extended follow-up is
      helpful, as the initial visit appears to accurately reflect
      the success or failure of the procedure.<sup>1</sup> With
      increasing evidence of the role of the foreskin a more
      conservative approach is advocated and, while a scarred
      prepuce will always need circumcision, a lateral
      preputioplasty is recommended as a more conservative
      measure.</p>
