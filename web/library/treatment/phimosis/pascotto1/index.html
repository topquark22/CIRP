       preputial plasty</h2>

      <p>Pascotto R, Giancotti E.</p>

      <p>Divisione di Chirurgia d'Urgenza, ASL Napoli 1, <a

      <p>BACKGROUND: To device a new surgical technique of
      preputial plasty for the treatment of phimosis, as an
      alternative to circumcision, easy to perform, which preserves
      the normal function of the prepuce.</p>

      <p>METHODS: The new technique consists of three lengthwise
      incisions of the stenosing wase [sic] and their diagonal
      suture, the triple incision preputial plasty, described by
      others, modified adding frenulotomy and two more incisions
      between the previous ones, which are left to heal
      spontaneously. This technique has been applied on 22 children
      over a period of 24 months, with a follow-up of
      six-twenty-four months.</p>

      <p>RESULTS: The technique is easy to perform. All check-ups
      show good cosmetic results, no recurrence, normal preputial
      anatomy and function. It is important to continue "preputial
      gymnastics" until stabilization.</p>

      <p>CONCLUSIONS: <span class="yellow">The devised technique
      fully succeeds in preserving a normal prepuce</span>, it is
      easier to perform and safer than other preputial plasties and
      it may be carried out in all cases of phimosis in pediatrics.
      The good results achieved encourage us to continue along this
      path, hoping that the technique will be largely applied.</p>
