        <p><i>Abstract</i></p>

        <p><b>Objectives.</b> From 1997 through 1998, we conducted
        a prospective study to evaluate the long-term outcome of
        using topical steroids in the treatment of childhood
        phimosis.</p>

        <p><b>Methods.</b> Both the parents and their children were
        instructed to apply 0.05% betamethasone cream topically
        twice a day for 1 month and to retract the prepuce after
        the fifth day of treatment. Results were evaluated at the
        end of the treatment and 6 months later.</p>

        <p><b>Results.</b> One hundred thirty-seven boys were
        evaluated. The median age was 5.4 years. At initial
        presentation, 61 boys had a phimotic but retractable
        prepuce, 37 had a nonretractable phimotic ring, and 39 had
        a pinpoint opening. Patients with a history of previous
        forcible foreskin retractions were considered to have
        secondary phimosis. By 6 months following treatment, 90%
        (124 children) had an easily retractable prepuce without a
        phimotic ring. No differences were seen in the response
        rate between those with primary and secondary phimosis. In
        all cases, the treatment was well tolerated without local
        or systemic side effects. All the patients with persistent
        or recurrent phimosis were found to be noncompliant with
        the suggested daily foreskin care.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusions.</b> <span class="yellow">Topical steroid
        for the treatment of phimosis is a safe, simple, and
        inexpensive procedure that avoids surgery and its
        associated risks. It is effective both in primary and in
        secondary phimosis.</span> We emphasize the importance of
        proper and regular foreskin care and hypothesize on the
        mechanism of action of the steroids.</p>

      <p><b><font size="5">T</font></b>he prepuce is <a
      href="/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/">a specialized, highly
      innervated, junctional mucocutaneous tissue</a> that forms
      the anatomic covering of the glans penis.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> At birth, it is not retractable
      because the inner epithelial surface is fused to the glans;
      this normal anatomic condition in infants is often mistaken
      as phimosis. Within 2 to 3 years, the foreskin detaches from
      the glans following the formation of keratinized
      pearls.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> This, together with
      intermittent erections, allows the foreskin to separate,
      resulting in a physiologic retraction. In 80% to 90% of
      uncircumcised boys, the foreskin can be retracted over the
      glans by 3 years of age,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      although isolated adherent areas in the coronal margin may
      persist.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is not only one of the oldest and more
      commonly performed surgical procedures, but it is also a
      source of dilemma and controversy.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> In countries such as the United States
      and Canada and in communities such as the Jewish community,
      it is frequently performed during the neonatal period for
      prophylactic or religious reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> In contrast, about 80% of the world
      population does not practice routine neonatal circumcision,
      and the aesthetic of an uncircumcised phallus is accepted
      culturally.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>In uncircumcised males, adequate care and hygiene of the
      prepuce during childhood are of fundamental importance. In
      the absence of routine care and hygiene, a pathologic
      phimosis can result from a preputial ring becoming fibrotic,
      preventing the foreskin from fully retracting.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> [<font color="red">CIRP Note: The
      previous statement is a medical myth. There is no scientific
      evidence to support such an assertion. Proper care of the

      In cases of pathologic phimosis, surgical correction is the
      standard treatment. However, in recent years, the topical
      application of steroids provides an alternative to the
      management of this disease.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      Herein, we present our results of the treatment of pathologic
      phimosis with topical steroids in a large group of patients,
      of diverse age, and with long follow-up. We hypothesize on
      the mechanism of action of topical steroids, focusing on the
      importance of developing routine foreskin hygiene for
      long-term satisfactory results.</p>

      <p><b>Patients and methods</b></p>

      <p>From 1997 through 1998 all boys referred to our outpatient
      clinic for surgical treatment of phimosis and who were
      considered to have a phimotic foreskin were offered topical
      treatment with steroids. Phimosis was defined as the presence
      of a constrictive preputial ring that resulted in a
      cone-shaped foreskin.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> None of
      the patients had previously undergone a circumcision. Those
      boys with signs of balanitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans
      (BXO) were excluded. The types of phimosis were classified as
      (1) retractable when a tight and constricting phimotic ring
      existed, but it did not completely prevent the retraction of
      the foreskin; (2) nonretractable when the ring prevented the
      retraction of the foreskin, but the external urethral meatus
      was exposed; and (3) pinpoint when the foreskin was so
      constricted that the meatus could not be visualized.
      Preputial hygiene habits and previous history of forcible
      retractions were assessed; patients with a previous history
      of forcible foreskin retractions were considered to have
      secondary phimosis. [<font color="red">CIRP Comment: It is
      probable that the boys in this study did not have true
      phimosis because those boys with BXO and balanitis were
      excluded. The boys apparently had <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis#phony">phony phimosis</a>,
      which usually requires no treatment since it tends to resolve
      itself with increasing maturity.</font>]</p>

      <p>Both the parents and the patients (when they were old
      enough to understand) were instructed to apply a thin layer
      of 0.05% betamethasone cream on the prepuce twice a day (in
      the morning and evening) for 4 weeks. After the fifth day of
      treatment, they were asked to gently retract the foreskin
      several times after applying the cream. They were also
      encouraged to retract the foreskin when they voided and
      during their daily bath. The importance of complying with
      these care measures was strongly emphasized. Patients were
      evaluated after 5 weeks and at 6 months. The outcome was
      defined as (1) a success if the prepuce was retractable and
      was without a ring; (2) a partial response when both the
      physician and the parents noted that there was a subjective
      improvement but not a complete disappearance of the ring; and
      (3) a failure if a constrictive ring persisted. Boys who had
      a partial response or a failure underwent a second course of
      topical treatment after discontinuing its usage for 1 month.
      Results for primary and secondary phimosis and in different
      age groups or type of phimosis at presentation were analyzed
      with the use of the chi-square test.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p>One hundred fifty-one boys entered the study and 137 were
      available for follow-up. During the same period, 11
      circumcisions were performed in patients that did not enter
      the study for several reasons (including rejection of topical
      treatment, suspicion of BXO, other associated surgeries, or
      inability to perform the treatment). The ages of the patients
      ranged between 13 months and 14 years, with a median age of
      5.4 years. At initial presentation, 61 patients had a
      retractable but phimotic prepuce, 37 had a nonretractable
      prepuce, and 39 had a pinpoint prepuce. None of the patients
      practiced daily retraction of their foreskin prior to
      entering the study, and 71% (98 of 137) were considered to
      have secondary phimosis.</p>

      <p>Five weeks after enrolment, 82% (112 patients) had a
      successful result, 12% (17 patients) had a partial response,
      and 6% (8 patients) were considered failures; the latter 25
      patients underwent a second course of treatment. At 6 months
      of follow-up, 90% (124 patients) had a retractable prepuce
      without recurrence of phimosis: 110 after one course of
      treatment and 14 after two courses. In the remaining 13
      patients (3 of them after an initial success, 4 after initial
      partial response, and 6 after initial failure), phimosis
      recurred or persisted. On careful evaluation, all of these
      patients were found to be noncompliant with the suggested
      daily foreskin care. They subsequently underwent
      circumcision. The histopathologic study of the prepuce showed
      nonspecific dermal fibrosis.</p>

      <p>Success rate was similar for patients with primary or
      secondary phimosis and for the different age groups (Table
      I). No differences in outcome were found related to the
      appearance of the prepuce at initial evaluation (retractable,
      nonretractable, or pinpoint prepuce) (Table II). In all
      cases, the procedure was well tolerated without evidence of
      atrophic skin changes as well as systemic or local side
      effects because of steroid absorption. In general, boys older
      than 6 years performed the retraction by themselves, and, in
      younger boys, the retraction was done by the parent.</p>

      <p><b>Comment</b></p>

      <p>Pathologic phimosis is a common problem throughout the
      world. In Europe, Asia, South America, and Central America
      neonatal circumcision is not routinely performed, thus
      childhood phimosis is not rare. In addition, in the United
      States and Canada the rates of neonatal circumcision,
      estimated to be 60% to 90%,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> are
      declining.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Thus, even in the
      United States and Canada, phimosis is a commonly faced
      problem. Obviously, one of the difficulties that arises when
      studying phimosis is the lack of a clear definition and
      differentiation between a pathologic phimosis and a
      physiologic nonretractile foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> In our study, nonretractable and
      pinpoint prepuces correspond to type II and type I of the
      classification by <a href="/library/normal/kayaba/">Kayaba et
      al.</a><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> The cases classified
      as ''retractable'' phimosis might not be considered
      pathologic by others because of a potential for spontaneous
      resolution with increasing age. However, all patients
      included in our study were originally referred for
      circumcision, they all had a constrictive ring for which they
      had sought medical attention, and they would have been
      considered candidates for circumcision if topical therapy had
      not been offered. [CIRP note: These doctors show the common
      inability to distinguish between normal in childhood
      developmentally narrow foreskin and a pathological condition
      called phimosis.]</p>

      <p>In the treatment of childhood phimosis, surgical
      correction has been for many years the standard. In this age
      group, circumcision requires general anesthesia. Although
      circumcision is associated with a low complication rate,
      potential problems, such as bleeding, unaesthetic scar, or
      meatitis with meatal stenosis, do occur.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Surgical alternatives to circumcision,
      such as preputial plasty, also require anesthesia and have up
      to 4% recurrence rate.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> In
      recent years, topical application of steroids has provided an
      effective nonsurgical treatment for phimosis,<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and this treatment is, at present, the
      recommended management of phimosis by the <a
      href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australasian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons</a>.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> When
      evaluating costs, steroid creams are also the most
      cost-effective treatment; $758 to $800 per treatment compared
      with $2512 to $3241 for surgery (either conventional
      circumcision or preputial plasty).<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p>Previous series using topical steroids for phimosis have
      demonstrated a high success rate, ranging from 67% to
      95%.<sup><a href="#n7">7, 8, 9, 10, 11</a></sup> Our result
      of 90% success rate is similar; however, to our knowledge,
      our report has longer follow-up, allowing for assessment of
      long-term outcome. Of importance, we did not find
      statistically significant differences in the response rate
      when stratifying the patients on the basis of age or type of
      phimosis at presentation. Moreover, we showed for the first
      time that the treatment is equally beneficial when a previous
      history of forcible foreskin retractions (secondary phimosis)
      is present. Of interest, we observed that in most cases the
      response to topical steroid treatment was durable at the
      6-month follow-up. We believe that both failure and
      recurrence rate are clearly related to the discontinuation of
      regular foreskin retraction and hygiene. This belief was
      evident in cases in which the child had a successful initial
      response but phimosis recurred when daily retraction of the
      foreskin was discontinued. Furthermore, in a study in which
      the parents were instructed not to make any specific attempt
      at foreskin retraction, the success rate was lower, and,
      because there was no follow-up after the first month, the
      possible recurrence of phimosis was not evaluated.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> These observations suggest that
      topical steroids act temporarily in treating phimosis, and it
      is the change of habits in the local handling of the foreskin
      that is key to long-term success.</p>

      <p>In our study, the use of topical steroids in children was
      safe, and signs of skin atrophy or systemic absorption were
      not seen. None of the cases of poor compliance were related
      to pain or irritation secondary to the application of the
      steroid cream. Although, theoretically, there might be a risk
      of systemic effects, such as suppression of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, this risk is low because
      the quantity of cream applied and the skin surface to which
      it is applied are very small. To avoid increased absorption,
      it was emphasized in all cases to use small amounts of cream
      only in the constrictive ring and not to use occlusive
      dressings. <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/milanovic/">Golubovic et
      al.</a><sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> demonstrated that
      topical steroid treatment for phimosis did not significantly
      change morning cortisol levels. In our series, 4 boys younger
      than 2 years of age were treated with betamethasone cream
      without any local or systemic side effects. For these
      patients, the families were strongly advised of the potential
      risks and to carefully monitor for signs of toxicity (eg,
      headaches, vomiting). Other studies similarly showed no side
      effects in treating children younger than 4 years of age with
      topical steroids.<sup><a href="#n18">18,19</a></sup> The
      number of children in this age group treated in these
      studies, however, is limited.</p>

      <p>The main effect of betamethasone cream is likely to be in
      its local anti-inflammatory activity. Although not proven, we
      speculate that the mechanism of action of topical steroids on
      the phimotic ring is similar to that in the treatment of BXO
      (also known as lichen sclerous et atrophicus or LSA).<sup><a
      href="#n20">20, 21, 22</a></sup> Even though the pathogenesis
      of BXO/LSA and phimosis are probably different, they both
      have mucocutaneous thinning and dermal fibrosis on histology.
      With the use of clobetasol dipropionate for treating LSA,
      Dahlman-Ghozlan et al.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
      recently showed that its effect is most likely exerted
      through restoring the balance of collagen synthesis by the
      fibroblasts and thus improving the preexisting epidermal
      atrophy. We suggest that in phimosis, topical steroid
      treatment similarly improves the elasticity of the foreskin.
      This improved elasticity together with the moisturizing
      effect of the cream allows the child to easily retract the
      prepuce and perform daily hygiene. [<font color="red">CIRP
      note: Daily retraction is <i>not</i> necessary according to
      the <a href="/library/normal/aap1999/">AAP</a>.</font>] These
      routine care measures will help to prevent the recurrence of
      phimosis.</p>

      <p>Parents' preference should play a role and when, for
      whatever reason, they decide not to circumcise a child in the
      newborn period, it remains the physician's duty to educate
      them and provide them with <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/4pam.pdf">guidelines for
      foreskin care</a>. In a child younger than 1 year of age, it
      is adequate just to see the meatus. [<font color="red">CIRP
      Note: There is no medical or scientific basis for the
      previous statement.</font>] Between the ages of 2 and 5
      years, local care should consist of careful retraction and
      cleaning during bathing with progressive exposure of the
      glans.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> [<font color="red">CIRP
      Note: The foreskin of a small child should never be retracted
      in the bathwater because the bathwater is likely to contain
      fecal matter carrying <i>E. coli</i>, the cause of most
      UTI.</font>] Forcible retraction should be avoided because it
      causes pain and bleeding, contributing to future adhesions
      and cicatrix formation that might lead to phimosis.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> In our experience, noncompliance to
      these measures is due to lack of knowledge regarding the
      proper care of the foreskin.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup>
      By complying with these care measures, it is estimated that
      less than 1% of the infants will have a foreskin problem
      later in life<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> (with an
      incidence of phimosis as low as 0.4 cases/1000 boys per year
      and, cumulatively, 0.6% of boys affected by their 15th
      birthday <sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>). We encourage
      fathers, whether or not they are circumcised, to play a role
      in the daily care of their child's foreskin. We suggest that
      the success of the nonsurgical management of phimosis be
      initially due to the effect of the steroids on the narrowed
      prepuce. Its success, however, will eventually depend on
      acquiring the habit of gently retracting the foreskin when
      voiding and during bathing.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, topical treatment of phimosis
      with corticosteroids is a simple, safe, and economical
      procedure. It obtains excellent results in diverse age groups
      and is well accepted by parents despite the fact that they
      have to play a more active role in the care of the
      foreskin.</p>
