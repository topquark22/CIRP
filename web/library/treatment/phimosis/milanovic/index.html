        <p><b>Objective</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; To further test the
        application of topical steroids in boys referred to a
        paediatric surgical practice with pathological,
        non-retractable foreskins diagnosed as phimosis.</p>

        <p><b>Patients and Methods</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This prospective
        study comprised two groups of 20 boys each (mean age 4.1
        years, range 3-6) diagnosed as having phimosis, twice
        daily, a topical steroid (0.05% betamethasone cream) was
        applied on the narrowed preputial skin in the first group
        and a neutral cream (Vaseline) in the second (control)
        group. Patients were treated for 4 weeks and the
        retractability of the foreskin and any side-effects
        assessed.</p>

        <p><b>Results</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good retraction of the
        foreskin was achieved in 19 patients with betamethasone
        cream and the response was unsatisfactory in 16 patients
        from the control groups; these 16 boys and one 6-year old
        boy treated with betamethasone were circumcized. There were
        no side-effects or problems after the application of either
        cream.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Treatment with 0.05%
        betamethasone cream is a simple and safe method for the
        treatment of phimosis in boys older than 3 years. An early
        operation is necessary in cases of genuine phimosis when 1
        month of treatment with topical steroids has failed. We
        strongly support the saying, `The fortunate foreskin of an
        infant boy will usually be left well alone by everyone but
        its owner'.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The suspicion of phimosis in boys is more
      frequent than its real occurrence: the diagnosis of phimosis
      is often used for different non-obstructive conditions of the
      foreskin, e. g. preputial adhesions or a tight prepuce<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. Typically, the foreskin is
      unretractable at the time of birth but this condition
      generally resolves in the first 4 years of life<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>. The incidence of phimosis decreases
      from 8 to 1% in adolescence<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and
      surgery has been the only treatment for boys aged &gt;3 years
      with a diagnosed phimosis<sup><a href="#n4">4,5</a></sup>.
      Recently, topical steroids were introduced as an alternative
      treatment for phimosis <sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> and the
      present study examined the effectiveness of betamethasone in
      a prospective trial.</p>

      <p><b>Patients and methods</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Between October 1994 and October 1995, 40
      boys (mean age 4.1 years, range 3-6 were included in a
      prospective study of the efficacy of 0.05% betamethasone
      cream in the treatment of phimosis. Phimosis was defined as
      an unretractable foreskin with no adhesions but with a
      circular band of constriction making complete retraction
      impossible. (Fig. 1)</p>

      <p class="text2">Two groups of 20 boys each were
      prospectively assessed in a double-blind, ramdomised trial:
      the first group of patients was treated with betamethasone
      cream applied on the narrowed</p>

      <p align="center">Fig. 1 A typical phimosis of the foreskin
      before treatment.</p>
      <hr />

      <p class="text1">preputial skin and the second (control)
      placebo group treated with neutral cream (Vaseline). The
      parents were instructed to apply a thin layer of cream on the
      child's foreskin, from the coronal groove to the meatus,
      twice daily for 4 weeks. They were asked not to attempt to
      retract the foreskin during the first two weeks of treatment,
      but after this period the narrowed foreskin becomes soft and
      elastic and parents were encouraged to then retract the
      foreskin gently and gradually.</p>

      <p class="text2">The patients were considered cured if the
      foreskin was fully retractable at 4 weeks, and the outcome
      was also determined 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. The
      protocol was not repeated and those patients not cured after
      4 weeks of therapy were referred for surgery. All the
      patients were examined at 1, 14, and 28 days after the start
      of treatment and the cortisol levels assessed using a blood
      spot test (Soft Touch, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) 1 h
      after the morning application of cream.</p>
      <b>Results</b> 

      <p class="text2">The results were assessed after a mean
      follow-up of 10.5 months (range 6-18); no local or systemic
      side-effects occurred after treatment. Good retraction of the
      foreskin was achieved in 19 patients treated with
      betamethasone cream (Fig. 2) but the response was
      unsatisfactory in 16 patients from the control group</p>
      <hr />

      <p align="center">[Photograph]</p>

      <p class="text1">(P&lt;0.001); these 16 boys and one 6 year
      old boy from the treated group were circumcized. A
      histological examination by one pathologist confirmed lichen
      sclerosis et atrophicus in four excised foreskins,
      non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrate in 11 and normal
      skin in two.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mean (sd) amount of cream applied per
      patient per treatment was 9.5 (3.2)g. giving a mean (sd) 47.5
      (16) mg of active substance applied topically per patient per
      treatment or 1.53 mg. daily. The mean (sd) morning bloodspot
      cortisol levels were not significantly different between the
      two groups, at 271.1 (39.13.) nmol/T. in those treated with
      betamethasone and 295 (41.1) nmof/L in the control group
      (P=0.958).</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Congenital physiological phimosis regresses
      spontaneously in the first years of life but unfortunately
      this resolution is difficult to predict <sup><a
      href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>. Although the symptoms in the
      present patients were ambigious and generally mild, the main
      reason for presentation of such patients to a paediatric
      surgical practice is the concern of their parents<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>. The Christian orthodox and most other
      European cultures prefer to leave the foreskin intact and
      thus circumcision is not accepted easily unless unavoidable.
      Therefore, in the present study, the parents were usually
      pleased when a conservative treatment with topical steroid
      was proposed.</p>

      <p class="text2">The histological assessment of the excised
      foreskins from circumcised patients showed findings similar
      to those reported previously<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,11</a></sup> and the present results using
      topical steroids agree with those published previously
      <sup><a href="#n6">6,12-14</a></sup>. There were no local or
      systemic side-effects after treatment with topical steroid;
      0.05% betamethasone cream applied to the foreskin involves
      &lt;0.1% of the total body area and thus such effects are
      very unlikely.</p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, treatment with a topical steroid
      is a simple, safe and painless method for the treatment of
      phimosis in boys older than three years. We strongly support
      the saying, "the fortunate foreskin of an infant boy will
      usually be left alone by everyone but its owner.<sup><a
