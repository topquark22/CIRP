      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <b>A penile problem that physicians are confronted with
          in the emergency room is entrapment of the foreskin by a
          zipper fastener. A case presentation and a simple
          technique for its management are described.</b>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">A 3-year old boy was brought to the
      emergency room after his mother had accidentally trapped the
      penile prepuce between the fastener and the zipper while
      dressing him. After several painless and fruitless attempts
      to free the entrapped foreskin she cut the zipper from the
      pants (fig. 1) and brought the child to the hospital. The
      child was anesthetized because of extreme anxiety and poor
      cooperation. Separation of the zipper from the teeth was
      accomplished by squeezing the median bar of the zipper with a
      bone cutter. There was minimal trauma to the foreskin and the
      child was sent home the same morning.</p>

      <p align="center"><small>DISCUSSION</small></p>

      <p class="text2">Entrapment of the foreskin between the
      fastener and the teeth usually occurs when the zipper is
      being opened because the movement is downwards and toward the
      body. This factor allows for accessibility to the median bar
      of the zipper fastener. (fig. 1)</p>

      <p class="text2">Management of this problem has included
      circumcision<sup>1</sup> or extraction of the foreskin by
      manipulation.<sup>2</sup> Problems with circumcision include
      pre-existing local edema, lack of psychological preparation
      and possible cultural taboos. Extraction by manipulation
      usually is prolonged, painful and often
      counterproductive.</p>

      <p class="text2">We suggest the following approach. A bone
      cutting plier is applied to the median bar (fig.2). Squeezing
      this bar will permit the whole zipper to fall apart and
      release the trapped skin. If this maneuver is applied
      initially a cooperative and grateful patient is the result.
      However, previous attempts to extract the foreskin,
      especially in young children, may have caused considerable
      pain, and therefore, will require either local or general
      anesthesia.</p>
