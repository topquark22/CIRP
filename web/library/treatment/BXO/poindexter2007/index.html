      <p>Lichen sclerosus is a chronic mucocutaneous inflammatory
      condition affecting both adults and children in a bimodal age
      distribution. Children can present as young as 6 months of
      age but average around 5 years. Females present with vulvar
      itching, soreness, dysuria, or gastrointestinal complaints,
      while males tend to have difficulty retracting the foreskin
      leading to phimosis. On examination, white smooth atrophic
      plaques are found in the anogenital region with atrophy and
      possible distortion of anatomy. LS in children has been
      commonly misdiagnosed as sexual abuse, leading to delay in
      appropriate diagnosis and unnecessary turmoil for families.
      It is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition possibly
      due to autoimmunity. When evaluating patients, a complete
      history can help guide which patients may benefit from a
      systemic evaluation for autoimmune disease. Although some
      patients have spontaneous resolution during puberty, many do
      not. There is a significant risk of squamous cell carcinoma
      developing in genital LS in adults possibly from chronic
      inflammation, delay in diagnosis, and delay in appropriate
      treatment. The risk of squamous cell carcinoma in pediatric
      onset LS is undefined. It is also unclear if effective
      control of cutaneous inflammation can decrease the risk of
      malignant transformation. Treatment is aimed at decreasing
      symptoms and returning involved skin to its normal
      appearance. Relapses are common. <span
      class="yellow">Ultrapotent topical corticosteroids are first
      line for the treatment of LS and can be used intermittently
      for years for flares. Topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus are
      also good treatment options at controlling
      inflammation.</span> Patients need to be monitored every 6 to
      12 months even when asymptomatic because of the potential for
      development of malignancy. Given the distressing nature of
      LS, support groups and a multidisciplinary approach are
      recommended.</p>
