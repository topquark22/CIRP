      <h2>The response of balanitis xerotica obliterans to local
      steroid application compared with placebo in children.</h2>

       Budapest, Hungary.</p>

      <p>PURPOSE: We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of
      topical steroid application for balanitis xerotica obliterans
      in children and analyzed the association of any clinical
      response with histological findings.</p>

      <p>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our double-blind, placebo
      controlled, randomized study included 40 boys in whom
      balanitis xerotica obliterans was diagnosed clinically by
      cicatricial phimosis. The severity of phimosis was graded
      into 4 groups. Patients were randomized to receive the
      topical application of 0.05% mometasone furoate or placebo.
      After 5 weeks phimosis severity was reevaluated and all
      patients underwent circumcision. Surgical specimens were
      histologically typed as an early, intermediate or late form
      of balanitis xerotica obliterans.</p>

      <p>RESULTS: Seven patients were withdrawn from the study. In
      the steroid group 7 boys had clinical improvement and 10 had
      no change. Histological study showed an early, intermediate
      and late form of balanitis xerotica obliterans in 5, 5 and 7
      cases, respectively. Of cases with clinical improvement 5
      were the early and 2 the intermediate type. In the placebo
      group 5 cases worsened clinically and 11 did not change.
      Histological evaluation revealed an early, intermediate and
      late form of balanitis xerotica obliterans in 3, 7 and 6
      boys, respectively. Of the 5 cases with histological
      worsening, disease was the early, intermediate and late type
      in 2, 2 and 1, respectively.</p>

      <p>CONCLUSIONS: <span class="yellow">Applying a potent
      topical steroid affects improvement in balanitis xerotica
      obliterans in the histologically early and intermediate
      stages of disease, and may inhibit further worsening in the
      late stage.</span></p>
