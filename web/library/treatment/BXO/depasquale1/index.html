      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text1">Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), first
      described in 1928 by St&uuml;hmer, is now considered to be
      the male genital variant of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus
      (LSA). This common penile disease can involve the prepuce,
      the glans (Fig.1) or the urethra, either individually or in
      any combination. BXO was regarded as an exclusively adult
      disease until a case was documented in a 7-year-old boy in
      1962 [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. Further reports of prepubertal
      BXO followed during the 1970s and currently it is recognized
      as a common cause of acquired phimosis and meatal stenosis in
      schoolboys, and has even been identified in the first year of
      life (unpublished communication). It remains speculation as
      to whether this represents a genuine change in prevalence and
      behaviour of this disease, or merely greater clinical
      awareness and recognition.</p>

      <p class="text2">The aetiology of BXO remains obscure.
      Genetic factors have been implicated in association with HLA
      subtypes [<a href="#n2">2</a>], which may explain our
      observation of brothers, or of fathers and sons, presenting
      with this condition. Several publications [<a
      href="#n3">3,4</a>] including ours, noted an increased
      incidence of other auto-immune type conditions (e.g.
      diabetes, vitiligo, alopecia), not only among patients, but
      also their close relatives. An infective aetiology has also
      been considered although initial studies on viruses [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>], spirochetes [<a href="#n6">6</a>] and
      acid-fast bacilli [<a href="#n7">7</a>] were inconclusive or
      unsubstantiated.</p>

      article.]</p>

      <h3>Clinical features</h3>

      <p class="text1">The clinical presentation and severity of
      BXO can vary markedly. The onset may be insidious, pursuing a
      chronic course over many years with few early symptoms, or it
      may behave aggressively with florid disease evident within
      weeks of onset. In mild early BXO, the patient may notice
      areas of greyish white discoloration on the glans or the
      moist inner layer of the foreskin. It may or may not be
      itchy, and at this stage it is frequently misdiagnosed as a
      candidal infection and treated to no avail with antifungal
      creams. The involved areas of skin coalesce or spread,
      becoming inelastic and prone to fissuring or haemorrhagic
      blistering during sexual activity. The frenulum often becomes
      contracted and circumferential involvement of the preputial
      aperture leads to a progressive fibrous phimosis,
      characterized by the typical whitish discoloration. In
      aggressive BXO disease the surface of the glans and inner
      prepuce may ulcerate, causing purulent discharge. Subsequent
      fibrosis may lead to dense fusion of the layers, thereby
      making a routine circumcision difficult or impossible. The
      intermittent ulceration of the glans is often histologically
      not specific, but eventually this chronic instability may
      progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which has a
      recognized association with BXO. For these reasons,
      circumcision of a severe BXO phimosis in which the glans
      cannot be inspected or in which there is an associated
      purulent discharge, should not be delegated to an
      inexperienced surgeon.</p>

      <p class="text2">Urethral involvement starts at the meatus,
      with a tendency to form superficial adhesions between the
      meatal lips in the milder cases, and then the typical dense
      ivory-white fibrosis in more severe disease (Fig. 1b).
      Although traditionally it was thought that BXO did not
      progress beyond the navicular fossa, our extensive experience
      shows that in long-standing disease, mucosal involvement and
      spongiofibrosis can spread proximally as far back as the
      prostate. However, it has not been found in bladder mucosa.
      Clinically the penile urethra may feel like a thickened cord
      on palpation, and on urethroscopy (when possible) the
      involved mucosa looks pale and ``shaggy,'' sometimes with
      focal areas of fissuring or ulceration. The proximal extent
      is usually well demarcated when in the penile urethra,
      although with more extensive bulbar extension of the disease,
      the mucosal changes may fade indistinctly and we have
      sometimes noted the appearance of minor mucosal ``skip''
      lesions beyond the apparent posterior limit. However,
      generally the disease seems to spread proximally from the
      meatus in a confluent manner.</p>

      <p class="text2">With experience, the clinical picture of
      established BXO is almost unmistakable, although the
      differential diagnosis might include lichen planus, localized
      scleroderma, leukoplakia, vitiligo and the cutaneous rash of
      Lyme disease. Furthermore, on histological examination BXO
      presents a very characteristic picture. Hyperkeratosis is
      present and the epidermis is atrophic with thinning of the
      rete pegs. Vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer may be
      present. The papillary and reticular dermis present a
      ``washed out'' appearance and dermal collagen forms a
      homogenous band at the dermal-epithelial junction in
      conjunction with elastin fibres, to produce an amorphous
      hybrid substance [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. Deep to this
      amorphous band, a chronic inflammatory cell infiltration is
      present, mainly from T cells [<a href="#n9">9</a>].</p>

      <h3>Treatment</h3>

      <p class="text1">BXO has been managed both medically and
      surgically. Currently available medical treatment can provide
      useful palliation but is generally regarded to be of limited
      benefit. Topically applied and intralesionally injected
      steroids have been shown to arrest the progression of the
      disease and in some cases cause regression or resolution,
      particularly in childhood phimosis. A trial with clobetasol
      or mometasone cream can be considered for those patients with
      early disease who are keen to avoid circumcision. However, on
      ceasing treatment the disease process may resume [<a
      href="#n10">10,11</a>]. Topically applied testosterone has
      been reported to have a beneficial effect, but this type of
      treatment has not been pursued further [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The surgical options are more definitive,
      and have included circumcision, dilating or surgically
      correcting meatal stenosis, and various urethroplasty
      techniques. The carbon dioxide laser has been used as an
      alternative to incisional surgery to ablate BXO on the glans
      [<a href="#n13">13-15</a>] and for the dilatation of proximal
      strictures [<a href="#n16">16,17</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Because previous reports include few
      patients and use uncertain treatment regimens, we reviewed a
      large series of histologically confirmed cases of BXO
      operated on by the senior author (A.B.), to establish a
      treatment protocol. To date, the senior author has treated
      700 patients for BXO and its sequelae; 522 of these patients,
      operated on between January 1984 and May 1998, were studied
      retrospectively by reviewing the case-notes and the senior
      author's database (). Those who had BXO as their main
      pathology were treated surgically, 82 (16%) patients were
      treated for hypospadias with concurrent BXO and 12 (2%) had
      treatment for SCC associated with BXO (Table 1.).</p>

      <p class="text2">The age of presentation of BXO was difficult
      to assess because many of the patients were referred from
      other units, having undergone several previous procedures
      over many years. Thus we assessed the subset of patients
      presenting for primary surgical treatment by circumcision,
      which would give a more accurate assessment. In the 300
      patients treated by circumcision the youngest was a
      2-year-old boy and the eldest an 81-year-old man. The median
      age at presentation was 33 years, with the highest incidence
      in those aged 21-40 years (145 patients, 48%).</p>

      <p class="text2">Of these 300 patients with BXO limited to
      the foreskin or glans penis only, 287 (96%) were treated by
      circumcision alone. The remaining 13 (4%) required concurrent
      surgical procedures, i.e. meatotomy or meatoplasty in five,
      urethroplasty using mucosal grafts in four and glans
      resurfacing in four.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of the 287 patients who had the glans
      exposed by circumcision alone as the definitive treatment,
      the disease process was arrested and symptoms relieved in 276
      (92%). BXO remained active in 11 (3.9%) patients, with
      development of glans ulceration requiring total glans
      resurfacing in five, and with urethral spread requiring
      urethroplasty in six. Surgery to correct meatal stenosis was
      undertaken in 21 (4%) patients in the form of meatotomy (13)
      or meatoplasty (eight).</p>

      <p class="text2">In all, 107 (20%) patients underwent surgery
      for a BXO urethral stricture, with excision of the involved
      urethra and replacement with grafts, the choice of graft
      changing with our length of experience. Initially, in 42
      (39%) of these cases, skin (genital or not) was used for
      substitution, and although the early results were good, there
      was an almost 90% stricture recurrence rate during a
      long-term follow-up. The other 65 patients (61%), plus the
      recurrences from the skin group, underwent reconstruction
      with buccal and/or bladder mucosa. There have been no BXO
      recurrences in these mucosal grafts to date.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of those with BXO, 82 (16%) were identified
      among patients who were being treated for hypospadias
      problems. Of these 82, 29 (35%) were presenting late for
      primary repair because a hitherto asymptomatic hypospadias
      deformity had become troublesome. Fifty-three (65%) were
      referred for salvage surgery having already undergone
      unsuccessful hypospadias repairs elsewhere. Most were adults
      with a long history of recurrent strictures and multiple
      hospitalizations. Our experience in managing these patients
      mirrors that in patients with no hypospadiac stricture, i.e.
      those repairs that used skin to reconstruct the urethra
      eventually stenosed, whereas those using mucosal grafts have
      remained free of recurrence.</p>

      <p class="text2">Penile SCC was associated with BXO in 12
      (2.3%) patients; of these, seven had been circumcised earlier
      for BXO whilst the other five had BXO in uncircumcised
      penises. These patients were treated by conservative
      resection, combined with reconstruction of a pseudo-glans.
      One of these patients developed a BXO urethral stricture
      requiring urethroplasty; another developed metastatic spread
      of his carcinoma, requiring an inguinal lymph node block
      dissection.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text1">BXO can be treated in several ways; of the
      300 patients treated by circumcision, in all but 12 (4%) this
      was the only intervention required, underlining the efficacy
      of this mode of treatment. BXO has a predilection for the
      warm, moist, urine-exposed environment that exists under the
      foreskin. In removing the moist skin folds and allowing the
      glans epithelium to dry out, circumcision usually leads to
      either resolution or arrest in progression of the disease,
      and alleviation of the symptoms. Mild glans disease may
      revert to a normal appearance within 6 months, and with more
      severe involvement, resolution may continue for up to 2 years
      after circumcision, although some permanent atrophic scarring
      and discoloration may then remain. Several authors [<a
      href="#n18">18,19</a>] have suggested that total excision of
      the involved epithelium is an effective way of eliminating
      the risk of recurrence. However, in our experience the
      associated desiccating effect of circumcision also plays an
      important role, and we recommend that sufficient foreskin
      should therefore be removed to allow adequate exposure and
      drying out of the glans. We have noted recurrence of BXO when
      the circumcision has been very conservative, even though the
      clinically diseased skin was removed. Recurrence is also
      common when residual moist skin folds are unavoidable because
      of obesity. Even after radical circumcision, in the obese
      patient the shaft skin may roll up to form a pseudo-foreskin
      as the penis invaginates into the pubic fat pad. In these
      patients, despite repeated surgery, the entire penile shaft
      skin may eventually be destroyed and therefore radical weight
      loss is a priority for these patients if they are to avoid
      becoming genital ``cripples.''</p>

      <p class="text2">In a minority of cases the glans continues
      to deteriorate despite adequate circumcision, and the patient
      may have recurrent blistering, fissuring or ulceration of the
      skin. Twelve such patients were treated with topical
      clobetasol cream applied twice daily to the glans, but on
      follow-up they continued to have problems. Five of them had
      persistent instability and ulceration of the glans surface
      (Fig. 2ab), which was effectively treated by complete
      resection of the glans epithelium and resurfacing with
      partial thickness skin grafts (Fig. 2c,d ). The other seven
      developed urethral strictures requiring urethroplasty with
      buccal mucosa; on follow-up these patients remain well. The
      reason that skin grafts seem to be effective on the
      circumcised glans but not in the urethra is that in the
      former the skin remains dry.</p>

      <p class="text2">BXO is a common disease, yet its true
      incidence is not appreciated because most cases are cured by
      circumcision, and unfortunately many surgeons still fail to
      send their circumcision specimens for histology. This
      practice is becoming medicolegally indefensible in a
      litigation-conscious society, where the clinical sequelae of
      BXO are often misinterpreted by the patient as surgical
      errors. It is important to recognize when an unretractile
      foreskin is the result of established BXO, as these patients
      may have already developed a buried corona or more extensive
      fusion between the foreskin and glans, thereby making
      circumcision a challenging procedure. Failure to fully
      separate the adhesions will not only compromise the aesthetic
      outcome of circumcision, but may lead to recurrent painful
      fissuring around the corona during sexual activity. Given
      also the possibility of concurrent meatal or urethral
      stricture, or of malignant transformation, circumcision in
      these patients should not be delegated to an unsupervised
      trainee surgeon. Indeed, in severe cases, primary referral to
      a plastic surgeon or reconstructive urologist may be
      advisable.</p>

      <p class="text2">BXO involvement of the urethra presents the
      challenging objective of restoring adequate urinary flow
      whilst minimizing the risk of recurrence. Various treatments
      have been recommended for meatal stenosis. Topical or
      injected steroids have shown some benefit [<a
      href="#n1">1,20</a>] especially when used as an adjunct to
      other treatments [<a href="#n21">21</a>]. A simple ventral
      slit in the terminal urethra followed by dilatation tends to
      cause a distal hypospadias deformity and often leads to
      recurrence. Meatoplasty has been claimed to achieve a better
      functional result and a more permanent treatment of the
      stenosis [<a href="#n22">22</a>]. The carbon dioxide laser
      has been used to treat meatal stenosis by ablation and
      meatotomy [<a href="#n17">17</a>], or circumferential
      vaporization [<a href="#n16">16</a>], with encouraging
      results. In our experience meatal stenosis may respond well
      to the above modalities, provided that circumcision has also
      been performed, and that the disease process is still
      confined to the meatal margins. Unfortunately, re-stenosis
      can be anticipated once there is established BXO in the
      distal urethra. Urethroscopy is therefore mandatory if
      symptoms or clinical examination are suggestive of spread
      into the urethra.</p>

      <p class="text2">To treat established urethral disease,
      excision of the involved urethra and substitution
      urethroplasty is the modality of choice. Conservative
      management with repeated urethrotomies and dilatations only
      exacerbates the fibrosis and recurrence of the stricture is
      virtually inevitable [<a href="#n23">23</a>]. There is
      consensus that the involved urethral segment should be
      excised, and that delay merely allows the disease to spread
      further proximally, thereby making the subsequent surgery
      more difficult.</p>

      <p class="text2">Various ways of reconstructing the urethra
      have been tried, including the use of pedicled skin flaps or
      skin grafts [<a href="#n24">24</a>]. Our management of the
      urethra with BXO will be discussed in more detail elsewhere
      but from an experience of 200 BXO strictures we can draw
      several conclusions.</p>

      <p class="text2">First, the diseased segment of urethra
      should be excised and substituted, rather than augmented with
      inlay flaps or grafts. Second, substitution urethroplasty
      with either genital or extra-genital skin grafts provides no
      cure. The short-term results may be excellent, but if such
      patients are followed for long enough then recurrent BXO
      strictures are almost inevitable. Re-stricturing commonly
      occurs within the first 2-3 years, but it may take longer,
      and we have noted recurrences up to 10 years later. In the
      early 1990s we therefore started to use mucosa for
      reconstruction, and to date have encountered no recurrent BXO
      in a mucosal substitution urethroplasty.</p>

      <p class="text2">We prefer a two-stage procedure where first
      the urethra is laid open, and the involved mucosa excised and
      replaced by a graft of buccal mucosa harvested from one or
      both cheeks. The urethra is reconstituted at a second
      operation 4 months later. If the length of urethra involved
      is too much to replace with buccal mucosa alone, then we use
      buccal mucosa for the terminal segment and at the second
      operation replace the remaining diseased urethra with tubed
      bladder mucosa.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the hypospadias-BXO group, most salvage
      referrals presented with recurring strictures resulting from
      various types of hypospadias repair that use skin for the
      neourethra. BXO was confirmed on histological examination and
      the problems rectified when mucosa was used instead. The many
      hypospadias patients with BXO are unlikely to represent any
      specific association between these conditions, but probably
      reflects referral patterns to the unit because of the senior
      author's interest in hypospadias salvage.</p>

      <p class="text2">Various authors [<a href="#n25">25-28</a>]
      have reported the association between BXO and SCC of the
      glans, although by what mechanism this occurs and whether
      this is a specific causal relationship remains unclear. Some
      regard BXO as an inherently premalignant condition, whereas
      others consider it an unspecific irritant focus, comparable
      with chronic scarring or ulceration that eventually
      progresses to a Marjolin's ulcer. In our series, 12 patients
      with BXO (2.3% of 522) presented with SCC (median age 61.5
      years, range 32-79); five presented with SCC in an
      uncircumcised penis, but intriguingly in the other seven the
      carcinoma had developed despite a previous circumcision for
      BXO phimosis. Why SCC of the glans should develop years after
      BXO circumcision remains unanswered, although it is possible
      that undiagnosed carcinoma in situ was already established at
      the time of primary surgery. We recommend that suspicious or
      atypical areas of BXO should be biopsied to exclude malignant
      transformation, especially in patients aged over 30
      years.</p>

      <p class="text2">Our patients were managed surgically,
      usually by glansectomy alone, but combined with a
      conservative amputation of the distal shaft if there was
      tumour penetration through to the corporal heads. We
      routinely reconstruct a pseudo-glans by resurfacing the
      corporal heads or the contoured amputation stump with a
      split-thickness skin graft from the thigh. This gives
      excellent functional and cosmetic results without
      compromising survival. Metastatic spread of the carcinoma
      occurred in only one patient, who required block dissection
      of the groin and has had no subsequent problems. We are now
      convinced, after a 10-year experience with conservative
      surgery, that the traditional mutilating operations described
      for penile carcinoma are unwarranted in stage 1 and 2
      disease, and our rationale will be the subject of a separate
      publication.</p>

      <p class="text2">We stress that radiotherapy is not a
      treatment option for carcinoma of the glans when associated
      with BXO, because BXO spreads aggressively and relentlessly
      in immuno-compromised, irradiated tissues, leading to florid
      and extensive involvement of the external genital skin and of
      the urethra. The management of such cases is exceedingly
      difficult.</p>

      <h3>A suggested treatment protocol</h3>

      <p class="text1">This is probably the largest series of BXO
      to date and therefore we suggest a protocol for the surgical
      treatment of BXO as currently practised in our unit.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the condition, as observed clinically, is limited to
        the foreskin, then circumcision is curative and provides
        histological confirmation of the disease.</li>

        <li>If there is associated glans discoloration, but with no
        scarring, ulceration or fusion to the foreskin, simple
        circumcision is again likely to be curative.</li>

        <li>Potent topical steroid creams may be a useful adjunct
        to manage localized areas that are reluctant to settle
        after circumcision, but we regard steroids as palliative
        rather than curative.</li>

        <li>If the coronal sulcus is obliterated by adhesions and
        the remaining glans skin is in reasonable condition, then
        we recommend release of the buried coronal ridge by careful
        sharp dissection, and allowing healing by secondary
        re-epithelialization of the raw area.</li>

        <li>If the glans is extensively scarred and disfigured, or
        if the surface remains unstable and symptomatic, then total
        resurfacing of the glans with healthy new skin is
        recommended. This improves the aesthetic appearance and
        should remove the risk of progression to SCC.</li>

        <li>If SCC of the glans occurs, it is best treated by
        conservative, reconstructive surgery; radiotherapy should
        be avoided.</li>

        <li>Meatal BXO may respond to minor surgery and topical
        steroids, but stenosis is likely to recur if there is
        already established involvement of the distal urethra.</li>

        <li>The treatment for urethral BXO is excision of the
        involved urethra and substitution with full thickness
        buccal mucosa, or a combination of buccal and bladder
        mucosa in more extensive disease.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="text1">We present a treatment protocol (Table 2)
      reflecting the experience in our unit of treating &gt; 500
      patients with BXO over a 14-year period. Because few cases
      have been reported to date there is little consistent advice
      on the treatment of this under-diagnosed condition. The
      protocol provides a treatment plan for managing most cases of
      BXO. Whilst many straightforward cases could be managed in a
      general surgery environment, it should be recognized that the
      sequelae of BXO can be technically challenging, and a
      proportion of patients will benefit from the services of a
      reconstructive specialist.</p>
