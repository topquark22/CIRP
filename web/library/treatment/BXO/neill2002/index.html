      <h4>Disclaimer</h4>

      <p class="text1">These guidelines have been prepared for
      dermatologists on behalf of the British Association of
      Dermatologists and reflect the best data available at the
      time the report was prepared. Caution should be exercised in
      interpreting the data; the results of future studies may
      require alteration of the conclusions or recommendations in
      this report. It may be necessary or even desirable to depart
      from the guidelines in the interests of specific patients and
      special circumstances. Just as adherence to the guidelines
      may not constitute defence against a claim of negligence, so
      deviation from them should not necessarily be deemed
      negligent.</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">The aim of the British Association of
      Dermatologists is to provide guidelines for the management of
      skin diseases using as much evidence-based data as possible.
      There are few published randomized controlled trials to
      support the following guidelines for the management of lichen
      sclerosus (LS); the recommendations made are those that are
      currently considered best practice but will be modified at
      intervals in the light of new evidence. Levels of evidence to
      support the guidelines are quoted according to the criteria
      stated in <a href="#appendix">Appendix 1</a>. Appraising and
      grading the evidence for the treatment of LS is not easy,
      particularly as it is a disorder in which many treatments
      have a large placebo effect; additionally, disease definition
      has been unreliable or unclear in some of the reports so it
      is possible that &lsquo;therapyresistant cases&rsquo; may
      have had some atypical features.</p>

      <h4>Definition</h4>

      <p class="text1">LS is a lymphocyte-mediated dermatosis that
      has a predilection for the genital skin in both sexes and was
      first formally described at the end of the nineteenth century
      by Hallopeau and Darier as a variant of lichen planus
      (LP).<sup><a href="#n1">1&ndash;3</a></sup> Use of the terms
      leucoplakia and kraurosis vulvae<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> in older literature is a source of
      confusion. Balanitis xerotica obliterans, a term used for LS
      of the penis, was only recently coded as part of LS in
      literature search tools such as Medline. Not all LS is
      histologically atrophic, and the term &lsquo;lichen sclerosus
      et atrophicus&rsquo; has now been replaced with LS alone.</p>

      <p class="text1">Currently, LS is considered as a separate
      entity from LP on the basis of its specific distinguishing
      clinical and histological features. However, it is recognized
      that some cases of LS may represent an overlap syndrome,
      sharing features of both LS and LP, and perhaps the two
      conditions represent different parts of a spectrum of the
      same process. Such overlap cases are often associated
      histologically with squamous cell hyperplasia, and are best
      categorized as &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; LS, as response to a
      topical ultrapotent corticosteroid is often poorer.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">These guidelines are in the main for
      uncomplicated LS with the classical histological features of
      the disorder.</p>

      <h4>Pathogenesis</h4>

      <p class="text1">The aetiology of LS is uncertain but there
      is mounting evidence to suggest that autoimmune mechanisms
      are involved in its pathogenesis;<sup><a
      href="#n6">6&ndash;8</a></sup> there is an increased
      incidence of tissue-specific antibodies<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> and associations with other autoimmune
      diseases in patients with LS,<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,11</a></sup> as well as positive associations
      with HLA class II antigens.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12&ndash;14</a></sup> There is still controversy
      regarding the implication of Borrelia infection as an
      aetiological agent; although several studies have shown that
      this association does not occur in the U.S.A., some doubt
      still remains in Europe.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15,16</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Incidence</h4>

      <p class="text1">It is clear from the number of patients
      attending a vulval clinic that LS is a common disease. LS in
      females has two peak ages of presentation. The first of these
      occurs in prepubertal girls<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      and may resolve or continue beyond the menarche.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> The other peak of incidence is in
      postmenopausal women;<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      although this suggests a hormonal influence, hormone
      replacement therapy neither improves existing disease nor
      provides any protection against its development.
      Interestingly, pregnancy seems to improve the symptoms and
      signs, and a normal vaginal delivery is usually possible.</p>

      <p class="text1">The incidence of LS in males is lower than
      in females but there is also a bimodal onset, with peaks of
      disease presentation occurring in young boys and then again
      in adults.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Clinical features</h4>
      <i>Female anogenital: adult</i> 

      <p class="text1">The typical lesions are porcelain-white
      papules and plaques, often with areas of ecchymosis.
      Follicular delling may be prominent. The lesions occur in the
      interlabial sulci, labia minora, clitoral hood, clitoris and
      perineal body. Genital mucosal involvement does not occur,
      the vagina and cervix always being spared (by contrast with
      LP). However, there may be some mucosal involvement at the
      edge of mucocutaneous junctions, which may lead to introital
      narrowing. Perianal lesions occur in women in 30% of cases.
      Itch is the main symptom but pain occurs if there are
      erosions or fissures. The itch is worse at nights and may be
      so severe as to disturb sleep. Dyspareunia occurs in the
      presence of erosions, fissures or introital narrowing.</p>

      <p class="text1">Some women are asymptomatic and the LS is
      only discovered when they are being examined for another
      reason. Most of these patients have inactive disease, which
      may have occurred in childhood, and the changes seen are the
      long-standing atrophic changes that persist. However, some of
      these individuals have changes of active disease with
      hyperkeratosis and ecchymosis, and should therefore receive
      treatment.</p>
      <i>Female anogenital: child</i> 

      <p class="text1">The lesions are similar to those in adult
      women but ecchymosis may be very striking and potentially
      mistaken as evidence of sexual abuse.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> There has been a tendency to exclude
      a diagnosis of sexual abuse if LS has been confirmed;
      however, as LS exhibits the Koebner phenomenon at sites of
      trauma, some cases of LS may in fact be caused or aggravated
      by sexual abuse.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Suspicious
      features include LS in older prepubertal girls, the presence
      of associated infection (especially infections that are
      characteristically sexually transmitted), or other symptoms
      or signs of abuse.</p>

      <p class="text1">Perianal LS with or without vulval
      involvement occurs in young girls, who commonly present with
      constipation because of painful fissuring in this area.</p>
      <i>Male genital: adult</i> 

      <p class="text1">The lesions appear most commonly on the
      prepuce, coronal sulcus and glans penis. More rarely lesions
      may be found on the shaft of the penis. The presenting
      complaint is usually tightening of the foreskin, which may
      lead to phimosis and painful erections. One report documented
      that 40% of phimosis occurring in adults was due to
      LS,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> although another study of
      75 subjects with severe phimosis only identified LS in eight
      (11%).<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> In contrast to women,
      men commonly present with the consequences of scarring. The
      perimeatal area may be involved and postinflammatory scarring
      may lead to stenosis and obstruction causing dysuria and poor
      urinary stream.</p>

      <p class="text1">Other presenting complaints are due to the
      appearance of lesions, decreased penile sensitivity and
      soreness rather than itch. <span class="yellow">Circumcision
      does not necessarily ensure protection against further flares
      of the disease and one series showed that 50% of men
      requiring circumcision continued to have lesions of
      LS</span><sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Perianal disease is
      extremely rare in males.</p>
      <i>Male genital: child</i> 

      <p class="text1">The disease usually affects the prepuce and
      can lead to phimosis. The incidence of phimosis caused by LS
      in children is difficult to determine as not all surgical
      specimens are assessed histologically. One study documented
      the presence of LS in 14 of 100 prepubertal boys having
      elective circumcision for disease of the foreskin;<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> a similar figure of 14% was recorded
      in a French series.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> A more
      recent study of 100 children with phimosis documented that
      all of them had LS.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> Perianal
      involvement occurs rarely, if ever.</p>
      <i>Extragenital</i> 

      <p class="text1">The classical extragenital sites are the
      upper trunk, axillae, buttocks and lateral thighs.
      Extragenital lesions in men are uncommon and usually do not
      occur in association with genital lesions. The face and scalp
      in both sexes are other sites that may rarely be
      involved.</p>

      <p class="text1">Oral lesions of LS are extremely rare and
      many of the cases reported in the literature have not been
      substantiated with histological evidence and may well have
      been examples of LP or morphoea.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> In the rare instances of oral LS
      these are recorded at sites in the mouth where there is
      cornified stratified squamous epithelium, i.e. tongue,
      gingiva and hard palate.</p>

      <h4>Investigations</h4>

      <p class="text1">The diagnosis in most patients is usually
      made clinically, but a confirmatory biopsy is helpful in
      cases where there is some clinical doubt about the diagnosis
      and to document any atypical features. The main differential
      diagnoses include LP, mucous membrane pemphigoid and genital
      psoriasis. A skin biopsy is not always practical in children
      and it is preferable to initiate their treatment without
      histological confirmation. A biopsy is essential in all cases
      that fail to respond to adequate treatment.</p>
      <i>Histology</i> 

      <p class="text1">The classical histological features of
      uncomplicated LS include a thinned epidermis with
      hyperkeratosis, a wide band of homogenized collagen below the
      dermoepidermal junction and a lymphocytic infiltrate beneath
      the homogenized area. There may be small focal areas where
      the inflammatory infiltrate is close to the dermoepidermal
      junction, similar to LP.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> A
      few patients may have a thickened epidermis; these patients
      tend to have complicated disease that is not so responsive to
      treatment and may have a higher risk in the long term of
      developing an associated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).</p>

      <p class="text1">The length of time that LS has been present
      cannot be determined accurately using histological
      parameters.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>
      <i>Other investigations</i> 

      <p class="text1">Other investigations that might be indicated
      include a screen for other autoimmune diseases, in particular
      thyroid disease in women.</p>

      <h4>Complications</h4>
      <i>Malignancy</i> 

      <p class="text1">SCC, discussed below, is the commonest
      malignancy described in association with anogenital LS.
      Interestingly, SCC has not been recorded in LS at sites other
      than the anogenital area. Verrucous carcinomas also appear to
      occur on a background of LS.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29,30</a></sup> There have also been reports of
      basal cell carcinoma<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> and
      melanoma occurring in cases of vulval LS.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32,33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Squamous cell carcinoma in women with
      genital lichen sclerosus.</i> SCC arising within LS only
      occurs in lesions affecting the anogenital area; in practice,
      this risk is extremely small. Two studies each of over 200
      women with LS under regular review have shown a small but
      definite increased incidence of invasive SCC.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17,34</a></sup> The magnitude of this risk is
      about 5% or less lifelong in known patients with LS17,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> (and is therefore probably a
      significant overestimate in view of the likely high
      prevalence of undiagnosed cases of LS). However,
      histopathological examination of vulval SCCs indicates that
      about 60% occur on a background of LS.<sup><a
      href="#n35">35&ndash;38</a></sup> A clinical study of
      anogenital SCC presenting to a vulval clinic demonstrated
      that 14 of 23 cases occurred on a background of LS.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> The role of human papillomavirus
      (HPV) as a possible aetiological agent in the progression to
      malignancy in LS has not been clearly established, although
      recent evidence suggests that there may be two distinct
      aetiologies for vulval SCC. One type occurs in older women
      with a chronic dermatosis such as LS, the other in younger
      women without LS but with evidence of the same oncogenic HPV
      types that are linked to cervical SCC.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> Although evidence for an important
      role of HPV in LS-associated SCC is scanty, there is a remote
      theoretical risk that topical corticosteroid use might induce
      oncogenic HPV types that may be cause for concern because, as
      found in the normal population, up to 20% of cases of LS may
      incidentally carry the oncogenic HPV 16.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> SCC of the vulva should be managed
      by gynaecologists experienced in this field as surgery has to
      be individualized according to the tumour size and location,
      particularly in early invasive disease.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Squamous cell carcinoma of the penis
      associated with lichen sclerosus.</i> An association between
      LS and penile SCC has also been reported.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42,43</a></sup> The magnitude of this association
      is probably less than 4%, which was the case in a
      retrospective series of 86 histologically confirmed cases of
      LS.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> There is probably poor
      recognition of the association, as a review of LS in 1995 was
      only able to document nine reported cases.<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> The role of HPV in inducing
      malignant change is again unproven, but there is
      documentation in the literature showing a high incidence of
      HPV 6 (in six of 23 patients) using polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) technology in childhood penile LS and another four of
      23 patients with HPV 16 or 18.<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> Another recent therapeutic study
      suggested that three of 22 men had evidence of HPV after use
      of corticosteroids for LS<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> (in
      one case by penoscopy, and in the other two on histological
      criteria), and studies also using PCR documented HPV in one
      of 25<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> and none of 24<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> patients. Oncogenic HPV types do not
      appear to be commonly associated with penile LS.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>
      <i>Scarring</i> 

      <p class="text1"><i>Introital narrowing.</i> Infrequently,
      some women may have narrowing of the introitus. This can
      present problems with dyspareunia and/or difficulties
      micturating. If surgery has to be considered to widen the
      introitus it is important to use part of the posterior
      vaginal wall in the reconstruction to prevent further
      adhesions and stenosis due to Koebnerization.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Pseudocyst of the clitoris.</i>
      Occasionally, clitoral hood adhesions seal over the clitoris
      and keratinous debris builds up underneath, forming a painful
      pseudocyst. This requires a subtotal or total
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>
      <i>Phimosis.</i> The most common complication in males is
      secondary phimosis, which may require circumcision if medical
      treatment fails. If the disease is still active at the time
      of surgery it is important to continue topical
      corticosteroids following the surgery to prevent
      Koebnerization and further scarring, particularly around the
      coronal sulcus.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text1"><i>Meatal stenosis.</i> LS of the glans may
      cause meatal stenosis, which is manifest as an altered
      urinary stream, less commonly progressing to cause frank
      obstruction to urinary flow.</p>
      <i>Sensory abnormalities: dysaesthesia</i> 

      <p class="text1"><i>Vestibulodynia and vulvodynia.</i> These
      conditions may occur after an inflammatory condition of the
      vulva and ? or vestibule. The patient remains symptomatic
      despite clinical improvement or resolution of the skin
      lesions. This is neuropathic pain and will not respond to
      topical corticosteroids, so treatment must be aimed at the
      eradication of the neuronal sensitization. Xylocaine 5%
      ointment should be tried first, with progression to
      amitriptyline in unresponsive cases.</p>
      <i>Penile dysaesthesia</i> 

      <p class="text1">Men may develop a similar problem, with an
      abnormal burning sensation on the glans or around the
      urethral meatus.</p>
      <i>Psychosexual problems</i> 

      <p class="text1">Men and women who have any chronic genital
      disorder will often lose their interest in sexual activity,
      leading to problems with sexual dysfunction.<sup><a
      href="#n51">51,52</a></sup> It is important to give patients
      the opportunity to express their concerns on their sexual
      function and to offer a referral to someone with the
      necessary expertise to address these problems.</p>

      <h4>Management</h4>

      <p class="text1">An extensive historical overview of
      treatment of LS is provided in the review by Meffert <i>et
      al.</i><sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup></p>

      <p><i>Topical corticosteroids</i></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Adult female anogenital lichen
      sclerosus.</i> Ideally, all women with symptomatic or active
      anogenital LS should be seen at least once by a
      dermatologist; difficult cases with complications may be best
      managed in a vulval clinic with a multidisciplinary team,
      including a dermatologist and a gynaecologist.</p>

      <p class="text2">The recommended and accepted treatment is
      the ultrapotent topical corticosteroid ointment clobetasol
      propionate<sup><a href="#n53">53,54</a></sup> (<i>Strength of
      recommendation A, Quality of evidence II-ii</i>). There are
      no randomized controlled trials providing evidence for any
      specific corticosteroid being the most effective or
      documenting that one regimen is superior to another. The
      regimen recommended by the authors for a newly diagnosed case
      is clobetasol propionate initially once a night for 4 weeks,
      then on alternate nights for 4 weeks and, for the final third
      month, twice weekly. The rationale for once daily application
      is based on pharmacodynamic studies showing that an
      ultrapotent corticosteroid needs a once daily application
      only.</p>

      <p class="text2">If the patients&rsquo; symptoms return with
      a drop in the schedule they are instructed to go back up to
      the frequency that was effective. A 30-g tube of clobetasol
      propionate should last 12 weeks and the patient is then
      reviewed. If the treatment has been successful the
      hyperkeratosis, ecchymoses, fissuring and erosions should
      have resolved but the atrophy and colour change will
      remain.</p>

      <p class="text2">The clobetasol propionate is then continued
      and used as and when required. Most patients seem to require
      30&ndash;60 g annually. Some patients go into complete
      remission, requiring no further treatment. Others will
      continue to have flares and remissions and they are advised
      to use clobetasol propionate as required.</p>

      <p class="text2">A soap substitute is also recommended, and
      the patient is given an information sheet on LS with
      instructions for the safe use of the topical corticosteroid,
      to try to ensure compliance.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Male genital lichen sclerosus.</i> <span
      class="yellow">A retrospective study of 22 men treated with
      clobetasol propionate documented this to be safe and
      effective, with significant improvement in discomfort, skin
      tightness, and also in urinary flow in the nine patients in
      whom this was affected</span><sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup>
      (<i>Strength of recommendation A, Quality of evidence
      II-ii</i>). The theoretical possibility of provoking latent
      HPV infection is discussed above. <span class="yellow">The
      use of a potent topical corticosteroid often avoids the need
      for circumcision.</span><sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Child anogenital lichen sclerosus.</i>
      There is one report of betamethasone dipropionate being used
      with success for vulval LS in children; all patients had
      improvement and eight of 11 had complete remission.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> No maintenance therapy was required.
      A subsequent study of 10 girls treated with clobetasol
      propionate twice daily for 6&ndash;8 weeks documented similar
      results and lack of adverse effects during treatment or
      prolonged followup<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup>
      (<i>Strength of recommendation A, Quality of evidence
      II-ii</i>).</p>

      <p class="text2">In boys, phimosis is commonly due to LS (see
      above), but studies of the use of corticosteroids have not
      always distinguished those with LS. <span class="yellow">A
      prospective study of 139 boys with phimosis treated with
      betamethasone for 1 month documented that 80% of the 111 who
      completed the study had normal retractability of the foreskin
      after this time; 10% proceeded to circumcision as treatment
      failures and 10% were having ongoing topical
      treatment</span><sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> (<i>Strength

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">An ultrapotent topical

      <p class="text1"><i>Extragenital lichen sclerosus.</i>
      Clobetasol propionate, with or without occlusion, is the
      first-line treatment. This is used once daily, as and when
      required. In general, extragenital lesions are not as
      responsive as genital disease to the potent topical
      corticosteroid (<i>Strength of recommendation A, Quality of
      evidence III</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Adult female anogenital lichen
      sclerosus.</i> Older studies have documented benefit from use
      of topical testosterone in vulval dystrophy (presumably some
      of these cases were LS),<sup><a href="#n62">62,63</a></sup>
      including one controlled study in LS that documented greater
      benefit in the active treatment group.<sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup> However, more recent research has
      documented that it is not as effective as clobetasol
      propionate<sup><a href="#n">65</a></sup> and is no more
      effective than an emollient.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup>
      In the maintenance of remission after topical corticosteroid
      it was actually worse than an emollient control<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> (<i>Strength of recommendation D,
      Quality of evidence II-i</i>). Topical testosterone is
      expensive and with overuse can lead to virilization. This
      discrepancy between studies is difficult to explain, and some
      authors still suggest that some patients will respond; one
      explanation is that there may be changes in the expression of
      androgen receptors with disease progression, which may in
      turn alter the hormonal responsiveness.<sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Topical progesterone has also been reported
      to be effective<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup> (<i>Strength
      of evidence C, Quality of evidence IV</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Male genital lichen sclerosus.</i>
      Testosterone has also been used topically (2&middot;5%
      ointment) for male genital LS<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup>
      (<i>Strength of recommendation C, Quality of evidence
      IV</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Child anogenital lichen sclerosus.</i>
      Topical oestrogen was reported to be beneficial in four
      girls, improving the histological features and itch (in the
      three who had this symptom).<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup>
      However, the magnitude of benefit is uncertain as this report
      stated that the overall clinical improvement was 20%, and no
      comparative trials are available.</p>

      cryotherapy</i></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Adult female anogenital lichen
      sclerosus.</i> There is no indication for removal of vulval
      tissue in the management of uncomplicated LS, and surgery
      should be used exclusively for malignancy and
      postinflammatory sequelae.</p>

      <p class="text2">In one study, nine of 12 patients with
      severe itch due to vulval LS unresponsive to topical
      treatment responded to cryotherapy, 50% for 3 years<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> (<i>Strength of recommendation C,
      Quality of evidence III</i>).</p>

      <p class="text2">In an open study of photodynamic therapy for
      vulval LS (topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid, argon laser light,
      one to three treatments), 10 of 12 patients had significant
      improvement.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> Laser treatment
      has also been used with some success<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> (<i>Strength of recommendation C,
      Quality of evidence III</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Male genital lichen sclerosus.</i> The
      role of surgery is better documented for penile LS, either to
      improve symptoms due to phimosis, which has failed to respond
      to a trial of an ultrapotent topical corticosteroid, or
      symptoms due to meatal stenosis. Two reviews (52 patients in
      total) document satisfactory results from circumcision for LS
      of the foreskin, and meatal dilatation, meatotomy or
      meatoplasty for meatal stenosis.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75,76</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Laser treatment has generally employed the
      carbon dioxide laser, and may have a role in the treatment of
      meatal stenosis<sup><a href="#n74">74,77</a></sup>
      (<i>Strength of recommendation B, Quality of evidence
      III</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Child anogenital lichen sclerosus.</i>
      Surgical treatment of childhood phimosis by circumcision has
      demonstrated the presence of LS in a high proportion of
      cases, but topical corticosteroids should be used first.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Extragenital lichen sclerosus.</i> Shave
      (tangential) excision has been used,<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup> and carbon dioxide laser has been

      of lesions.<sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A case of extragenital LS in a child has
      been successfully treated with low-dose ultraviolet (UV) A1

      <p class="text1"><i>Other treatments</i></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Ciclosporin.</i> A pilot trial of topical

      Quality of evidence III</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Retinoids.</i> There is no evidence that
      these are particularly effective in uncomplicated LS but
      there is some evidence that they may have a role in
      complicated disease that does not respond to an ultrapotent
      corticosteroid,<sup><a href="#n81">81&ndash;83</a></sup>
      including one long-term placebocontrolled study. However,
      this study only documented benefit in 14 of 22 evaluable
      patients as well as in six of 24 controls, and only 46 of 78
      patients could be evaluated. Use of topical retinoids is
      accompanied by the problem of irritancy (<i>Strength of
      recommendation C, Quality of evidence I</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Potassium para-aminobenzoate.</i> A
      report of five patients with LS at various sites, and
      resistant to numerous other therapies, documented good
      improvement in all five (dose 4&ndash;24 g daily in divided
      doses)<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup> (<i>Strength of
      recommendation C, Quality of evidence III</i>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Others.</i> There are reports of benefits
      from psoralen plus UVA treatment, stanozolol,<sup><a
      href="#n85">85</a></sup> antimalarials, antipruritic and

      antibiotics (for which the main rationale is the uncertain
      link with Borrelia infection). These and others are
      summarized elsewhere,<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> but
      must all be viewed as less well proven or as anecdotal.</p>

      <h4>Treatment failure</h4>

      <p class="text1">If treatment with topical corticosteroids
      fails to bring LS under control then it is important to
      consider the following:<br />
       <b>1</b> Non-compliance. Sometimes patients may be alarmed
      at the warnings on the package insert warning against the use
      of a topical corticosteroid in the anogenital area and they
      will then not use the preparation. Also, very elderly
      patients disabled with poor eyesight and limited mobility may
      not be able to apply the medication appropriately.<br />
       <b>2</b> Is the diagnosis correct, or is there an added
      problem such as the development of a contact allergy to the
      medication or is there another superimposed condition, e.g.
      secondary candidiasis, intraepithelial neoplasia, malignancy,
      psoriasis or mucous membrane pemphigoid?<br />
       <b>3</b> Is the LS in fact treated, but the patient is still
      symptomatic because they have developed a secondary sensory
      problem, dysaesthetic vulvodynia or are experiencing problems
      with intercourse that they may feel too shy to discuss?<br />
       <b>4</b> Is the problem mechanical due to scarring, e.g.
      severe phimosis or meatal stenosis in males, in which case
      surgery may be indicated?</p>

      <h4>Follow-up</h4>

      <p class="text1">The risk of malignancy in uncomplicated
      genital LS that has been diagnosed and treated appropriately
      is very small. If malignancy occurs it does so rapidly. Early
      detection would require 3-monthly follow-up consultations;
      this is generally impossible in the U.K. due to the
      constraints of the National Health Service system.</p>

      <p class="text2">The authors suggest two follow-up visits
      after the initial consultation: (i) at 3 months to assess
      response to treatment and to ensure that the patient is using
      the topical corticosteroid appropriately and judiciously, and
      (ii) if response has been satisfactory, a final assessment 6
      months later to ensure that the patient is confident in
      treating their problem and to take the opportunity to discuss
      any residual problems that the patient might have before
      discharge back to the care of their primary physician. If
      patients continue to use a topical corticosteroid it is
      suggested that they see their primary care physician once
      yearly. Instruction should be given to the patient at the
      time of their discharge from the clinic warning them that any
      persistent ulceration or new growth must be reported to their
      family practitioner who will then make an urgent referral
      back to an appropriate specialist.</p>

      <p class="text2">Long-term follow up is, however, required
      for patients with LS that continues to be poorly controlled.
      These patients usually have LS with a histological pattern
      that has features of both LS and LP with squamous cell
      hyperplasia. Clinically, these patients seem to have an
      overlap syndrome and their disease runs a relentless course
      despite trials of various therapies, and a small percentage
      does go on to develop one or more SCCs.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is important to biopsy persistent ulcers,
      erosions, hyperkeratosis and erythematous zones, whether
      present at initial presentation or subsequently, to exclude
      intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive SCC.</p>

      <h4>Recommendations and conclusions</h4>

      <p class="text1">An ultrapotent topical corticosteroid is the
      first-line treatment for LS in either sex at any site, but
      there are no randomized controlled trials comparing
      corticosteroid potency, frequency of application and duration
      of treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Asymptomatic patients with evidence of
      clinically active LS, i.e. ecchymosis, hyperkeratosis and
      progressing atrophy, should be treated.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anogenital LS is associated with SCC but the
      development of this complication is rare in clinical practice
      (5% or less). It is not yet known whether treatment will
      lessen the long-term risk of malignant change.</p>

      <p class="text2">Long-term follow up in a specialized clinic
      is unnecessary for uncomplicated disease that is well
      controlled clinically using small amounts of a topical
      corticosteroid, and follow up should be reserved for patients
      with complicated LS that is unresponsive to treatment and
      those patients who have persistent disease with history of a
      previous SCC.</p>

      <p class="text2">Surgical intervention is indicated only for
      the complications of scarring or the development of
      malignancy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Any psychosexual issues should be addressed
      if appropriate and referral made to practitioners experienced
      in this field if indicated.</p>

      <h4>Audit points</h4>

      <p class="text1">&bull; Has a biopsy been performed in
      patients with clinically active disease that is unresponsive
      to adequate treatment with an ultrapotent topical
      corticosteroid?<br />
       &bull; Are follow-up arrangements in place for patients with
      ongoing symptomatic disease?<br />
       &bull; Are patients with genital LS aware that any
      persistent ulcer, erosion or new growth within the affected
      skin needs to be reported?<br />
       &bull; <span class="yellow">Has a topical corticosteroid of
      adequate potency and duration been used prior to surgery in
      males with symptomatic preputial tightening?</span></p>

      <p class="text1">The consultation process for British
      Association of Dermatologists (BAD) guidelines has been
      published elsewhere.<sup><a href="#n86"
      target="_block">86</a></sup> Evidence is searched from
      Medline and other medical databases, from reviews and
      references in publications. There is a 3-month consultation
      process with the entire BAD membership. Updates are made at
      intervals according to new evidence and will appear on the
      BAD website and as single-sheet summary documents.</p>

      <p><i>Strength of recommendations</i></p>

      <p class="nc">A There is good evidence to support the use of
      the procedure.</p>

      <p class="nc">B There is fair evidence to support the use of
      the procedure.</p>

      <p class="nc">C There is poor evidence to support the use of
      the procedure.</p>

      <p class="nc">D There is fair evidence to support the
      rejection of the use of the procedure.</p>

      <p class="nc">E There is good evidence to support the
      rejection of the use of the procedure.</p>

      <p><i>Quality of evidence</i></p>

      <p class="nc">I Evidence obtained from at least one properly
      designed, randomized controlled trial.</p>

      <p class="nc">II-i Evidence obtained from well-designed
      controlled trials without randomization.</p>

      <p class="nc">II-ii Evidence obtained from well-designed
      cohort or case&ndash;control analytical studies, preferably
      from more than one centre or research group.</p>

      <p class="nc">II-iii Evidence obtained from multiple time
      series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in
      uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of the
      introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s) could also
      be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>

      <p class="nc">III Opinions of respected authorities based on
      clinical experience, descriptive studies or reports of expert
      committees.</p>

      <p class="nc">IV Evidence inadequate owing to problems of
      methodology (e.g. sample size, or length of comprehensiveness
      of follow-up or conflicts in evidence).</p>
