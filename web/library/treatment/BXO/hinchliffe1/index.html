      <p>Dermatopathological evaluation of pediatric preputial
      inflammatory disease rarely allows for specific diagnosis
      other than pediatric penile lichen sclerosus et atrophicus
      (balanitis xerotica obliterans, LSA/BXO). A prospective
      immunopathological study was performed on 20 consecutive,
      unselected, clinically and histopathologically confirmed
      LSA/BXO cases to determine the relative presence of T and B
      lymphocytes. There were seven cases with early stages of
      disease, eight with florid disease, and five with later
      stages of disease. Two ritual circumcision specimens and 12
      specimens with non-LSA/BXO balanitis, collected during the
      same period, were used as controls. The infiltrate in LSA/BXO
      patients was wholly composed of T cells (positive with UCLH-1
      antibody) in all cases. B cells (positive with L-26 antibody)
      were found only focally in small, discreet, easily
      recognizable (follicular or early follicle-like) aggregates,
      positioned slightly deeper than the band-like infiltrate of T
      cells. T cells were inconspicuous in 9 of the 12 control
      specimens. In the three other controls, T cells were much
      more obvious and these patients showed clinical features
      possibly suggestive of LSA/BXO in early, prediagnosable
      phases of development. We conclude that limited
      immunophenotyping may be a useful adjunct to diagnosis in
      pediatric cases in which only limited tissue is available or
      the disease may be more difficult to classify with
      confidence.</p>
