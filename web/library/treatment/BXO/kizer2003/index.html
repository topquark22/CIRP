      MC, USA, and LTC Allen F. Morey, MD</i></p>

      <div class="abstract">
        <p><b>Background:</b> We analyzed the incidence of
        balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) by both age and
        ethnicity at an equal-access health care facility.<br />
        <br />
         <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively reviewed discharge
        records from 1997 to 1999 at Brooke Army Medical Center to
        determine ethnicity and age of patients with BXO.<br />
        <br />
         <b>Results:</b> Of 153,432 male patients, 108 (0.070%) had
        a diagnosis of BXO. The age distribution was similar over a
        range from 2 to 90 years, with the exception of the third
        decade, when the incidence almost doubled. Black and
        Hispanic patients had twice the incidence found in white
        patients (10.59, 10.67 and 5.07 per 10,000 patients,
        respectively).<br />
        <br />
         <b>Conclusion:</b> At our equal-access health care
        facility, the incidence of BXO in black and Hispanic
        patients was double that in whites. This unexpected
        finding, in concert with the greater incidence in the third
        decade, may result from greater access to medical attention
        for these patients in the military setting. Nevertheless,
        further research into the origin of the disease is
        warranted.<br />

          <li>Black and Hispanic patients have twice the risk of
          white patients for acquiring balanitis xerotica
          obliterans.</li>

          <li>All age groups were susceptible to developing
          balanitis xerotica obliterans, with the diagnosis at
          approximately 2 years and continuing well into the
          90s.</li>

          <li>The incidence of balanitis xerotica obliterans was

      <p class="text1"><font size="6">B</font>alanitis xerotica
      obliterans (BXO) was first described in the urologic
      literature in 1928 by St&uuml;hmer,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> who reported it as a postcircumcision
      phenomenon. White, scaly papules generally involve the glans,
      prepuce, and urethral meatus, and may distort the penile
      architecture. Upon closer examination, white or brown horny,
      follicular plugs may be seen on the surface of these lesions,
      a feature referred to as &ldquo;delling.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Typically, patients present with
      painful erections, itching, difficulty in retracting the
      foreskin, and loss of glanular sensation.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Voiding complaints may accompany
      meatal involvement.<sup><a href="#n3">3&ndash;6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This disease must be differentiated by skin
      biopsy from lichen planus, erythroplasia of Queyrat and
      leukoplakia, as all are grossly similar. Histologically, BXO
      is remarkable for hyperkeratosis, a thinned epithelium, and
      loss of the rete pegs. (In contrast, the other conditions
      will show hypertrophied rete pegs.) The most dramatic
      characteristic of BXO is a pale-staining subepidermal layer
      composed of homogenized collagen and edema (Fig. 1). In later
      stages the papillary dermis is infiltrated with lymphocytes
      and plasma cells. Balanitis xerotica obliterans is now
      commonly regarded as synonymous histologically and clinically
      with male genital lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As rare as BXO is thought to be, it remains
      the most common cause of acquired urethral meatal stenosis in
      children and adults.<sup><a href="#n4">4,8</a></sup> The
      epidemiologic breakdown, however, has yet to be reported. In
      our retrospective epidemiologic study of 108 patients with
      BXO, some interesting findings are worthy of note.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Methods</h3>

      <p class="text2">We performed a retrospective computer search
      of the military&rsquo;s Standard Ambulatory Data Records for
      Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, TX. The data
      were searched for patients&rsquo; first date seen on an
      outpatient basis for treatment of BXO during the fiscal years
      1997 to 1999. Records with insufficient or questionable data
      on BXO were reviewed individually for clarification. Patients
      were classified by age and ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic,
      and other/ unknown), and the incidences were documented. A
      95% largesample confidence interval was used for analysis of
      all data.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Results</h3>

      <p class="text2">Of a total eligible population of 153,432
      male patients, 108 had BXO diagnosed for the first time at
      Brooke Army Medical Center from 1997 to 1999 (an incidence of
      0.070% [7.04 &plusmn; 1.33/10,000 eligible patients]). The
      distribution by age and ethnic background is shown in Tables
      1 and 2, respectively. Results showed a relatively even
      distribution of BXO throughout all age groups, with one
      exception: the age group 21 to 30 years showed a nearly
      double incidence of BXO. A comparison of BXO by ethnic
      background reflected virtually identical incidences between
      black and Hispanic patients (10.59 and 10.67/10,000), but
      these were double the incidence in white patients
      (5.07/10,000 eligible patients).</p>

      <h3 class="section">Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text2">Our findings do not support those of
      previous studies, which have suggested that BXO is
      predominantly a disease of middle-aged white men. In fact, in
      both black and Hispanic patients we noted an incidence twice
      that in whites. In addition, we found the highest incidence
      in young adults (in the third decade [13.71 cases/10,000]),
      with a relatively even distribution among all other age
      groups (Table 1).</p>

      <p class="text2">To suggest an explanation for these
      findings, it is necessary to review the etiology of BXO.
      Although one single cause has not been definitively named,
      the many suspected causes carry the common denominator of
      chronic inflammation. Autoimmune phenomena have long been
      implicated in the progression to BXO, and a strong
      association with class II antigens has strengthened this
      argument significantly. In a study of 84 white female
      patients, Marren et al<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> showed a
      78% concurrence with class II DQ human lymphocyte antigens in
      patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. A history of
      trauma with resultant scarring and eventual progression to
      histologic BXO (ie, K&ouml;bner&rsquo;s phenomenon) has been
      noted in other studies.<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup>
      After hypospadias repair, BXO with urethral stricture has
      been reported in 0.4% (3 of 796 cases).<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Various infectious agents, including
      human papilloma virus (serotype 16 in particular),
      spirochetes and atypical mycobacteria, have been implicated
      in the progression to BXO, though this remains
      unsubstantiated.</p>

      <p class="text2">The epidemiology of BXO is likewise
      uncertain. Most studies concur that the common distribution
      lies between the third and sixth decades.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13,14</a></sup> Others address a correlation
      between BXO and late circumcision for phimosis and
      hypospadias repair.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12,15&ndash;17</a></sup> These reports conclude
      that although BXO is regarded as a disease of the
      middle-aged, its prevalence in young boys is both
      underestimated and understudied. Approximately 35% of our
      patients treated for BXO had a history of late circumcision,
      genital trauma, or surgery for urethral stricture. The higher
      incidence among those aged 21 to 30 may be related to the
      high numbers of patients in that age group in the military
      receiving regular physical screenings, in comparison with
      veterans and dependent children. Our findings suggest that
      all other age groups are equally susceptible, except the very
      young (0&ndash;2 yr).</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition, most previous studies have
      focused on the white population, only three reports
      discussing lichen sclerosus in patients of other ethnic
      backgrounds.<sup><a href="#n18">18&ndash;20</a></sup> We
      found no published analysis of the demographics of BXO by
      ethnicity with which to compare our findings. One possible
      explanation for the ethnic differences in our study may be
      the better access to medical care for minorities through the
      military health care system. A second explanation might be
      cultural: at-birth circumcision was introduced into the
      United States by the white population, in whom the practice
      maintains greater popularity than in other ethnic
      groups.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Therefore, a higher
      percentage of phimosis and late circumcision among black and
      Hispanic men might not be surprising. A final explanation may
      be that BXO is more prevalent in regions with more temperate
      climates, as is penile cancer. Although BXO has not been
      putatively linked to squamous cell carcinoma, we believe that
      trends noted in our study could show BXO to be more prominent
      in tropical or subtropical regions. Further investigation of
      the comparative incidence in different regions and climates
      is warranted.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="text2">Our contemporary epidemiologic assessment of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans suggests that black and
      Hispanic patients have twice the risk of white patients of
      acquiring the disease. Second, BXO is a chronic inflammatory
      disease to which all age groups are equally susceptible,
      although it appears more frequently during the third decade.
      The range for diagnosis begins at approximately 2 years and
      continues well into the 80s and 90s. Finally, we recommend
      further research comparing the incidence of BXO in temperate
      and colder climates to assist in further identifying its
      cause.</p>
