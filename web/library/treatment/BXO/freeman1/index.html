      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balanitis
      xerotica obliterans (post-operationem) is the term which
      St&uuml;hmer<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> used in 1928 to describe an
      atrophic, shrinking process involving the glans and prepuce
      and frequently leading to urethral stenosis. On the basis of
      the first five cases St&uuml;hmer concluded that, although
      there was a close relation among various sclerosing processes
      of the male genitals described in the literature under the
      titles of leukoplakia and kraurosis, the condition in his
      cases was singularin that it developed in men in the second
      and third decades and followed circumcision for phimosis. In
      a second article he<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> described 4 more similar cases
      and expressed the opinion that balanitis xerotica obliterans
      was not identical with either kraurosis or leukoplakia of the
      male genitals.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      St&uuml;hmer's euphonious title became a popular one; and
      several cases of sclerotic, atrophic dermatoses of the glans
      and prepuce have been reported before various foreign
      societies under the same name, and several contributions to
      the subject have appeared, such as those by M&uuml;ller,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> Sprafke,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font>
      Gr&uuml;tz,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> Beek<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> and de Gregorio, de Blasio and
      Hijar.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> No
      formal article devoted to the subject has appeared in the
      American literature, although balanitis xerotica obliterans
      was discussed by Madden<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> in his paper on the balantides,
      and a case was recently presented at a meeting of the San
      Francisco and Los Angeles Dermatological Societies by
      Novy.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></font>
      Fort this reason we felt that a discussion of this relatively
      uncommon disease and especially its relation to leukoplakia,
      scleroderma, lichen sclerosis et atrophicus and kraurosis,
      was worth while. Considerable confusion exists especially
      among balanitis xerotica obliterans, kraurosis and
      leukoplakia of the male genitals.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leukoplakia
      of the penis was first referred to in 1892 by Perrin,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> who describe
      a case in which the prepuce and frenulum were involved but
      the glans and urethra were normal. Where the prepuce was
      retracted, its inner fold instead of being read was covered
      by a white shiny coating which was rough in some places and
      smooth in others. The lesion of the prepuce formed a firm
      apparently fibrous ring about the penis 1 inch (2.5 cm.) back
      of the coronal sulcus. Perrin and Leredde<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></font> described a
      second case in 1897, in which there were some white sclerotic
      plaques on the glans and on the inner fold of the prepuce.
      Urethral stenosis was not noted. It was mentioned that some
      of the patches were rough and hypertrophic while others were
      smooth and atrophic.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Brandweiner<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> (1907), Kraus<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></font> (1907) and
      Fuchs<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font>
      (1908) also reported white, patchy thickenings of the prepuce
      or glans under the title of leukoplakia. Fuchs even at that
      time compared the process to kraurosis vulvae. In these
      cases, however, no mention was made of atrophic retraction of
      the glans or of urethral stenosis.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1908
      Delbanco<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> published 3 cases of what he
      termed kraurosis glandis et praeputii penis, characterized by
      a progressive, atrophic retraction of the glans and inner
      fold of the prepuce leading to stenosis of the urethral
      meatus. The disease was accompanied by intense itching and
      disagreeable paresthesias. Delbanco stated his belief that
      kraurosis was a disease sui generis differing from the
      condition in cases of leukoplakia described by Kraus and
      Fuchs.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1910
      Galewsky<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> discussed 6 cases of
      &ldquo;leukokeratosis&rdquo; (kraurosis) of the glans and
      prepuce, aligning them with those of Delbanco. Galewsky
      emphasized the difficulty of distinguishing kraurosis from
      leukoplakia when the location was on the penis.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1925
      Benedek,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> from a study of 3 cases and a
      thorough survey of the literature, concluded that there was a
      disease consisting of leuko-keratotic lesions of the genitals
      characterized by pure hyperplasia and hypetrophy, to which he
      applied the term leukokeratosis. In contrast was the
      condition in cases such as those of Delbanco and Galewsky,
      presenting the histologic picture of atrophy, for which he
      reserved the term kraurosis. He suggested the name
      leukosclerokeratosis for the condition in which leukoplakic
      (hypertrophic) as well as kraurotic (atrophic) changes were
      present simultaneously. He expressed the opinion that
      leukokeratosis, leukosclerotosis, kraurosis and even
      subsequent malignant degeneration were closely related and
      represented various stages of the same pathologic
      processes.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genner and
      Nielson,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font> in 1931, published an
      extensive article dealing with leukokeratosis and kraurosis
      of the penis and described 3 cases under the title
      leukokeratosis. The authors concluded that on the basis of
      all available experience the exact relation of leukokeratosis
      (leukoplakia) and kraurosis to one another was not clearly
      established. For a more detailed consideration of the
      pertinent literature reference may be made to the
      publications of Benedek or Genner and Nielson.</p>

      <center>
        <p>CLINICAL FEATURES</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have
      studied a total of 18 cases of balanitis xerotica obliterans,
      and Dr. Harry Foerster set us histologic sections from an
      additional case (Michelson, 9 cases; Sweitzer, 3; Madden, 3;
      Freeman, 1 and Laymon 2). The disease occurred at various
      ages ranging from 22 to 65. A relationship to circumcision
      could not be determined in any of the patients, and a history
      of repeated attacks of balanoposthitis was notably absent
      except in 1. Each of the patients presented much the same
      picture, which will be described in detail in another part of
      the paper. Urethral stenosis was present in all.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St&uuml;hmer
      characterized balanitis xerotica obliterans as an
      obliterative cicatrixical, sclerotic shrinking process
      involving the prepuce and glans. In his patients, who were
      relatively young (under 40), the lesions appeared as a rule
      several months after circumcision or dorsal incision of the
      prepuce for phimosis. The disease, however, is not
      exclusively limited to young persons, as illustrated by such
      patients as those of Morimoto<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> (64 years old), M&uuml;ller
      (66 years old) and Gr&uuml;tz (4 patients over 50) and
      several of ours. Also, since St&uuml;hmer's article was
      published, identical conditions have been described in
      patients wwho had never had a circumcision or a dorsal
      incision; hence it must be assumed that an operative
      procedure is not a requisite for the diagnosis of balanitis
      xerotica obliterans. For example, in 5 of the 12 cases
      described by de Gregario, de Blasio and Hijar there had been
      no previous operation of any kind.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The early
      symptoms of the disease vary in acuity and intensity. They
      may be of insufficient severity to force the patients to seek
      medical advice, so that when the patient is first seen by a
      physician the disease is in full development. The early
      changes are especially apt to remain unnoticed if the prepuce
      is long, and they may consist of only a few erythematous
      areas on the prepuce or glans. We have observed patients,
      however, in which the disease appeared abruptly and in its
      early phases underwent an extremely stormy course. There was
      intense pain, itching, burning and prickling with profuse
      purulent secretion and in one instance sloughing of the
      distal half-centimeter of the urethra so that it hung from
      the meatus and had to be clipped away. Later in the course of
      the disease there may be pain on erection, diminution in
      sensation on the glans and disturbance of the sexual
      function.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balanitis
      xerotica obliterans is chronic and as a rule slowly
      progressive. From the observation of our own case, however,
      it should be stated that the disease in certain cases may run
      a somewhat cyclic course characterized by periods of decided
      improvement, the skin apparently becoming less sclerotic and
      the urethral stenosis less intense. In his patients who had
      been circumcised St&uuml;hmer referred to balanitis xerotica
      obliterans as a pterygium-like growth appearing at the point
      of excision of the prepuce and extending onto the glans. In
      patients who had not been circumcised there is an almost
      constant involvement of of the prepuce in the form ofa
      constricting, sclerotic band which is located 1 or 2 cm. from
      the distal end. As the disease progresses, the coronal sulcus
      may partially or completely disappear, and the frenulum may
      be obliterated or sclerosed. There may be adhesions between
      the prepuce and the glans.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      involvement of the glans may or may not be diffuse. If it is,
      the glans is white, bluish white or ivory colored. If it is
      not diffuse, the admixture of white plaques and the normal
      red tissue of the glans gives rise to a mottled appearance.
      In Novy's case there were areas of telangiectasia resembling
      roentgen ray dermatitis. The glans may appear shriveled,
      although when stretched between the fingers the skin is thin,
      smooth and shiny. M&uuml;ller mentioned the resemblance of
      the lesions to parchment. The affected tissues are more
      friable than normal, so that tiny fissues appear especially
      on the prepuce and on the frenulum. Erosions and hemorrhagic
      or serious subepidermal bullae, especially near the meatus,
      may accompany the cicatricial changes. We noted hemorrhagic
      bullae in one of our cases early in the course of the
      disease. Carcinoma may be an eventual development, as
      exemplified in cases described by St&uuml;hmer,
      Fr&uuml;hwald<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> and Gr&uuml;tz.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></p>

      aged 33. The disease began insidiously in 1938. <i>A</i>,

      plaques on the glans. <i>B</i>, there is considerable
      involvement of the meatus and extrensive involvement of the
      glans.</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
      noteworthy and constant feature of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans is the gradual narrowing of the urethral meatus,
      often leading to complete stenosis, which renders urination
      increasingly difficult and finally impossible.
      Ga&yacute;et<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></font> stressed the potential
      dangers of a meatal stricture, stating that it may lead to
      urinary retention, damage to the posterior urethra, bladders
      and kidneys or even perineal phlegmon.</p>

      <center>
        <p>HISTOLOGIC FEATURES</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Gregorio,
      de Blasio and Hijar pointed out that histologic studies lead
      one to believe that balanitis xerotica obliterans is related
      pathologenetically to a series of recurring subacute or
      chronic inflammatory processes in which restitutio ad
      integrum is impossible and which eventually lead to a state
      of cicatrixation or sclerosis.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the
      coure of the disease inflammatory changes predominate. The
      epithelium is invaded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and at
      first there is an abundant, diffuse, cellular infiltrate in
      the papillary portion of the edematous cutis with large
      numbers of the same type of cells. Later, the relative number
      of lymphocytes increases, and epitheloid and plasma cells may
      be present. In the subacute phases the lympocytic infiltrate
      becomes arranged about the vessels.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the
      evolution of the process histiocytes proliferate intensively
      in areas which later are centers of cicatrixation. De
      Gregorio, de Blasio and Hijar noted that migratory cells
      tended to disappear as the connective tissue became denser
      and that walls of the blood vessels became reduced to a
      single layer of endothelium. Proliferation of connective
      tissue seemed most accented about these vessels.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fully
      developed condition there is distinct aprophy of the
      epidermis, but with relative and absolute hyperkeratosis.
      There may be a moderate degree of intracellular edema in the
      lower portions of the epidermis and slight liquefaction
      degeneration of the basal cell layer. Perhaps the most
      striking histologic feature of balanitis xerotica obliterans
      is the band of homogenization in the upper portion of the
      cutis. This area appears relatively acellular and edematous
      and may show diminution or complete disappearance of the
      elastic tissue. To this point the histologic pictures of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans and lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus are practically identical. However, in balanitis
      xerotica obliterans we have not observed a bandlike formation
      of the infiltrate as is frequently seen in lichen sclerosus
      et atrophicus just below the homogenized zone. In the middle
      and deeper portions of the cutis there is a lymphocytic
      perivascular infiltrate.</p>

      <center>
        RELATION TO AND DIFFERENTIATION FROM OTHER DISEASES
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the
      most difficult aspects in the diagnosis of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans is its relation to and differentiation from
      similar and probably closely related processes involving the
      male genitals, including the following diseases: (<i>a</i>)
      erythoplasia of Queyrat, (<i>b</i>) circumscribed
      scleroderma, (<i>c</i>) lichen sclerosus et atrophicus,
      (<i>d</i>) lichen planus, (<i>e</i>) kraurosis and (<i>f</i>)
      leukoplakia.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A.
      Erythroplasia of Queyrat</i>.-Sulzberger and Satenstein<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup></font> first
      recorded this condition in America as a rare form of
      precancerosis. The lesions, which may occur on the glans or
      prepuce, are well defined, slightly elevated patches with
      brilliant red, velvety surfaces. Thus the efflorescences are
      are entirely different from the thin, white, sclerotic
      plaques of balanitis xerotica obliterans. Histologically
      there is hypertrophy rather than atrophy of the epidermis.
      Peyri,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></font>
      however has classified erythroplasia as a type of kraurosis,
      dividing the latter into an atrophodermic (Delbanco) type, a
      white or leukoplakic type and a red or erythroplasic type. It
      seems to us that neither clinical nor histological
      differentiation between erythroplasia and balanitis xerotica
      obliterans should present serious difficulty.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>B.
      Circumscribed Sleroderma</i>.&mdash;Scleroderma occurs
      extremely rarely on the male genitals. Pautrier and
      Camus,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></font>
      in 1932, reported the case of a patient who presented a ring
      of scleroderma about the glans and prepuce. In 1934 Gougerot,
      Degos and Roulle<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> described 2 similar cases and
      stressed the difficulty in making a diagnosis if there were
      no lesions elsewhere on the body. In 1939 Gougerot and
      Basset<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></font>
      reported the case of a boy aged 19 in whom two sclerotic
      rings developed on the glans and prepuce three weeks after an
      attack of balanitis. In this case the urethral meatus was
      contracted and infiltrated. In the discussion of the case
      Clement Simon proposed a diagnosis of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans. Touraine also related an interesting case which
      he had studied in which there was typical balanitis xerotica
      obliterans with scleroderma en bande of the abdomen and
      inguinal regions. For this reason he felt that balanitis
      xerotica obliterans was a part of scleroderma. In his
      discussion of balanitis xerotica obliterans Madden expressed
      his belief that the disease was closely related to morphea.
      In our opinion, however, the histologic picture affords a
      means of differentiating scleroderma from balanitis xerotica
      obliterans. In the former there is an actual increase in
      number and thickening of the individual connective tissue
      fibers throughout the whole cutis, as contrasted with the
      edematous, homogenized zone in the upper part of the cutis in
      balanitis xerotica obliterans.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>C. Lichen
      Sclerosus et Atrophicus</i>.&mdash;At a meeting of the
      Minnesota Dermatological Society during the summer of 1940,
      Becker presented a male patient aged 52 who had typical
      papules of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in the clavular and
      scapular regions, on the shaft of the penis and on the
      scrotum and the characteristic sclerosing lesions of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans on the prepuce and on the
      glans. Urethral stenosis was present. Unfortunately a biopsy
      was not performed on the glans, although the histologic
      picture of a lesion from the clavicular region was that of
      lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Fabry,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></font> in 1928, described a case in
      which in all probability, there was a similar association.
      The patient, who was 35 years of age, was said to have had
      kraurosis penis complicated by a superficial carcinoma of the
      glans and &ldquo;white spot disease&rdquo; on the scrotum.
      Judging from the photomicrograph in the article we believe
      the condition was an example of lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus. The association in Becker's and in Fabry's
      patients affords interesting speculation concerning the
      relation of balanitis xerotica obliterans and lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus. Is the former a manifestation of the
      latter localized to the penis or is such an association
      coincidental? Certainly the simultaneous occurrence of the
      two diseases must be extremely rare, or it would have been
      reported previously in the literature.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      characteristic lesion of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is an
      irregular, often polygonal, flat-topped papule. The ivory or
      mother-of-pearl color of the lesions is striking. They may be
      discrete or may coalesce to form plaques, but in most cases
      both types of lesions are present. The presence of dells and
      of follicular plugging is regarded as an important diagnostic
      aid. It is noteworthy, however that, the on the vulva the
      striking lesion is the plaque, although individual papules
      with dells or plugs may be seen at the periphery of the
      plaque. In the recent, thorough study of lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus by Montgomery and Hill<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> the disease occurred in males
      in only 8 of 46 cases. Penile lesions were present in only
      one case, and these were characteristic papules located on
      the shaft. No mention was made of lesions simulating
      balanitis xerotica obliterans, as were observed in Becker's
      case. Both diseases, of course, are rare on the male
      genitals. If they were the same it would seem that a more
      frequent occurrence of genital and body lesions should have
      been recorded. In none of our cases have we noted individual
      papules suggesting lichen sclerosus et atrophicus at the
      borders of the plaques characterizing balatitis xerotica
      obliterans, nor have the patients complained of lesions
      elsewhere on the body when attention was focused on the
      genital lesions which were causing urethral stenosis and
      resulting disturbances of urination.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      histologic picture of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus shows a
      band of sclerosus in the upper part of the cutus. Even if
      this amount of sclerosus were insufficient to cause atresia
      and stenosis of the vagina when the disease occurred in the
      female, it might conceivably produce stricture of a much
      narrower orifice, such as the urethral meatus in the male. We
      are unable to decide whether or not balanitis xerotica
      obliterans and lichen sclerosus et atrphicus are the same
      disease. Certainly there is a close ethical and histologic
      similarity. When two related conditions occur at various
      ages, are similar clinically and even indistinguishable
      histologically, it seems difficult to separate them clearly
      when the lesions are limited to the penis.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>D. Lichen
      Planus</i>.&mdash;It is not within the scope of this paper to
      discuss the possible relation of lichen planus to lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus, except to state that recent studies
      of the subject (Nomland,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup></font> and Montgomery and Hill<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></font>) strengthen
      the belief that the two are separate entities. Lesions of
      lichen planus limited to the penis may present a superficial
      similarity to balanitis xerotica obliterans.We have never
      observed the two conditions in 1 patient, nor to our
      knowledge has such an association been reported in the
      literature. If the characteristic lesions of lichen planus
      can be found elsewhere on the skin or mucous membranes, the
      diagnosis of the penile lesions presents no difficulty.
      Lesions of lichen planus on the genitals are more apt to be
      elevated in contrast to the atrophic plaques of balanitis
      xerotica obliterans, and urethral stenosis is not present in
      the former. In typical cases of the two diseases histologic
      studies also afford a reliable means of differentiation.
      Except in the rare atrophic forms of lichen planus there is
      an increase in the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum
      with varying degrees of acanthosis, in contrast to distinct
      atrophy in balanitis xerotica obliterans. The sharply limited
      band of infiltrate in the upper part of the cutis in lichen
      planus persists even in the atrophic form of the disease, in
      which the epidermis is decidedly thinned. In cases of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans the area which is the site of
      infiltrate in lichen planus appears edematous and
      homogenized. In 1 of our cases a moderate degree of
      infiltrate was noted high in the cutis, but the homogenized
      edematous papillary layer was present nevertheless, a feature
      which is not observed in lichen planus.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>E. Kraurosis Penis</i>.&mdash;One who
      carefully analyzes and compares the clinical and histologic
      features of balanitis xerotica obliterans and kraurosis penis
      is forced to admit that there are no essential differences.
      Both are chronic, atrophic, sclerosing processes of the
      prepuce and glans leading to urethral stenosis. Both show
      atrophy of the epidermis, edema and homogenization of the
      cutis, inflammatory changes about the blood vessels and
      diminuition or loss of the elastic tissue. St&uuml;mer
      admitted that the fundamental changes in the two diseases
      were the same but stated the belief that balanitis xerotica
      obliterans should be set aside as a separate entity because
      (1) it occurred in younger patients, (2) it followed some
      operative procedure and (3) the annoying itching and
      paresthesias which presumably characterize kraurosis penis
      were not prominent features in this disease. As we have
      stated previously, the aforementioned differential points
      seem insufficient, since balanitis xerotica obliterans has,
      since St&uuml;hmer&rsquo;s report, been observed in older
      persons and in patients who have had no operation. Moreover,
      as Delbanco reported kraurosis penis in patients as young as
      39. We have noted annoying itching and paresthesias in
      several of our patients for whom we have made a diagnosis of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans. Such symptoms vary
      considerably and certainly do not carry a great degree of
      diagnostic significance. As Beek noted, carcinoma has been
      reported in cases of a condition diagnosed as kraurosis penis
      as well as in those of a disease called balanitis xerotica
      obliterans. In view of the rarity of such cases, regardless
      of title, the tendency to malignant change offers no reliable
      means of differentiation. We share the opinion of Beek that
      balanitis xerotica obliterans and kraurosis penis are
      identical. They look the same; the histologic picture shows
      no important variations; the follow the same chronic course,
      and both eventuate in urethral stenosis. Beek felt that
      kraurosis (or, as he termed it, progressive atrophy of the
      glans and prepuce) might be divided into the following three
      types: (1) spontaneous (Delbanco), (2) postoperative
      (St&uuml;hmer) and (3) postbalantic (Gr&uuml;tz).</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>F. Leukoplakia Penis</i>.&mdash;If the
      term leukoplakia is reserved for patchy, circumscribed,
      thickened, smooth or rough, milky, opalescent plaques which
      rarely occur on the glans or prepuce, there is less confusion
      with balanitis xerotica obliterans. Leukoplakia of the male
      genitals is identical with that occurring in the mouth. It is
      a hypertrophic, hyperplastic process rather than an atrophic
      retractive one. It may occur alone, as in Benedek's case, or
      in conjunction with atrophic lesions, as in the cases of
      Kraus and Genner and Nielson. The same frequent association
      of kraurosis and leukoplakic vulvitis in the female has been
      emphasized by Montgomery, Counseller and Craig.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Summary</i>.&mdash; Even though it is
      not possible to say that leukoplakia, balanitis xerotica
      obliterans, scleroderma and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus
      are the same, they must stand in close relation to one
      another. Kraurosis penis and balanitis xerotica obliterans
      seem to us indistinguishable; we have observed lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus of the body and balanitis xerotica
      obliterans in the same patient. Touraine noted balanitis
      xerotica obliterans and morphea in the same patient, and
      leukoplakia and atrophic changes have been frequently seen
      together in both male and female. In all probability there is
      some unknown property of the tissues of certain persons which
      predisposes them to the development of these various
      sclerosing processes. In our opinion there is insufficient
      evidence to conclude that leukoplakia (hypertrophic) changes
      occur primarily in balanitis xerotica obliterans and that
      atrophy develops later. It seems more likely that the two
      conditions occur coincidentally, since they are the exact
      opposite of each other histologically.</p>

      <center>
        <p>COMMENT</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans is unknown. In his original
      presentation St&uuml;hmer opined that the most important
      factor in the pathogenesis was circumcision, which lead to a
      mechanical disturbance and an unusual drying of the glans.
      These factors predisposed to subsequent inflammation or
      infection which finally brought about sclerotic changes
      characterizing the fully developed condition. He was unable
      to incriminate any specific organism. He felt that there were
      initial acanthosis and hyperkeratosis as a result of these
      epidermal insults and that the changes in the cutis were
      secondary. It is obvious that circumcision does not
      necessarily precede balanitis xerotica obliterans, since in
      many cases there has been no previous operation, and,
      conversely, balanitis xerotica obliterans has not followed
      many circumcisions. Since St&uuml;hmer&rsquo;s publication,
      other authors, including Gr&uuml;tz, Beek, and de Gregario,
      de Blasio and Hijar; have suggested that the atrophic and
      sclerotic changes of balanitis xerotica obliterans are the
      consequences of a chronic inflammatory state induced by
      repeated attacks of balanoposthitis provoked usually by
      partial or total phimosis. Various bacteria, such as
      streptococci, streptobacilli and spirili, have been found on
      the genitals but were not regarded by the observers as
      etiologically important. The disease is unrelated to syphilis
      or other systemic diseases. One of Gr&uuml;tz&rsquo;s
      patients had diabetes, although adequate studies of 2 other
      patients showed no signs of the disease.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therapy
      of well developed balanitis xerotica obliterans is difficult,
      since restitution of the sclerotic parts to normal by any
      known therapeutic means cannot be expected in most cases.
      St&uuml;hmer said that the application of bland emollient
      ointments following circumcision was of prophylactic value
      and that similar therapy early in the course of the disease
      might retard its progress. De Gregario, de Blasio and Hijar
      expressed the opinion that early circumcision of all patients
      with phimosis would help to avoid the repeated attacks of
      balanoposthitis which in turn create a chronic inflammatory
      state leading to balanitis xerotica obliterans.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the
      disease is fully developed the chief consideration is the
      maintenance of a urethral opening of adequate size so as to
      prevent retention of urine. The most common procedure is to
      pass sounds repeatedly and as frequently as the condition of
      the meatus demands. Gayet expressed the belief that more
      radical therapy should be done, stating that rapid recurrence
      of the urethral stenosis followed even meatotomy and that a
      veritable hypospadia should be surgically created to insure a
      permanently adequate orifice and avoidance of serious damage
      to the urethra, bladder and kidneys. We do not share this
      view. Such complications did not develop in any of our
      patients in spite of extreme narrowing of the meatus. It is
      the consensus that any operative treatment of stricture may
      aggravate the condition. Furthermore, it is our distinct
      impression that the entire process in balanitis xerotica
      obliterans improved after the repeated passage of bougies,
      the improvement being analogous to that obtained by massage
      in scleroderma. It is our opinion that routine dilation of
      the urethra at regular intervals, (at least monthly) by means
      of bougies is important in the management of this disease. In
      cases characterized by a constricting band about the prepuce,
      circumcision adds greatly to the comfort of the patient, and
      in 1 of our cases there was remarkable improvement in the
      whole process within three months after such an
      operation.</p>

      <center>
        <p>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Balanitis xerotica
      obliterans is a chronic, progressive, atrophic, sclerosing
      process of the glans and prepuce leading to a urethral
      stenosis.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Operations on the
      genitals are unnecessary for its development, and it may
      occur in adults of all ages.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The histologic
      picture consists of atrophy of the epidermis, edema and
      homogenization of the papillary cutis, perivascular
      inflammatory changes and diminution or loss of the elastic
      tissue.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. In our opinion,
      kraurosis penis and balanitis xerotica obliterans are the
      same disease, since insufficient clinical and histologic
      differences exist to permit their separation.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Further observations
      are necessary to decide the relation of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. If not
      identical, they are extremely closely allied.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Scleroderma can be
      differentiated from balanitis xerotica obliterans on
      histologic grounds. Scleroderma of the penis is extremely
      rare.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The term leukoplakia
      of the penis should be reserved for hypertrophic rather than
      atrophic lesions.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The therapy of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans must be directed toward the
      maintenance of an adequate urethral meatus by the means of
      the regular passage of dilating bougies.</p>
