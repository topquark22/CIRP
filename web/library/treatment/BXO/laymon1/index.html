    <div class="corpus">
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      1941, we<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font>
      reported <a
      href="/library/treatment/BXO/freeman1/">observations</a>
      based on a study of 18 cases of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans, a disease of the male genitals to which attention
      was first called by St&uuml;hmer<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> in 1928. Balanitis xerotica
      obliterans may be briefly defined as a chronic, progressive,
      atrophic, sclerosing process of the glans and prepuce leading
      to urethral stenosis. Operations on the genitals, such as
      circumcision and dorsal incision, are not etiologic factors
      in our opinion. In contradistinction to St&uuml;hmer's<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> belief that
      the disease occurs only in young adults, we feel that it may
      occur at any age.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      onset of balanitis xerotica obliterans is as a rule
      insidious, although it may appear as an acute disease with
      pain, itching burning, prickling and profuse purulent
      secretion. It becomes chronic and in most cases slowly
      progressive up to a certain point, where it remains
      stationery. In patients who have not been circumcised there
      is almost constant involvement of the prepuce in the form of
      a sclerotic, constricting band, which is located 1 or 2 cm.
      from the distal end. The involvement of the glans may be
      diffuse or as mottled patches. The admixture of the white
      plaques and normal red tissue of the glans may give rise to a
      mosaic appearance, and if telangiectasia is present there may
      be a resemblance to roentgen ray dermatitis. Fissure and
      erosions are rather common, andhemorrhagic or serous bullae
      often accompany the cicatricial changes. The eventual
      development of carcinoma was reported by St&uuml;hmer,
      Fr&uuml;hwald<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> and Gr&uuml;tz.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> One of the
      noteworthy features of balanitis xerotica obliterans is the
      gradual narrowing of the urethral meatus, which often leads
      to almost complete stricture.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      association of balanitis xerotica obliterans and lichen
      sclerosus et atrphicus was not noted in any of our 18
      patients discussed in 1941, although unfortunately we made no
      careful search for lesions elsewhere on the body. Unless such
      an examination were made, it would be easy to overlook small
      papules or patches of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the
      body when attention was focused on the genital lesions which
      were causing urethral stenosis with resulting disturbances in
      urination. Our attention was called to a possible
      relationship between the two diseases in 1940 at a meeting of
      the Minnesota Dermatological Society, where Dr. Fred Becker
      presented a patient with unmistakable papules of lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus in the clavicular and scapular
      regions and on the shaft of the penis and scrotum, along with
      characteristic sclerosing lesions of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans on the prepuce and glans. It was impossible to
      obtain a specimen for biopsy from the glans, although the
      histologic structure of a lesion from the clavicular region
      was that of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Fabry<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> in
      1928 reported a case in which there was in all probability as
      similar association. The patient, aged 35, was said to have
      had "kraurosis penis" and "white spot disease" on the
      scrotum. Judging from the photomicrograph in the article, we
      believe that the eruption was lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Montgomery and Hill<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> presented an excellent study of
      lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in 1940. In their group of 46
      patients the disease occurred in 8 males, only 1 of whom had
      penile lesions. In this case there were characteristic
      papules of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the shaft but no
      sclerosing atrophic lesions on the glans and prepuce such as
      characterize balanitis xerotica obliterans.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since
      our previous report we have carefully examined 6 additional
      patients with balantis xerotica obliterans. One of these
      presented no lesions of interest elsewhere on the body.
      Another showed multiple striae and atrophic scars on the body
      (said to have followed furunculosis), some of which bore a
      close resemblance to patches of lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus. The cases of the other 4 patients are briefly
      summarized.</p>

      <center>
        <p>REPORT OF CASES</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
      size="2">Case 1.--H. L., a white man aged 25, had three
      typical plaques of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the
      back, the largest (3 cm. in diameter) in the midline just
      below the collar line and a smaller lesion (1 cm. in
      diameter) to either side and below the largest one. The
      largest one appeard in 1933. There was a similar patch 4 by 3
      cm. in the right clavicular region which prevented follicular
      dilation and plugging. The lesion was noted first in 1939.
      Several isolated acromatic papules were seen in the left
      clavicular region.</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
      size="2">There were shiny white atrophic patches on the glans
      and a constricting ring about the prepuce; the frenulum was
      sclerotic, and the urethral meatus was slightly but
      definitely narrowed. Tightness of the prepuce was noted at
      the same time that the clavicular lesion appeared.</font></p>

      <center>
        <p><img src="figure1.gif" alt="Case 1" /></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
      size="2">Case 2.--C. T., a white man aged 55, presented three
      pea-sized white papules in the right inguinal region which
      were typical of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, In addition,
      there were distinct urethral stenosis and patchy involvement
      of the glans which were identical with those of all of our
      other patients with balanitis xerotica obliterans. No
      histologic studies were made.</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
      size="2">Case 3.--C. D., a white man aged 37, presented a
      sclerotic band about the prepuce of a year's duration,
      definite narrowing of the meatus with difficulty in
      urination, atrophic plaques on the glans, and several white
      shiny papules over the scapulas which showed well developed
      follicular plugging. Biopsy was not permitted.</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
      size="2">Case 4.--J. P., a white man aged 67, noted
      difficulty in retracting the prepuce during the summer of
      1942. When he was examined in February 1943 there was a
      constricting band of sclerotic tissue about the prepuce and
      white patches on the glans but only slight narrowing of the
      meatus. All along the shaft and extending down to the
      preputial constriction were white papules such as are seen
      with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. There were no other
      lesions elsewhere on the body. The patient was circumcised
      and the tissue which was removed included isolated papules
      and the constricting band, which were in
      approximation.</font></p>

      <center>
        <p>COMMENT</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      our previous report on balanitis xerotica obliterans we
      speculated briefly concerning its relationship to lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus. The primary lesion of the latter
      disease is a flat irregular, often polygonal papule of the
      color of ivory or mother of pearl. The papules may remain
      discrete, or they may coalesce to form plaques; in most cases
      both types of lesions are present. The presence of cells and
      follicular plugs aids in the diagnosis. The article of
      Montgomery and Hill contains an excellent photograph of
      multiple discrete papules on the shaft of the penis in lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus. One of our patients (case 4) had
      practically identical lesions plus constricting involvement
      of the prepuce, plaques on the glans and narrowing of the
      meatus. The histologic features were entirely consistent with
      those regarded as characteristic of lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus, and, since the patient was circumcised, the
      opportunity was afforded to compare the histologic features
      of the isolated papules with those of the constricting band,
      all in one section. They appeared identical.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      not our purpose here to discuss the possible relations of
      lichen planus to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, although we
      share the views of Nomland<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> and Montgomery and Hill<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> that the two
      are separate entities. In our 24 cases of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans we never saw associated lichen planus.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
      previously stated our opinion that so-called kraurosis penis
      and balanitis xerotica obliterans are identical, and there is
      no need to repeat here our reasons for this view. Briefly,
      however, there are no essential differences in either the
      clinical or histologic features It is beside the point also
      in this paper to open discussion as whether balanitis
      xerotica obliterans (kraurosis penis) is the analog in the
      male of kraurosis vulvae. Certainly there is considerable
      difference of opinion concerning the relationship of
      kraurosis vulvae to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus affecting
      the female genitals. We plan to make this the subject of a
      future investigation.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
      fully developed balanitis xerotica obliterans it is possible
      to make a definite histologic diagnosis. The epidermis is
      distinctly atrophic, with relative and absolute
      hyperkeratosis. There may be a moderate degree of
      intracellular edema in the lower portions of the epidermis
      and slight liquefaction degeneration of the basal layer,
      beneath which there may be a few lymphocytes. The most
      striking histologic feature is the band of homogenized
      connective tissue in the upper portion of the cutis. This
      zone appears relatively acellular and edematous and may show
      diminution or complete disappearance of the elastic tissue.
      We have also seen a bandlike infiltration beneath the
      homogenized zone in one of our later patients showing that
      the clinical features of balanitis xerotica obliterans and
      presenting patches of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the
      body (case 1). It is immediately obvious to
      dermatopathologists that the aforementioned histologic
      description of balanitis xerotica obliterans could just as
      well be used to characterize lichen sclerosus et atrophicus,
      since the feature of both are identical. In case 1 biopsies
      were performed on specimens from the clinical lesions of
      lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the body as well as from
      the plaques on the genitals regarded as balanitis xerotica
      obliterans, and there were no noteworthy differences in the
      conditions observed.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      case 2 the genital lesions were in every way characteristic
      of balanitis xerotica obliterans. The lesion in the groin was
      just as typical of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, and it is
      especially interesting that the patient had been seen
      previously by other dermatologists and that they had
      expressed the opinion that the disease was lichen sclerosus
      et atrophicus.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case 3, although
      histologic studies were not permitted, the same association
      was noted clinically.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
      are of the opinion, then, that balanitis xerotica obliterans
      and lichen sclerosis et atrophicus are identical. Lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus can occur on the male genitals in two
      forms: (1) as isolated papules on the shaft and (2) as a
      constricting band about the prepuce, with plaques on the
      glans and urethral stenosis. Both forms may coexist, and both
      may occur alone or with ordinary lesions of lichen sclerosis
      et atrophicus elsewhere on the body. The histologic features
      of all types of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus are, as should
      be expected, the same.</p>

      <center>
        <p>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six
      cases of balanitis xerotica obliterans are added to the 18
      previously reported. Four of the patients had plaques of
      lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the body in association
      with the genital lesions, and another showed typical isolated
      papules of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on the shaft of the
      penis with lesions of balanitis xerotica obliterans on the
      glans and prepuce.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our opinion lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus and balanitis xerotica obliterans are
      identical.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus may occur on the genitals as
      (1) isolated papules on the shaft or (2) sclerotic preputial
      and urethral involvement, with patches on the glans. Both
      types of genital involvement may occur alone or with lesions
      on the body. All forms present the same histologic
      features.</p>
