      <p class="text1"><i>ABSTRACT&mdash;Our entire clinical
      experience with the use of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
      laser in the treatment of 67 patients with diverse external
      genital lesions is presented. Successful eradication was
      accomplished in 61 patients with wide distribution of
      condylomatous lesions, with 88 per cent responding to a
      single laser treatment. Excellent cosmetic results, as well
      as complete disappearance of balanitis xerotica obliterans
      and erythroplasia of Queyrat, were observed in 5 additional
      patients. Laser therapy, although not an established
      treatment option, appears to be a safe alternative and should
      be considered in those patients with recurrent genital
      condylomata, balanitis xerotica obliterans, as well as
      erythroplasia of Queyrat, not responding to well-known
      treatment modalities.</i></p>
      <hr color="black" size="1" />

      <p>Laser therapy has become a reality, and its enormous
      potential has opened additional avenues in the treatment of
      external genital lesions,<sup><a href="#n1">1-7</a></sup>
      urethral stricture disease,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      bladder neoplasms,<sup><a href="#n3">3-4</a></sup> staghorn
      calculus,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> etc.</p>

      <p class="text2">The carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> laser is a
      member of a class of lasers called &ldquo;molecular
      lasers.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The infrared
      beam emitted by the CO<sub>2</sub> laser is absorbed by the
      tissues, converted into heat, resulting in cell vaporization.
      Water within the tissue evaporates at the temperature of
      laser impact greater than 100&deg;C. The thermal response to
      CO<sub>2</sub> laser energy varies with the water content of
      the particular cells. The greater the absorption, the more
      precise and controllable the tissue destruction. If
      absorption is poor, deep thermal effect will occur. <span
      class="yellow">Since epithelial cells have the greatest water
      content, absorption will be the greatest, and it is precisely
      this fact that makes CO<sub>2</sub> laser an excellent tool
      for the treatment of external genital lesions.</span></p>

        <p>Material and Methods</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">From July, 1978 to June, 1983, 61 male and 6
      female patients with an age range between fifteen and
      fifty-three years were treated. Of these 67 patients,
      CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment was done on 47 patients under
      general anesthesia, and on 20 patients with local
      infiltration of 1% lidocaine (Xylocaine) supplemented by
      intravenous diazepam fentanyl sodium. From this total of 67
      patients, 24 (18 males and 6 females have been the subject of
      previous reports (22 patients with distal urethral and meatal
      condylomata,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> 1 case of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans,<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      1 case of erythroplasia of Queyrat<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>). Thus, 40 new cases of recurrent
      genital condylomata (18 distal urethral and meatal, 12 penile
      shaft, 10 penile shaft and perineum) were treated in addition
      to 1 case of erythroplasia of Queyrat, and 2 cases of
      balanitis xerotical obliterans.</p>

      <p class="text2">A 733 Sharplan CO<sub>2</sub> laser,
      continuous wave mode, withan output of 30 wats, and an
      optical spot size of 2.0 mm was used. The laser was coupled
      to an OPMI I operating microscope and controlled by joystick
      micromanipulator. The average power required varied from 2 to
      6 watts for lesions measuring 0.2 to 0.8 mm in diameter.
      Meatotomy was required in 10 patients for adequate
      exposure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis xerotica obliterans and
      erythroplasia of Queyrat were managed with an average pewer
      of 3 watts, continuous wave mode, using the
      vertical-horizontal-oblique technique.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        Follow-Up and Results<br />
        <br />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">All patients were followed at three-month
      intervals for at least six months, and advised to return if
      any occurrence was noted. Average follow-up ranged from two
      to thirty months. Of the 40 new cases of condyomatous
      lesions, 36 (90%) responded to a single laser treatment, the
      overall response (62 patients) being 88 per cent (7
      recurrences). Most of the patients complained of mild to
      moderate initial dysuria during the first twenty-four to
      forty-eight hours, and were treated with oral administration
      of Urised. Postoperative urethral meatal calibration failed
      to reveal any stricture formation in patients with distal
      urethral and meatal lesions.</p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis xerotica obliterans recurred
      twenty-four months after the original laser application in
      the first patient we treated and repeat therapy resulted in
      complete eradication and no further recurrence after eight
      months (Fig.1). Two additional patients, twenty-eight and
      thirty-two months, respectively, continue to be free of
      recurrence. Erythroplasia of Queyrat has been followed after
      CO<sub>2</sub> laser vaporization for thirty-six months and
      fourteen months respectively, with no recurrence.</p>

      <center>
        <p>Comment</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Condyloma acuminatum has been considered by
      many to be a disease of minor importance, even though it may
      be a premalignant lesion and could assume major proportions.
      Successful treatment requires accurate determination of the
      location and extent of involvement. In 1944, Culp and
      Kaplan<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> described the use of
      podophyllin in 200 cases; 81.5 per cent were cured with a
      single application, and the recurrence rate was 4.5 percent.
      In 1975, Dretler and Klein<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      introduced the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Efludex 5%) in
      patients with intraurethral lesions, reporting total
      eradication in 19 of 20 patients. Although the efficacy of
      this modality is well appreciated, our personal experience
      has been disappointing since patients tend to complain of
      severe pain and irritation in the perimeatal and distal
      urethral region which prompts discontinuation of treatment.
      In 1982 we reported on the guidelines for the treatment of
      condyloma acuminata<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> with
      CO<sub>2</sub> lase with successful eradication with one
      single treatment in 96.6 per cent of 22 cases treated. None
      of the patients had meatal adherence or spraying of the
      urinary stream, although initial dysuria was always present
      during the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours following
      treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Because of the potential malignant behavior
      of erythroplasia of Queyrat treatment modalities have
      included electro-desiccation,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      fulguration,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      cryotherapy,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      irradiation,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> which carry high
      failure rates, fulguration and surgical resection being
      mutilating procedures.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1975, Dretler et al.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> reported on the use of topical 5-FU
      recommending a twice daily application, preferably under
      foreskin or condom occlusion for a period of four to five
      weeks. Marked erythema, edema, burning, and stinging required
      temporary discontinuance of therapy. The reported success
      rate with this approach is 100 per cent (13 cases).</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1980, Rosemberg et al.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> reported on the first case of
      erythroplasia of Queyrat successfully treated with
      CO<sub>2</sub> rapid superpulse laser, with complete
      disappearance and excellent functional and cosmetic results.
      Patient discomfort was minimal. Our second case reported in
      this article (Fig. 2) had the same postoperative results as
      reported in 1980, making the CO<sub>2</sub> laser, in our
      opinion, superior to 5-FU topical application, since only one
      outpatient treatment is required which can be performed with
      local anesthetic infiltration.</p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis xerotica obliterans is a chronic
      progressive sclerosing disease of the male genital tract for
      which a multitude of different treatments are advocated,
      depending on its anatomic location. All of these modalities
      include circumcision,<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> meatal
      dilatation and meatomy,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>
      intralesional steroid injection,<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> etc., and generally offer palliation
      rather than permanent cure. The ability to predict and
      control the depth of surgical injury, by variation of the
      power and time characteristics (watts X time = joules =
      energy) enables the CO<sub>2</sub> laser to completely
      vaporize these sclerosing lesions, with exceptional cosmetic
      results. So far, the very first patient has remained
      symptom-free for twenty-four months before recurrence was
      noted. Re-treatment has resulted in complete eradication and
      symptom-free status after eight months. Our second and third
      cases continue to be symptom-free thirty-two and twenty-eight
      months respectively (Fig. 3). Again, outpatient single
      treatment, local anesthetic infiltration, minimal
      postoperative discomfort, and exceptional postoperative
      appearance all combine to offer a superion alternative to the
      well-known treatment modalities.</p>

      <p class="text2">The guidelines for the treatment of
      condylomata acuminata with CO<sub>2</sub> laser have been
      previously described. Nevertheless, two important steps
      deserve to be re-emphasized: (1) selection of an adequate
      power, and (2) surgical technique.</p>

      <p class="text2">It has been previously stated that laser
      vaporization of any particular lesion should always be
      accomplished by selection of the lowest possible average
      power, and that adjustments be made accordingly during the
      surgical procedure. One of the most commonly noted errors
      amongst physicians newly trained in laser surgery is the use
      of excessive wattage which in turn results in deep burns with
      subsequent increase in postoperative patient discomfort.</p>

      <p class="text2">It must be remembered that the total mass
      ablated by a laser beam which strikes a target tissue in one
      fixed place is directly proportional to the total power of
      the beam, and to the time of application, and that the same
      factors apply to mass ablation of a moving laser beam, but
      vaporization will be somewhat less if total beam power and
      time of application are the same as for the stationery beam.
      Thus, the newly trained laser surgeon should always select
      the lowest possible power output for any particular lesion
      amenable to laser vaporization.</p>

      <p class="text2">Lasers, like any medical device, must be
      used with skill and common sense. When confronted with
      multiple external condylomatous lesions, the perimeter should
      be established in order to be able to encompass all the
      abnormal areas within a specific square surface. Do not
      vaporize condylomatous lesions whose total boundaries have
      not been identified. All the recurrences in this series have
      been outside the field of laser irradiation, suggesting that
      the new outbreaks were in fact at an incubating stage, not
      clinically apparent, or very small lesions missed during the
      vaporization process.</p>

      <p class="text2">Once the boundaries for the surface area to
      be treated have been established, the
      vertical-horizontal-oblique technique will assure an even,
      smooth removal of all lesions from surface to base. By
      operating the laser in this fashion, the heat conducted to
      the underlying tissue; distributed evenly along the surface
      of the lesion, resulting in minimal coagulation necrosis, the
      end result being a fine cosmetic result. Thus in our
      experience, CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy appears to be a safe
      adjunct, and offers an alternative treatment modality for
      those recurring lesions frustrating patients and their
      urologists.</p>
