        <font size="2"><i>Abstract.</i> Balanitis xerotica
        obliterans (BXO) and kraurosis penis are thought to be
        synonymous. Clinically and histopathologically they
        probably represent the same disease process as lichen
        sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) but also involve the urethral
        mucosa. The treatment of choice is considered to be 2 1/2%
        testosterone propionate ointment which gives better results
        than strong corticosteroid applications, yet without their
        side effects.</font>

      <p class="text1">St&uuml;hmer (<a href="#n15">15</a>)
      introduced the term balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) to
      describe an atrophic and sclerotic condition of the glans
      penis leading to stenosis and occasionally obliteration of
      the external meatal orifice. He considered that the disease
      invariably resulted from circumcision or dorsal slit for
      phimosis but many cases have since been described unconnected
      with preputial surgery. They have usually had an insidious
      onset, associated with a long prepuce and constricted
      preputial openining (<a href="#n6">6</a>) BXO is a rare
      disease, occurring in men between 20 and 45 years of age. It
      affects the glans penis, external meatus, sulcus, and
      occasionally the penile shaft. Diagnostic difficulty arises
      when the eruption is of restricted distribution. There is a
      mottled or parchment-like appearance with white or ivory
      areas scattered throughout apparently normal tissue. There
      may be a stricture of the external meatus and sclerotic
      changes obliterating the frenum. Early lesions (especially
      with a long prepuce) consist of multiple moist red areas on
      the glans with possibly linear erosions on the mucosal
      surface of the prepuce. Serious or haemorrhagic bullae, which
      may rupture to form erosions may occur around the urinary
      meatus. Adhesions between the glans and prepuce may occur.
      Pigmentation and telangiectasia may develop, giving an
      appearance resembling radiodermatitis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA)(<a
      href="#n5">5</a>) is clinically similar, but lesions occur on
      other areas such as the back, neck, shoulders, forearms, or
      axillae (<a href="#n7">7,9</a>). Lesions of the vulva are
      often called kraurosis vulvae.</p>

      <p class="text2">Histopathologically, LSA shows
      hyperkeratosis with keratotic plugging of follicles, atrophy
      of the stratum malpighii with hydropic degeneration of the
      basal cells, atrophy and homogenization of the upper dermal
      collagen and an infiltrate in he mid-dermis (<a
      href="#n7">7</a>). Apart from the natural absence of hair
      follicles on the penis, BXO shows a similar picture.</p>

      <p class="text2">St&uuml;hmer (<a href="#n15">15</a>)
      reported malignant change in BXO, since confirmed several
      times. Many clinicians consider that malignant change is
      unlikely in LSA, but Fitzpatrick (<a href="#n4">4</a>) put
      the incidence at 3% and Newbold (<a href="#n11">11</a>) at
      15-50% in BXO/LSA. This high figure may be due to the
      inclusion of many mucosal cases in which malignant change is
      believed to be more likely.</p>

      <p class="text2">Treatment recommended has included meatal
      dilatation (<a href="#n2">2, 13</a>), fluorinated
      corticosteroid ointments (<a href="#n12">12</a>), male sex
      hormones topically or by injection (<a href="#n1">1</a>),
      cold saline compress followed by topical corticosteroids (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>) and intralesional hydrocortisone acetate
      (<a href="#n16">16</a>). Powerful corticosteroids locally may
      cause atrophy and telangiectasia (<a href="#n2">2, 10,
      14</a>). Atrophy in LSA may lead to malignancy (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>) and this seems a good reason for an
      alternative to corticosteroids topically.</p>

      <p class="text2">Initial experience in using testosterone
      propionate in the treatment of BXO was obtained in
      cooperation with the late T. E. Anderson and A. McPhater
      during the Second World War when about 15 cases were treated.
      The introduction of corti-costeroids temporarily superceded
      this treatment but the initial rapid improvement obtained
      tended to be followed by deterioration. More seriously in one
      case meatal obliteration and ulceration due to squamous
      carcinoma developed.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the present series, 4 patients were
      treated with 2.5% testosterone propionate in a water-miscible
      base, (Neo-Hombreol-Organon) (<a href="#n8">8</a>). Biopsy
      was refused in each case. The diagnosis BXO is used whenever
      there is urethral involvement; otherwise, the term LSA is
      used.</p>

      <center>
        CASE REPORTS
      </center>

      <p><font size="2">Case 1. A 19-year-old waiter reported in
      1971 with increasingly severe attacks of urinary retention.
      There was typical BXO of the glans penis, sulcus and external
      meatus (Fig. 1) with mild urethritis. Dorsal slit had been
      performed at age 12 following circumcision for congenital
      phimosis. No response to previous local therapy. No response
      to previous local therapy.</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><font size="2">Testosterone ointment was
      applied twice daily. The skin improved markedly within 3
      months, the urethritis cleared and micturition became normal.
      Postal follow-up for 2 years indicated that he had remained
      symptom freem.</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><font size="2">Case 2. A 64-year-old,
      married chartered accountant was referred in 1971 because of
      suspected penile cancer of 9 months duration. There were
      typical (but itching) atrophic, white telangiectatic patches
      of LSA on the glans and sulcus but no meatal
      involvement.</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><font size="2">Testosterone propionate
      ointment was applied twice daily. For the first four weeks
      only, hydrocortisone was also used locally to alleviate the
      itch. There was noticeable improvement after 3 months and
      skin lesions had disappeared after 2 years.</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><font size="2">Case 3. A 23-year-old student
      of architecture was seen in 1972 because of painful erections
      and a rash of about 5 months duration on the glans penis. He
      was uncircumcised. There was two atrophic, whitish
      telangiectatic patches of LSA on the glans penis only. After
      a short period on hydrocortisone ointment to relieve
      irritation, testosterone ointment therapy was started. He
      then developed a recurrent non-specific urethritis requiring
      repeated courses of oral tetracycline. The painful erections
      lessened but the skin lesions were unchanged. He later
      developed diabetes mellitus, which was controlled by diet and
      chlorpropamide (Diabenese; Pfizer). The LSA improved rapidly
      although assessment was difficult because of his obsession
      with his penile lesions. Direct correlation between the LSA
      and his diabetes was doubtful.</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><font size="2">Case 4. A 31-year-old married
      waiter came to the clinic in 1972 with acute gonorrhoea. On
      examination he was found to be uncircumcised and to have
      sclerosing condition around the urethral meatus (Fig. 2)
      causing stenosis and which was diagnosed as BXO. The
      condition had been present for 5 or 6 years and required
      occasional catheterization. Treatment with testosterone
      ointment afforded considerable improvement within 4 months
      and after one year the meatus looked normal.</font></p>

      <center>
        <p>DISCUSSION</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Since BXO (synonym, kraurosis penis) and LSA
      are believed to represent the same disease process, the
      question arises as to which diagnosis to use when the
      genitalia are involved. Most of patients seen have had
      widespread involvement of the glans penis, coronal sulcus and
      external urethral meatus (Fig. 1). These should be called
      balanitis xerotical obliterans. The term lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus should be retained for cases of genital
      involvement without urethral involvement. For the opposite
      situation, where the urethra exclusively is involved, it
      would be logical to use the term obliterative urethritis
      (Fig.2). It seems justifiable for the venerologist to retain
      these diagnostic distinctions because of the higher risk of
      malignancy with the genital and especially urethral
      involvement, though this may seem academic to the
      dermatologist.</p>

      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p class="text2">The absence of biopsies in this series,
      whilst regrettable, was not diagnostically crucial.
      Nevertheless if ulceration was present, biopsy would be
      imperative to exclude malignant change. The response of
      BXO/LSA to testosterone propionate has ranged from good, to
      complete resolution. These results are better than could have
      been expected with other treatments. The urethra was dilated
      when necessary and hydrocortisone ointment was used in the
      early stages for rapid relief of irritation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since malignancy may supervene in BXO in
      relation to the degree of atrophy present, there is a
      theoretical advantage in avoiding strong topical
      corticosteroids, as they tend to produce atrophy. The
      excellent response to testosterone propionate ointment
      suggests that its use may reduce the tendency for malignancy
      to develop. Testosterone propionate ointment appears to be
      the treatment of choice.</p>
