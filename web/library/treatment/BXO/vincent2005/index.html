            <p><b><span class="vincent">Abstract</span></b><br />
             <b><span class="vincent">Objective:</span></b> The aim
            of this study was to assess the effectiveness of using
            topical steroid-based creams in the management of
            clinically diagnosed balanitis xerotica obliterans
            (BXO) in boys.<br />
             <b><span class="vincent">Methods:</span></b> The
            response in 56 boys to locally applied steroid-based
            creams was studied retrospectively. All had been
            referred by their general practitioners with symptoms
            of penile pathology and then subsequently had a
            clinical diagnosis of BXO made. The boys were initially
            assessed after 3 months of treatment and then at
            various intervals depending on their response.<br />
             <b><span class="vincent">Results:</span></b> The mean
            age at presentation of the boys was 8.9 (4 to 15)
            years. After the initial 3-month assessment, 10 (17.9%)
            boys had complete resolution. When the treatment period
            was prolonged by an average of 14 months, the total
            number of boys showing resolution increased to 17
            (30.4%). All boys showing resolution had clinically
            mild BXO limited to the prepuce only. Those patients
            with established scar formation on the foreskin showed
            no significant improvement.<br />
             <b><span class="vincent">Conclusions:</span></b>
            Topical steroids seem to offer a reliable option only
            in the management of mild BXO limited to the prepuce in
            boys with minimal scar formation. Steroid-based creams
            can be offered to such patients provided they and their
            families are realistic as to the likelihood of success.
            This treatment is ineffective in the face of
            established scarring.<br />
