      <h2>Balanitis xerotica obliterans in children.</h2>
      <b>Bale PM, Lochhead A, Martin HC, Gollow I</b> 

      <p>Histopathology Department,<br />
       <a href="http://www.chw.edu.au/" target="_blank">Children's
      Hospital</a>,<br />
       Camperdown, NSW,<br />
       Australia.</p>

      <p>Balanitis xerotica obliterans was studied in 48 fully
      developed and 6 early cases in children aged 2-15 years. It
      occurred in 9% of 100 consecutive circumcisions for all,
      including religious, reasons and in 19% of 232 other
      circumcisions for disease of the prepuce and penis. Seven
      cases developed after surgery for hypospadias. The boys
      nearly always presented with inability to retract the
      prepuce; half also had discomfort after micturition, and a
      quarter had obstructive signs, usually minor. At surgery,
      half had involvement of glans or meatus, previously
      considered rare in childhood, 3 requiring meatotomy. The
      condition, once seen, was easily recognized clinically as
      well as microscopically. The early cases, characterized by
      focal narrow hyaline edematous zones in severe diffuse
      chronic balanitis, suggest that the condition may be an
      inflammation in which the usual increased permeability of
      small vessels in inflammatory reaction is accentuated in a
      loose vascular region.</p>
