      <p>We have treated 10 patients (five women and five men) with
      lichen sclerosus (LS), verified by histopathological studies
      from skin biopsies, with CO2 laser vaporization. All men
      studied had LS of the penile skin, of the women, three had
      extragenital lesions and two LS of the perineal skin. The
      mean follow-up time was 32 months (range 3-79 months). One
      man had both penile and urethral LS. All penile lesions of
      the five men were clinically cured by laser treatment:
      however, urethral lesions of one patient recurred despite
      three separate treatments. The two women with perineal LS
      improved after laser treatment. However, LS recurred on the
      treated area in one and on the margins of the treated area in
      another. Two women with LS on the skin of the breast became
      asymptomatic after treatment. One woman had several lesions
      on the skin of the trunk that improved after treatment but
      were not cured completely. The present study suggests that
      carbon dioxide vaporization may be an effective treatment of
      skin lesions in LS.</p>
