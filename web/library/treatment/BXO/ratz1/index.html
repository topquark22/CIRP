      <p>Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic and often
      painful condition of the glans penis. Its histology is
      similar to that of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA), and
      indeed, it probably does represent LSA of the glans. Many
      modalities have been used in the treatment of this condition
      but not always with success.</p>

      <p class="text2">A patient came to our office with a
      histologic diagnosis of BXO that had been unresponsive to
      topical therapy. The involved area was treated with
      CO<sub>2</sub> laser vaporization and has remained free for
      21 months after treatment.</p>

      <p><b>CASE REPORT</b></p>

      <p class="text2">A 39-year-old white man came to the surgical
      unit and laser treatment center of the Department of
      Dermatology of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in
      September, 1981, with a biopsy-proved diagnosis of BXO of at
      least 2 years duration. The patient had experienced pain for
      some time before that and eventually had developed an
      inability to retract his foreskin, necessitating a
      circumcision that was performed in 199.</p>

      <p class="text2">Following this procedure the patient was
      left with a raw, erosive, exquisitely painful glans penis.
      After 2 years of unsuccessful management, primarily with
      topical antibiotics and potent corticosteroids, he was
      referred for other treatment considerations.</p>

      <p class="text2">Physical examination at the time of his
      initial visit revealed a superficial, hemorrhagic erosion of
      most of the surface of the glans penis (Fig. 1). The meatus
      and corona were free of involvement, and the remainder of the
      cutaneous examination was unremarkable.</p>

      <p class="text2">The biopsy specimens were reviewed and
      coincided with the clinical diagnosis of BXO.</p>

      <p class="text2">On September 30, 1981, with the patient
      under regional anesthesia, the involved area was vaporized
      through the handpiece of the articulating CO<sub>2</sub>
      laser, which was operating at 20 W of power output in the
      continous mode. The CO<sub>2</sub> laser spot size was 2 mm,
      and the power density delivered was approximately 600 W/cm2.
      This resulted in a dry, somewhat charred glans penis (Fig. 2)
      The entire affected area was vaporized to margins of
      apparently normal epithelialization. The wound was allowed to
      reepithelialize from these normal margins, with the thought
      that the resulting epithelium would remain uninvolved.</p>

      <p class="text2">Once regional anesthesia was no longer
      effective, the patient experienced a syncopal episode and was
      hospitalized for observation. Application of topical
      lidocaine jelly relieved the symptoms, and the patient return
      to his home the next day. He was instructed to cleanse the
      area twice daily with hydrogen peroxide and to immediately
      apply an antibacterial ointment (Polysporin).</p>

      <p class="text2">Occasional burning pain was still present to
      a minima degree until 3 weeks postoperatively. He has
      remained free of disease since that time, which is 21 months
      postoperatively (fig. 3).</p>

      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Treatment of LSA may depend on its extent,
      location, symptoms, etc. Although not always successful,
      suggested modes of therapy have included topical or
      intralesional corticosteroids,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      oral or topical estrogens,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      topical antibiotics,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> topical or
      intralesional androgens,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      cryosurgery,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> and, when the
      glans penis is involved, excision of the affected
      area.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> When more extensive
      involvement is present, meatotomy has been performed, but may
      believe that this procedure is rarely effective for any
      length of time.<sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup> Urethroplasty
      has been suggested as a possible treatment of choice,<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> and a combination of circumcision,
      meatal dilatation, and meatoplasty has also been
      suggested.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Most observers agree that the condition can
      be, and usually is, progressive and that symptoms can include
      difficulty with micturition, nonretractable foreskin, urinary
      retention, and pain and difficulty during intercourse.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Our patient had not had intercourse
      since before his circumcision, 2 years before his initial
      visit to our unit.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some reports indicate that development of
      leukoplakia can take place in LSA,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> and squamous cell carcinoma has been
      reported to occur in areas of involvement of BXO.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8,9</a></sup> Radiation therapy might be a factor
      in the development of such tumors, however.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8,10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One report of CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment
      is present in the urologic literature,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> but the technique differed slightly
      from ours, and no mention was made of follow-up. The exact
      physics of CO<sub>2</sub> laser vaporization as employed here
      can be found in our earlier paper on treatment of port-wine
      stains.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Although the details
      of the treatment are the same, we are finding with time, that
      the power output for successful vaporization is probably much
      less than in much of our original work. Most CO<sub>2</sub>
      laser vaporization in our unit is now carried out at power
      outputs of between 5 and 10 W.</p>

      <p><b>COMMENTS</b></p>

      <p class="text2">It has been gratifying to us to be able to
      effect curative therapy for our patient after he had had
      several years of unsuccessful treatment. It is important to
      note that this patient never experienced any meatal edema or
      difficulty in micturition postoperatively. This can be
      attributed tto the mode of therapy and has been discussed in
      our earlier papers.<sup><a href="#n12">12-14</a></sup> It is
      also important to note that he was restored to completely
      normal sexual function 3 months postoperatively, this after a
      hiatus of more than 2 years.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although pain is generally not a factor
      following CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery, it was quite
      prominent for a short time in this patient and must always be
      considered as a possible sequela.</p>

      <p class="text2">We believe that CO<sub>2</sub> laser
      vaporization, as presented, represents an attractive
      alternative to conventional therapy for what is often a
      chronic, progressive, and difficult to treat entity. Its use
      may successfully obviate the need for more rigorous surgery
      at a later date and should be considered when other modes of
      therapy have failed.</p>
