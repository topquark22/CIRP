        <p class="juroltext2">Purpose: Balanitis xerotica
        obliterans (BXO) is a chronic dermatitis of unknown
        etiology most often involving the glans and prepuce but
        sometimes extending into the urethra. We report our 10-year
        experience with BXO in pediatric patients.</p>

        <p class="juroltext2">Materials and Methods: Our pathology
        database was queried for all tissue diagnoses of BXO from
        1992 to 2002. Available charts were reviewed and patient
        presentation, clinical and referral history, operative
        procedure(s) and postoperative course were recorded.</p>

        <p class="juroltext2">Results: A total of 41 patients had a
        tissue confirmed diagnosis of BXO. Median patient age was
        10.6 years. Of the patients 85% were 8 to 13 years old and
        all had referrals available for review. The most common
        referral diagnoses were phimosis (52%), balanitis (13%) and
        buried penis (10%). No patient had the diagnosis of BXO at
        referral. Of the patients 19 (46%) underwent curative
        circumcision or redo circumcision and had no recurrence at
        a mean followup of 12.5 months (range 1 to 57). A total of
        11 patients (27%) had BXO involvement of the meatus and
        underwent circumcision combined with meatotomy or
        meatoplasty. Nine patients (22%) required extensive plastic
        operation(s) of the penis, including buccal mucosa grafts
        in 2.</p>

        <p class="juroltext2">Conclusions: The incidence of BXO in
        pediatric patients may be higher than previously reported,
        with the diagnosis rarely made by pediatricians. <span
        class="yellow">Our study demonstrates that older patients,
        those with BXO involvement of the meatus and those with a
        history of surgery for BXO tend to have a more severe and
        morbid clinical course.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a
      chronic dermatitis of unknown etiology that occurs on the
      penile skin. It most often involves the glans and prepuce but
      sometimes extends into the meatus and anterior urethra. It
      was first described in 1928 by Stuhmer in 9 adult patients,
      and at that time was thought to be etiologically related to
      exposure of the glans after circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This inference was later refuted by
      Freeman and Laymon, who noted in 1941 that the disease entity
      described as BXO was a variant of lichen sclerosus et
      atrophicus confined to the male penis.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> The first published report of BXO in a
      child is credited to Catterall and Oates, who in 1962
      described a 7-year-old boy with disease isolated to the
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Since then, there
      have been multiple reports of this entity in children.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4&ndash;7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although circumcision is curative in the
      majority of boys with BXO confined to the prepuce,
      progression of the disease to involve the meatus and anterior
      urethra is not uncommon. Furthermore, previous studies have
      failed to define the optimum treatment strategy for patients
      who have meatal or glanular involvement. We sought to examine
      a cohort of pediatric patients with a pathological diagnosis
      of BXO with regard to referral history, clinical
      presentation, operations performed and postoperative course.
      We also sought to determine which factors, if any, predispose
      children with BXO to a more aggressive disease course.</p>

      <p class="jurolabstract">MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>

      <p class="text2">The pathology database at our institution
      was retrospectively reviewed for all cases with a tissue
      diagnosis of BXO from 1992 to 2002. Patients were excluded if
      they were older than 18 years.</p>

      <p class="text2">Patient charts were reviewed and the
      referral diagnosis, specialty of the referring physician,
      clinical presentation, symptoms, medical history and
      radiographic studies were recorded. Operative notes were
      reviewed to assess the degree of penile involvement with BXO.
      Specific attention was given to glans involvement, meatal
      stenosis, urethral stricture and involvement of the shaft
      skin. The severity of phimosis found at the time of surgery
      (if reported by the surgeon) was graded according to criteria
      defined by Meuli et al, ie grade 1&mdash;full retractability
      of the prepuce and stenotic ring in the shaft, grade
      2&mdash;partial retractability with partial exposure of the
      glans, grade 3&mdash;partial retractability with exposure of
      the meatus only and grade 4&mdash;no retractability.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Postoperative records were reviewed to
      assess recurrence of disease and the need for further
      interventions.</p>

      <p class="text2">Patients were divided into 3 groups based on
      the clinical course of the BXO (table 1). Group 1 (mild
      course) included patients who were cured after undergoing
      circumcision and had no recurrence. Group 2 (moderate course)
      consisted of patients who required 1 major or more than 1
      minor surgical procedure, or required emergent treatment
      (acute urinary retention). Group 3 (severe course) included
      patients who required more than 1 major reconstructive
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare
      age distributions between the 3 groups. The unpaired
      Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used to calculate the 2-sided p
      value comparing meatal stenosis in patients with and without
      involvement of the glans with BXO.</p>

      <p class="jurolabstract">RESULTS</p>

      <p class="text2">A total of 42 patients with pathological
      confirmation of BXO were identified between 1992 and 2002.
      All specimens showed lymphocytic infiltration in the upper
      dermis, hyali- nosis and homogenization of collagen, basal
      cell vacuolation, atrophy of the stratum Malpighii and
      hyperkeratosis. One patient who was 21 years old was
      excluded, leaving a cohort of 41 patients for analysis.
      Average patient age was 10.6 years (range 4 to 17) and 85% of
      patients were 4 to 13 years old. All patients had complete
      medical records available for review.</p>

      <p class="text2">A total of 40 patients were referred to our
      department for evaluation. Two referrals were made by
      urologists, and the remainder were made by pediatricians (35)
      or emergency medicine physicians (3). The most common
      referral diagnoses were phimosis (52%), balanitis (13%) and
      buried penis (10%). None of the referrals by pediatricians or
      emergency medicine physicians identified BXO as the primary
      diagnosis. After evaluation by a pediatric urologist 36
      patients (88%) were correctly diagnosed with BXO
      preoperatively. Of the 5 patients who were not diagnosed by a
      pediatric urologist preoperatively only 1 had the
      characteristic white, sclerotic, distal preputial ring.</p>

      <p class="text2">A total of 19 patients (46%) with an average
      age of 9.5 years were categorized into group 1 (mild disease
      course) and underwent circumcision or redo circumcision. The
      most common presenting symptoms for these children were
      dysuria (42%), ballooning of the foreskin with voiding (32%)
      and splaying or deviation of the urinary stream (26%, table
      2). Of these patients 32% had grade 1 or 2 phimosis at
      surgery and 68% had grade 3 to 4 phimosis. The glans was
      involved by disease in 26% of the patients. One patient had
      meatal stenosis. These patients had no recurrence of BXO
      after circumcision at a mean followup of 9 months (range 1 to
      55).</p>

      <p class="text2">A total of 16 patients (mean age 11 years)
      were categorized into group 2 (moderate disease course).
      Three of these patients (19%) presented in acute urinary
      retention and underwent emergent surgery (circumcision,
      dorsal slit or circumcision with meatoplasty). The 3 most
      common symptoms in this group were dysuria (50%), obstructive
      symptoms or complete obstruction (44%) and ballooning of the
      foreskin with voiding (25%, table 2). Of these patients 12%
      had grade 1 or 2 phimosis at surgery and 88% had grade 3 to 4
      phimosis. The glans was involved in 81% of patients and there
      was meatal stenosis in 56%. Of these patients 37% underwent
      circumcision combined with meatotomy, meatoplasty or distal
      urethral cutback,<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> and 44%
      required reconstructive operations to release a concealed
      penis with concomitant meatoplasty required in 3 (table
      3).<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Six patients (mean age 13 years) were
      categorized into group 3 (severe disease course). Of these
      patients 67% presented with dysuria.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Half of the patients had a completely
      entrapped penis at presentation and 4 had undergone multiple
      surgical procedures before referral. Operative course is
      outlined in table 4. There was a significant difference in
      age at presentation between patients in group 1 and patients
      in group 3 (p &lt;0.05), with patients in group 3 being
      older.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of the 41 patients 23 (56%) had glans
      involvement in the form of keratotic plaque(s) and 15 (37%)
      had meatal stenosis. Of the 15 patients with meatal
      involvement 13 (87%) also had glans involvement. In addition,
      13 (57%) of the 23 patients with glans involvement also had
      meatal stenosis. Patients with glans involvement had
      significantly more meatal stenosis than those without glans
      involvement (p = 0.0036, table 5). Of the 15 patients with
      meatal involvement 1 underwent circumcision alone, and 7
      underwent circumcision and meatoplasty. The remaining 7
      patients underwent concealed penis release, redo circumcision
      and meatoplasty, meatotomy and lysis of penile adhesions,
      circumcision and distal urethral cutback (2), and
      urethroplasty with buccal mucosa (2). Two of the patients who
      underwent circumcision and meatoplasty had recurrence of
      disease and required further surgery.</p>

      <p class="jurolabstract">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text2">BXO is a poorly understood dermatological
      disease involving the prepuce, glans, urethral meatus and
      sometimes the anterior urethra. Once thought to be a rare
      entity in children, it is now apparent that its incidence is
      more common than previously realized. We examined a cohort of
      patients seen at our department during a 10-year period with
      histologically confirmed BXO, with specific interest in
      referral patterns, referral diagnoses and clinical
      outcomes.</p>

      <p class="text2">The onset of BXO is usually without
      symptoms. Initial symptoms might be mild, such as dysuria or
      ballooning of the foreskin. More severe symptoms usually
      indicate disease progression. Rickwood et al reported on 23
      patients referred for phimosis in 1970, of whom 20 were found
      to have BXO.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The 3 most common
      presenting symptoms were poor urinary stream, dysuria and
      preputial pain. Bale et al identified 54 patients with BXO in
      a circumcision series.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> The
      most common presenting symptom was inability to retract the
      foreskin. Discomfort with voiding occurred in 27 patients and
      obstructive symptoms were noted in 23. Two patients were
      hospitalized with acute retention and 2 had hematuria.</p>

      <p class="text2">We examined the presenting symptoms of
      patients and also aimed to determine whether patients with
      more complicated clinical courses (groups 2 and 3) had
      different or higher incidences of certain symptoms than those
      with milder courses (group 1). The most common symptom for
      all groups was dysuria (49% of all boys) but a greater
      proportion of patients in groups 2 (50%) and 3 (66%) had
      dysuria than in group 1 (41%). There were also higher
      percentages of patients in groups 2 and 3 with obstructive
      symptoms, including complete obstruction requiring emergent
      surgery in 3 (table 2). Complete urinary obstruction in
      adults and children with BXO has been described previously,
      and obstructive symptoms are not unusual.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a>, <a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Catterall and
      Oates reported symptoms of urinary obstruction in 8 of 41
      patients (20%).<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Bainbridge et
      al reported symptoms of urinary obstruction in 47% of their
      patients.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> A greater
      percentage of patients in our groups 2 and 3 had deflection
      or changes in the urinary stream (including incontinence)
      than in group 1, perhaps implying worsening phimosis and
      meatal or urethral involvement.</p>

      <p class="text2">We believe that recognition and early
      referral for treatment of BXO while the lesion is small and
      local are important due to the extensive tissue involvement
      that may ensue if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. A
      review of the available literature revealed an alarming
      incidence of missed diagnoses of BXO by pediatricians and
      general practitioners. Schinella and Miranda found 15 cases
      of BXO in children 13 years or younger.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> In none of these patients was a
      preoperative clinical diagnosis of BXO made. Huntley et al
      prospectively examined a group of 100 patients referred for
      circumcision by general practitioners.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Six patients were identified as
      having clinical evidence of BXO, which was confirmed
      histologically in 4. In none of these cases was the diagnosis
      made by the referring clinician. Meuli et al prospectively
      followed 100 patients referred for circumcision by family
      practitioners or pediatricians.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      The referring provider diagnosed none of these patients with
      BXO, although 2 presented with urinary retention. In our
      study only 2 patients were correctly diagnosed by the
      referring provider as having BXO, both by urologists.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are unifying clinical characteristics
      of BXO that should make its diagnosis relatively
      straightforward. Perhaps the most important of these is a
      ring-like distal sclerosis of the prepuce with white
      discoloration or plaque formation. McKay et al found this
      white ring in two thirds of cases.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Meuli<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      and Bale<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> et al found this
      sign in 100% of their patients. We noted this sign in 74% of
      patients (14 of 19) in group 1, 88% (14 of 16) in group 2 and
      33% (2 of 6) in group 3. The lower proportion of this finding
      in patients in group 3 is due to the fact that a majority (5
      of 6) had been circumcised previously.</p>

      <p class="text2">Age at presentation and a history of
      circumcision provide further clues to the diagnosis of BXO
      and to the possible significant variable for the diagnosis of
      BXO in 100 children referred for phimosis.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Of children with phimosis secondary to
      BXO 1.8% were younger than 6 years, while 21.6% were older
      than 6 years. In this same series 90% of boys with BXO had
      development of &ldquo;secondary phimosis&rdquo; or the
      inability to retract a once retractile foreskin during a
      period of several months. In contrast only 11% of boys
      without BXO had development of secondary phimosis. The
      authors concluded that secondary phimosis with onset at
      school age is highly suggestive of BXO.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> In our study children with a more
      severe clinical course (group 3, mean age 13 years) were
      significantly older than those with a milder course (group 1,
      mean age 9.5 years, p &lt;0.05). Whether this finding
      represents more aggressive disease in older children or a
      longer delay in diagnosis and institution of appropriate
      treatment is not clear.</p>

      <p class="text2">It has not been established previously
      whether glans and/or meatal involvement with BXO is of
      clinical relevance. Given that the disease is locally
      progressive, it is possible that glans involvement leads to
      meatal involvement, which may eventually lead to urethral
      involvement. To our knowledge a relationship between glans
      involvement, meatal involvement and urethral involvement has
      not been demonstrated in the literature.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are various anecdotal reports of glans
      and/or meatal involvement by BXO but the clinical relevance
      of these, if any, has yet to be established. Schinella and
      Miranda reported that 7 of 22 cases (32%) in their series had
      clinical evidence of glans involvement and 4 of 22 (18%) had
      meatal involvement.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> They
      speculated that all of the patients with meatal involvement
      plus 3 others who had severe adhesions of the prepuce to the
      glans had BXO involvement of the glans. However, they
      provided no concrete evidence for this conclusion.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our study 13 of 15 boys (87%) with meatal
      stenosis also had glanular disease (table 5). Meatal stenosis
      was significantly higher in patients with glanular
      involvement (p 0.05). Given the locally progressive nature of
      this disease, this finding may be expected. Two of these boys
      had disease progression after meatoplasty and required
      additional surgery. Frank et al reported that 10 of 12 boys
      with meatal and submeatal stenosis had undergone previous
      circumcision for BXO.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Our
      data, combined with the observation by Bale<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> and Frank<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> et al, suggest that children with
      BXO and meatal stenosis tend to have a more severe clinical
      course than those with preputial involvement alone. Thus,
      these patients require more frequent followup, and families
      should be instructed about the possible signs and symptoms of
      disease progression or recurrence.</p>

      <p class="text2">Depasquale et al have proposed an
      interesting hypothesis.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> In a
      series of 300 adult and pediatric patients with BXO they
      noted that circumcision alone was curative in 96%. They
      advocated that the main purpose of the circumcision was to
      desiccate the glans, stating, &ldquo;BXO has a predilection
      for the warm, moist, urine exposed environment that exists
      under the foreskin.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      They noted several recurrences in conservative circumcisions
      after thorough removal of the diseased skin, and in obese
      patients in whom the shaft skin rolled up to form a
      &ldquo;pseudo foreskin&rdquo; as the penis invaginated into
      the pubic fat pad. Interestingly, we noted that 4 of 6
      patients (67%) in group 3 were obese and had prominent pubic
      fat. Although in this study this observation was purely
      subjective, there may be some association between obesity and
      a more severe clinical outcome. A more likely explanation for
      the apparent more severe course in obese children might be
      that because of the invagination of the penis into the pubic
      fat pad, the penis is not easily visible to the parent or
      primary provider, and, thus, the diagnosis is delayed.</p>

      <p class="jurolabstract">CONCLUSIONS</p>

      <p class="text2">BXO encompasses a spectrum of clinical
      disease, and rapid progression of BXO is not unusual. The
      unpredictable nature of the disease warrants prompt diagnosis
      and referral to an appropriate specialist. Failure to do so
      may lead to extensive damage of the glans, meatus and
      urethra, necessitating significant reconstructive surgery.
      Primary care providers fail to differentiate the pathological
      presentation of BXO from benign phimosis in the majority of
      cases. Improved education of these clinicians regarding BXO
      and its clinical appearance is clearly warranted to prevent
      referral delays.</p>

      <p class="text2">BXO should be suspected in any child with
      phimosis (particularly of a progressive nature) and a white
      sclerotic ring in the distal prepuce. Our study shows that
      older patients, those with BXO involvement of the meatus and
      those with a history of surgery for BXO tend to have a more
      severe and morbid clinical course. Therefore, these patients
      require more frequent followup.</p>
