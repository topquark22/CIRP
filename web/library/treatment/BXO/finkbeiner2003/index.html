      <p class="title">Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans:<br />
       A Form of Lichen Sclerosus</p>

      <p align="right"><i><b>Alex E. Finkbeiner, MD</b></i></p>

      <p class="text1">Lichen sclerosus is a chronic dermatosis
      characterized by atrophic white papules or plaques of skin
      and mucosa. This dermatosis can affect any part of the body;
      it occurs most commonly on the anogenital skin of
      postmenopausal women, though it is seen in all age groups and
      both sexes. It is rare in males, with the glans and prepuce
      often the only sites involved. Lichen sclerosus is also known
      as vulvar dystrophy, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus,
      kraurosis vulvae, hypoplastic dystrophy, and balanitis
      xerotica obliterans, depending on its anatomic location.</p>

      <p class="text2">The etiology of lichen sclerosus is unknown.
      The likely but unproved etiology is an autoimmune mechanism,
      with about 20% of the general population having at least one
      autoimmune disease, and a higher percentage having
      circulating autoantibodies. In Europe and Japan, infection
      with <i>Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi)</i> has been
      linked to lichen sclerosus based upon finding spirochetes,
      <i>B. burgdorferi</i> antigens, and <i>B. burgdorferi</i> DNA
      in the lesions; however, such an etiology is not universally
      accepted. Other theories regarding etiology include
      abnormalities in keratin synthesis, defects in androgen
      metabolism, abnormal keratins, decreased collagenase
      activity, and increased elastase activity. Trauma can induce
      lesions and may explain the improvement in the condition in
      boys after circumcision and its frequent appearance after
      surgical removal of the lichen sclerosus. Finally, there is a
      known, but small, hereditary predisposition for the
      disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Lichen sclerosus begins asymptomatically in
      most patients. It can present at any time from childhood to
      old age, and occurs in all races. Both sexes are affected,
      both before and after puberty, with females predominating at
      all ages by a 10:1 ratio.</p>

      <p class="text2">Early lichen sclerosus shows clinically
      nonspecific findings of erythema, with or without
      hypopigmentation. In time, if untreated, typical ivory or
      porcelain white macules and plaques develop. The surface of
      the lesion is usually smooth, but may be hyperkeratotic.
      Lesions may become eroded or ulcerated. Itching may be
      severe, especially in the anogenital area. Extragenital
      lesions are most frequent on the upper back, chest, and
      breasts, and are usually asymptomatic. The tongue and oral
      mucosa may also be involved, either alone or without lesions
      elsewhere. Lichen sclerosus has a predilection for the
      anogenital area, however.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anogenital lesions in females are initially
      pruritic, but as the condition becomes chronic, symptoms due
      to erosion supervene. The initial plaques may become
      sclerotic, bulbous, ulcerated, or hemorrhagic, and the
      epidermis may be thin and shiny, or thick and white. In
      end-stage vulvar lichen sclerosus, there is total loss of
      identifiable structures, and the introitus can be reduced to
      a slit-like opening with fusion of the labia. The perianal
      area is frequently involved, giving rise to constipation.
      Resorption of the labia minora, scarring of the clitoral hood
      burying the clitoris, and obliteration of the urethral meatus
      may occur with longstanding disease. Lichen sclerosus never
      affects the vagina.</p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis xerotica obliterans is the penile
      counterpart of lichen sclerosus (lichen sclerosus et
      atrophia). It may occur in patients of any age. It is most
      common in middle-aged men, but has been reported in boys. In
      one study of prepubertal boys requiring circumcision for
      phimosis, 14% were found to have lichen sclerosus. While it
      may occur in circumcised or uncircumcised individuals, it is
      more frequently associated with chronic balanitis or phimosis
      in uncircumcised males. It most commonly occurs on the glans
      and inner surface of the prepuce; involvement of the shaft of
      the penis is uncommon. Its onset and evolution are usually
      insidious, but may progress over many years. The condition
      originates as small, erythematous areas that coalesce,
      forming white plaques with welldefined margins. The surface
      is usually smooth and shiny, but may be wrinkled. A white
      patch on the prepuce or glans may extend to and around the
      urethral meatus, frenulum, and fossa navicularis. The meatus
      may appear white, indurated, and/or edematous. Glandular
      erosion, ulceration, fissures, and meatal stenosis may occur.
      Lesions may be asymptomatic, or produce varying degrees of
      local pain, discharge, pruritus, painful erections, or
      urinary obstruction. In uncircumcised males, a sclerotic,
      constrictive band may form 1 to 2 cm from the distal end of a
      thickened, contracted, fissured prepuce that cannot be
      retracted.</p>

      <p class="text2">Fully developed lichen sclerosus with
      hypopigmentation and distinctive shiny or crinkled texture
      changes is easily recognized. Extragenital lichen sclerosus
      must be differentiated from guttate morphea and lichen
      planus. Anogenital lichen sclerosus must be distinguished
      from genital lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus,
      Bowen&rsquo;s disease, and Paget&rsquo;s disease. The
      differential diagnosis of a white plaque on the glans or
      distal shaft of the penis includes vitiligo, erythroplasia of
      Queyrat, lichen planus, localized scleroderma, and
      leukoplakia. When doubt of the diagnosis exists, a biopsy is
      indicated.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is no effective, curative medical
      treatment for lichen sclerosus. Treatment with high-potency
      topical glucocorticoids, such as 0.05% clobetasol propionate,
      provides significant resolution of lichen sclerosus. Most
      patients will respond to twice-daily applications of these
      agents, tapered to once or twice weekly. Lichen sclerosus can
      be controlled, but not eradicated, by glucocorticoid therapy;
      it gradually recurs when therapy is discontinued. Oral
      retinoid therapy and treatment with topical tretinoin may be
      useful in both men and women with anogenital lichen
      sclerosus. Antimalarial agents may also be beneficial.
      Topical antibiotics or anti-infectious agents are indicated
      in patients in whom secondary candidal or bacterial
      infections exist. Significant urethral meatal stenosis due to
      balanitis xerotica obliterans is treated with hydrocortisone,
      but urethral dilation and/or meatotomy may be required.
      Circumcision may be curative if the lesions are localized to
      the prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">Lichen sclerosus of the genitalia in both
      men and women carries a small but real risk of developing
      into a local squamous cell carcinoma. Patients should be
      monitored periodically, and focal persistent, hyperkeratotic,
      or ulcerated sites should be biopsied.</p>
