      <h2>Circumcision and Non-Circumcision in Australia</h2>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision was popularized in
      Australia during the early twentieth century just as was done
      in other English-speaking nations. Consequently, a majority
      of adult Australian males, who were born prior to 1980, are
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1967, J.E. Wright published a paper which
      was highly critical of the then current practice of
      non-therapeutic circumcision of infant males.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This was followed in 1970 by I.O.W.
      Leitch, who published a landmark article that showed male
      neonatal circumcision is not necessary and is harmful in some
      ways.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The following year, in 1971, medical
      authorities decided that non-therapeutic male neonatal
      circumcision was not necessary,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      and in 1983, medical authorities decided that non-therapeutic
      male neonatal circumcision should be discouraged.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of circumcision of boys then
      started to decline. Wallerstein,<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> relying on Wirth, provided the
      following table:</p>

        <p>Adapted from Wirth, J.L.: Current circumcision practices
        in Australia. Med. J. Aust., <em>1</em>:179, 1982.</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Wirth reported a further decline in neonatal
      circumcision from 50 percent to 24 percent during the period
      1974-1983.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup><br />
      <br />
       In 1996, the Australasian Association of Paediatric
      Surgeons, said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons does
        not support the routine circumcision of male neonates,
        infants or children in Australia. It is considered to be
        inappropriate and unnecessary as a routine to remove the
        prepuce, based on the current evidence available."<sup><a
        href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of non-therapeutic male
      neonatal circumcision, therefore, has declined sharply over
      the years. Richters <em>et al.</em> carried out a telephone
      survey of Australian males, aged 16 through 59 years of age
      in 2001-2, as part of the Australian Study of Health
      Relationships.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> That survey
      produced the following findings:</p>

      <p class="text2">Richters <em>et al.</em> (2006) report that
      69 percent of Australian-born men in the 2001-2 survey were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Of all the men
      surveyed, 58.7 percent reported being circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> In 2001-2, among Christians 61.39
      percent were circumcised, and among Muslims, 74.31 percent
      were circumcised.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of non-therapeutic neonatal
      circumcision started to decline in 1971 and non-circumcision
      became the norm in Australia about 1980.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5-6</a></sup> This has produced a sharp dichotomy
      between older and younger age groups. The older age group is
      about 65 percent circumcised and the younger group is about
      70 percent non-circumcised.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      (Some older Australian circumcised males may feel some
      anxiety regarding their missing body part and lobby for
      restoration of the practice of medically-unnecessary
      non-therapeutic circumcision.)</p>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of circumcision in Australia
      continued to decline and in 1996 the Australian College of
      Pediatrics estimated that only about 10 percent of newborn
      boys currently were being circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Spilsbury <em>et al.</em> report
      that in Western Australia, the incidence of "routine" [i.e.,
      non-therapeutic] circumcision had declined from 9.8 percent
      in 1994 to 7.8 percent in 1999.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> In Western Australia, boys
      circumcised between the age of six months and 15 years were
      most likely to be aboriginal or Torres Strait
      Islanders.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Post-neonatal allegedly-therapeutic
      circumcision appears to be over-performed in Australia.
      Spilsbury <em>et al.</em> report that the number of such
      circumcisions is seven times the expected rate of
      phimosis.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Hill suggests that
      this is due to outmoded and inaccurate data in textbooks
      regarding development of preputial retractability in children
      and adolescent males that causes improper confusion of
      developmentally non-retractile foreskin with pathological
      phimosis.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The Medicare statistics of the Department of
      Health provide information on the number of claims for male
      circumcision. O'Donnell has studied these claims. In 2004,
      the incidence of male neonatal circumcision in Australia was
      stable at about 12.7 percent, which means that genital
      integrity was preserved for 87.3 percent of boys born in that
      year.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> O'Donnell reports sharp
      divisions by state. Tasmania was the lowest at 3.9 percent,
      while Queenland was the highest at 19.5 percent for the year
      ended February 2004.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> The
      absolute number of claims paid for males less than six months
      of age for the year ended February 2004 was 16,311.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As the incidence of circumcision has gone
      down, infant and child mortality steadily has gone
      down,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> while the life
      expectancy of Australians steadily has increased,<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> according to the Australian
      Institute for Health and Welfare.</p>

      <p class="text2">Australian States operate public hospitals.
      By the end of 2007, most public hospitals had stopped
      providing free non-therapeutic circumcisions, however,
      Medicare still offered a subsidy.</p>

      <p class="text2">It appears that certain medical doctors in
      South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland are
      promoting the circumcision of male children for personal
      financial gain and this is keeping the rate inappropriately
      high in those states. In spite of their efforts, the overall
      incidence of circumcised males in Australia is expected to
      decline gradually as older circumcised males pass away and
      newborn non-circumcised males enter the population and
      Australia continues to march inexorably toward increased
      genital integrity for its males.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Royal Australasian College of Physicians
      estimated in 2010 that 10 to 20 percent of newborn Australian
      boys are still being circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In January 2013, Circumcision Information
      Australia collected data on the incidence of infant
      circumcision in Australia from 2009 through 2012. The data
      show a renewed decline of the popularity of circumcision in
      Australia in Queensland and New South Wales, which produced
      an overall decline in the percentage of Australian boys being
      circumcised. The decline is attributed to a smaller
      percentage of circumcised fathers in the current generation
      of fathers. 9.3 percent of Australian infant boys were
      circumcised in fiscal year 2012.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <h4>2013 Statistics</h4>

      <p>It can safely be said that the infant circumcision rate in
      Australia in 2013 was lower than at any time in the previous
      one hundred years. And this, despite the proportion of all
      male infants subjected to religiously motivated circumcision
      being at an all-time high.</p>

* Number of claims as a percentage of male births
</pre>

      <p>NSW and South Australia are neck and neck for the state
      with the highest rate, but the rate in NSW has been declining
      steadily for a number of years whilst the rate in South
      Australia has been fairly stable, so it is likely that South
      Australia will become the state with the highest rate in
      2014.<br />
      <br />
       The proportion of the Australian population that is
      foreign-born is higher than that of any other industrialised
      nation. The immigration in recent years of large numbers of
      people from countries where circumcision is a religious or
      cultural norm has given rise to speculation that births to
      parents of immigrants are making the infant circumcision rate
      (defined for this purpose as the number of Medicare claims in
      respect of boys aged less than 6 months divided by the number
      of male births) higher than it would be without immigration
      and, by corollary, that the infant circumcision rate among
      boys born to Australian-born parents might be lower than the
      overall infant circumcision rate shown in the table
      above.<br />
      <br />
      While, naturally, the rate among boys born to parents born in
      countries where circumcision is prevalent is probably higher
      than the overall rate, one must take into account boys born
      to parents born in countries where circumcision is not the
      norm (notably, China and India) to evaluate the overall
      effect of immigration on the infant circumcision rate. Having
      analysed this in considerable depth, my conclusion is that
      the overall effect of births to foreign-born parents is still
      to reduce the infant circumcision rate, as it has undoubtedly
      done throughout the last one hundred years (at until
      recently, when the effect has become less certain). Much
      depends, of course, upon the assumptions one makes about the
      proportion of male births to Muslim parents, to non-Muslim
      parents from the Middle East and North Africa, and to
      Filipino and Korean parents, that result in a Medicare claim
      for circumcision at less than 6 months of age.</p>
