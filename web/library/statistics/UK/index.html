      <h2>United Kingdom: Incidence of Male Circumcision</h2>

      <p align="justify">The incidence of male circumcision in the
      United Kingdom has varied sharply over the decades of the
      twentieth century. The National Health Service does not offer
      free non-therapeutic circumcision, so non-therapeutic
      circumcision of the newborn is almost unknown. When
      non-therapeutic circumcision of the newborn does occur, it is
      most likely to be in furtherance of the religious views of
      the parents.</p>

      <p align="justify">There are sharp variations by age group in
      the percentage of males who are circumcised. Younger males
      are less likely to be circumcised.</p>

      <p align="justify"><a target="_blank"
      href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7264/792">Rickwood
      <i>et al.</i></a> report that the male circumcision rate was
      about 35 percent in the 1930s.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> The rate had declined to about
      1/5 of boys being circumcised in the 1940s, or about 90,000
      annually.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font>
      <a href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> reported a
      sharp division by social class with the upper classes being
      circumcised much more frequently.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> The National Health Service
      (NHS) started operations in 1948 and did not provide
      non-therapeutic neonatal circumcisions. Following the
      publication of Gairdner's influential report on the lack of
      necessity of neonatal circumcision in 1949<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font>, the incidence
      of male non-therapeutic (routine) circumcision declined
      sharply. The BMJ reported that the incidence of
      non-therapeutic circumcision was 6 percent in 1975.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> Rickwood
      reported in 1989 that about 30,000 circumcisions a year were
      carried out in England and 70 percent were on boys under 15
      years of age.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> <a
      href="/library/general/gordon/">Gordon and Collin</a>
      suggested in 1993 that 5.6 percent of boys in England would
      be circumcised by age 17.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">Johnson <i>et al</i>. surveyed 7990
      British men (1990) and found that 21.9 percent of all men in
      the survey were circumcised.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> There was a sharp division by
      age group. The oldest are the most likely to be circumcised
      while the youngest group is the least likely to be
      circumcised.</p>

      <p align="justify">At the present time (2000) non-therapeutic
      (routine) neonatal circumcisions are rare in England. A few
      are performed for religious reasons. They are not covered by
      the NHS. Post-neonatal circumcisions are performed usually
      due to mis-diagnosis of phimosis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> Rickwood reports that the
      incidence of post-neonatal circumcisions has declined sharply
      in the late 1990s. About 12,200 circumcisions were performed
      in Britain in a recent year (1998?).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> This would suggest that 3.8
      percent of British boys born today would be circumcised by
      their 15th birthday, if current trends continue.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> However, in
      the Liverpool and Sefton districts only 1.5 percent of boys
      born today would be circumcised by their 15th birthday, if
      current trends continue.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">The British Medical Association (<a
      href="http://www.bma.org.uk/">BMA</a>) take the ethical
      position that doctors have a right to conscientiously object
      to the performance of non-therapeutic male circumcisions of
      children on moral, ethical, or legal grounds.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> The BMA
      consider male circumcision to be an invasive, radical
      procedure, and state that unless conservative treatments are
      tried first, a therapeutic circumcision would be
      unethical.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> The BMA and the British
      Association of Paediatric Surgeons (<a
      href="http://www.baps.org.uk/">BAPS</a>) insist that the
      written consent of <i>both</i> parents should be obtained for
      non-therapeutic circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6,8,9</a></sup></font> This ethical guidance may
      act to reduce the incidence of circumcision of male
      children.</p>

      <p align="justify">The 2000 British National Survey of Sexual
      Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal 2000) found that 15.8
      percent of British males aged 16 to 44 reported being
      circumcised. The incidence of circumcision was highest in the
      men aged 40-44 at 19.6 percent [born 1956-60] and lowest in
      the group aged 16-19 [born 1981-84] at 11.7 percent.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> Men of
      ethnic minorities (except black Caribbeans) were signficantly
      more likely to circumcised than those described as
      "white".<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> Jews were 98.7 percent
      circumcised and Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddists were only 9.8
      percent circumcised.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> The most recent survey,
      therefore, appears to show a continuing decline in the
      incidence of circumcised males in Britain when compared with
      previous data.</p>

      <p align="justify">Cathcart and colleagues examined trends in
      paediatric circumcision from 1993 through 2003.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></font> They found
      that the incidence of post-neonatal therapeutic circumcision
      declined by about 20 percent through 2000 but leveled off and
      remained constant after the year 2000. 10,031 circumcisions
      were performed on boys younger than 15 years-of-age in
      2003.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Cathcart <i>et al.</i>
      report that, if present trends continue, 3.1 percent of
      British boys will be circumcised by age 15.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Circumcision is the traditional (but
      outmoded) treatment for non-retractile foreskin. The authors
      report that the incidence of allegedly therapeutic
      circumcision is six times the expected rate of
      phimosis,<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> so large numbers of
      boys are receiving circumcisions, which are medically
      unnecessary. This suggests that better training of physicians
      urgently is needed to enable them to distinguish in boys
      between normal developmentaly non-retractile foreskin, not
      requiring treatment and pathological phimosis, requiring
      treatment.</p>
