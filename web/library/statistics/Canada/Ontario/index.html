    <h3>Infant circumcision in Ontario, 1994-95</h3>

    <p>Despite repeated recommendations by the Canadian Paediatric
    Society (most recently in <a
    href="/library/statements/cps1996/">1996</a>) that neonatal
    circumcision not be performed, and despite the fact that the
    procedure is no longer covered by the Ontario Health Insurance
    Plan, Ontario still has one of the highest rates in Canada. In
    1994-95, Essex County had the highest rate of circumcisions
    (performed in hospitals on male children under the age of 28
    days) among the 33 health districts in Ontario. Some of the
    rates include:</p>
