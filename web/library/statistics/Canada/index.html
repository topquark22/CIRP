      <h2>Canada Circumcision Statistics</h2>

      <p>The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS)'s <a
      href="/library/statements/cps1975/">neonatal circumcision
      policy since 1975</a> has been that there is no medical
      indication for male neonatal circumcision. Wirtz compiled
      such circumcision data as he could for the fiscal years of
      1971 through 1979. Although the incidence was quite high at
      the beginning (Alberta reported an incidence of 67.5 percent
      for fiscal year 1971), Wirtz found a generally declining
      incidence of neonatal circumcision in Canada.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The incidence of male non-therapeutic
      neonatal circumcision continued to decline and some provinces
      started to remove non-therapeutic circumcision from the
      benefit schedule of their health insurance plans in the
      1980s.</p>

      <p>The CPS issued a new statement in 1996, <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"><i>
      Neonatal Circumcision Revisited</i></a>, which strengthened
      its stand against neonatal circumcision by recommending that
      "circumcision of newborns should <i>not</i> be routinely
      performed." The death of an infant from post-circumcision
      hemorrhage has contributed to a growing national consensus
      for genital integrity.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> All
      provincial health insurance plans have now removed
      non-therapeutic male neonatal circumcision from the schedule
      of covered procedures due to the lack of health benefit. At
      least one major hospital has permanently suspended the
      performance of non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> These factors, and possibly a wider
      movement to holistic health, have led to a decline in the
      rate of neonatal circumcision in Canada.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>While the incidence of neonatal male circumcision varies
      sharply by region in Canada, the overall incidence of
      neonatal male circumcision is decreasing throughout Canada.
      Prince Edward Island (PEI) reported the highest incidence,
      but Newfoundland/Labrador reported no circumcisions in 2003.
      Quebec and the Atlantic provinces traditionally have had a
      low incidence of male neonatal circumcision (except for
      PEI).<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>Statistics on the incidence of male neonatal circumcision
      in Canada formerly were derived from the number of insurance
      benefits paid by the provincial health insurance plans. That
      source of information is no longer available because a
      benefit no longer is paid for male non-therapeutic neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons in a
      <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/sask2002/">memorandum</a>
      to doctors in Saskatchewan strongly discourages the
      circumcision of male children.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.cihi.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
      Institute for Health Information</a>, which in 1994 took over
      the national Hospital Database from Statistics Canada,
      reports that in fiscal 1996/97, circumcision was performed as
      a primary procedure on about 20 percent of Canadian male
      neonates, however by 2005, this had declined to 9.2 percent,
      which brings the genital integrity rate up to 90.8
      percent.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
      target="_blank"><b>Association for Genital Integrity</b></a>
      maintains the best available statistical data on the
      increasing incidence of male genital integrity in Canada. See
      <a href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/refs/yr99p-e.html"
      target="_blank">provincial statistics</a> for province by
      province information through 2003.</p>
