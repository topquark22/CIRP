      <h3>Incidence of Circumcision in British Columbia</h3>

      <p>The male neonatal circumcision rate in British Columbia
      peaked in the 1970s, when it reached nearly 60%. The rate has
      declined steadily since then.</p>

      <p>Routine neonatal circumcision was removed from the insured
      services list on April 1, 1984. As of that date, it was no
      longer covered by the government health plan.</p>

      <p>In recent years, the number of circumcisions performed in
      hospitals(1) has been as follows:</p>
<pre>
                                                  
            
             Male      Routine Infant                  Other
 Year        Births    Circumcisions(2)    Rate(%)     Circumcisions(3) 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1992-93     23,000          4,606         20.0         1,670
 1993-94(4)
 1994-95(4)
 1995-96     24,000          2,329          9.7         1,731
 1996-97     24,600          1,467          6.0         1,800(5)

        1995-96, 43 were performed on newborns, 1,023 were
        performed on children, and 665 were performed on
        adults.</font></li>

      <h4>Recent Developments (2004)</h4>

      <p>Newspaper reports indicate that in-hospital circumcisions
      have reached a new low. BC Children's Hospital reported that
      only 4.9 percent of the boys born in 2002-3 were
      circumcised.<sup>1</sup> Victoria General Hospital reports
      that only 1 percent of boys are being circumcised in that
      hospital.<sup>2</sup></p>
