        The National Center for Health Statistics of DHHS of
the Federal Government compiles statistics on the number of
circumcisions performed in four regions of the US and
in the entire country.

        They are as follows for 1991-1993.

                        1991       1992       1993
Northeast Region        62.3%      67.7%      65.1%
Midwest Region          78.1%      78.1%      74.4%
Southern Region         63.6%      62.7%      61.4%
Western Region          40.5%      37.6%      35.5%

All Regions             61.6%      60.7%      59.5%

     The 1994 statistics are now available.  The NCHS has
changed its data collection methods.  This has resulted in a
statistical bump because the 1994 statistics are NOT
comparable to the previous years' statistics.  There is an
increase in the numerical value reported.  The NHSC
cautioned that this did not mean more circumcisions are
being performed.  It simply reflects a difference in the way
the data are collected.  The reported values produced by the
new data collection system are:

                        1994

Northeast Region       69.6%
Midwest Region         80.1%
Southern Region        64.7%
Western Region         34.2%

All regions            62.7%
