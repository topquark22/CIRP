      <blockquote>
        <p>We report a controlled, blind observational study on the
        effecs of circumcision (circ.) upon newborn behavior using
        a new technique which we have developed for reducing
        Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS) data
        into specific behavior categories: average, subdued and
        hyperactive. Twenty-six normal male infants were randomly
        assigned to an early-48-hour or delayed 3-wk. circ. group.
        Each group received 3 BNBAS examinations (E). E1 at a47
        hrs., E2 at 50 hrs., and E3 at 72 hrs., in which the
        examiner was blind to the circ. status of the patient.
        Circ. was done between E1 and E2 for the early group and
        after E3 for the delayed group. Ten items were extracted
        from the BNBAS scores to form our clinical reduction scale
        - 7 from the behavioral scores, and 3 derived from the
        summary paragraph recorded at the end of the examination. A
        significant difference (p&lt;.0001) in the number if
        infants changing behavior categories between E1 and E2 (3
        hrs. was noted: 12/14 (86%) for the early circ. subjects,
        compared to 2/12 (17%) for the control, delayed circ.
        subjects. One-third (4/12) of early circ. subjects
        persisted in their changed behavior for at least 22 hrs.
        (E3). We have demonstrated: 1) an new technique for
        applying the BNAS to clinical problems, 2) <span
        class="yellow">that nearly 90% of infants show behavior
        changes after circ.</span>, 3) that post-circ. behavior
        changes are varied, about 60% more and 40% less active, and
        4) that investigators of male infant behavior must consider
        effects of circ. for at least 22 hrs.</p>

        <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This abstract was published in
        a collection of abstracts. It is a preliminary report of
        the results of the first controlled study of behavior
        changes associated with circumcision. This study was later
        published as a complete article. See: <a
