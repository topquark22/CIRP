      <p><b>Summary</b></p>

      <p>The effects of circumcision upon mother-infant interaction
      were examined in an observational study of 59 mother-infant
      pairs during hospital feedings using a specifically designed
      mother-infant interaction observation system that examined 43
      discreet behaviours relating to feeding, gaze, facial
      expression, vocalizations and touch. The experimental group
      was circumcised after the second feeding and the control
      group after the fourth feeding.<br />
      Analysis revealed no major differences between the
      experimental and control groups. Yet, different trends
      between the two groups were observed regarding two variables
      shortly after surgery. These differences disappeared by 24 h
      post-operatively. Differences relating to the frequency of
      feeding intervals and infant availability scores. The study
      also revealed a surprising limited repertoire of behavior
      exhibited by both the mother and infant during feeding
      sessions.<br />
      Our data suggest that circumcision has brief and transitory
      effects on mother-infant interactions observed during
      hospital feeding sessions, the only time mothers who are not
      rooming in have to be with their infants.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p>There are limited ways in which it is possible to study
      the effects of pain on healthy infants. Circumcision provides
      one such opportunity. Although approximately one million
      newborn males are routinely circumcised each year, the short
      term consequences of this procedure are poorly
      understood<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup>. In a previous
      study<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> we examined infants
      before and after circumcision using the Brazelton Neonatal
      Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS)<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>, a series of stimuli designed to
      elicit measured response from infants. We found that 4 h
      after circumcision, 90% of the infants reacted to stimuli
      differently than they had pre-operatively. Approximately half
      of the infants became more active, agitated and fussy
      following circumcision, and half more subdued, drowsy or
      sleepy. Within 24 h, however, most had reverted to their
      pre-circumcision responses.</p>

      <p>In the current study, we wished to examine the impact of
      circumcision upon the mother-child interaction as it occurs
      in an naturalistic hospital setting for a clinic population.
      We chose the feeding situation for a variety of reasons. (1)
      For those mothers who do not elect to have their babies room
      with them (rooming-in), it is the only predictable and
      regular time infants have with their mothers. (2) The feeding
      time is an actual situation in which mothers interact with
      their babies; it, therefore, is not a manipulative stressful
      situation like the Brazelton exam. We choose clinic patients
      since circumcisions on private patients are done by private
      obstetricians at a time convenient to their schedules, thus
      rendering controlled observations on these patients
      difficult.</p>

      <p><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>

      <p>59 newborn infants were randomly assigned to either an
      experimental (early circumcision) or control (delayed
      circumcision) group and were observed during four hospital
      feeding sessions using a specifically designed mother-infant
      interaction observation system <sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup>. Each mother-infant dyad was observed
      by one of two observers during the first 15 min of four
      hospital feeding sessions occuring in a 24-h period. Infants
      in the experimental groups (n=27) were circumcised on the 2nd
      day of life, between observations 2 and 3, and those in the
      control group (n=32) on the 3rd day of life after the
      completion of four observations (Table I). This protocol
      allowed us to compare the early circumcision group with a
      similar group without surgical intervention. All clinic
      mothers are discharged before noon on the third day of life,
      making further observation of the delayed groups
      impossible.</p>

      <p>All males whose mothers were clinic patients on the
      Washington University OB-GYN delivery service were considered
      eligible candidates for our study. Mothers and infants were
      screened to meet specific criteria<sup><a
      href="#n4">4,5</a></sup> including vaginal delivery with mild
      or no anesthesia, term gestation, normal physical health, and
      bottle feeding without rooming-in. The mothers were told that
      their infants would be circumcised on either day 2 or 3. In
      an effort to control for maternal behaviors elicited by
      knowledge that their babies had been circumcised, mothers
      were requested not to look at their infants genitals or ask
      nurses whether their babies had been circumcised. Nurses
      reported to us that mothers did not ask about circumcision
      status of their infants. Babies whose mothers consented to
      experimental participation were randomly assigned to either
      the experimental or control group. Circumcisions were
      performed using a Gomco clamp and a circumcision board
      (Olympic Circumstraints, Olympic Medical, Seattle, WA) that
      fixed the arms and legs.</p>

      <p>A sample data sheet is shown in Table II. A time-sampling
      strategy was used to make observations in the mother's
      hospital room. Over an approximate 13-min period forty 5-s
      observations were made. Blocks of 2 consecutive 5-s
      observations were followed by 30 s for recording. Time
      intervals were determined by pre-recorded signals audible
      only to the observer from a cassette recorder. Inter-observer
      reliability was 83% based on the results of observations made
      simultaneously by 2 independent observers periodically
      throughout the study.</p>

      <p>Five behavioral domains were observed and recorded for
      both mothers and infants during each 5-s interval. These
      included feeding, gaze, facial expression, vocalizations and
      touch. 43 distinct codes (23 maternal; 20 infant) defined all
      observed behaviors. These are itemized on the data sheet
      (Table II). In addition, infant states, as defined in the
      NBAS, were recorded for each 5-s observation interval.
      Finally, in addition to the quantitatively scored data, each
      observer added a brief paragraph subjectively describing the
      interaction patterns of the dyad.</p>

      <p>Because our previous study suggested that infant state
      behavior was altered by circumcision we wanted to determine
      whether differences in infant state would be reflected in a
      non-stressful feeding situation as well. To summarize
      differences in infant state, we developed an index of infant
      availability which was based on the assumption that infant in
      a calm alert state (state 4) were more available for social
      interaction than when they were sleeping (states 1,2), drowsy
      (state 3), fussy (state 5), or crying (state 6). The
      availability index, which weights states according to heir
      potential availability, is shown in Table III.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p>Characteristics of the early and delayed circumcision
      groups, including type of maternal anesthesia, race, marital
      status, and infant gestational age were compared using
      Fisher's exact test. Other maternal and infant factors, such
      as gravidity, education, Apgar scores, birth weight and
      length were compared using two-sample t-tests. No significant
      differences were found between the two groups for any factors
      using a significance level of 5%.</p>

      <p>Although the feeding situation is the primary and
      sometimes only time that mothers who are not rooming-in are
      together with their infants in a hospital, we found very
      little indication of any robust dyadic interaction. To get an
      overview of the early behavioral repertoire of mothers and
      infants, we combined data from all subjects in both early and
      delayed circumcision groups across all observations.</p>

      <p>We found that mothers primarily held their infants in a
      cradled position (73%), looked at their infant's faces (83%)
      with a neutral facial expression (89%), and displayed little
      touching (25%) or vocalizing (22%). Overall, mothers
      attempted to feed their infants 62% of the time.
      Concurrently, the infants eyes were typically closed (71%),
      had neutral facial expressions (91%), did little vocalizing
      (8%), clinging (13%), or even feeding (40%).</p>

      <p>To further examine the behavioral repertoire of mothers
      and babies the frequency that each behavior in a domain was
      observed to occur in combination with other domain behaviors
      was calculated. Behavioral combinations occurring less than
      10 times across all observations were omitted. These results
      illustrated again how limited the behavioral repertoire of
      mothers and infants is during a feeding situation as well as
      how infrequently dyadic social interaction occurs. Only 3
      combinations of 2 maternal behaviors (out of 2000
      theoretically possible) account for 49% of all dyadic
      interaction. The combinations occuring with the highest
      frequencies reflected only behaviors regarding feeding and
      gaze; all other combinations occurred with lesser frequencies
      and behaviors in the domains of facial expression,
      vocalization, and touch seldom occurred.</p>

      <p>To summarize, mothers predominantly looked at their
      infants while holding and trying to feed them. Babies either
      fed with their eyes closed or did not feed at all. The
      average number of intervals in which infant feeding occurred
      did increase across time, rising from 59% at observation 1 to
      87% at observation 4. This trend of the total population is
      due, most probably, to both the increased requirements and
      skills of the maturing infant.</p>

      <p>Although an analysis of most maternal and infant behavior
      revealed no significant differences between experimental and
      control groups, results of interest appeared for 2 variables:
      the number of intervals in which feeding occurred (Fig. 1)
      and infant availability (Fig. 2). When the frequency of
      uninterrupted infant feeding was compared for the 2 groups
      for each observation we found that the experimental showed a
      mean change of -0.05 between observation 2 before
      circumcision and observation 3 (after circumcision). During
      this same period the control group showed a mean change of
      2.73, clearly demonstrating the lack of impact of surgical
      intervention (Wilcoxon P&lt;0.05). We found a similar
      leveling off of experimental maternal feeding behavior (X
      change = 0.07 compared to X change = 3.13 for the control
      group mothers) although this difference was significant only
      at the 0.07 level (Wilcoxon).</p>

      <p>We examined whether this difference in feeding behavior
      might be related to differences in the state behavior of the
      infants in the 2 groups. As seen in Figure 2 between the 2nd
      observation (before circumcision) and the 3rd observation
      (after circumcision) than did the control group. Although
      this did not reach significant levels (Wilcoxon P&lt;0.09) it
      does reflect a different trend between the two groups,
      specifically that the circumcised infants displayed less
      state 4 behavior than the control groups.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p>Our previous work demonstrated that infants who are
      circumcised undergo behavioral changes detected after
      circumcision by using the NBAS. In this study, we chose to
      examine behavior in a caregiving clinical environment by
      evaluating the impact of circumcision on mother-infant
      interaction. The feeding session revealed a limited
      repertoire of maternal and newborn interactive behaviors; the
      mother tried to feed her baby who was wrapped in a blanket.
      The fact that observers were in the room may well have
      influenced our results. Mothers may have been inhibited by
      the observer's presence but it could also be suggested that
      mothers might have tried harder to socialize with their
      infants since they were `on display'. Clearly, however the
      behavioral changes were much less dramatic than those
      observed in response to NBAS examinations following
      circumcision.</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p><span class="yellow">We did find, however, that
      immediately following circumcision there were differences in
      the feeding patterns between the two groups. The experimental
      group exhibited fewer intervals of uninterrupted feeding than
      did the control group.</span> Similar patterns, although not
      at highly significant levels, were demonstrated by the
      experimental group mothers. Although the volume of formula
      consumed was not monitored, subjective descriptions support
      the observations that the infants who were circumcised sucked
      on the bottles harder, faster and more concertedly. Their
      comments revealed that certain infants appeared to be
      intensely focused on feeding at observation 3 and seemed to
      `tune out' external distractions. Subsequently we determined
      that over 85% of these particular individuals were in the
      experimental group. This explanation would lend support to
      the different trends found in availability scores between
      observations 2 and 3 for the 2 groups. If infants in the
      experimental group did concentrate more on feeding, they
      would be less available for social interaction.</p>

      <p><font color="navy">[CIRP Note: The babies in this 1982
      study were fed breastmilk substitute (formula) from bottles.
      Today, we know that mother's milk is superior to breastmilk
      substitute and breastfeeding is encouraged. Suckling at the
      breast is more difficult for newborns than taking breastmilk
      substitute from a bottle. When stressed, exhausted, and
      traumatized from a circumcision, newborn babies may be unable
      to manage to suckle at the breast.]</font></p>

      <p>It is certainly possible that there are effects of
      circumcision that can affect mother-infant interaction during
      a non-feeding situation which are not precluded on the basis
      of our data. It is also possible that circumcision might
      affect interaction between infants and their primary
      caregivers, the nurses. If the subjects in the delayed
      circumcision group had been available for more extensive
      observations perhaps further differences between the two
      groups might have emerged. Further investigations are,
      indeed, indicated.</p>

      <p>The study revealed that in a hospital setting with
      restricted opportunity for mother-infant interaction both
      mothers and infants limit their behaviors to feeding-related
      events when they are together. <span class="yellow">A
      stressful, painful event such as circumcision, however, still
      appears to affect the feeding patterns of infants who have
      recently undergone circumcision.</span> Despite differences
      between control and experimental infants shortly after
      surgery, by 24 h post-operatively no significant differences
      were observed between the groups. The behavioral effects of
      circumcision in the present study were immediate but brief.
      This should be comforting information to those who provide
      care for newborns and for their parents.</p>
