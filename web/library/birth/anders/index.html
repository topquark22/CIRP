      <h2>The Effects of Circumcision on<br />
       Sleep-Wake States in Human Neonates</h2>
      Thomas F. Anders, MD and Robert J. Chalemian, MD. 

      <p class="abstract">The effect of circumcision on the
      proportion of subsequent sleep-wake states was assessed in
      eleven, normal full-term neonates. We speculated, as had been
      previously suggested, that the proportion of quiet sleep
      would be increased as a response to this "procedure." Our
      results demonstrate that no quiet sleep state shifts were
      present in the immediate hour after circumcision: instead,
      significant increases in the proportion of wakefulness were
      noted, suggesting that later quiet sleep state shifts, if
      present, may be secondary to changes in wakefulness.</p>

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="body">Although much research effort has been
      expended on the study of rapid eye movements (REM, active)
      and nonrapid eye movement (NREM, quiet) sleep, the functions
      of these two cyclically recurring states remain obscure. One
      avenue of exploration to assess function has been the study
      of relative priorities of one state vis-a-vis the other. In
      adults, following selective deprivation of either REM or
      Stage IV NREM sleep, the deprived state is "recovered."
      Following total sleep deprivation, Stage IV NREM sleep is
      recovered before REM sleep (<a href="#n1">1-3</a>).</p>

      <p class="body">In two separate studies, using both
      observational and polygraphic techniques Emde et al. (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>) reported a significant selective elevation
      of the proportion of quiet sleep, a decreased latency to the
      first quiet sleep period, and increased numbers of quiet
      sleep periods during the 10 hr of sleep following routine
      neonatal circumcision. They concluded that these indications
      of quiet sleep "priority" were not the result of heightened
      levels of exercise and fatigue surrounding the procedure, but
      rather, were the manifestations of a "stress" response to the
      circumcision, similar to the conservation-withdrawal response
      first described by Engle (<a href="#n5">5,6</a>). Their
      suggestion that the inhibited, well regulated physiological
      state of quiet sleep serves as the organismic substrate of
      the behaviorally observed conservation-withdrawal syndrome is
      an interesting speculation.</p>

      <p class="body">In a previous study, Anders and Roffwarg (<a
      href="#n7">7</a>) reported that following either selective
      interruption of REM or NREM sleep, or deprivation of total
      sleep, neonates exhibited a propensity to recover quiet sleep
      rather than active-REM sleep. This indication of a "priority"
      for quiet sleep, supports the results reported by Emde et al.
      (<a href="#n4">4</a>). Baekland et al. (<a href="#n8">8</a>)
      have reported an increase in the proportion of NREM sleep and
      increased numbers of arousals during the night following
      presleep exercise. It is not clear from these two studies,
      however, whether the elicited quiet sleep "priority" is
      related to the "stress" associated with sleep deprived and/or
      exercised, or whether it is secondary to the wakefulness and
      fatigue that results from the experimental manipulations.</p>

      <p class="body">From another perspective, several reports
      have indicated that newborn infants are able to respond
      rapidly to "arousing" situations by means of another
      physiological system, the adrenocortical system. Significant
      increases in plasma cortisol have been reported following
      short 20-min periods of crying (<a href="#n9">9,10</a>).
      Since this response to arousal has been observed to occur
      within 20 minutes, we speculated that a
      conservation-withdrawal or quiet sleep response to a "natural
      stress" might be expected to be as rapid.</p>

      <p class="body">The present study attempts to replicate
      Emde's circumcision study, in a modified way. We looked at
      the effects of circumcision on immediate changes in
      sleep-wake state proportions.</p>

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <p class="body">Two investigators continuously observed
      eleven normal 3-day old, full-term, male infants in the
      nursery for three different noncontiguous 1-hr periods. The
      three observations were: (<a href="#n1">1</a>) a
      precircumcision control hour (PC) immediately following a
      feeding period preceding the scheduled circumcision; (<a
      href="#n2">2</a>) a stress- circumcision hour(SC) immediately
      following the procedure; and (<a href="#n3">3</a>) a recovery
      hour hour (REC) generally after the next scheduled feeding
      following the circumcision. Though not all the observation
      periods occurred at the same clock time, the PC and REC hours
      were comparable periods in the infants activity schedule in
      that both followed routine scheduled feeding periods. Since
      newborns normally spend 50% of their interfeeding sleep time
      in active-REM sleep and 50% in quiet sleep (<a
      href="#n11">11</a>) we felt that diurnal factors effecting
      sleep-wake state proportions would not confound results.</p>

      <p class="body">The two investigators, by behavioral
      observations, rated state every 30 sec, and defined four
      waking and two sleep states. The waking states were:
      Fussy-Cry (FC), characterized by vigorous diffuse motor
      activity and varying intensities of vocalization (crying);
      Wakeful Activity (WA), characterized by frequent spurts of
      diffuse motor activity, open eyes, and occasional grunts and
      whimpers; Alert Inactivity (AI), characterized by occasional
      directed motor actions and wide open eyes that pursued
      targets; and Drowsy (DR), characterized by relative
      immobility, absence of focused attention, and opening and
      closing of the eyelids. (<a href="#n12">12</a>) The two sleep
      states were active (AR), behaviorally defined by the presence
      of rapid eye movements, facial grimacing, writhing body
      movements, isolated limb twitches, and irregular respiration;
      and quiet NREM sleep (QS), defined by the absence of eye
      movements and body movements except for an occasional startle
      or burst of nonnutritive sucking, and the presence of regular
      respiration (<a href="#n13">13</a>). The overall interrater
      reliability for definition of sleep wake states was 0.93 for
      the two observers. Greatest reliability was obtained for the
      observations of active/REM, quiet and fussy-cry states.
      Slightly less agreement was obtained for the states of drowsy
      and alert inactivity.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="body">Our results are depicted in Fig. 1 and Table
      1. Significant findings were confined to the redistribution
      of waking states. Total wakefulness increased during the SC
      period compared to the two previous periods. (F(2,30) = 5.23;
      p &lt; 0.05) emphasizing conversely, the total sleep
      decrement during this period. Since wakefulness during the
      immediate minutes following the circumcision (sleep onset
      latency time) was not significantly increased compared to PC
      control period, the wakefulness noted during this period
      represented an increase throughout the entire hour rather
      than only immediately after the trauma.</p>

      <p class="body">Shifts within wakefulness were also evident.
      The PC period was characterized by drowsiness, whereas the SC
      period was characterized by fussy crying. These differences
      were significant (p &lt; .001).</p>

      <p class="body">Changes within sleep were not as dramatic:
      the proportional relationships of active REM to quiet sleep
      noted during the REC period was reduced significantly (p &lt;
      0.05) compared to both the PC and SC conditions suggesting
      that a sleep "rebound" or recovery effect followed the
      circumcision. The mean latency time to the first quiet NREM
      sleep period, in contrast, was not significantly reduced. The
      absence of any initial sleep onset quiet NREM sleep episode
      in either the SC or REC periods for any infant further failed
      to support a quiet NREM sleep state priority.</p>

      <p class="body">Thus the effect of circumcision in our infant
      population was an immediate and significant increase in
      wakefulness, particularly in fussy crying, during the hour
      following the procedure, and a decreased sleep onset latency
      time in a recovery period 1.5-7 hr later. No significant
      changes in active-REM or quiet-NREM sleep state proportions
      were noted in any period.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="body">In this study we attempted to ascertain
      whether a possible function of quiet sleep in the neonate was
      the response to "stress." Some understanding of what
      capacities infants have for interacting with the environment
      has been the research concern of many investigators. Stern
      (<a href="#n1">1-4</a>), for example, has demonstrated that
      the ability to look toward or away for a caretaker comes
      under executive control quite early in the infant's
      development. By three months of age the infant's control of
      gaze shifting is almost as mature as the adults. Of similar
      interest is the amount of control the infant exerts over
      physiological states of arousal. Engel (<a
      href="#n5">5,6</a>) has suggested that the conservation-
      withdrawal response represents a shift of states in a
      stressful situation when the more typical fight-flight
      response is unavailable. The reaction is characterized by
      increased sensory thresholds, withdrawal of attention,
      self-preoccupation and at times sleep. In the study by Emde
      et al. (<a href="#n4">4</a>) the psycho- physiological
      increase of quiet sleep resembled the conservation-withdrawal
      reaction, suggesting a relationship between the two; and,
      suggesting further, that such shifts reflect early executive
      control in times of stress.</p>

      <p class="body">Our study differ in several important
      respects from that of Emde's group. Our circumcision
      procedures were acute, lasting not more than 10-15 min;
      theirs employed the use of an acute incision and the
      subsequent application of a chronic ligature causing ischemic
      necrosis of the foreskin over several days. Our study
      employed behavioral observations for 3 separate 1-hr time
      blocs, whereas theirs employed polygraphic recordings and
      compared two 10hr time periods; one on the night previous to,
      and the other immediately following the circumcision. Our
      study used each infant as his own control, theirs had a
      noncircumcised control population.</p>

      <p class="body">Their results of clear-cut increases in quiet
      sleep without changes in the amount of wakefulness were not
      replicated in our study. Although they mention, in passing,
      that crying and activity were increased for a mean of 15.6
      min during circumcision, these shifts were not carried over
      into the subsequent sleep period. We found a marked increase
      in the fussy-crying state, which persisted through much of
      the first hour of observation following circumcision and, no
      significant quiet sleep changes during that hour or in a
      subsequent REC period 1.5 to 7 hr. later. These differences
      might well be accounted for by the more "traumatic," acute
      circumcision procedure experienced by our subjects in
      contrast to their more chronic method; though if this were
      so, a "stress" response should be even more evident. That is,
      if the circumcision were "stressful," and that change in
      quiet sleep were a response to that "stress," we would expect
      to find proportional shifts of quiet sleep in the expected
      direction immediately after the procedure. We might also
      expect that following the "stress," an infant would
      immediately enter into quiet sleep (in contrast to the normal
      active-REM sleep onset of neonates) or at least exhibit a
      decreased latency time to the first quiet sleep period. While
      these findings were reported by Emde, they also should have
      been present in our study, regardless of the nature of the
      circumcision. We were unable to demonstrate them,
      however.</p>

      <p class="body">Finally our results resembled those of our
      previous polygraphic study (<a href="#n7">7</a>) in which
      quiet sleep rations were increased following induced
      wakefulness. These infants showed clear increases in the
      proportions of their quiet sleep (quiet sleep "rebounds") in
      subsequent undisturbed recovery sleep. In that group, as in
      our present cohort, the sleep onset latency time in REC
      periods was significantly reduced compared to baseline
      periods as well. Thus the REC periods of infants in our
      present study resembled those of infants previously studied
      after increased amounts of wakefulness.</p>

      <p class="body">Emde et al. (<a href="#n4">4</a>) assert that
      their sleep findings were not related to prior wakefulness
      because other infants had been observed with long periods of
      spontaneous wakefulness which were not followed by changes in
      quiet sleep. Our present and previous findings, in contrast,
      suggest that the significant effect of circumcision is upon
      wakefulness and that proportional changes of sleep states
      seem secondary to the increased amount of wakefulness. Since
      prolonged periods of spontaneous wakefulness may not be
      associated with the same measure of arousal, exercise, and
      fatigue as periods of wakefulness following circumcision, we
      suggest that the "type" or "quality" of wakefulness may be
      important in determining subsequent sleep state proportions
      and patterns.</p>

      <p class="body">Further investigation is required to resolve
      these complex interrelationships and to elucidate whether
      neonates are capable of executing a psychophysiological
      "inhibiting" response to "stress."</p>

      <h4>SUMMARY</h4>

      <p class="body">In this study we attempted to ascertain
      whether human neonates could demonstrate any evidence of
      executive control over physiologic states. Specifically we
      observed the sleep-wake proportions of a group of 11 newborns
      during three 1-hr periods surrounding the "stress" of
      circumcision. We speculated that executive control would be
      evidenced by a reduction in the proportion of wakefulness
      following the procedure and a concomitant increase in the
      proportion of quiet sleep, resembling the
      conservation-withdrawal response. Instead we found increases
      in wakefulness with no significant shifts in sleep state
      proportions. We conclude that little executive control over
      sleep state proportions exist.</p>
