        <b>ABSTRACT.</b> The behavior of full-term neonates
        undergoing circumcision with and without local anesthesia
        was examined using the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale
        (BNAS). Evaluations were done blindly pre- and post-
        circumcision and on the day following the procedure.
        Infants receiving lidocaine in a dorsal penile nerve block
        (DPNB) remained more attentive to animate and inanimate
        stimuli following circumcision and demonstrated a greater
        ability to quiet themselves when disturbed. The smoothness
        and maturity of motor behaviors showed the expected rate of
        improvement or recovery curve in the anesthetized group,
        while the control group's behavior did not. Behavioral
        differences were still evident on the day following the
        procedure. This report adds to the growing body of data
        that indicate that circumcision is a painful procedure that
        disrupts the course of behavioral recovery following birth.
        These disruptions can be lessened by the use of local
        anesthesia to relieve pain and stress during the procedure
        without any additional morbidity. These data support the
        use of DPNB during anesthesia for routine neonatal
        circumcisions still requested by the majority of parents in
        the country.

      <p>Neonatal circumcision has remained a common practice in
      spite of efforts by the American Academy of Pediatrics and
      others to halt its use as a routine medical
      procedure.<sup>1-6</sup> The few studies that have explored
      the effects of this procedure on the neonate's behavior have
      indicated that this is a stressful and painful
      event.<sup>7-11</sup> Changes in heart rate, respiratory
      rate, transcutaneous pO2, adrenal cortical hormone secretion,
      sleep patterns, and behavioral patterns have been shown to be
      altered during and/or following circumcision of the full-term
      neonate. Indeed, circumcision has been recommended as a model
      for studying pain in the neonate,<sup>12</sup> and its
      effects are suggested to be long lasting.<sup>13</sup> <a
      href="/library/pain/kirya1/">Kirya and
      Werthmann</a><sup>14</sup> described a simple technique for
      the use of local anesthesia during neonatal circumcision to
      minimize pain during this procedure. Williamson and
      Williamson<sup>12</sup> reported a reduction in the infant's
      circumcision stress as indicated by several physiologic
      measures when a similar technique was used. It has also been
      demonstrated that a dorsal penile block with lidocaine
      reduced intraprocedure indicators of distress: crying and
      heart rate changes.<sup>15</sup> The present study expands
      those observations to include an assessment of behavior pre-
      and post-circumcision in a group of infants receiving a
      dorsal penile block, in contrast to that of a group
      circumcised without the local anesthetic. The study was
      designed to determine whether the alterations in behavior
      following circumcision could be reduced through the use of a
      local anesthetic during the procedure.</p>

      <h3>METHOD</h3>

      <p>The study population included 31 male infants who were
      born during a two-month period at UCSD Medical Center, San
      Diego, Calif. Parent(s) requested circumcision with informed
      consent for study participation. All were full-term
      appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants of two to five
      days of age with an uncomplicated perinatal course. Subjects
      were randomly assigned to one of three groups: group 1
      infants were restrained and circumcised with a Gomco clamp in
      the standard manner after dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB)
      with lidocaine (lidocaine group); eight were circumcised in a
      similar manner after DPNB with saline (group 2, saline
      control group) to control for the stress of an injection and
      possible effects of fluid volume compression on penile
      sensation. Eight were circumcised under identical
      circumstances without any injection (group 2, control group).
      The procedures were performed by a single physician who was
      blind to the injection content in groups 1 and 2. Heart rate
      and crying patterns were monitored continuously from the time
      of the initial restraint until completion of the procedure.
      The entire procedure has been described in detail
      elsewhere.<sup>15</sup> Two physicians, were blind to the
      child's group until the end of the study. They performed
      behavioral assessments on 16 infants selected blindly and at
      random from the three subgroups. They utilized the Brazelton
      Neonatal Assessment Scale (BNAS),<sup>16</sup> a widely used
      instrument that consists of 27 behavioral items, each scored
      on a scale of 1 to 9, and 20 reflexes, scored on a 3-point
      scale. The scale examines the organization and integration of
      behavior while the infant is being presented with a series of
      graded positive and adversive situations. Those behaviors
      that are most salient in specifying the infants' internal
      neurobehavioral organization and social interaction are
      particularly highlighted in this behavioral assessment. Both
      examiners were trained to reliability of greater than 0.85 on
      all items and demonstrated interscorer reliability at that
      level, at the inception and conclusion of the study. All
      assessments were performed in a quiet darkened room, and
      every effort was made to bring out the best performance of
      the infant over the 30-minute examination, in line with the
      established protocol. The examinations were conducted during
      interfeeding periods, prior to the circumcision (exam 1),
      following the circumcision (exam 2), and on the day following
      the procedure (exam 3). Half of the infants were breastfed,
      and these were distributed proportionately across the groups.
      The infants were all circumcised two to five days after
      birth. Clusters of assessment items normalized so that 9 was
      the optimal score and were then combined in an a priori,
      nonweighted fashion. This approach has been used in previous
      reports.<sup>17,18</sup></p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <p>Circumcision was completed in a satisfactory manner in all
      infants. One infant developed a small unilateral hematoma
      after the puncture of the superficial dorsal penile vein
      following regional anesthesia. There were no untoward effects
      from this. As reported previously, infants who received the
      DPNB with lidocaine showed less distress during the
      circumcision procedure. Heart rate changes were less, and
      percent of time that the baby cried was decreased in the
      anesthetized group.<sup>15</sup></p>

      <p>The mean scores on the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale
      for the three groups at three examination periods are shown
      in Table I. These group means are broadly within the norm of
      behavior expected for American samples reported
      elsewhere.<sup>17-19</sup> Individual variation in the item
      scores precluded demonstration of any statistically
      significant differences between the group means. However, the
      changes in behavior pre- and post-circumcision at the
      individual level within each of the groups was tested (alpha
      at 0.05 level) using the Mann-Whitney and Kniskal-Wallis
      one-way analysis of variance. nonparametric techniques
      appropriate for the small sample size.<sup>20</sup></p>

      Changes from Pre- to Post-circumcision, Exam 1 and Exam 2 The
      orientation response to an inanimate auditory stimulus (i.e.,
      rattle) showed significant differences between the groups in
      change of behavior from exam 1 and exam 2 (Kruskal-Wallis H =
