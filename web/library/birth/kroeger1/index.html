            <h4>Circumcision</h4>

            <p class="text">"According to the Council on Scientific
            Affairs of the American Medical Association,
            circumcision is a non-therapeutic procedure without
            documented benefit for the infant. Hill has raised
            concerns in a letter to a lactation journal about how
            little the matter of possible negative effects on
            breastfeeding from circumcision is addressed in the
            literature or in parental counseling. Circumcision is a
            traumatic and painful procedure that induces hard
            crying and that will continue to cause postoperative
            pain to the newborn. Anesthetic is used in less than
            half of the procedures done, according to one survey.
            This is despite the fact that the American Academy of
            Pediatrics (AAP) has called for the use of
            anesthetic.</p>

            <p class="text">"In his letter, Hill notes 25 years of
            studies documenting breastfeeding difficulties in
            infant males who have been circumcised. Howard <i>et
            al.</i> studied 44 infants after circumcision and found
            less-frequent feeding and withdrawn, subdued,
            less-interactive behavior. Howard cautions that because
            many babies are discharged on the day the circumcision
            is performed, they are lost to immediate follow-up for
            subsequent breastfeeding problems. Breastfeeding
            newborns in this study required supplementation due to
            their mother's perception that the baby could not
            breastfeed or had true difficulties with feeding. Early
            supplementation before the onset of lactogenesis is
            known to be associated with breastfeeding failure.
            Given the strong arguments for protecting a calm, safe,
            pain-free environment for the newborn to transition to
            life outside the warmth and cushion of the uterus, Hill
            argues that "successful breastfeeding should be given
            absolute priority over neonatal circumcision." The work
            group on breastfeeding in the AAP has also called for
            avoidance of painful procedures like circumcision.</p>

            <p class="text">"Fleiss has written extensively on the
            initial and long-term trauma to infants from
            circumcision. He writes: "The radical practice of
            routinely circumcising babies did not begin until the
            Cold War era. This institutionalization of what
            amounted to compulsory circumcision was part of the
            same movement that pathologized and medicalized birth
            and actively discouraged breastfeeding."</p>
