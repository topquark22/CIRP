      <h2>[Breastfeeding Problems After Circumcision]</h2>

      <p>A recent <a href="/library/pain/howard/">study of the use
      of acetaminophen</a> to control pain after circumcision drew
      attention to yet another factor that may adversely affect
      getting breastfeeding off to a good start. <span
      class="yellow">The feeding behavior of both breastfed and
      formula-fed infants deteriorated in the hours after surgery,
      regardless of whether acetaminophen was
      administered.</span></p>

      <p>"The observed deterioration in ability to breastfeed may
      potentially contribute to breastfeeding failure. Furthermore,
      some neonates in this study required formula supplementation
      because of maternal frustration with attempts at
      breastfeeding or because the neonate was judged unable to
      feed postoperatively. This finding is disconcerting because
      early formula supplementation is associated with decreased
      breastfeeding duration," the study's authors commented.</p>

      <p>Unquestionably, many babies are circumcised and go on to
      breastfeed without difficulty. <span class="yellow">But for
      some, the pain after circumcision may cause just enough
      disruption to interfere with the breastfeeding
      relationship.</span> When a Leader is contacted by a mother
      whose male infant is having difficulties with breastfeeding,
      it may be appropriate to ask about circumcision. If the
      mother understands that there could be a legitimate cause for
      her baby's fussiness, and the fussiness is temporary, she may
      be able to persist with breastfeeding a little longer.</p>

      <p>This study can be mentioned if the subject of circumcision
      is brought up by a mother at a meeting. It can be appropriate
      in a discussion of how the choices parents make about the
      birth experience can affect breastfeeding in the early days.
      Care should be taken to avoid a protracted discussion of
      circumcision, which is beyond the appropriate scope of an LLL
      meeting and may be a religious choice for some parents.</p>

      <p>The Leader's goal is to show that events in the baby's
      life in the early days can have positive and negative effects
      on breastfeeding and to encourage mothers to learn about
      their options.</p>
