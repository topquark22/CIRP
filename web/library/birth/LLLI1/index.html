        <h3>ELECTIVE SURGERY FOR YOU OR BABY</h3>
      </center>

      <p>If you are going to be in the hospital anyway for the
      birth of your baby, you or your doctor may suggest that you
      have some other medical matter attended to. Examples of
      elective surgery for the mother include stripping the legs of
      varicose veins or tying the fallopian tubes (tubal ligation).
      As for the baby, it may be considered almost routine to
      circumcise boy babies when they are only a few hours or days
      old. <span class="yellow">But circumcision is elective
      surgery and you have a choice of whether or not to have your
      baby circumcised.</span> You can also choose to wait a while
      before having this done. We bring this up because, physically
      and emotionally, these procedures all take their toll on
      mother and child. Since they represent elective surgery,
      their appropriateness at this critical time must be
      questioned.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Circumcision is as painful a
      procedure to a newborn as it is to an adult.</span> As a
      religious rite, circumcision is not performed until the baby
      is eight days old, when he is less likely to hemorrhage. The
      reasons given in the past for the non-religious, almost
      routine circumcision were generally hygienic and are no
      longer accepted by many physicians and parents. If you're
      interested in learning more about this subject see the book
      list at the end of the book.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">The most important reason for
      deciding against elective surgery following childbirth is
      that it interferes with a mother and her new baby being
      together and getting to know each other</span>. While a
      mother may feel very good following the birth of her baby,
      her body nevertheless has some recovering to do. Adding the
      strain of recovering from a surgical procedure might lessen
      her enjoyment of these early days with her baby.</p>

      <p>In regard to tubal ligation, there can often be an
      unexpected emotional reaction in the mother. When it dawns on
      her that the baby in her arms is her last, there may be
      feelings of deep sadness. It might become difficult for her
      to keep a normal perspective on her mothering of this baby.
      She may become exceedingly anxious about doing everything
      just right.</p>

      <p>Whatever the inconvenience you may experience by
      postponing such operations for you or your baby, it is slight
      compared to the upheaval such surgery can cause in your life
      at this time.</p>
