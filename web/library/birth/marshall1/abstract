[ABSTRACT]

Twenty-six newborn infants were randomly assigned to an
early (2 day) and delayed (3 week) circumcision group.  Each
infant was examined three times using the Brazelton Neonatal
Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) in which the examiner was
blind to the circumcision status of the subject.  A
reduction scale was derived from the NBAS examination were
assigned to the behavioral categories of average, subdued,
or hyperactive.  Nearly 90 percent of the early circumcision
group changed behavior categories after circumcision for at
least four hours compared to 16 percent of the delayed
group.  The implications of these results and the details of
the reduction scale are discussed.
