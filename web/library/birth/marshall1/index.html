      <h4 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p>In the United States, about 80% of the approximately
      1,600,000 male infants born each year are routinely
      circumcised as newborns (Kaplan, 1977; <a
      href="/library/general/grimes/">Grimes</a>, 1978). despite
      the prevalence of this medical procedure in the United
      States, there are few carefully documented studies about the
      effects of circumcision in the newborn male (<a
      href="/library/birth/emde/">Emde, Harmon, Metcalf, Koenig
      &amp; Wagonfeld</a>, 1971; <a
      href="/library/birth/anders/">Anders &amp; Chalemian</a>,
      1974; Brackbill, 1975). This paper reports on a controlled,
      blind study in 26 infants on the effects of circumcision on
      newborn behavior using the Brazelton (1973) Neonatal
      Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). A new method was
      developed for reducing the data derived from the NBAS into
      specific categories of behavior that permits further
      applications of the NBAS to a variety of clinical
      problems.</p>

      <h4 align="center">RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="navlink">[not transcribed]</p>

      <h4 align="center">DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p>There are only three previous experimental studies that
      have investigated the effects of circumcision upon newborn
      behavior. <a href="/library/birth/emde/">Emde</a> (1971)
      studied the effects of circumcision on sleep patterns in ten
      subjects and ten controls, and found that circumcised infants
      had about a 10 percent increase in the amount of non-REM or
      quiet sleep during a 10-hour polygraphic observation period.
      It is of interest to note that these subjects were
      circumcised by the plastibel technique in which a mold is
      placed over the glans penis and held in place by a ligature
      until there is ischemic necrosis of the foreskin over several
      days. The plastibel technique, which may be considered a
      chronic procedure with an unknown period of pain, is
      different from the acute circumcision procedure used by <a
      href="/library/birth/anders/">Anders</a> (1974) in his study,
      where 11 infants each (each acting as his own control) were
      observed for three non-continuous one-hour periods. Ander's
      observations were made after the feeding preceding the
      circumcision, immediately following the procedure, and during
      a recovery period after the feeding following the
      circumcision. Behavioral observations were made ever 30
      seconds and six behavioral states were recorded - four waking
      and two sleep states. Anders observed an increase in
      wakefulness, especially in crying and fussy behavior, in the
      hour after circumcision. There were no significant
      differences in acive-REM or quiet-non-REM sleep state
      perceptions in any observation period. <span
      class="yellow">The differences between Anders' and Emde's
      results might be due to differences in experimental design -
      controls and observational method - or circumcision
      techniques.</span></p>

      <p>In the third experimental study, Brackbill studied the
      effects of circumcision on response to continuous auditory
      stimulation in 39 male newborns (Brackbill, 1975). The
      subjects had been circumcised by methods not described, 37
      hours before they were tested. Control groups were 30 female
      and 30 uncircumcised male infants. Arousal levels, as
      measured by heart rate changes and state changes, were
      observed during the experimental period with continuous
      auditory stimulation of white noise and no additional
      auditory stimulation for control periods. Significant
      differences were noted in heart rate and state changes
      between the 39 circumcised males and the 60 control
      subjects.</p>

      <p>All three studies reported differences in some aspects of
      behavior in circumcised infants and are consistent with our
      observation that male infants behave differently after
      circumcision than a control group.</p>

      <p>Why did the item analysis of NBAS not reveal differences,
      although the behavior categories procedure did? There are at
      least two possible explanations. One, the kinds of changes
      seen after circumcision were not reflected evenly through out
      all 27 behavioral items. Though none of the items were
      statistically significant, some items did change more than
      others. In our data, startle, self-quieting, response to
      rattle and rapidity of build-up showed most change between
      early and late circumcision groups. Therefore, if all 27
      items are analyzed as a unit, then changing items may be
      dampened against the background of no-change items. Two, the
      NBAS was designed to elicit the maximal potential that an
      infant can display during the examination (Brazelton, 1973).
      If any infant gives a best score for a brief period and a
      less optimal score for most of the examination, one is
      required to record the best score. such a constrain obscures
      differences that are related to an intervention like
      circumcision. This methodological problem has been addressed
      by Horowitz, who developed a modal scoring system for NBAS
      items in an attempt to capture the behavior exhibited by baby
      during most of the examinations. (Horowitz, Sullivan, &amp;
      Linn, in press).</p>

      <p>The reduction scale presented in this study utilizes 7
      NBAS items. Three of these items - irritability, peak of
      excitement, and rapidity of build up - reflect stimuli during
      the NBAS examination that upset the infant. Two items - self
      quieting and consolability with intervention - reflect the
      infant's ability to be consoled by himself or others. All of
      these items capture a baby's capacity to control and modulate
      his state behavior. It is not surprising that these
      dimensions of behavior would be altered after a procedure
      like circumcision.</p>

      <p>The other two items in the reduction reflect global
      behaviors - lability of state and alertness. Changes in these
      two categories reflect the overall impression which the
      infant presents to the examiner and influence whether an
      infant seems average, subdued, or hyperactive. It must be
      stated that the reduction scale requires the seven NBAS items
      and the three items from the summary paragraph for its
      application. When attempts were made to utilize either the
      seven NBAS items or the summary paragraph alone, reliable
      assignment of infants to the appropriate behavior category
      was not possible.</p>

      <p>We think the results of the study are significant for four
      reasons. First, we have developed a method of reducing the
      NBAS that permits detailed examination of behaviors, yet
      emerges with general statements about changes after
      intervention. <span class="yellow">Second, our results
      demonstrate than infants change behaviors after circumcision
      in about 90 percent of cases.</span> Families, nurses, and
      physicians have appreciated that babies are different after
      circumcision, but there have not been controlled studies
      using the NBAS scale to substantiate these changes. <span
      class="yellow">Third, investigators of infant behavior must
      recognize the circumcision status of their subjects when
      doing research on newborn male subjects. We have shown that
      behavior differences after circumcision in 4/12 (33%)
      subjects persisted for at least 22 hours.</span></p>

      <p>Richards and colleagues suggest that some behavioral
      differences between male and female babies may be related to
      circumcision effects. (<a
      href="/library/psych/brackbill/">Richards, Bernal, &amp;
      Brackbill</a>, 1976). Fourth, the infant's response to the
      circumcision procedure is diverse, not uniform. Our initial
      bias was that all subjects would become more active and
      irritable during the examination after circumcision (E2). Our
      data did not support that impression. Some infants react to
      the stress of circumcision by becoming more active. This
      diversity of individual infants' responses to a stressful
      procedure like circumcision suggest that they have different
      coping styles from birth.</p>

      <p>The criticism may be raised that the differences observed
      between the early and delayed circumcision groups were real
      but trivial because they may have no long term significance.
      Unfortunately, our three week outpatient NBAS examinations
      did not generate reliable data. Only 50 percent of the early
      circumcision group returned to the hospital, and the infants
      were not frequently in the appropriate states to permit
      adequate and complete examinations. Thus, we cannot make any
      direct statements from our data at this point. However, <span
      class="yellow">data from diverse investigators have shown
      that newborns have greater response competency and capacity
      for storage of memory, than previously anticipated.</span>
      (Stone, Smith and Murphy, 1973; Lipsitt, 1977). Klaus and
      Kennell (1976), O'Connor, Vietze, Hopkins, and Altmeier
      (1977), and De Chateau and Wiberg (1977) have shown,
      moreover, that newborn experience may have long term
      consequence for both mothers and infants. It seems
      inappropriate, therefore, to make the assumption in the
      absence of direct evidence that there are no long-term
      consequences of the circumcision experience (Lipsitt, 1977;
      Richards, 1976). <span class="yellow">As suggested by
      Lipsitt, even without memory of the specific circumcision
      event the painful experience might affect the infant's
      subsequent behavior, which in turn may determine other's
      responses to the baby and thus affect subsequent
      environmental inputs to the child.</span> <span
      class="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: Later research verified
      long-lasting changes in behavior. See <a
      href="/library/pain/taddio2/">Effect of neonatal circumcision
      on pain response during subsequent routine
      vaccination.</a>]</b></span></p>

      <p>A recent report described a method for reducing pain
      during circumcision by using dorsal penile nerve block as a
      means of local anesthesia (<a
      href="/library/pain/kirya1/">Kirya &amp; Wirthman</a>, 1978).
      Because the infant's behavior changes after circumcision may
      be due to pain after circumcision, such an invasive procedure
      may not be warranted. However, further data is required. It
      is hoped that the results of this study will stimulate others
      to examine methods used and behavioral consequences of
      providing routine care for newborns.</p>
