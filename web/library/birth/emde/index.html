      <h2>Stress and Neonatal Sleep</h2>
      Robert N. Emde, MD Robert J. Harmon, MD, David Metcalf, MD,
      Kenneth L. Koenig, MD and Samuel Wagonfeld, MD 

      <p class="abstract">Routine circumcision, done without
      anesthesia in the newborn nursery was usually followed by
      prolonged nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Since this form
      of sleep has been described as a low point on an arousal
      continium, we consider its increase to be consistent with a
      theory of conservation-withdrawal in response to stressful
      stimulation.</p>

      <p class="body">Normal hospital routine requires
      blood-drawing by lancing the newborn's heel during the first
      3 days of life. We observed that this procedure was
      frequently followed by prolonged sleeping which began with a
      lengthy, behaviorally inactive sleep period without rapid eye
      movements (non-REM sleep). This observation was noteworthy
      because the newborn ordinarily begins a sleep cycle with
      active, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (<a
      href="#n1">1-4</a>). Curiosity about this reaction to the
      blood-drawing procedure led us to explore the effects of
      stressful stimulation on sleeping at this age.</p>

      <p class="body">It seemed to us that two different theories
      offered explanations as to how stressful stimulation would
      prolong sleep, and that they led to mutually incompatible
      predictions. One theory was relevant to the general effects
      of stimulation. It considers REM sleep to serve the primary
      function of processing and programming information which has
      been taken in during the wakeful period prior to sleep (<a
      href="#n5">5</a>). This theory led us to the prediction of an
      increase in REM sleep after a large amount of stimulation. A
      second theory is relevant to the effects of stressful
      stimulation (<a href="#n6">6,7</a>). A second theory is
      relevant to the effects of stressful stimulation (<a
      href="#n6">6,7</a>). It postulates two basic physiologic
      response patterns to such stimulation, one consisting of
      increased vigilence with mobilization of activity
      (fight-flight pattern), and the other consisting of a
      reduction of incoming stimulation by alteration of sensory
      thresholds with a decline of activity
      (conservation-withdrawal pattern). Our a assumption was that
      the immature human infant, who has a limited capacity
      actively to avoid stressful stimulation, would be likely to
      respond to such stimulation with the conservation-withdrawal
      pattern. This led us to predict an increase in non-REM sleep
      after such stimulation, since this form of infant sleep has
      been described as a low point on an arousal continuum, a
      condition in which thresholds to sensory stimulations are
      high and motoric activity is low (<a href="#n8">8,9</a>).</p>

      <p class="body">Routine hospital circumcision, done without
      anesthesia, was chosen as a potential stressor which might be
      expected to produce prolonged bombardment of pain pathways.
      The Plastibel technic (<a href="#n10">10</a>) for
      circumcision was used on all infants studied, is one in which
      a midline foreskin incision allows a plastic mold to be
      slipped over the glans penis. A ligature is then tied over
      the mold which results in a progressive ischemic necrosis of
      the foreskin during the next several days.</p>

      <h4>Initial Behavioral Study</h4>

      <p class="body">Since pilot work verified that prolonged
      non-REM sleep periods often followed circumcision, we carried
      out an initial study without polygraphic or other
      manipulations in which minute-by- minute observations of
      behavioral states were made. The method of observing
      behavioral state, along with operational definitions of the
      states, will be found in a previous publication (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>). Infants were observed continuously over a
      24-hour period, with individual investigators rotating 4-5
      hour observation assignments. Intermittent time sampling for
      assessing interobserver reliability showed 97% perfect
      agreement among the twelve states between any two of our four
      observers. Six normal full-term newborns had circumcisions
      midway during the observation period. Of the six, 4 evidenced
      increases in the amount of non-REM sleep of 28%, 72%, and
      80%, when the 12 hours before were compared with the twelve
      hours after the procedure. Increases of this magnitude were
      remarkable as, in our previous observations of undisturbed
      infants, we had never seen any comparable values even
      approaching these. Although all 6 infants spent less time in
      alert states after circumcision, REM sleep was variable with
      no consistent increase or decrease. One of the 2 circumcised
      infants who did not have an increase in non-REM sleep was
      kept awake by his father for a prolonged period after
      circumcision. This convinced us of the need for environmental
      control in a subsequent study. The other infant was unusually
      alert and wakeful both before and after circumcision and
      represented a clear exception to the trend of our findings.
      For purposes of comparison, 3 infants of the same age without
      circumcision were observed for 24 hours; they showed no
      increase in non-REM sleep during the second 12 hours.</p>

      <h4>Polygraphic Study</h4>

      <p class="body"><i><b>Method.</b></i> After this study a
      second was carried out which employed EEG ash polygraph
      recordings. Twenty full-term male infants were randomly
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups - 10 to a circumcision group, and
      10 to a control group. One group was circumcised during the
      period of study and the other group was not. Each group of
      infants was studied on 2 successive nights, beginning at 24
      hours of age. Environmental conditions were standardized with
      data collected over a 10-hour period, from 10 pm till 8 am.
      All blood drawing procedures were delayed until after the
      total period of study. In each instance, observations began
      with feedings and subsequent feedings were offered in
      accordance to the infants demands. For the first night's
      study, conditions were identical in each group, as were the
      case for the second night's study in the control group. The
      second night's study of the circumcised group differed only
      in that infants were circumcised immediately prior to the
      standardized 10-hour recording period. This experimental
      design allowed a comparison of postcircumcision nights with
      first nights of the same infants and also with nights of
      other infants of the same age who had not been
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="body">Electrophysiologic recording was done be a
      10-channel Model 6 Grass EEG-Polygraph in which four channels
      were used for recording eye movements three channels for EEG,
      one channel for respiration. Ongoing behavioral observations
      were written on the polygraph paper. Minute-by-minute scoring
      of state was done from the polygraph records by two of the
      authors, and an agreement study between them on 40 hours of
      record yielded over 90% agreement on all, sleep, crying and
      awake states.</p>

      <p class="body"><i><b>Results.</b></i> Results of this study
      were similar to those of the observational one; of 10
      circumcised infants, 8 showed an increase in non-REM or quiet
      sleep. Increases ranged from 41% to 121% then Night 2 was
      compared to Night 1. In contrast, in the non-circumcised
      group, the total amount of non-REM sleep varied little from
      Night 1 to Night 2; the greatest single percentage increase
      was less than 3%. Table 1 displays mean data for the 10
      infants in each of the two groups. Statistical analysis
      indicates that increase in non-REM sleep in the
      postcircumcision subgroup is significant beyond the the 0.01
      level of confidence. Analysis of variance was done, using a
      partially hierarchialized design, with subjects nested within
      treatments. The interaction F ratio was 16.35; df = 1,18.
      Although the equal variance assumption was not met for the
      analysis of variance, the results are consistent with those
      of the Mann-Whitney U Test applied to the second day-first
      day differences. It will be noted that the means of crying
      time are practically identical on Night 2 for circumcised and
      uncircumcised groups. The lesser amount of awake and drowsy
      times for the circumcised group on Night 2 is not
      statistically significant. In 5 of the 8 infants in whom
      postcircumcision increase in non-REM sleep was noted, there
      was a corresponding decrease in REM sleep. In the 3 remaining
      infants, a decrease in the amount of REM sleep was not
      evident, although a decrease in crying, wakeful and drowsy
      states was noted.</p>

      <p class="body">Postcircumcision increase in non-REM sleep is
      reflected in several other measures: (a) a shorter latency to
      the first non-REM sleep period after the feeding which began
      each observation, (b) an increased number of non-REM sleep
      periods, and (c) an increased number of extremely long
      non-REM sleep periods. Shorter latency to non-REM sleep after
      circumcision was statistically significant at the 0.05 level
      of confidence. (As in the the previous analysis, a partial
      hierarchialized design for analysis of variance was used. The
      F ratio was 7.66; df =1,18.).</p>

      <p class="body">Figure 1 illustrates that Night 2 of the
      circumcision group had twenty more non-REM sleep periods than
      the control nights of circumcised and noncircumcised groups.
      It also illustrates that the postcircumcision night was
      characterized by a wider distribution in the duration of
      non-REM periods; there were more non-REM which lasted longer
      than 30 minutes and more which lasted less than 5
      minutes.</p>

      <p class="body">How long does this effect last? We do not
      know. Figure 2 suggest a waning in the effect over the
      10-hour observation period, but increased values for non-REM
      sleep did not return to basal levels. The suggested Night
      1-Night 2 difference in control group patterns, although not
      statistically significant, raises a question of a more
      general effect which is related to the order of recording
      nights.</p>

      <h3 align="center">DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p class="body">Recent reports have indicated that severe
      physical exercise has the effect of increasing non-REM sleep
      in rate (<a href="#n11">11</a>), cats (<a href="#n11">12</a>)
      and adolescent humans (<a href="#n13">13</a>). Is the effect
      of an increase in non-REM sleep after circumcision primarily
      due to exercise? At first, anecdotal evidence suggested that
      it might be. It has been noted in our EEG laboratory that
      when a technician is learning to apply electrodes (and
      consequently taking longer to manipulate the infant), sleep
      often begins with a long behaviorally quiet non-REM period;
      later as the technician becomes more skillful, this
      phenomenon is rare. The unskilled manipulation experience
      could be regarded as one of increased exertion, with crying
      and consequent fatique; however, it could equally be
      considered stressful. Further evidence which bears on this
      question was uncovered in a review of data from the current
      polygraphic study. The circumcision procedure added a mean of
      15.6 minutes to the night's observation; much of this time
      was spent in vigorous crying with considerable exercise. For
      purposes of comparison, we found two instances from our
      ongoing naturalistic studies, in which newborn babies cried
      for long periods (47 and 87 minutes) in the absence of
      circumcision or other stressful procedures. We were able to
      compare intervals with of at least 6 hours before and after
      the crying period for each infant. We found no increase in
      non-REM sleep after crying and no decrease in latency to the
      first non-REM sleep period. It therefore seem unlikely that
      exercise is the major factor in producing this effect.</p>

      <p class="body">Another alternative to the
      conservation-withdrawal explanation of the postcircumcision
      effect is suggested by Oswald (<a href="#n14">14</a>), who
      postulates that non-REM sleep assists in the processes of
      growth and repair of body tissues outside of the central
      nervous system. A test of this explanation may be found in an
      experimental design comparing circumcision effects on infants
      who had local anesthesia with infants who did not. If the
      effect of increased non-REM sleep is a function of bombarded
      pain pathways and resultant physiologic stress, the
      anesthetic condition should eliminate it. However, if this
      effect is a result of processes of tissue breakdown and
      repair, the effect would remain.</p>

      <p class="body">The fact that non-REM sleep declined in some
      infants invites a comparison with the first night effect in
      adults, in which initial laboratory sleeping results in a
      lesser amount of REM sleep than occurs in subsequent
      laboratory nights (<a href="#n15">15</a>). Although such a
      comparison is limited because the effect has not been
      documented in human infants, the postcircumcision effect
      would appear to be different, since there was not an increase
      in the amount of quiet non-REM sleep.</p>

      <p class="body">In conclusion, the information processing
      theory of REM sleep led us to a false prediction in this
      study, while the conservation-withdrawal theory led us to an
      accurate one. This would seem to provide further confirmatory
      evidence for the usefulness of the latest theory which has
      been employed in explaining the experimental production of
      pathologic states in infant pigtail monkeys (<i>Macaca
      nemestrina</i>) (<a href="#n16">16</a>). Current research is
      aimed at the endocrinologic basis for the phenomenon of
      increased non-REM sleep after circumcision. This phenomenon
      may be related to some long-term aspects of infant
      development; these are being investigated along theoretical
      lines proposed elsewhere (<a href="#n17">17</a>).</p>

      <h3 align="center">SUMMARY</h3>

      <p class="body">Prolonged periods of quiet non-REM sleep
      sometimes followed routine blood drawing in newborns. This
      observation led us to study the effects of stressful
      stimulation on sleep patterns at this age.</p>

      <p class="body">Routine hospital circumcision, done without
      anesthesia, was chosen as a potential stressor which might be
      expected to produce prolonged bombardment of pain pathways.
      Two studies, one without polygraphic manipulation and one
      with EEG and polygraphic manipulation and one with EEG and
      polygraphic recording, resulted in similar findings.
      Circumcision was usually followed by prolonged, non-REM
      sleep. Effects of circumcision were demonstrable in terms of
      an increase in the amount of non-REM sleep (p&lt;0.01) and a
      decrease in latency to the onset of non-REM sleep
      (P&lt;0.05). Infants were used as their own controls and were
      compared with non-circumcised males for statistical analysis.
      Postcircumcision increase in non-REM sleep was also reflected
      in an increased total number of non-REM sleep periods and an
      increased number of extremely long non-REM sleep periods.</p>

      <p class="body">These results are interpreted to be
      consistent with a theory of conservation-withdrawal in
      response to stressful stimulation.</p>
