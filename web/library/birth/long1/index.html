      <p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>

      <p>I am the mother of three sons, one circumcised and two
      intact. When I gave birth to my first son, Keith, at <a
      href="http://www.uhseast.com/body.cfm?id=26&amp;oTopID=26"
      target="_blank">Pitt Memorial Hospital</a> Birthing Center in
      Greenville, NC in 1991 I consented to having him circumcised.
      I assumed it was a medically necessary procedure because I
      received no information to the contrary from my OB/GYN, my
      son's pediatrician or any of the medical staff. I took my
      newborn son home and listened to him scream in pain for five
      days until his throat was hoarse. I struggled to comfort him
      and to encourage him to nurse. If I had not hired a Lactation
      Consultant five days a week for two weeks, I doubt I would
      have succeeded in breastfeeding my son.</p>

      <p>If I had received <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/"
      target="_blank">informed consent</a> I would have never
      consented to have this painful, unnecessary cosmetic
      procedure performed on my helpless newborn baby. I live with
      the guilt of allowing my son to be <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">irreparably injured</a>, but
      my doctor, my son's doctor, and the hospital staff had a
      responsibility to give me accurate information about
      circumcision and they failed me and my son miserably.</p>

      <p>Informed consent on any procedure is the right of every
      patient.</p>

      <p>Most Sincerely,</p>
      <br />

      <p>Beth Long<br />
       Mother of Keith, A.J., and Evan</p>
