      Breastfeeding Patterns" subsection "In the Early
      Days"</b></p>

            <p>Basic Information: Painful medical procedures can
            affect a baby's ability and willingness to feed in the
            early days.</p>

      <p class="text">When a baby undergoes a painful medical
      procedure, such as a heel stick, injection, spinal tap, or
      <span class="yellow">circumcision</span>, he may shut down
      and be unreceptive to feedings until he is feeling better.
      Vigorous suctioning of a baby's mouth can also cause a sore
      throat and injured vocal cords, which can cause a baby to
      reject anything by mouth for a time.</p>

      <p class="text">Research indicates, however, that if a baby
      is breastfed during a painful procedure, such as a heel
      stick, that breastfeeding is "a potent analgesic" that
      essentially eliminates the symptoms of pain, such as crying
      and grimacing, and prevents a marked rise in heart rate (Gray
      2002). Previous research has found that three components of a
      potent reliever [sic] for the newborn are: skin-to-skin
      contact, suckling, and a sweet taste (Gray 2000).
      Breastfeeding provides all three.</p>
