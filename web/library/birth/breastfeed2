Pisacane et al.[1] found that breastfeeding may protect infant boys
from urinary tract infections. Looking at 62 cases of urinary tract
infection hospitalized under the age of six months with a urine
culture yielding more than 100,000 organisms per milliliter of a
single species, only 10 (16%) were breastfeeding. A control group
of 62 infants seen at their well-baby clinic and a control group
of 62 infants admitted for acute illness with negative urine cultures
had breastfeeding rates of 55% and 42% respectively. None of the
boys in the study had been circumcised. The odds ratio for bottle
feeding was 6.3 (CI=2.5-16.1) for the well-child controls and 3.7
(CI=1.5-9.5) for hospital controls, which is comparable to the odds
ratios seen for circumcision.

In addition several studies have shown that circumcision interferes
with breastfeeding.[2]
