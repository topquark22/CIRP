      <p class="topic"><i>Circumcision and Breastfeeding: A
      Response to Nikki Lee's Letter</i></p>

      <p class="text">I agree with Nikki Lee (<a
      href="/library/birth/lee1/">2000;16:295</a>) that baby boys
      are at lower risk for breastfeeding difficulties when
      circumcision is delayed and breastfeeding is more
      established. Case in point: my own three sons were all
      circumcised at home at 8 days at the traditional Brith Milah.
      Breastfeeding was well established, my milk supply was ample,
      and the babies had a full week to perfect their skills. As
      soon as the <i>mohel</i> was finished, the baby was whisked
      back to mom's breast for a comforting feed, with no
      problems at all! This is so unlike what I observe in the
      hospital again and again, with babies shocked into a stupor,
      some having not yet even suckled well, milk volume not yet
      increased, and mom not yet experienced with feeding.</p>
