Uses of the foreskin:
 
1. protects the glans from abrasion and keratinization
 
2. contains 100,000 Meissner corpuscles for sexual sensation
 
3. For the first three years, while attached by the synechia, 
protects the infant glans from irritation, meatal stenosis, UTI.
 
4. as a rolling bearing, facilitates masturbation and vaginal  
intercourse.
 
5. stimulates partner's genitalia
 
6. stores smegma, nature's own lubricant
 
7. in plastic surgery, for repair of hypospadias, burnt 
eyelids (for the foreskin's *owner*, I mean - which reminds 
me, we haven't even *touched* on *property rights* here) etc.
 
8. There are more...

Problems of circumcision:
 
1. Urinary tract infection "In our experience, we have found 
cases of staphlococcal pneumonia, ascending urinary infection, 
and sepsis that have resulted from infection at the site of 
circumcision."
(T E Reichelderfer and J R Fraga, Circumcision in: K S 
Shepard, Care of the Well Baby, 2nd ed, Lippincot, 1968, p 302)
 
2. Haemmorrhage and sepsis "Although haemorrhage and sepsis 
are the main causes of morbidity, the variety of complications 
is enormous. The literature abounds with reports of morbidity 
and even death as a result of circumcision."
(N.Williams and L Kapila, Complications of circumcision, Brit. 
J Surg 80: 1231-6, 1993)
 
3. Pain "There is no doubt that circumcisions are painful for 
the baby. Indeed, circumcision has become a model for the 
analysis of pain and stress responses in the newborn."
(H Stang et al, Local anesthesia for neonatal circumcision, 
JAMA 259: 1507-11,1988)
 
4. Necrotizing fasciitis ("galloping gangrene")
(J R Woodside, Circumcision disasters, Paediatrics 65: 1053, 
1980.)
 
5. Surgical errors and healing problems
"The nature of circumcision dictates that errors of omission 
and commission, i e too little or too much, in assessing how 
much foreskin to remove are likely to happen and one of he 
commonest complaints is of an unsatisfactory cosmetic result."
Williams and Kapila, op cit.
(In this connection, wouldn't the "best" amount to be taken depend in 
some measure on how big the penis was going to be in adulthood 
- something the surgeon couldn't possibly know?)
 
7. Death
"It is an incontestable fact at this point that there are more 
deaths each year from complications of circumcision than from 
cancer of the penis."
(S S Gellis, Circumcision, Am Journ. of Diseases of Childhood, 
132: 1168, 1978)
"Most practicisng paediatricians have seen unfortunate 
consequences from the operation of circumcision, and seen or 
personally heard of death directly resulting from it."
(R S Illingworth, The Normal Child, Some Problems of the Early 
Years and their Treatment, 8th ed, Churchill Livingston, 
Edinburgh, 1983, p 98.)
