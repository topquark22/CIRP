However, attention should be paid to the fact that a large number of those
will have been circumcised for cultural/religious reasons, and these cultures/
religions may frown upon promiscuous behaviour. What you have at the moment
is a correlation, not a causal effect.

In addition, The AAP noted that a study had been published that found a higher
incidence of UTI's among uncircumcised babies. Then they admit the study was 
flawed. They go on to say that "...in the absence of well-designed prospective 
studies, conclusions regarding the relationship of urinary tract infection to 
circumcision are tentative." 

Other studies [Altschul, Am Fam Physician v41 #3, March 1990 p817-821] have 
failed to confirm the results. 

Further..in their own press release the AAP stated in 1989..


        "Evidence regarding the relationship of circumcision to

        sexually transmitted diseases is conflicting. Although

        published reports suggest that canchroid, syphilis, human

        papillomavirus and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection are

        more frequent in uncircumcised men, methodologic problems

        render these reports inconclusive."

In other words, no causal link has been established

Nope. Maden found 22 in such a small sample. Clearly this is an error by the
AAP EC. However, I did some finding out on this report. It appears all is not
well within the AAP. In their recent convention last month in Philadelphia,
it was reported that...

 "We can't let a doctor, who had been so openly pro-circumcision, head the 
 task force again", he said. "We're going to try our hardest to  get someone 
 objective to head the next task force even if it takes a year to find this 
 person," he added. Others stated that Edgar Schoen is going to have nothing 
 to do with the next task force. 

In other words, it appears that the 1989 committee was a 'rogue' committee.

No it doesn't. A letter from one military surgeon to a military magazine
indicating that he has changed his position is not US Armed Forces Policy.
Indeed, that letter appears to indicate that the US Military are moving away
from recommending routine circumcision - which appears to be what prompted
his letter.

I'm not claiming anything at the moment, other than I find your claims of
'decades of research' dubious. It appears much of this is contradictory.

You appear to be saying "80% of those who developed penile cancer were
uncircumcised. This shows that the foreskin causes penile cancer". That's
a rather strange position to take.

Perhaps, or perhaps they were military people trying to 'perform better in
the field'?
