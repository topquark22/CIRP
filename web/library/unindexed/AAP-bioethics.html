<h2>Informed Consent, Parental Permission, and Assent in Pediatric Practice</h2>
<p>
Committee on Bioethics<p>

<hr>
<i>The statement on informed consent, parental permission,
and patient assent has a long and extraordinary
history. The first draft of this document, prepared by
William G. Bartholome, MD, was presented to the
original American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee 
on Bioethics in 1985. Bill put his soul into the
manuscript and has watched over it carefully ever
since. Now, a decade later, those who have worked on
its continued development and urged its adoption as
Academy policy applaud its publication. No one is more
gratified than its primary author and champion. Those
who have had the privilege to know Dr Bartholome
share his sense of accomplishment, but cannot help but
experience a cruel sense of irony. Just as the work Bill
considers his most important contribution has become
available for public appreciation, Dr Bartholome suffers
from a serious illness that threatens his life.<p>

Bill always wanted ``the experience, perspective, and
power of children'' to be taken most seriously. Through
the years of the statement's revisions and re&#173;presentation 
within the Academy, Bill ``had faith in the power
of the text and the ideas it contained,... that its time
would come.'' The statement embodies Bill
Bartholome's dedication to children. Throughout his
career, he worked to make medicine and medical research 
safer and more friendly for children. The AAP
and its Committee on Bioethics, on behalf of all our
colleagues, extend heartful thanks to Dr William G.
Bartholome for helping us more fully appreciate that
children are in the process of becoming, in his words,
``intelligent, observant, capable, and responsible
persons'' who deserve our utmost respect.

<center><h3>AN OVERVIEW</h3></center><p>

Since the 1976 publication of an AAP policy statement 
on the legal concept of informed consent in
pediatric practice, the concept has evolved and become 
more formal.[<a href="#references">1</a>] A better understanding now exists 
as to how physicians should collaborate with
patients and parents in making these decisions. Patients 
should participate in decision&#173;making commensurate 
with their development; they should provide 
assent to care whenever reasonable. Parents and
physicians should not exclude children and adolescents 
from decision&#173;making without persuasive reasons. 
Indeed, some patients have specific legal entitlements 
to either consent or to refuse medical
intervention. Although physicians should seek parental 
permission in most situations, they must focus
on the goal of providing appropriate care and be
prepared to seek legal intervention when parental
refusal places the patient at clear and substantial
risk.[<a href="#references">2</a>] In cases of serious conflict, physicians and families 
should seek consultative assistance and only in
rare circumstances look to judicial determinations.<p>

We now realize that the doctrine of ``informed
consent'' has only limited <i>direct</i> application in pediatrics. 
Only <b>patients</b> who have appropriate decisional
capacity and legal empowerment can give
their <b>informed consent</b> to medical care. In all other
situations, parents or other surrogates provide <b>informed 
permission</b> for diagnosis and treatment of
children with the <b>assent</b> of the child whenever appropriate.<p>

In this statement, the AAP provides an updated
analysis of 1) the concept of informed consent; 2) the
ethics of informed consent and the concept of the
right to refuse treatment; 3) the concept of ``proxy
consent''; 4) the concepts of parental permission and
child assent; and 5) informed consent of adolescents.<p>

<center><h3>CHANGES IN MEDICAL DECISION&#173;MAKING</h3></center><p>

The authority to make medical decisions used to
lie squarely in the hands of physicians. However,
complex social changes have resulted in acceptance
of the idea that patients have a right to know about
their health, to know about available diagnostic and
treatment options and their risks and probable benefits, 
and to choose among the altematives.[<a href="#references">3</a>] Many
now regard traditional practices based on the theory
that ``doctor knows best'' as unacceptably paternalistic.[<a href="#references">4</a>] 
Society recognizes that patients or their surrogates 
have a right to decide, in consultation with
their physicians, which proposed medical interventions 
they will or will not accept. Decision&#173;making
power or authority is increasingly seen as something
to be shared by equal partners in the physician&#173;patient 
or physician&#173;surrogate relationship. For
many patients and family members, personal values
affect health care decisions, and physicians have a
duty to respect the autonomy, rights, and preferences 
of their patients and their surrogates.[<a href="#references">5</a>]<p>

<center><h3>ETHICS AND INFORMED CONSENT</h3></center><p>

The doctrine of informed consent reminds us to
respect persons by fully and accurately providing
information relevant to exercising their decision&#173;making 
rights. Experts on informed consent include
at least the following elements in their discussions of
the concept:[<a href="#references">6</a>]<p>

<ol>
 <li>Provision of information: patients should have
 explanations, in understandable language, of the
 nature of the ailment or condition; the nature of
 proposed diagnostic steps and/or treatment(s)
 and the probability of their success; the existence
 and nature of the risks involved; and the existence, 
 potential benefits, and risks of recommended 
 alternative treatments (including the
 choice of no treatment).
 <li>Assessment of the patient's understanding of the
 above information.
 <li>Assessment, if only tacit, of the capacity of the
 patient or surrogate to make the necessary decision(s).
 <li>Assurance, insofar as is possible, that the patient
 has the freedom to choose among the medical
 alternatives without coercion or manipulation.
</ol>

The goals of this consent process include the development 
of the patient's comprehensive understanding 
of the clinical situation, and the timely exercise, 
by the patient, of active choices regarding the
circumstances.[<a href="#references">7,8</a>]<p>

<center><h3>INFORMED CONSENT AND THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT</h3></center><p>

Health care providers should engage in the process 
of informed consent with patients before undertaking 
any medical intervention. Patients generally
have a moral and legal right to refuse proposed
medical intervention, except when the patient has
diminished decision&#173;making capacity or must undergo 
legally authorized ``involuntary'' treatment.
Respect for competent patients' autonomy ordinarily
extends even to the refusal or discontinuation of their
own life&#173;sustaining treatment.[<a href="#references">9</a>]<p>

<center><h3>PROBLEMS WITH THE CONCEPT OF ``CONSENT'' BY PROXY</h3></center><p>

In attempting to adapt the concept of informed
consent to pediatrics, many believe that the child's
parents or guardians have the authority or ``right'' to
give consent by proxy. Most parents seek to safeguard 
the welfare and best interests of their children
with regard to health care, and as a result proxy
consent has seemed to work reasonably well.<p>

However, the concept encompasses many ambiguities. 
Consent embodies judgments about proposed
interventions and, more importantly, consent (literally 
``to feel or sense with'') expresses something for
one's self: a person who consents responds based on
unique personal beliefs, values, and goals.<p>

Thus ``proxy consent'' poses serious problems for
pediatric health care providers. Such providers have
legal and ethical duties to their child patients to
render competent medical care based on what the
patient needs, not what someone else expresses. Although 
impasses regarding the interests of minors
and the expressed wishes of their parents or guardians 
are rare, the pediatrician's responsibilities to his
or her patient exist independent of parental desires
or proxy consent.[<a href="#references">10</a>]<p>

<center><h3>PARENTAL PERMISSION AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY</h3></center><p>

Decision&#173;making involving the health care of
young patients should flow from responsibility
shared by physicians and parents. Practitioners
should seek the informed permission of parents before 
medical interventions (except in emergencies
when parents cannot be contacted). The informed
permission of parents includes all of the elements of
standard informed consent, as outlined previously.<p>

Usually, parental permission articulates what most
agree represents the ``best interests of the child.''
However, the Academy acknowledges that this standard 
of decision&#173;making does not always prove easy
to define. In a pluralistic society, one can find many
religious, social, cultural, and philosophic positions
on what constitutes acceptable child rearing and
child welfare. The law generally provides parents
with wide discretionary authority in raising their
children.[<a href="#references">11</a>] Nonetheless, the need for child abuse and
neglect laws and procedures makes it clear that parents 
sometimes breach their obligations toward their
children. Providers of care and services to children
have to carefully justify the invasion of privacy and
psychologic disruption that come with taking legal
steps to override parental prerogatives.<p>

<center><h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD AS PERSON
AND THE CONCEPT OF ASSENT</h3></center><p>

Decision&#173;making involving the health care of older
children and adolescents should include, to the
greatest extent feasible, the <b>assent of the patient</b> as
well as the participation of the parents and the physician. 
Pediatricians should not necessarily treat children 
as rational, autonomous decision makers, but
they should give serious consideration to each patient's 
developing capacities for participating in decision&#173;making, 
including rationality and autonomy.
If physicians recognize the importance of <b>assent,</b>
they empower children to the extent of their capacity.[<a href="#references">12</a>] 
Even in situations in which one should not and
does not solicit the agreement or opinion of patients,
involving them in discussions about their health care
may foster trust and a better physician&#173;patient relationship, 
and perhaps improve long&#173;term health outcomes.<p>

<b>Assent</b> should include at least the following elements:<p>

<ol>
 <li>Helping the patient achieve a developmentally
  appropriate awareness of the nature of his or her
  condition.
 <li>Telling the patient what he or she can expect with
  tests and treatment(s).
 <li>Making a clinical assessment of the patients understanding 
  of the situation and the factors influencing 
  how he or she is responding (including
  whether there is inappropriate pressure to accept
  testing or therapy).
 <li>Soliciting an expression of the patient's willingness 
  to accept the proposed care. Regarding this
  final point, we note that no one should solicit a
  patient's views without intending to weigh them
  seriously. In situations in which the patient will
  have to receive medical care despite his or her
  objection, the patient should be told that fact and
  should not be deceived.
</ol>

As children develop, they should gradually become 
the primary guardians of personal health and
the primary partners in medical decision&#173;making,
assuming responsibility from their parents.<p>

Just as is the case with informed consent, the emphasis 
on obtaining assent should be on the interactive 
process in which information and values are
shared and joint decisions are made. The Academy
does not in any way recommend the development of
new bureaucratic mechanisms, such as ``assent
forms,'' which could never substitute for the relational 
aspects of consent or assent.<p>

<center><h3>THE PATIENT'S REFUSAL TO ASSENT (DISSENT)</h3></center><p>

There are clinical situations in which a persistent
refusal to assent (ie, dissent) may be ethically binding.[<a href="#references">13</a>]
This seems most obvious in the context of
research (particularly that which has no potential to
directly benefit the patient).[<a href="#references">14</a>] A patient's reluctance
or refusal to assent should also carry considerable
weight when the proposed intervention is not essential
to his or her welfare and/or can be deferred
without substantial risk.<p>

Medical personnel should respect the wishes of
patients who withhold or temporarily refuse assent
in order to gain a better understanding of their situation 
or to come to terms with fears or other concerns
regarding proposed care. Coercion in diagnosis or
treatment is a last resort.[<a href="#references">15</a>]<p>

<center><h3>ETHICAL CONFLICT AND ITS RESOLUTION</h3></center><p>

Social forces tend to concentrate authority for
health care decisions in the hands of physicians and
parents and this tendency diminishes the moral status 
of children.[<a href="#references">12</a>] Thus, those who care for children
need to provide for measures to solicit assent and to
attend to possible abuses of ``raw'' power over children 
when ethical conflicts occur. This is particularly
important regarding the initiation, withholding, or
withdrawing of life&#173;sustaining treatment.[<a href="#references">16,17</a>] Examples 
of mechanisms to resolve ethical conflicts include 
additional medical consultation(s); short&#173;term
counseling or psychiatric consultation for patient
and/or family; ``case management'' or similar multidisciplinary 
conference(s); and/or consultation
with individuals trained in clinical ethics or a hospital&#173;based 
ethics committee. In rare cases of refractory
disagreement, formal legal adjudication may be necessary.<p>

<center><h3>LEGAL EMANCIPATION AND INFORMED CONSENT</h3></center><p>

The traditional notion of informed consent clearly
applies to patients who have reached the legal age of
majority, except when the patient has been determined 
to be incompetent. In addition, laws designate
two settings in which minors have sole authority to
make health care decisions.[<a href="#references">11</a>] First, certain minors are
deemed ``emancipated'' and treated as adults for all
purposes. Definitions of the emancipated minor include 
those who are: 1) self&#173;supporting and/or not
living at home; 2) married; 3) pregnant or a parent; 4)
in the military; or 5) declared to be emancipated by a
court. Second, many states give decision&#173;making authority 
(without the need for parental involvement)
to some minors who are otherwise unemancipated
but who have decision&#173;making capacity (``mature
minors'') or who are seeking treatment for certain
medical conditions, such as sexually transmitted diseases, 
pregnancy, and drug or alcohol abuse.[<a href="#references">18</a>] The
situations in which minors are deemed to be totally
or partially emancipated are defined by statute and
case law and may vary from state to state.[<a href="#references">19</a>] Legal
emancipation recognizes a special status (eg, independent 
living) or serious public and/or individual
health problems that might not otherwise receive
appropriate attention (eg, sexually transmitted disease).<p>

<center><h3>PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS</h3></center><p>

The following illustrations may help practitioners
when applying the concepts developed above. These
examples are intended to provide a focus for discussion 
and clarification and do not suggest new legal
standards for pediatric practice.<p>

In cases involving the following kinds of medical
care for infants and young children, the Academy
encourages physicians to seek the <b>informed permission 
of the parents</b> before: 1) providing immunizations; 
2) performing invasive diagnostic testing for a
congenital cardiac defect; 3) beginning long&#173;term anticonvulsant 
therapy to control a seizure disorder; 4)
initiating serial casting to correct congenital ``clubfoot''; 
or 5) undertaking surgical removal of a ``suspicious'' 
neck mass.<p>

Even in pressing situations, informed permission
should be sought for actions such as performing a
lumbar puncture to evaluate the possibility of meningitis. 
(In this situation, if parents deny permission
for the procedure, one should obtain permission
from the parents to initiate treatment based on reasonable 
clinical judgment, rather than delaying care
or risking liability for performing the lumbar puncture 
without appropriate authorization).<p>

In cases involving the following kinds of medical
care for older school&#173;age children, the Academy encourages 
physicians to seek the <b>assent of the patient</b>
as well as the <b>informed permission of the parents:</b> 1)
venipuncture for a diagnostic study in a nine&#173;year&#173;old; 
2) diagnostic testing for recurrent abdominal
pain in a 10&#173;year&#173;old; 3) psychotropic medication to
control an attention&#173;deficit disorder in a third grader;
4) an orthopedic device to manage scoliosis in an
11&#173;year&#173;old; 5) an ``alarm'' system to treat nocturnal
enuresis in an eight&#173;year&#173;old; or 6) surgical repair of
a malformed ear in a 12&#173;year&#173;old. In some cases,
treatment may proceed over the objection of the patient. 
However, physicians and parents should realize 
that overruling the child may undermine their
relationship(s) with the child.<p>

In situations such as the following that involve
adolescents and young adults, the Academy encourages 
physicians to obtain the <b>informed consent</b>
of the patient, in most instances: 1) performance 
of a pelvic examination in a 16&#173;year&#173;old; 2)
diagnostic evaluation of recurrent headache in an
18&#173;year&#173;old; 3) a request for oral contraceptives for
fertility control in a 17&#173;year&#173;old; 4) proposed long&#173;term 
oral antibiotics administration for severe acne
in a 15&#173;year&#173;old; or 5) surgical intervention for a
bone tumor in a 19&#173;year&#173;old. Such patients frequently
have decision&#173;making capacity and the
legal authority to accept or reject interventions,
and, in that event, no additional requirement to
obtain parental permission exists. However, the
Academy encourages parental involvement in
such cases, as appropriate.<p>

Review of the limited relevant empirical data
suggests that adolescents, especially those age 14
and older, may have as well developed decisional
skills as adults for making informed health care
decisions.[<a href="#references">20&#173;22</a>]
Ethical and legal factors, (ie, confidentiality 
and/or privacy), suggest that the physician 
involve parents after appropriate discussion
with the adolescent elicits his or her permission to
do so. In some cases in which the patient has no
legal entitlement to authorize treatment, the physician 
may have a legal obligation in some jurisdictions 
to obtain <b>parental permission</b> or to notify
parents in addition to obtaining the patient's consent. 
An adolescent's refusal of consent in cases
such as these may well be legally (and ethically)
binding. If ``conflict resolution'' fails, formal, legal
adjudication may be needed.<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center><p>

A re&#173;analysis of informed consent leads to the
identification of important limitations and problems
in its application to pediatric practice. Two additional 
concepts are needed: <b>parental permission</b> and
<b>patient assent.</b> The American Academy of Pediatrics
believes that in most cases, physicians have an ethical 
(and legal) obligation to obtain <b>parental permission</b>
to undertake recommended medical interventions. 
In many circumstances, physicians should also
solicit a <b>patient assent</b> when developmentally appropriate. 
In cases involving emancipated or mature
minors with adequate decision&#173;making capacity, or
when otherwise permitted by law, physicians should
seek <b>informed consent</b> directly from patients.<p>
