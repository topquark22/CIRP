      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: Jewish teaching allows parents to
      be exempt from the duty of ritual circumcision of the fourth
      son born after three previous sons have died from
      circumcision. The source of that authority is presented here
      in an extract from the Talmud.]</p>

      <p><b>Shabbat 134A: p. 47.</b><br />
      V.1 J. And said Abbayye, "mother told me, 'If an infant is
      too red, so the blood is not yet absorbed in him, we wait
      until the blood is absorbed, then we circumcised him. If he
      is green so he is deficient in blood, we wait until he is
      full blooded and then circumcise him.'"</p>

      <p>K. For it has been taught on Tannaite authority:</p>

      <p>L. Said R. Nathan, "I once went to the coastal towns, and
      a woman came before me, who had circumcised her first son and
      he died, so, too, the second and the third. They brought him
      before me, and I saw that he was ruddy. I said to her, 'Wait
      for him until the blood is absorbed.' So she waited until the
      blood was absorbed and then circumcised him and he survived,
      and they called him 'Nathan the Babylonian' in my honor."</p>

      <p>M. "There was another time that I went to Cappadocia, and
      a woman came before me, who had circumcised her first son and
      he died, so, too, the second and the third. They brought him
      before me, and I saw that green. I examined him, and I didn't
      see enough blood for circumcision, and I said to her, 'Wait
      for him until he gets his full blood. So she waited until the
      blood was absorbed and then circumcised him and he survived,
      and they called him 'Nathan the Babylonian' in my honor" [T.
      Shab. 15:8E].</p>

      <p><b>Yebamot 64B: p. 150.</b><br />
      III.3. G. "If a woman was married to a first husband who
      died, to a second who died, to a third she should not be
      wed," the words of Rabbi.</p>

      <p>H. Raban Simeon b. Gamaliel says, "To a third she may be
      married, but to a fourth she should not be married. [If she
      produces males and they were circumcised and died, if the
      first was circumcised and died, the second and he died, the
      third may be circumcised, but the fourth should not be
      circumcised]" [T. Shab. 15:8A-C].</p>
