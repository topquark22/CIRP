            <p class="text1">As a pro-life Roman Catholic mother
            and grandmother, and an advocate for children who
            cannot speak for themselves, I am writing to bring to
            your attention a moral law violation that occurs every
            day in the United States at Catholic hospitals - the
            elective circumcisions of baby boys. Catholic hospitals
            in the U.S. follow the moral law by not allowing
            abortions, sterilizations, and genital mutilations of
            females, but they violate the moral law by allowing
            non-therapeutic, elective circumcisions of male infants
            at their facilities. This occurs mainly in U.S.
            hospitals but not in hospitals in most other countries
            where the rights of male children are respected.</p>

            <p class="text2">The <i>Catechism of the Catholic
            Church</i>, under "<a
            href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a5.htm#II"
            target="_blank">Respect for bodily integrity</a>" (The
            Vatican, 1994, #2297) states, "Except when performed
            for strictly therapeutic medical reasons, directly
            intended amputations, mutilations, and sterilizations
            are against the moral law." Elective circumcision
            (i.e., healthy foreskin amputation) fits the definition
            of amputation, which means to cut off. (In 1999, the
            American Academy of Pediatrics described circumcision
            as "amputation of the foreskin." In 2000, the American
            Medical Association described elective circumcisions as
            "non-therapeutic.") It is done usually for social and
            cultural reasons, not medical ones! (Much as most
            abortions today are done for social reasons, not
            medical ones!) Catholic hospitals don't use the line
            that parents have the right to make a choice for
            abortion, and that the hospital should remain neutral.
            Neither should Catholic hospitals or Catholic
            physicians working at Catholic or secular facilities
            use the parental choice line for circumcision, which
            ignores the baby's choice and his right to his own
            bodily integrity.</p>

            <p class="text2">The <a
            href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/bishops/directives.htm"
            target="_blank"><i>Ethical and Religious Directives for
            Catholic Health Care Services</i></a> (ERD), Fourth
            Edition, (June 15, 2001) supports respect for bodily
            integrity. Catholic hospitals that allow elective
            non-therapeutic circumcisions of infants violate these
            directives. Part III, Directive 29 reiterates what the
            Catechism teaches under "Respect for Bodily Integrity"
            when it states, "All persons served by Catholic health
            have the right and duty to protect and preserve their
            bodily and functional integrity." The 1971 ERD and the
            1977 ERD likewise support respect for bodily integrity.
            The 1977 ERD, Directive 33 states, "Unnecessary
            procedures, whether diagnostic or therapeutic, are
            morally objectionable. A procedure is unnecessary when
            no proportionate purpose justifies it." The Church
            recognizes the right of a healthy person to donate a
            heathy kidney as an act of charity, but no donation is
            involved in the forcible amputation of the foreskin of
            an infant, since an infant is incapable of giving
            consent to the amputation of any of his healhy body
            parts until he reaches the age of majority. The
            foreskin belongs to the infant, not to the parents or
            the physician, since it is part of his body and not
            theirs. Companies that buy and use amputated foreskins
            of infants for research in developing other products
            likewise violate the moral law.</p>

            <p class="text2">The healthy foreskin, like other
            healthy body parts, serves a protective and sexual
            function throughout life, and its removal violates the
            bodily and functional integrity and human dignity of
            the human person. Circumcision is both an amputation
            and a mutilation. The <i>American Heritage
            Dictionary</i> defines "mutilate" thus: 1. To cut off
            or destroy a limb or other essential part. 2. To render
            imperfect by excising or radically altering a part."
            The foreskin is a protective and sexual organ. It
            covers and protects the sterile urinary tract
            environment, contains tens of thousands of specialized
            nerve endings, and provides the sliding and gliding
            mechanism that allows for non-abrasive, lubricating
            normal sexual intercourse for both male and female.
            Many men do feel they were violated and mutilated as a
            result of elective circumcision, and some have
            undergone surgical and non-surgical methods of foreskin
            restoration to try to restore some of their lost
            functional integrity. Like some women who undergo
            breast reconstruction after mastectomies to feel whole
            again, these men also want to feel whole again.</p>

            <p class="text2">No national medical group in the world
            today recommends infant circumcision, including the <a

            target="_blank">Royal Australasian College of
            Physicians</a>.</p>

            <p class="text2">The American Academy of Pediatrics'
            Committee on Bioethics stated in February of 1995 that
            pediatric health care providers "have legal and ethical
            duties to their child patients to render competent
            medical care based on what the patient needs, not what
            someone else expresses&hellip;. The pediatrician's
            responsibilities to his or her patient exist
            independent of parental desires or proxy consent."
            Physicians who perform medically unnecessary
            circumcisions on infants, thereby exposing them to the
            risks and damages of the surgery (which can be serious
            and even deadly), are not basing their care on what the
            child needs but on parental social desires. This is not
            good medicine, and it does not follow the dictum to
            "First, do no harm."</p>

            <p class="text2">Social reasons for circumcision
            typically include a circumcised father wanting his son
            to "match" him or "match" his circumcised brothers (as
            opposed to the baby "matching" himself), or parents
            wanting their son to "look like" (lack like?) other
            circumcised boys. These are not "strictly therapeutic
            medical reasons." (Religious, ritual circumcisions
            among Jews and Muslims typically take place after a
            baby has been discharged from the hospital and are not
            done for "strictly therapeutic reasons," but they don't
            claim to be.) By contrast, a "strictly therapeutic
            medical" circumcision is one done to treat a disease,
            defect, or pathology that is present. A circumcision
            done in hopes of possibly preventing a future problem
            is one done for "alleged prophylactic reasons," not
            "strictly therapeutic reasons." Thus, nearly every
            elective infant circumcision performed at a Catholic
            hospital today fails to qualify as being performed for
            the reasons spelled out in the Catholic Catechism.</p>

            <p class="text2">During the time of Christ, only the
            tip of the foreskin was removed during a ritual
            circumcision, not the whole foreskin as is done today
            by physicians and mohels. One writer made the following
            comparison, noting that Christ's circumcision was the
            first time His innocent blood was shed, and Christ's
            crucifixion was the last time His innocent blood was
            shed. Except for our first pope, Peter, who was Jewish,
            it is probably safe to say that most of our popes
            (including the present one) were left intact, i.e.,
            <i>NOT</i> circumcised.</p>

            <p class="text2">Christians have no religious
            obligations to circumcise their children. My Catholic
            Bible states that circumcision is unnecessary now, and
            it refers readers to Acts 15: 1-12, Galatians 2: 3-10.,
            and Galatians 5: 2-6. In Acts 15: 10, St. Paul told the
            Jews who had become Christians and who were now
            pressing for circumcision of the Gentiles, "And now are
            going to correct God by burdening the Gentiles with a
            yoke that neither we nor our fathers were able to
            bear?" <span class="cirp">[CIRP Note: St. Peter made
            the quoted statement, not St. Paul.]</span> At the time
            of the Council of Florence (1438-1445), Pope Eugenius
            IV issued a Papal Bull which states in part, "Therefore
            it strictly orders all who glory in the name of
            Christian, not to practice circumcision either before
            or after baptism, since whether or not they place their
            hope in it, it cannot possibly be observed without loss
            of eternal salvation." Fr. Jules Paquin, S.J.
            (<i>Morale et medecine</i>: Comite des Hopitaux du
            Quebec, 1957, p. 246) and Fr. Edwin F. Healy, S.J.
            (<i>Medical Ethics</i>, Loyola University Press,
            Chicago, 1956, p. 128) both wrote that since routine
            circumcisions are not medically defensible, they are
            morally objectionable.</p>

            <p class="text2">Children of both sexes deserve to be
            loved and accepted the way God has created them,
            whether they are infants born in American hospitals, or
            children in Africa who are endangered by the custom of
            circumcision, excision, or infibulation. Europeans, who
            don't routinely circumcise male infants, look aghast at
            those who practice elective infant circumcision, and
            rightly so. The genital mutilation and sexual abuse of
            children of both sexes must stop, and must no longer
            occur in Catholic hospitals. This issue must not be
            swept under the rug as was the issue of sexual abuse
            within the Catholic Church for so many years. God does
            not make a mistake every time he creates a baby boy in
            the United States or a child in Africa, one that
            doctors and parents need to correct. The foreskin
            serves a purpose on the body, protecting the glans
            during infancy, and later serving a sexual function for
            both males and females. Worldwide, 85% of males are NOT
            circumcised.</p>

            <p class="text2">For further information, see these
            articles in the <i>British Journal of Urology</i>,

            <p class="text2">U.S. Catholic hospitals send a mixed
            message to parents by allowing medically unnecessary,
            harmful circumcisions to continue, thus appearing to
            give tacit approval and legitimacy to a non-therapeutic
            procedure that clearly violates the moral law as
            expressed in the Catholic Catechism. Catholic hospitals
            that ask parents of male newborns if they want their
            children circumcised (Usually after providing
            incomplete information about the risks of circumcision
            and the benefits of non-circumcision) are soliciting
            for medically unnecessary surgery.</p>

            <p class="text2">Jesus brought a New Covenant of Love,
            one of loving your neighbor as yourself. Loving a child
            does not mean strapping him to a board and then
            painfully cutting off a healthy part of his body
            (usually without anesthesia) for social or cultural
            reasons. That is a most violent way to "welcome" a
            child into this world. It is time for our Catholic
            hospitals to stop elective circumcisions on their
            premises, even if it means a loss of income, because it
            is the right thing to do!</p>

            <p class="text2">Lawsuits have been brought after the
            deaths and mutilations of infants from elective
            circumcision. In 1966, an infant at <a
            href="http://www.sbgh.mb.ca/" target="_blank">St.
            Boniface Hospital</a> in Winnipeg, Canada, a Catholic
            hospital, was so severely mutilated by an unnecessary
            circumcision that he underwent a "sex change." In his
            teens, this child discovered that God had created him
            male, and he has since undergone numerous operations to
            change his appearance back to that of a male. The book,
            <i>As Nature Made Him - The Boy Who Was Raised as a
            Girl</i>, by John Colapinto, tells this sad story. At
            <a href="http://www.providence.org/alaska/default.htm"
            target="_blank">Providence Hospital</a> in Anchorage,
            Alaska, a Catholic hospital, a settlement was reached
            after an elective circumcision in January of 1986 left
            newborn Jacob Sweet severely brain damaged, paralyzed,
            and blind. Presently, a lawsuit by William Stowell has
            been brought against <a
            href="http://www.webspan.net/~goodsam/index.html"
            target="_blank">Good Samaritan Hospital</a>, a Catholic
            hospital in West Islip, New York. Mr. Stowell was
            subjected to a medically unnecessary circumcision there
            as an infant nineteen years ago, and he is now suing
            the hospital and doctor for battery, and for violating
            his rights to his own bodily integrity. If Mr. Stowell
            wins his case, his lawyer plans to bringa class-action
            suit against the hospital on behalf of all the males
            who were circumcised there unnecessarily, and against
            their will. Any hospital, Catholic or secular, could
            also become a defendant in such a lawsuit if it
            continues to permit the unnecessary amputations of
            healthy foreskins from male infants.</p>

            <p class="text2">Pope John Paul II, in "<a

            included mutilation. He said, "The Second Vatican
            Council, in a passage which retains all of its
            relevance today, forcefully condemned a number of
            crimes and attacks against human life. Thirty years
            later, taking up the words of the Council and with the
            same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation in the
            name of the whole Church, certain that I am
            interpreting the genuine sentiment of every upright
            conscience: Whatever is opposed to life itself, such as
            any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, or
            willful self-distruction, whatever violates the
            integrity of the human person, such as mutilation,
            torments inflicted on body or mind, attempts to coerce
            the will itself; whatever insults human dignity, such
            as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment,
            deportation, slavery, prostitution, the selling of
            women and children; as well as disgraceful working
            conditions, where people are treated as mere
            instruments of gain rather than as free and responsible
            persons; all these things and others like them are
            infamies indeed. They poison human society, and they do
            more harm to those who practice them than to those who
            suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are a supreme
            dishonor to the Creator."</p>

            <p class="text2">Catholic physicians who perform
            non-therapeutic circumcisions on non-consenting infants
            need to ask themselves why they are violating the
            integrity of these infants, tormenting their bodies,
            insulting their human dignity, and using these children
            as instruments of financial gain. (Dr. Thomas Wiswell,
            not a Catholic but an ardent proponent of infant
            circumcision, was quoted in <i>The Boston Globe</i> on
            June 22, 1987 as saying, "I have some good friends who
            are obstetricians outside the military, and they look
            at a foreskin and almost see a $125 price tag on it.
            Each one is that much money. Heck, if you do 10 a week,
            that's over $1,000 a week, and they don't take that
            much time.") Physicians who perform medically
            unnecessary circumcisions harm themselves as they
            inflict unnecessary suffering on innocent children.
            What a dishonor to our Creator for any physician to
            think that he or she can create a better baby than our
            Lord can!</p>

            <p class="text2">What will Catholic physicians do to
            see that non-therapeutic circumcisions of male infants
            are no longer allowed at Catholic hospitals in the
            United States? What will the Catholic Medical
            Association do to ensure that Catholic hospitals live
            up to the teaching expressed in the Catholic Catechism,
            and that the right of male infants to their own bodily
            integrity is respected within the confines of Catholic
            hospitals? As a practicing Roman Catholic, I feel
            obligated to write to you about this serious issue that
            impacts the welfare of children. I thank you for your
            attention to this issue, and I look forward to your
            response.</p>
