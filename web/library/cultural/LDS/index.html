      Darillyn Starr. It contains the scripture of the Church of
      Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints concerning circumcision.

      <p>In <b>Moroni 8:8</b>, in the <b>Book of Mormon</b>,
      Christ, following his death and resurrection, is speaking to
      the peoples of the western hemisphere, known as the Nephites
      and Lamanites.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord,
          and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call
          the righteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need
          no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little
          children are whole, for they are not capable of
          committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from
          them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law
          of circumcision is done away in me."

      <p><b>Doctrine and Covenants Section 74</b>, is a revelation
      received by the prophet Joseph Smith, as an explanation of 1
      Corinthians 7:14.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="doctrine">
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="D">1 &nbsp;"For the unbelieving husband is
          sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is
          sanctified by the husband; else were your children
          unclean, but now they are holy.</p>

          <p class="D">2 &nbsp;Now, in the days of the apostles the
          law of circumcision was had among all the Jews who
          believed not the gospel of Christ.</p>

          <p class="D">3 &nbsp;And it came to pass that there arose
          a great contention among the people concerning the law of
          circumcision, for the unbelieving husband was desirous
          that his children should be circumcised and become
          subject to the law of Moses, which law was fulfilled.</p>

          <p class="D">4 &nbsp;And it came to pass that the
          children, being brought up in subjection to the law of
          moses, gave heed to the traditions of their fathers and
          believed not the gospel of Christ, wherein they became
          unholy.</p>

          <p class="D">5 &nbsp;Wherefore, for this cause the
          apostle wrote unto the church, giving unto them a
          commandment, not of the Lord, but of himself, that a
          believer should not be united to an unbeliever; except
          the law of Moses should be done away among them.</p>

          <p class="D">6 &nbsp;That their children might remain
          without circumcision; and that the tradition might be
          done away, which saith that little children are unholy;
          for it was had among the Jews;</p>

          <p class="D">7 &nbsp;But little children are holy, being
          sanctified through the atonement of Jesus Christ; and
          this is what the scriptures mean."</p>
