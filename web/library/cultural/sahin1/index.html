      <h2>Attitudes and practices regarding circumcision in
      Turkey</h2>

      <p><b>F. Sahin, U. Beyazova and A. Akturk</b></p>

      <p>Department of Pediatric Surgery, <a
      href="http://www.dicle.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Dicle
      University</a> Medical School, Diyarbakir, Turkey</p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p>Background: In Turkey, circumcision is a necessity for
      boys to gain a masculine identity. In contrast to Western
      societies, where circumcision is performed in the neonatal
      period, it is performed at older ages in our population, and
      the timing may affect the psychosocial well-being of males.
      The person who performs the operation, a physician or a
      traditional circumciser, may affect their health as well.</p>

      <p>Objective: To provide some information about the practice
      of circumcision in Turkey, such as timing, by whom and why it
      is performed in our country, and relation of their fathers'
      past emotions about their own circumcision to this current
      practice.</p>

      <p>Methods: Questionnaires were filled out in face-to-face
      interviews with parents of 1235 male children under 16 years
      of age who attended well-child clinics of Gazi University
      Hospital and 10 different primary health care centres
      throughout Ankara, Turkey.</p>

      <p>Results: Median age of circumcision was found to be 6
      years. Only 14.8% of children were circumcised before 1 year
      of age. The main reasons for circumcision were religious and
      traditional. The medical benefits of the procedure outweighed
      the traditional reasons for only 15.2% of the families. The
      operation was carried out by a traditional circumciser in
      13.3% of the children. Most of the fathers who could remember
      their own <a href="/library/psych/cansever/">emotions about
      circumcision</a> confessed that they had been frightened.
      They remembered the procedure as painful. Indeed, the mean
      age of their sons' circumcision was close to their own
      circumcision age.</p>

      <p>Conclusions: Traditions still play an important role in
      the timing of circumcision and by whom and why it is
      performed in Turkey. Changing times and educational levels do
      not seem to affect the traditional approach to
      circumcision.</p>
