    "For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers
and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.
They must be silenced because they are ruining whole
households by teaching things they ought not to teach - and
that for the sake of dishonest gain. . . . Therefore rebuke
them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith and
will to pay no attention to Jewish myths or those who reject
the truth."

                                   -Titus 1:10-11,13-14
