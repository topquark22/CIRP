      <h2><i>Respect for Bodily Integrity: A Catholic Perspective
      on Circumcision in Catholic Hospitals</i></h2>

      <h5>Petrina Fadel, New York State Right to Life Committee,
      Inc.</h5>
      <hr size="4" color="black" />

      <p class="text1">Slosar and O'Brien (2003) seek guidance on
      the ethics of elective infant circumcisions at Catholic
      hospitals from Michael Benatar and David Benatar, two
      non-Catholics, instead of from the Catholic Catechism
      teaching on "Respect for bodily integrity" and the New
      Testament. They would do well to read the writings of two
      Jesuit priests, Fr. Paquin, S.J. (1957), and Fr. Healey, S.J.
      (1956), who independently found that because routine
      circumcisions are not medically defensible, they are morally
      objectionable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Slosar and O'Brien claim that No. 2297 of
      the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> (1994) applies
      only "within the context of kidnapping, hostage-taking, and
      torture," even though the concluding sentence speaks of
      respect for bodily integrity within a medical context. They
      mistakenly equate the terms <i>therapeutic</i> and
      <i>prophylactic</i> (preventative). Finally, they rely on an
      outmoded position statement of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision (1989), one that has
      been replaced by a newer statement (American Academy of
      Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision 1999).</p>

      <p class="text2">No. 2297 of the Catechism, "Respect for
      bodily integrity," states in part: "Except when performed for
      strictly therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended
      <i>amputations</i>, <i>mutilations</i>, and
      <i>sterilizations</i> performed on innocent persons are
      against the moral law." The <i>American Heritage
      Dictionary</i> defines <i>amputate</i> as "To cut off (a part
      of the body), esp. by surgery," and it defines therapeutic as
      "Having healing or curative powers." In 1999 the American
      Academy of Pediatrics described circumcision as "amputation
      of the foreskin," and the American Medical Association called
      elective circumcision "non-therapeutic" (Council on
      Scientific Affairs 1999). Elective circumcisions are directly
      intended, nontherapeutic amputations of healthy foreskins. As
      such, they <i>do</i> violate the moral law.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are no medical indications for
      circumcision in the newborn period (Committee on Fetus and
      Newborn 1971; 1977; Fetus and Newborn Committee 1975). In
      1999 the American Academy of Pediatrics, after studying
      nearly 40 years of research, concluded "these data are not
      sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision." No
      national medical group in the world today recommends infant
      circumcision. Although Slosar and O'Brien claim a health
      benefit, Medicaid programs in 11 states (five within the past
      year, including Missouri, home of Ascension Health) have
      dropped funding of nontherapeutic circumcisions. The Birthing
      and Care Program of the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington,
      D.C., likewise does not cover circumcisions.</p>

      <p class="text2">Slosar and O'Brien defend circumcision by
      citing Directive 33 of the <i>Ethical and Religious
      Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (ERD;</i>
      Conference of Catholic Bishops 2001), which discusses only
      "therapeutic procedures," not "non-therapeutic procedures"
      such as elective infant circumcision. Directive 29 supports
      respect for bodily integrity, stating that "All persons
      served by Catholic health care have the right and duty to
      protect and preserve their bodily and functional integrity."
      The 1977 ERD, Directive 33, states that "unnecessary
      procedures, whether diagnostic or therapeutic, are morally
      objectionable.</p>

      <p class="text2">A procedure is unnecessary when no
      proportionate reason justifies it." The chair of Applied
      Health Care Ethics in Oregon, who is also a Catholic priest,
      wrote that he doubted any proportionate reason justified the
      circumcision of male infants, but he was sure he had heard
      many attempts. Slosar and O'Brien's commentary is one such
      attempt. Male neonatal circumcision has no proven medical
      utility and cannot support the use of "proportionate reason"
      to override the child's right to bodily integrity and the
      hospital's duty to protect that right.</p>

      <p class="text2">The primary reason American parents choose
      circumcision is to make the baby "look like" the circumcised
      father (Brown 1987). This egocentric reason clearly does not
      take into account "the best interests of the child" or the
      numerous risks of the surgery. Catholic hospitals don't
      accept the parental-choice line for abortions. Neither should
      they promote this line for nontherapeutic circumcisions.
      Hospitals and physicians profit from circumcisions (Mansfield
      1995). The June 22, 1987 <i>Boston Globe</i> quoted Thomas
      Wiswell, M.D., as saying:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          I have some good friends who are obstetricians outside
          the military, and they look at a foreskin and almost see
          a $125 price tag on it. Each one is that much money.
          Heck, if you do 10 a week, that's over $1,000 a week, and
          they don't take that much time. (Lehman 1987)
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Profit should never dictate morality, but in
      the case of nontherapeutic circumcision it does. In 1999 the
      American Academy of Pediatrics found that neonatal
      circumcisions in the United States added between $150 and
      $270 million annually to healthcare costs.</p>

      <p class="text2">A Catholic mother from Indiana told me of
      her experience giving birth in a Catholic hospital. Three
      times doctors and nurses at the hospital solicited her to
      circumcise her son, even though she told them the first time
      that her decision was no. Solicitation and coercion for this
      unnecessary surgery is unethical, sexist, and must stop.</p>

      <p class="text2">A man born and circumcised at a Catholic
      hospital described to me his feelings this way:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          I am a man who has lived all of his life with the results
          of a circumcision done at birth. There does not a day go
          by that I don't feel a deep sense of loss and
          disfigurement as a result of this loss of the most
          sensitive tissue on my body. How can anyone deny the
          feelings of millions of men like me who were denied the
          right to a natural and normal sexuality for their entire
          life? I will never have any idea what has been taken from
          me, but I do know that I was damaged for life physically,
          sexually, emotionally, and spiritually by the horrible
          "nonsense" committed by a medical doctor who needed some
          quick and easy money for his Cadillac payment and didn't
          care about the damage done to me. I was born in a
          Catholic hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, in December
          of 1940, and I learned about sexual abuse by Catholic
          institutions as soon as I was born. Sex and violence met
          for the first time in my life in the few hours after
          birth in a Catholic hospital.
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Slosar and O'Brien claim they "are unaware
      of the Catholic Church explicitly addressing the practice of
      circumcising male infants in any of its official teachings."
      In Acts 15:10, St. Peter, the first pope, told the Jewish
      Christians who were advocating circumcision of the Gentiles,
      "And now are you going to correct God by burdening the
      Gentiles with a yoke that neither we nor our fathers were
      able to bear?" (<i>The Way</i> 1979). Circumcision during
      Peter's century typically involved removing only the tip of
      the foreskin, not the complete foreskin as is done today
      (Ritter 2002).</p>

      <p class="text2">The Church spoke forcefully about
      circumcision at the Council of Florence (1438-1445). Pope
      Eugene IV (1442) issued a Papal Bull which states in
      part,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Therefore it strictly orders all who glory in the name of
          Christian, not to practise circumcision either before or
          after baptism, since whether or not they place their hope
          in it, it cannot possibly be observed without loss of
          eternal salvation.
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians
      12:18) reiterates God's genius as man's Creator. "But that
      isn't the way God has made us. He has made many parts for our
      bodies and has put each part just where he wants it" (<i>The
      Way</i> 1979).</p>

      <p class="text2">In Matthew 11:25 Jesus prayed, "O Father,
      Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding the truth from
      those who think themselves so wise, and for revealing it to
      little children" (<i>The Way</i> 1979). Slosar, O'Brien, and
      the Benatars might consider themselves wise about
      circumcision, but little children strapped to a
      Circumstraint&trade; and undergoing the procedure know
      otherwise.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nothing in Catholic doctrine requires
      Catholic hospitals to provide nontherapeutic infant
      circumcisions. To the contrary, the <i>Catechism</i> teaches
      that nontherapeutic amputations violate the moral law. An
      infant's foreskin belongs first and foremost to the
      infant-not to his parents, not to the hospital, not to the
      physician, and not to companies that want amputated foreskins
      to develop other products. Companies that do this are
      reminiscent of the Nazis who used the skins of murdered Jews
      to make lampshades. The <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i>
      (1982) defines <i>mutilate</i> as: "1. To cut off or destroy
      a limb or essential part. 2. to render imperfect by excising
      or radically altering a part." The foreskin is a protective
      and sexual organ that covers and protects the sterile urinary
      tract environment; contains tens of thousands of specialized,
      erogenous nerve endings; and provides the sliding and gliding
      mechanism that allows for nonabrasive, lubricating, normal
      sexual intercourse for both the male and female. All that is
      lost with circumcision. In addition, circumcision has been
      shown to cause erectile dysfunction (Coursey 1991; Fink
      2002).</p>

      <p class="text2">Pope John Paul II, in "The Gospel of Life"
      (1995), no. 3, wrote about "New threats to human life." He
      included mutilation among the threats by repeating the words
      of the Second Vatican Council:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of
          murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, or willful
          self-destruction, whatever violates the integrity of the
          human person, such as mutilation, torments inflicted on
          body or mind, attempts to coerce the will itself;
          whatever insults human dignity, such as subhuman living
          conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, slavery,
          prostitution, the selling of women and children; as well
          as disgraceful working conditions, where people are
          treated as mere instruments of gain rather than as free
          and responsible persons; all these things and others like
          them are infamies indeed. They poison human society, and
          they do more harm to those who practice them than to
          those who suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are a
          supreme dishonor to the Creator.
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Hospitals and physicians who perform
      nontherapeutic circumcisions on nonconsenting infants must
      stop violating the integrity of those infants, stop
      tormenting their bodies, stop insulting their human dignity,
      and stop using them as instruments of financial gain. The
      time is long overdue for all hospitals to take the only
      morally acceptable action and stop this practice.</p>
