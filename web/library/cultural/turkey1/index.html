      <h3>CIRCUMCISION PHENOMENON IN TURKEY AS A TRADITIONAL
      COUNTRY: FROM PAST TO PRESENT</h3>

      <p>It is a reality that one sixth of the world is
      circumcised, and circumcision is widely practiced in all
      Islamic countries, so also in Turkey. Circumcision is
      believed to be one of the features of a `heliolithic' culture
      about 15,000 years ago and has spread over much of the world.
      People speculate that it might have originated independently
      within several cultures depending on evidence that
      inhabitants of the new world and Australian aborigines were
      circumcised when these continents were discovered (<a
      href="#n1">1-2</a>). The observation of 6,000 years old
      circumcised mummies point to the fact that this may be one of
      the oldest surgical procedure (<a href="#n2">2</a>).</p>

      <p>Although female circumcision has never been performed
      among Turkish tribes, male circumcision is generally
      performed in Turkey (prevalence @ 99%) at any time between
      the period of birth and marriage, generally before the school
      age according to the Islamic and traditional points of view
      (<a href="#n3">3</a>). Although festivities surrounding
      circumcision are not a strict traditional rule, most of the
      Turkish families are sympathetic towards this custom. These
      festivities may vary according to the region and the age of
      the young man to be circumcised.</p>

      <p><b>Circumcision Ceremonies at the Ottoman Palace</b><br />
       These fantastic ceremonies, described in detail by Nil Sari
      <i>et al.</i>, performed from the 16 through the 18 century,
      reflected the importance of the circumcision celebrations
      organized by the ruling class of the empire (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>). The most popular locations for these
      festivities such as the Topkapi Palace, the Sultanahmed
      Square and the Golden Horn, were replaced by the Dolmabahce
      Palace after the middle of 19th century (fig.1).</p>

      <p><em>Figure 1: A scene from Bosphorus a hundred years ago
      and Dolmabahce, the last Ottoman Palace, at the back side in
      which there is a special room for the circumcised prince,
      nowadays on display in the Harem region.</em></p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
       

      <p>Celebrations for the circumcision ritual of a Prince
      generally lasted 10-15 days and in some exceptional cases,
      might even last up to 50-55 days. As part of the celebration,
      besides carrying out the princes' circumcision, surgeons also
      performed circumcisions of 3,000 to 10,000 boys of poor
      families and gifts such as clothing, underwear, toys and gold
      coins were given to these children (<a href="#n4">4</a>).
      Although gold coins have been replaced by money in today's
      economy, surprisingly, this kind of gift tradition;
      especially the attaching of a gold coin to the dress of the
      circumcised boy by his relatives, is still continuing.</p>

      <p>Two high-ranking Ottoman officials escorted the princes to
      the special room prepared for circumcision in the Harem
      (women's part of the palace). The Dolmabahce Palace has a
      special permanent room with a lovely decorated small bed in
      the Harem region, designed for the circumcised prince for the
      postoperative period and only his mother and sisters were
      permitted to enter this floor (<a href="#n4">4</a>).</p>

      <p>Festive activities continued ceaselessly, night and the
      day, such as hunting, sporting events, illuminations,
      fireworks, dramas, songs and the feasts, but all of this was
      not only designed for the entertainment of the Sultan and
      high officials but also for the common citizens. Janissaries
      (Ottoman soldiers) played war games while fireworks masters,
      poets, and artists displayed their talents (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>). Decorated palm trees with fruits, animal
      figures, flowers, and shiny materials, resembling huge
      Christmas trees, were the symbols of the Sultan's power and
      authority in the society and some of those trees were
      recorded to be 6 m wide 15 m high (<a href="#n4">4</a>). A
      literary type called surname, which is unique among the world
      literature, was written for each of these festivities and as
      well as for weddings of the Sultan's daughters (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>). It can be said that weddings and
      circumcision ceremonies had equal importance in the social
      life of the Ottoman Palace.</p>

      <p><b>Present&hellip;</b><br />
       The industrial revolution has had a profound influence on
      people's social lives in almost every part of the world, and
      also in Turkey. However, traditional circumcision ceremonies
      still retain their importance within the community. Turkish
      families widely accept circumcision as one of the milestones
      in the lives of male children.</p>

      <p>Despite some attitude differences between generations,
      most of the people in Turkey still do not think that the
      circumcision procedure is a real surgical procedure and a
      fairly large amount of people prefer the circumcision
      procedure to be conducted outside the operation theatres and
      without doctors. This point of view originates from the
      traditional idea of most Turkish families that their son's
      circumcision procedure be carried out at their own homes with
      their family members and invited guests present and to also
      be able to conduct religious ceremonies accompanying the
      party or the feast. It is very interesting that at these
      celebrations, the child generally wears festive garments
      resembling a Sultan's or a King's dress (fig.2), and the
      guests and relatives attach gold coins, depending on their
      wealth, to his clothes. These parties also offer an
      opportunity for the family members and friends to come
      together as for wedding parties but the main aim is to make
      the celebration a success for all the children present. I
      myself attended a circumcision ceremony with a show team
      including a band of 20 janissaries in their original costumes
      and the circumcised boy and his friends seemed to be very
      happy. Municipalities organize big parties for the
      circumcision of the boys of poor families. I think all of
      these traditions are examples of traces of the Ottoman
      culture.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Unfortunately, mass circumcisions
      with traditional circumcisers that are commonly devoid of any
      medical training is still a big problem due to the fact that
      it occurs in up to 85% of cases in rural Turkey</span> (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>). <span class="yellow">Primary bleeding and
      infections are common complications with these sort of
      circumcisions and there are some reports in the literature of
      horrific complications of circumcisions such as glanular
      injury, gangrene of the penis and even amputation of the
      penis</span> (<a href="#n2">2,3</a>). Despite of this, the
      rate of parents who want to have their boys circumcised by
      doctors is still only 70%, even among the hospital staff (<a
      href="#n5">5</a>).</p>

      <p>Although circumcision is regarded as a minor surgical
      procedure, it is obvious that it sometimes results in major
      complications caused by unqualified hands. For ages, people
      in Anatolia from Ottoman to Turkey have been performing this
      ritual according to their own rules and the tradition of
      circumcision is retaining its importance in the community
      with some old traditional patterns.</p>
