Well, this isn't a religous discussion and I wouldn't want to turn it 
into one, but I do have a problem with the prevalent popular Jewish view 
of circumcision.

I am Jewish by lineage, and was raised socially Jewish, but I am intact.  
So maybe I have a unique perspective on this issue.  Nevertheless, from 
all that I have learned about Judaism, circumcision is **not** a 
sacrament (Encyclopaedia Judaica) or defining point of Judaism -- the way 
having a Jewish mother is -- but it is a cherished social practice.  
[Full quote:  "It is not a sacrament, and any child born of a Jewish 
mother is a Jew, whether circumcised or not."   CIRCUMCISION:  Laws]

Rabbi Moises Maimonides had it quite right in the 13th century when he 
argued that the point of circumcision is to damage sexual response and 
enjoyment, for both the man and his partner.  I don't have a problem with 
this -- circumcision is supposed to be a horrible thing among the Jews, a 
terrible destruction, a sacrifice to G*d of normal sexuality and function 
as a demonstration of faith.  It is our substitute for Abraham's aborted 
murder of his son Ishmael <I>[sic]</I> at G*d's command, in addition to being an 
outward sign of the covenant G*d made with Abraham.

Somewhere along the line this got awfully turned around into the present 
nonsensical feel-good view that the lucky Jews are doing a great physical 
service to their sons.  Hello??  It's supposed to tear your heart out to 
do this to your son.  We should rend our clothes over this.  I am 
disgusted when I watch the joy of the menfolk at a bris -- what pathetic 
denial.  I guess it's only human nature to search for any good in what is 
intended to be a tragedy -- albeit a tragedy to show one's love for G*d.  
But is is delusional to believe that this surgery in any way benefits the 
penis or the child, other than culturally, which is an ever-changing 
consideration.

We all know that the original circumcision commandment involved cutting 
only a small snip from the part of the infant foreskin that hangs long 
over the glans -- never tearing the foreskin from the glans.  Even Jesus 
experienced this relatively minor surgery.  It was not until 140 C.E. 
when the rabbinical council decided on its own to institute the radical 
circumcision we see today, in response to Jewish athletes trying to pass 
for intact.  This significantly increased destruction of penile tissue 
[average: 51% of total penile skin and mucosa:  Dr. John Taylor, British 
Journal of Urology (1996)] was neither called for in Genesis nor 
practiced by any Jews before this.

There exist numerous support groups for American Jews that forgo 
circumcision of their children.  Since over 60% of American Jewish boys 
are non-ritually circumcised in the hospital (and most not on the 8th 
day), the point of this part of the bris milah is being lost on them 
anyway.

Jews do not abuse their children through circumcision.  But I cannot 
accept that unnecessary surgery is somehow more physically beneficial to 
a Jewish boy than to a Gentile.  Socially?  The goal and means of that 
has gotten so distorted as to be unrecognizable.

I'm meeting increasing numbers of other intact Jews, and Jewish parents 
of intact sons.  They appear to have surrendered nothing culturally -- in 
light of the checkered history of the practice -- but have gained 
substantial physical advantage -- even Maimonides, writing 600 years ago, 
got this right.

I think it is time for Jews to own up to the fact that circumcision is 
extremely painful, destroys substantial functional tissue of the normal 
penis, and interferes with a number of natural functions.  Recent 
extensive studies on follow-up care have demonstrated the infection rates 
among circumcised infants is many times higher than among intact, which 
only figures because this is an open wound.  Also partly because of this 
wound and the natural protective function of the foreskin which is fused 
to the infant glans, these studies have demonstrated that hygiene is 
superior in the intact infant and child.  All around, nature's design 
works best.  Is this so difficult to acknowledge?

My position is that it is entirely consistent for Jews to say that yes, 
circumcision destroys natural functioning of their sons' penises.  And 
yes, the wound may have complications, sometimes severe.  But these risks 
may have to be taken out of devotion and sacrifice.  Or, if your view of 
history is such that the ritual practice of circumcision, at least the 
radical form practiced today, is questionable, then by all means make a 
decision based on the health of the child to leave him intact.
