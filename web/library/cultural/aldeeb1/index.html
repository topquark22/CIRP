      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      Article 24, paragraph 3 of the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention
      on the Rights of the Child</a>, of 20 Nov. 1989, stipulates: 

      <blockquote>
        States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate
        measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices
        prejudicial to the health of children<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup><font>.</font></font>
      </blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><font>In 1984, the President of the
      Inter-African Committee stated:</font></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <font size="2"><font>An erroneous idea of Religion has
        played a key role in maintaining the practice of excision
        and other practices which tend to relegate the woman to a
        lower status in relation to the man <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n2">2</a></sup></font>.</font></font>
      </blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><font>In April 1987, the Vice-President of
      the Inter-African Committee reiterated:</font></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <font size="2"><font>I request more aggressive tactics to
        put an end to the practice of infibulation. I call for more
        active support especially from the religious leaders of
        Islam after it has been confirmed many times that this
        practice is contrary to the precept of Islam <font
        size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n3">3</a></sup></font>.</font></font>
      </blockquote>
      <font size="2"><font>In this Committee's opinion, religion
      and Muslim religious leaders play an important role in the
      matter of female circumcision. The goal of this study is to
      define this role in male circumcision as well as in female
      circumcision. We shall on purpose avoid any use of the word
      Islam, as too abstract a notion, and we shall concentrate on
      the written sources of Muslim law and the opinions of
      contemporary Arab authors, mostly of Egyptian
      origin.</font></font>

        <h2>CHAPTER I. DEFINITIONS AND DISTINCTIONS</h2>
      </center>
      <a id="Terminology" name="Terminology"></a> 

      <h4>I. TERMINOLOGY</h4>
      The English language uses different terms to designate sexual
      mutilations. Generally, one speaks of circumcision for boys,
      and of circumcision, excision or infibulation (depending of
      the case) for girls. In this study, we shall use the terms
      male circumcision and female circumcision <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>The legal Arabic jargon uses the word <i>khitan</i> for
      male circumcision and the term <i>khafd</i> or <i>khifad</i>
      for female circumcision. But the everyday language uses the
      term khitan for both mutilations. There is also
      <i>taharah</i>, meaning purification, these mutilations being
      said to be purificatory to their victims <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p><a id="Male_and_Female" name="Male_and_Female"></a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>II. MALE AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION</h4>

      <p>Female circumcision has triggered a passionate public
      debate in the West. Many national, non governmental, and
      international organizations are showing their concern <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font>. This debate
      has found somewhat of an echo in the Arab world. The feminist
      circles demand its abolition, while at the same time, the
      Muslim religious circles try as often as they can to justify
      female circumcision, only in the form called sunnah, which is
      said to be the one conforming to the tradition of Mohammed
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font>. But the
      Arabic juridical literature shows very little interest for
      this issue <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font>. The Arabic medical profession
      does not seem to be much interested either: constituted of a
      majority of men, its responsibility is to perpetuate social
      and moral values which are predominant in its society, thus
      blindfolding its members <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Contrary to female circumcision, male circumcision does
      not really interest anyone<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font>. The debate on the topic is
      still taboo. This attitude can be observed in the previously
      mentioned article 24, paragraph 3 of the Convention on the
      Rights of the Child. In spite of a general wording, the
      preparatory studies prove that its authors had only female
      circumcision in mind and not male circumcision at all <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>The distinction made between male circumcision and female
      circumcision might be justified for medical and cultural
      reasons. According to Wedad Zenie-Ziegler, an Egyptian
      woman:</p>

      <blockquote>
        There is no similarity between male circumcision, a
        prophylactic measure recommended for boys in almost every
        society and female circumcision, the goal of which is to
        diminish, if not suppress sexual desire in women <font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>
      During the UN Seminar in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), the
      majority of participants agreed that the justifications of
      female circumcision based on cosmogony and those based on
      religion "must be assimilated to superstition and denounced
      as such" since "neither the Bible, nor the Koran recommend
      that women be excised". They recommend ensuring that, in the
      minds of people, male circumcision and female circumcision be
      dissociated, the former as a procedure for hygienic purposes,
      the latter, excision, as a serious form of assault on the
      women's physical integrity <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></font>. This reasoning is groundless
      and extremely dangerous. If female circumcision was in the
      Bible or the Koran, would it be allowed no matter what? And
      if one decided to put into practice everything that is said
      in the Bible and the Koran, starting with the law of
      retaliation?! 

      <p>Another opinion came from Ghita El-Khayat-Bennai, a
      Moroccan woman:</p>

      <p>Women are not alone in being subjected to sexual
      mutilations. Every Jew all over the world for example is
      circumcised on the 7th day without much concern on the part
      of his parents. They keep circumcising their male offspring,
      even knowing this to be an extremely traumatic event,
      preferring to subject the little boy to pain rather than face
      their own fear and cultural taboos as adults <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font>.
      Genevi&euml;ve Guidicelli-Delage writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        No doubt the consequences are of lesser importance in male
        circumcision than they are in female excision (although
        some practices of minimal excision could be seen as
        identical to male circumcision). But nevertheless, to take
        a position in view of consequences alone would be a
        mistake. Custom justifies the most serious actions, even
        death: the essential here is not action, but culture. If a
        family from Mali may in France have a son circumcised, but
        may not have a daughter excised, it is because male
        circumcision belongs to a cultural order which is more or
        less ours, male circumcision belongs to this
        Judeo-Christian ideology which is the melting pot of our
        culture and this ideology does not know excision and never
        did<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>For Doctor Gerard Zwang, the reason for making a
      distinction between the two types of circumcision is simple:
      most sexologists and most men in charge of information about
      it are circumcised [Jews]. They oppose any debate on the
      subject of male circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Juridical logic cannot acknowledge the distinction between
      male and female circumcision, both being the mutilation of
      healthy organs and consequently damaging the physical
      integrity of the child, whatever the religious motivations
      lying underneath<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p><a id="Practice" name="Practice"></a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>III. PRACTICE OF MALE AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION</h4>

      <p>Male circumcision is practiced by all Muslims and Jews and
      also by some Christians, as is the case for Christians in
      Egypt. It is also practiced by animist tribes in Africa.</p>

      <p>As for female circumcision, it is neither practiced by all
      Muslims, nor by all Arabs. In fact, many if not most of the
      Maghreb countries as well as Turkey and Iran ignore this
      custom <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font>. On the other hand, one can
      find it among the Egyptian Christians<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> and the Ethiopian Jews
      (Falachas) <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> who in all probability keep
      practicing it in Israel today, as do Africans living in
      France. Sudan (98%), Somalia (98%) and Egypt (75%) are among
      the largest Arabic countries practicing it. In Egypt, 97.5%
      of uneducated families impose circumcision upon their
      daughters compared to 66.2% of educated families <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></font>. Other
      Arabic countries practice it too: Yemen, the United Emirates,
      Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, some areas of Saudi Arabia, Mauritania.
      It appears to be done also in some Muslim countries of Asia
      such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and India under the
      name of sunnah circumcision, here with a reference to
      religion. But precise data on the subject are not available.
      In Africa, 28 countries appear to practice it, among them
      many animist tribes. It seems to affect about 75 million
      women <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Often, male or female circumcision is performed without
      anaesthesia in a barbaric manner, by persons without any
      medical training, such as barbers or midwives, using
      rudimentary instruments causing complications sometimes
      leading to death. We have many tragic testimonies on female
      circumcision but none on male circumcision as obviously
      nobody is interested. Still today, I can recall my youth and
      hear the screams coming from my young Muslim neighbours while
      they were being circumcised. Let us quote here the briefest
      and least shocking of the women's testimony, that of Samia, a
      Muslim girl born in a small Egyptian village close to the
      Sudanese border, who now lives in Cairo:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I was seven years old when I was excised. I recall the
        stories from women of my village who spoke of this
        operation as if their whole life had stopped there and
        then. The atrocity of their descriptions and at the same
        time a feeling of inescapable doom had triggered such a
        panic in me that when the terror-laden day came, I began to
        vomit. What happened then is still excruciatingly burning
        my flesh, so much so that I often wake up in the middle of
        the night screaming and calling for my mother <font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>
      Generally the victim is mutilated without anaesthesia, lying
      on her back, legs kept wide apart by helpers or by one only
      lying under the young girl, her ankles being hooked in the
      helper's feet. To immobilize a 7 years old, you sometimes
      need the help of 5 persons to restrain her head, arms and
      legs. When the girl is a toddler, one assistant alone can
      manage body and thighs at the same time, while holding her in
      a sitting position.<br />
      <br />
       There are many different kinds of male circumcisions: The
      circumcision per se consisting of total or partial excision
      of the foreskin; phallectomy; castration; emasculation. Only
      the first kind is of interest to us due to its frequency and
      its ritual characteristics. The other three seem to be less
      common and we do not have enough information on them <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>There are as well many different kinds of female
      circumcision:</p>

      <p>- The female circumcision called sunnah or according to
      the tradition of Mohammed. The religious circles in favour of
      this type of female circumcision do not always give details
      on what is done. According to a classical author, Al-Mawardi,
      "it is limited to cutting off the skin in the shape of a
      kernel located above the genitalia. One must cut the
      protruding epidermis without performing a complete ablation"
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></font>. For
      Doctor Hamid Al-Ghawabi, it is the ablation of the clitoris
      as well as labia minora <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></font>. According to Doctor Mahran,
      the hood of the clitoris is excised as well as the most
      important parts of the labia minora <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>- Clitoridectomy or excision. It consists of the ablation
      of the clitoris as well as labia minora. It is the operation
      of choice in Egypt.</p>

      <p>- Infibulation or pharaonic circumcision. It is practiced
      in Sudan and Somalia and involves the complete ablation of
      clitoris, labia minora and part of labia majora. The two
      sides of the vulva are then sewn together with silk or catgut
      stitches (Sudan) or with thorns (Somalia) in order to close
      the vulva, except a very small opening for the passage of
      urine and menstrual flow <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></font>. On the wedding night, the
      groom will have to open his bride, more often than not with a
      double edged dagger. In some tribes, the woman is sewn back
      each time her husband goes travelling and is opened again
      each time he comes back. In case of divorce, the woman is
      sewn up to forbid her any possibility of intercourse <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Let us mention that in the West, female circumcision and
      especially infibulation were performed in the past. One of
      those chastity belts was made by passing rings in the labia
      and vulva, wiring them shut or closing them with a lock, the
      key of which was kept by the husband especially when going
      away <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></font>.
      In Russia, the Skopotzy (circumcisers) who are Christians,
      have practiced infibulation to insure perpetual virginity:
      they call upon Matthew 19:12: "... and there be eunuchs,
      which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
      heaven's sake" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></font>. A particular type of female
      circumcision practiced by the Kikuyu tribes in Kenya is said
      to be performed today in some of the hospitals in Paris to
      accentuate the pleasure potential in some women of the upper
      class of society. The clitoris is disengaged and pulled back
      inside the vagina. Such a practice is said to add to women's
      sexual pleasure <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>I. RELIGIOUS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF CIRCUMCISION</h4>

      <h5>1. The sources of Muslim law</h5>

      <p>Muslim law has two main sources: the Koran and the Sunnah
      (tradition: words and actions) of Mohammed, to which one must
      add the igtihad, tenets of the schools of Muslim law through
      the centuries.</p>

      <p>Nowadays a specific part of igtihad is getting more and
      more important: namely the fatwas (opinions of Muslim
      religious scholars), which are often worded in a language
      accessible to the masses, defining which behaviour conforms
      to the Divine Will <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup></font>. Though juridically non
      binding, the fatwas are nonetheless morally obligatory for
      the believer and at times the first step toward the
      promulgation or the modification of laws. They are given in
      writing or orally and are often published and sold on a wide
      scale<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup></font>.
      Many pertain to male and female circumcision.</p>

      <p>We confine our study here to the works and anthologies of
      modern fatwas, mostly Egyptian ones, referring to classical
      books of Muslim law. This choice is justified by the fact
      that the public at large seldom has access to the classical
      books.</p>

      <h5>2. The Koran</h5>

      <p>The Koran mentions neither male nor female circumcision.
      An extensive interpretation of verse 2:124 shows some barely
      traceable indication of it:</p>

      <p>When Abraham was put to the test by his Lord, through
      certain commandments, he carried them out. God then said: "I
      am appointing you a guide for the people".</p>

      <p>One of the commands given to Abraham, as a test, was
      circumcision, as mentioned in some of the sayings of
      Mohammed. Abraham is a model for the Muslim faithful by
      virtue of verse 16:123:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Then we inspired you (Mohammed) to follow the religion
        (millat) of Abraham, a true believer...<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is relevant to note the rule of the Muslim law
      according to which norms that were revealed to the prophets
      prior to Mohammed are valid until unmistakably nullified.
      Thus the Bible, by a process of referral, becomes a source of
      law for the Muslims. One can read:</p>

      <blockquote>
        God told Abraham: "...Here is our alliance which shall be
        observed between me and you, i.e. thy race after thee, may
        all your males be circumcised. You shall have the flesh of
        your foreskin cut off and it shall be a sign of alliance
        between me and you...When they reach their 8th day all your
        males shall be circumcised from generation to generation...
        My alliance shall be branded in your flesh as a perpetual
        alliance. The uncircumcised, the male whose foreskin has
        not been cut off, this very life shall be cut off. He
        violated my alliance" <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n36">36</a></sup></font>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Circumcision as a sign of alliance can only be found in
      two other passages of the Bible <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup></font>. Elsewhere, it is more
      narrative: King Saul demanded one hundred Philistine
      foreskins from David, before he gave his consent to David
      marrying his daughter Mikal:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "David... thought it was a good deal in order to become the
        king's son in law... He went to war...He killed 200
        Philistine men, brought back their foreskins, counted them
        in front of the king....So Saul... had to admit that
        Jehovah was on David's side" <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n38">38</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This interpretation of the Koranic verses with reference
      to the Bible is considered abusive by Imam Mahmud Shaltut
      (israf fil-istidlal) <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup></font>. What is more, this textual
      argument based on Jewish law concerns male circumcision only,
      not female circumcision that the Bible does not mention and
      that the Jews do not practice (Falachas excepted). Al-Sukkari
      answers that, according to Ibn Hagar, the Jews used to
      circumcise both sexes, which is why he rejects male and
      female circumcision on the 7th day, so as not to look like
      them. Even the authentic Bible - today's one is considered
      falsified - does not contain any text related to female
      circumcision. Nonetheless, the Muslims must practice it, if
      the Muslim law makes provision for it <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h5>3. The Sunnah</h5>

      <p>We will try here to glean, from the works of contemporary
      Arab authors, the different sayings of Mohammed related to
      male and female circumcision.</p>

      <p>- The most often mentioned narration reports a debate
      between Mohammed and Um Habibah (or Um 'Atiyyah). This woman,
      known as an exciser of female slaves, was one of a group of
      women who had immigrated with Mohammed. Having seen her,
      Mohammed asked her if she kept practicing her profession. She
      answered affirmatively adding: "unless it is forbidden and
      you order me to stop doing it". Mohammed replied: "Yes, it is
      allowed. Come closer so I can teach you: if you cut, do not
      overdo it (la tanhaki), because it brings more radiance to
      the face (ashraq) and it is more pleasant (ahza) for the
      husband". According to others, he said: "Cut slightly and do
      not overdo it (ashimmi wa-la tanhaki), because it is more
      pleasant (ahza) for the woman and better (ahab, from other
      sources abha) for the husband". We shall hereinafter refer to
      this narration as the exciser's narration.</p>

      <p>- Mohammed said: "Circumcision is a sunnah for the men and
      makrumah for the women". The term sunnah here means that it
      is conform to the tradition of Mohammed himself, or simply a
      custom at the time of Mohammed. The term makrumah is far from
      clear but we can translate it into a honorable deed.</p>

      <p>- Speaking to the Ansars' wives, Mohammed said: "Cut
      slightly without exaggeration (ikhtafidna wa-la tanhikna),
      because it is more pleasant (ahza) for your husbands".</p>

      <p>- Someone came to Mohammed and became a convert before
      him. Mohammed told him: "Shave off your unbeliever's hair and
      be circumcised".</p>

      <p>- Mohammed said: "Let him who becomes a Muslim be
      circumcised, even if he is old".</p>

      <p>- One asked Mohammed if an uncircumcised man could go to
      pilgrimage. He answered: "Not as long as he is not
      circumcised".</p>

      <p>- Mohammed said: "Five norms define fitrah: shaving of the
      pubis, circumcision, moustache trimming, armpit depilation
      and nail clipping". Other narrations name ten norms amongst
      which circumcision is always mentioned. The norms of fitrah
      are believed to be those taught by God to His creation. The
      man in pursuit of perfection must conform to those norms.
      They are not compulsory, but simply advisable (mandubah),
      except for circumcision which is mandatory. Based on these
      premises, Al-Sukkari believes Adam to have been the first
      circumcised man. His descendants having neglected their
      obligation, it was reconfirmed to Abraham and his
      descendants. Thus circumcision would be the sign which would
      differentiate the believer from the non-believer. Therefore,
      circumcision is the sign of Islam <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>- Mohammed has stipulated: "If both circumcised parts
      (khitanan) meet or if they touch each other, it is necessary
      to wash before prayer". From this, it may be deduced that men
      and women were circumcised in Mohammed's time.</p>

      <p>The Shiites add a narration by Imam Al-Sadiq stating:
      "Female circumcision is a makrumah, and is there anything
      better than a makrumah?" They cite Al-Sadiq as the reporter
      of the exciser's narration <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>The supporters of circumcision themselves (male or female)
      acknowledge that those narrations attributed to Mohammed
      offer little credibility <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup></font>. Mahmud Shaltut states that
      they are neither clear nor authentic44. Sheikh Abbas, Rector
      of the Muslim Institute at the Mosque of Paris, is even more
      adamant:</p>

      <p>If circumcision for the man (though not compulsory) has an
      aesthetic and hygienic purpose, there is no existing
      religious Islamic text of value to be considered in favour of
      female excision, as proven by the fact that this practice is
      totally non-existent in most of the Islamic countries. And if
      unfortunately some people keep practicing excision, to the
      great prejudice of women, it is probably due to customs
      practised prior to the conversion of these people to Islam
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h5>4. Custom and silence of the law</h5>
      Female circumcision having fragile foundations in the Koran
      and the Sunnah, Al-Sukkari tries to strengthen those
      foundations in calling upon custom, which constitutes a
      source of Muslim law. For him, female circumcision has become
      the norm in as much as it is general, it has been practiced
      for a long time and it is not contrary to any text of
      religious law. 

      <p>He refers to the rule according to which what is not
      forbidden is allowed. Thus female circumcision, not being
      expressly forbidden, remains permitted46. Even if narrations
      related to female circumcision are not credible, none has
      shown up to forbid it or declare it blameworthy. One of the
      principles of Muslim law is that it is better to apply the
      norm that to give it up <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>However, this author forgets that the Muslim law allows a
      custom based on ignorance to be abolished. In effect, the
      Koran states:</p>

      <p>When they are told: "Come to what God has revealed and to
      the Messenger". they say: "Sufficient for us is what we found
      our parents doing". What if their parents lacked the
      knowledge? And the guidance? (5:104).</p>

      <p>Indeed, he reverses the rule. Instead of supporting
      physical integrity, indirectly he speaks in favour of the
      principle of mutilation.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>II. RELIGIOUS ARGUMENTS AGAINST CIRCUMCISION</h3>
      </center>

      <h4>1. God does not mutilate</h4>

      <p>This argument can be summed up as follows: Can we imagine
      a God who demands that his believers be mutilated and branded
      on their genitals the same as cattle? Doctor Nawal
      El-Saadawi, an Egyptian woman, herself excised, writes:</p>

      <p>If religion comes from God, how can it order man to cut
      off an organ created by Him as long as that organ is not
      deceased or deformed? God does not create the organs of the
      body haphazardly without a plan. It is not possible that He
      should have created the clitoris in a woman's body only in
      order that it be cut off at an early stage in life. This is a
      contradiction into which neither true religion nor the
      Creator could possibly fall. If God has created the clitoris
      as a sexually sensitive organ, whose sole function seems to
      be the procurement of sexual pleasure for women, it follows
      that He also considers such pleasure for women as normal and
      legitimate, and therefore as an integral part of mental
      health <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>It has very often been proclaimed that Islam is at the
      root of female circumcision, and is also responsible for the
      under-privileged and backward situation of women in Egypt and
      the Arab countries. Such a contention is not true...
      Religion, if authentic in the principles it stands for, aims
      at truth, equality, justice, love and a healthy wholesome
      life for all people, whether men or women. There can be no
      true religion that aims at disease, mutilation of the bodies
      of female children, and amputation of an essential part of
      their reproductive organs <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Ren&eacute;e Saurel goes over the argument again. She
      writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The Koran, contrary to Christianism and Judaism, permits
        and recommends that the woman be given physical and
        psychological pleasure, pleasure found by both partners
        during the act of love. Forcibly split, torn, and severed
        tissues are neither conducive to sensuality nor to the
        blessed feeling given and shared when participating in the
        quest for pleasure and the escape from pain <font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup></font>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Both sources mentioned above refer to religion, Islam,
      Christianity and Judaism. Those abstract notions contain the
      most conflicting components. It is better to refer to written
      sources than to abstract notions. It must also be pointed out
      that this argument is as valid against male circumcision as
      it is against female circumcision. However, both authors use
      it against female circumcision only. 

      <h4>2. Banning alteration of the human being</h4>
      It is not difficult to find support for the above argument in
      the Koran itself. Indeed, verse 4:119 does not allow man to
      change God's creature: 

      <blockquote>
        <p>[The devil said]: "I will mislead them, and I will
        create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the
        ears of cattles, and to deface the fair nature created by
        God".</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This verse appears to condemn any change of God's
      creation. It is referred to by Islamists to oppose permanent
      birth control, be it by measures affecting the man or the
      woman <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup></font>.
      Oddly, male and female circumcision enthusiasts forget this
      verse completely. They also forget the following one:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "He perfected everything He created" (32:7). Aziza Kamel,
        adversary of female circumcision, refers to this verse and
        adds: "Excision is a distortion of what God created because
        God is satisfied with His creation" <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n52">52</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>3. Man knows best</h4>
      Mohammed had told some farmers not to pollinate their date
      trees. That very year, the trees did not bear any dates.
      Having returned to Mohammed for explanations, they were told:
      "You know your worldly business better [than I do]". 

      <p>The last passage of the narration was quoted by Sheikh
      Hassan Ahmed Abu-Sabib from Sudan in his presentation to the
      Seminar on Traditional Practices having consequences on the
      Health of Women and Children (affecting Women's and
      Children's Health) in Africa (Dakar, Feb. 6-10, 1984).
      Strengthened by this narration, he comes to the conclusion
      that female circumcision must be banned because medical
      science has proved it to be harmful. Then, he says, the Koran
      forbids man to harm himself by virtue of verse 2:195: "Do not
      throw yourselves with your own hands into disaster".
      Elsewhere, Mohammed said: "Who harms a believer, harms me and
      who harms me, harms God".</p>

      <p>This Sudanese Sheikh did not pursue his reasoning to its
      end. In the narration about the date trees, Mohammed did not
      want to consider himself as infallible in botany and so
      admitted that the farmers knew more than he did on the
      subject in spite of his quality as a prophet. By analogy with
      female and male circumcision, this narration means that
      Mohammed indeed could not be infallible on the subject and
      could be contradicted by medical science. Our Sheikh does not
      go so far. He separates Mohammed's answer from the whole
      narration about the date trees and just states that
      Mohammed's narrations on female circumcision are not
      reliable, calling on the authority of his counterpart, Imam
      Shaltut. He concludes that the issue of male and female
      circumcision must be judged according to its disadvantages
      and advantages <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>In spite of this minor inconsistency, his advice against
      female circumcision is the most explicit known to us on the
      part of a contemporary religious Muslim leader.</p>

      <h4>4. The Al-Mahdawi case</h4>
      All of the aforementioned religious arguments are written
      solely and exclusively against female circumcision. Though
      they could very well be used against male circumcision, their
      authors never do so and not without purpose. 

      <p>Indeed, the only Muslim author to have cast doubts on male
      circumcision has had legal action brought against him and
      might be sentenced to death for apostasy. I am speaking of
      (retired) Judge Mustafa Kamal Al-Mahdawi, a personal friend
      of mine, who is today under a ferocious attack lead by Libyan
      religious circles in the mosques as well in the press. The
      preacher of the Mosque of the Prophet, in Medina, Saudi
      Arabia, published in July 1992 a pamphlet handed out free of
      charge in Libya. In this pamphlet, he asks the Muslim Arab
      League and the Islamic Conference to set up a collective
      fatwa of all Muslim scholars against this judge and to
      execute him as an apostate if he does not retract. As for his
      book, the preacher asks that it be removed from the shelves,
      burned and forbidden to any reader. He blames the judge for
      having, among other things, denied that male circumcision is
      compulsory when there is unanimity in favour of it and when
      Mohammed was Himself circumcised <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>In fact, this Libyan judge insists that male circumcision
      is a Jewish custom; the Jews believe that God would only see
      them if they had distinctive marks such as circumcision or
      blood stained doors. He refers here to God's command given to
      the Jews that the blood from sacrificed cattle be put on
      jambs and lintel of houses at the time of Passover because He
      intended to kill all firstborn in Egypt. God said to Moses
      and Aaron: "The blood shall be a sign on the houses where you
      live. Seeing this sign, I shall pass over those doorways and
      you shall escape the destructive calamity when I strike down
      the people of Egypt" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup></font>. The Libyan judge adds that
      the Koran does not mention this "peculiar logic". For him,
      God does not devote Himself to such banter no more than He
      created the foreskin as a superfluous object destined only to
      be cut off56. He quotes verse 3:191 which states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Our Lord, You did not create all this in vain! Glory be to
        You! So spare us the agony of hell <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n57">57</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>III. QUALIFICATION OF CIRCUMCISION IN MUSLIM LAW</h3>
      To define an act means to declare it forbidden,
      reprehensible, permitted, advisable or mandatory. Those are
      the five categories into which a Muslim believer classifies
      any act. 

      <p>The adversaries of circumcision regard it as forbidden
      when it concerns girls. On the other hand, they do not oppose
      male circumcision and even consider it mandatory.</p>

      <p>As for the supporters of male and female circumcision,
      they are divided on the qualification that should be attached
      to it. Three opinions have been expressed:</p>

      <h4>1. Mandatory for boys and girls</h4>
      Imam Ahmad deems only the prayer and pilgrimage of the
      circumcised to be worthy of acceptance. Imam Malik refuses
      access to public office to, and testimony from, a
      non-circumcised person. Others go as far as forbidding that
      meat killed by a non-circumcised person be eaten58. This
      school puts forward the following justifications: 

      <p>- Verse 16:120 requests that Mohammed follow the path of
      Abraham. Abraham was circumcised at a very old age, when he
      was 80 years old, according to others 120, in spite of the
      suffering that circumcision could cause him. Had it not been
      mandatory in Abraham's opinion, he would not have subjected
      himself to it.</p>

      <p>- Different sayings of Mohammed related to circumcision
      and mentioned earlier.</p>

      <p>- During the era of the Companions of Mohammed, male and
      female circumcision was carried out.</p>

      <p>- The condition of being non circumcised keeps impurity in
      the body and renders prayer null and void, the same way as an
      unclean mouth does.</p>

      <p>- Circumcision (male and female) causes pain. Pain is
      permissible only for benefit, punishment and obligation.
      Since benefit and punishment are inapplicable, circumcision
      (male and female) is an obligation <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>2. Sunnah for both sexes</h4>
      According to this school of thought, male and female
      circumcision falls under sunnah, the meaning of which jurists
      disagree upon. It can have two meanings: the tradition of
      Mohammed himself, or simply a custom at the time of
      Mohammed60. Considered as sunnah, it would be advisable and
      not mandatory <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>Those in favour of this qualification call upon the
      narration which compares circumcision (male and female) to a
      norm of the above mentioned fitrah. As such, it has man's
      perfection as a purpose. Though it is desirable, the Muslim
      believer is under no obligation to have it done. They add
      that many persons joined Islam without Mohammed ever
      searching [under their clothes] to see if they were
      circumcised or not <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>3. Compulsory for the boys, sunnah or makrumah for the
      girls</h4>
      The modern authors opt for this opinion. Al-Sukkari states
      that male circumcision is mandatory because of the smell and
      the repugnant, greasy substances secreted and kept under the
      foreskin. This uncleanness renders prayer invalid. But as
      purity is necessary for prayer, circumcision becomes
      compulsory according to the legal rule which states: what is
      necessary to fulfil an obligation becomes in turn mandatory. 

      <p>On the other hand, the female having no foreskin and
      therefore no source of impurity "down there", female
      circumcision is only advisable. Two reasons underlie the
      recommendation of female circumcision:</p>

      <p>- to fulfil makrumah granted by Mohammed.</p>

      <p>- to avoid falling into a taboo <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>For Professor 'Abd-al-Wahhab Khallaf, the term makrumah
      means that female circumcision adds to the man's pleasure
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></font>.
      Shaltut states that female circumcision is a makrumah for the
      men who are not used to feeling this protruding piece
      (za'idah) piece of flesh <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>The majority leans toward the meaning of a commendable or
      meritorious act on the part of the woman. It is Professor
      Zakariyya Al-Birri's opinion that it is better to carry out
      female circumcision. Anyone who does not do it does not sin
      if he is convinced in the light of religious texts and
      doctor's advice that he is under no obligation to conform (to
      it) <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup></font>.
      Al-Qaradawi leaves the choice to parents according to their
      beliefs, in spite of the fact that he favours female
      circumcision, because it protects girls' morality "especially
      nowadays" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>A fatwa from the Egyptian Fatwa Committee dated May 28,
      1949, has declared that abandoning female circumcision does
      not constitute a sin68. Another fatwa from the same body
      dated June 23, 1951, is more rigid. Not only does this fatwa
      not recognise the abandonment of female circumcision as an
      option, but is further of the opinion that it is advisable to
      carry it out because it curbs "nature". Moreover, this fatwa
      considers doctors' opinions on the disadvantages of female
      circumcision irrelevant (see Chapter III, Paragraph 3, point
      2) <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></font>. A
      third much more detailed fatwa from the same institution
      dated January 29, 1981, is adamantly opposed to giving up
      female circumcision. The author of this fatwa is the present
      Great Sheikh of Al-Azhar, the most famous University of the
      Islamic World in Cairo. He insists that it is impossible to
      abandon the lessons of Mohammed in favour of the teaching of
      others, be they doctors, because medical science evolves and
      does not remain constant. The responsibility of female
      circumcision lies with the parents and with those in charge
      of the girl's welfare. Those who do not abide by it do not do
      their duty <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>4. Motives for the difference between boy and girl</h4>
      Al-Sukkari tries to explain the difference between boy and
      girl vis-&agrave;-vis the religious norm: 

      <p>- Abraham circumcised himself and he would not have done
      it, had it not been a duty. But there is no evidence that
      Abraham ordered female circumcision <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup></font>. This is instead a command
      from Mohammed according to the above mentioned exciser's
      narration.</p>

      <p>- Male circumcision is a sign which separates Muslim men
      from the non-Muslim ones. As for the woman, one should adopt
      a respectful attitude toward her and not impose a physical
      examination to see if she is circumcised or not.</p>

      <p>- Male circumcision helps prevent many diseases, cancer
      among them, and reduces having to resort to masturbation.
      This opinion is also put forward by Imam Mahmud Shaltut for
      whom the boy's foreskin hides germs harmful to his health,
      which is not the case for the girls <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>5. Consequences of the qualification</h4>
      Jurists have asked themselves if public authority can force a
      Muslim to submit to circumcision, especially if he is getting
      on years. The Zaydites and the Shafiites answer
      affirmatively. According to the Hanafite School, if a group
      rejects male circumcision, the Head of State must declare war
      (against this group). However, some say that a man may be
      spared circumcision if it endangers his health. Al-Sukkari, a
      modern author, is of the opinion that health nowadays is not
      a problem. The Muslim man who fears for his health can ask a
      doctor to carry out the operation under anaesthesia and with
      the help of modern equipment. 

      <p>The Hanbalites say that male and female circumcision is an
      Islamic ritual; the man can force his wife to be excised as
      well as to force her to pray. The Ibadites consider as
      invalid the marriage of a non-circumcised Muslim even if it
      was consummated. The woman may ask for legal separation. If
      the husband gets circumcised after its consummation, the
      marriage remains invalid; he must go through another ceremony
      in order to get his wife back. For the Hanbalites, the
      non-circumcision of the husband is a breach of contract
      giving the woman the choice of asking for divorce or
      continuing the marriage. For some, the non-circumcised man
      has no right of guardianship of a Muslim and no right to give
      his consent to the marriage of a Muslim relative. In this
      case, the marriage is dissolved, except if it was
      consummated.</p>

      <p>Al-Sukkari, a modern author, grants the woman the right to
      dissolve the marriage if the husband is not circumcised,
      because his foreskin can be a vector of diseases. It can also
      be a source of repulsion, thus preventing the realization of
      the objectives of marriage, id est love and understanding
      between partners. The woman has a right to be married to
      someone handsome and clean, Islam being the religion of
      cleanness and purity <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup></font>. Ahmad Amin emphasizes the
      importance of circumcision in the Egyptian's mind by telling
      this anecdote: a Sudanese tribe wanted to join Islam. The
      chief wrote to a scholar of the Al-Azhar to ask him what was
      to be done. The scholar sent him a list of demands, putting
      circumcision in first place. The tribe then refused to become
      Muslim <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>For the majority of believers, to belong to Islam implies
      de facto male circumcision. In Java, to circumcise a boy is
      translated by: to welcome someone in the bosom of Islam; in
      Algiers, during the colonial era, the printed invitation to
      the religious ceremony named it in French: bapt&icirc;me
      (baptism). In Muslim life, it is an important cause for
      family celebration, which is not the case for female
      circumcision, always carried out secretly <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup></font>. According
      to the Saudi religious authorities, a man who converts to
      Islam must get circumcised, but in case he refuses to join
      Islam for fear of the procedure, this demand may be postponed
      until the faith is stronger in his heart <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>On a social level, the non-circumcision of a female has
      serious consequences. In some countries, the non-circumcised
      girls do not get married and people then start talking about
      them, as if they were guilty of misbehaviour, possessed by
      the devil. In the Egyptian countryside, the matron practicing
      female circumcision delivers a certificate which is used for
      the marriage <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></font>. Wedad Zenie-Ziegler writes
      that the Egyptian country women are surprised to learn that
      their sisters in Cairo are not excised. They burst into
      laughter, interrupted by scandalized comments: "Really it is
      not done? Girls remain like that uncut? And they don't become
      wild?" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup></font>. El-Masry reports the
      statement of an Egyptian midwife who had circumcised more
      than 1000 girls. To her, "one should lynch the fathers who
      were opposed to excision of their daughters, because these
      fathers were in fact willing to see their girls become
      whores" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup></font>. In Sudan, where infibulation
      is practiced, brothers have tried to protect their young
      sisters from this torture. Most of them were evicted from the
      paternal home after terrible quarrels, the parents accusing
      them of being depraved and of trying to transform their
      sisters into shameless creatures. Very few succeeded: but, to
      put an end to the neighbours' gossip, they had to bring their
      sisters to live under their own rooves in Khartoum or Atbara.
      "Because in Sudan, it is as unusual not to sew girls'
      genitals as in the West, it is unusual not to bath the
      children. It sets the tongues wagging" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p><a id="Modality" name="Modality"></a></p>

      <h3>IV. MODALITY OF CIRCUMCISION ACCORDING TO MUSLIM LAW</h3>

      <h4>1. Male circumcision</h4>
      According to classical Muslim jurists, male circumcision
      involves the cutting of the foreskin, preferably the whole
      foreskin. If the man has two penises, some say that both
      should be circumcised, others say that only the one passing
      urine should be circumcised. If the child was born
      circumcised, some are of the opinion he should be left as
      such, while for others, the knife should be passed over the
      emplacement of the foreskin to fulfil the Commandment. If the
      circumcision is incomplete, it should be completed <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup></font>. 

      <h4>2. Female circumcision</h4>
      Al-Sukkari, a modern author, describes female circumcision as
      follows: "For a start, God should be called upon by saying
      the opening statement: in the name of God, most gracious,
      most merciful, followed by praise to God and prayer to the
      Prophet, the author of this supreme makrumah". Female
      circumcision must be carried out by one male or female
      surgeon of Muslim faith and devout appearance, knowledgeable
      of the teaching of Mohammed. The best medical means must be
      used to reduce pain. Female circumcision must be done by day
      to allow the physician to perform in full day light, but also
      in full secrecy; only her mother or her tutor must be
      present, or the one who feels the most compassion for the
      girl <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup></font>.
      He does not clarify what female circumcision consists of. For
      Gad-al-Haq, female circumcision consists of "cutting the skin
      which is located above the urinary orifice without
      exaggeration and without rooting it out" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup></font>. Al-Sha'rawi
      stipulates that if the girl does not have any flesh
      protruding, circumcision should not be done <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>What is described above as in compliance with sunnah
      remains theoretical. In fact, it is rather clitoridectomy
      (performed in Egypt) or infibulation (performed in Sudan and
      Somalia). In Sudan, a study has brought to light that 64% of
      female circumcisions are done by the traditional matrons, 35%
      by midwives and 0.7% by physicians <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n85">85</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>3. Circumcision of the hermaphrodite</h4>
      Classical authors' opinions have differed regarding
      hermaphrodites, persons with both male and female genitalia.
      Some say that both must be circumcised, while others say that
      only the organ passing urine should be cut because it implies
      rights of inheritance <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup></font>. Finally, for others, one
      must delay circumcision until it is possible to tell which
      one of the two is predominant. Cautiously, Al-Sukkari, a
      modern author, chooses the first opinion, meaning
      circumcision of both sexes, to minimize the chances of
      mistake <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n87">87</a></sup></font>. 

      <h4>4. Age for male and female circumcision</h4>
      Jurists are not unanimous regarding the age at which
      circumcision should be carried out. Different opinions are
      presented: any time; at puberty; before 10 years of age (the
      age when one has often to hit the child to force him to
      pray); at about 7 years for the boy; on the seventh day (some
      take the day of birth into consideration, others not);
      especially not on the seventh day or before (because it is a
      Jewish custom and one does not want to be put in the same
      category with them). Al-Mawardi suggests that circumcision be
      done at 7 years of age at the latest, but preferably at 7
      days or at 40 days, except in case of inconvenience. That is
      Al-Sukkari's opinion for the boys. For the girls, he suggests
      the age of 7 to 10 years, to help them cope with the
      procedure <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n88">88</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>According to testimony gathered by Wedad Zenie-Ziegler,
      female circumcision in Egypt is done in principle one week
      after birth, but it can be done at 2 months, sometimes at 7
      months or even 7 years89. Nawal El-Saadawi says that in Egypt
      it takes place at the age of 7 or 8, before the girl starts
      menstruating <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Jurists have asked themselves if persons who died without
      circumcision should be circumcised. The majority of legists
      reject such an idea because it affects the deceased's
      physical integrity (hurmah) and exhibits his private part
      ('awrah); moreover, it is useless, the goal of circumcision
      being to fulfil an act of worship and to be clean for prayer,
      which is of no use to the deceased. For others, circumcision
      of the deceased is necessary; his foreskin is placed in the
      shroud. They call on a narration by Mohammed, according to
      which one must do to the dead what is done to those getting
      married. Al-Sukkari, a modern author, leans toward the first
      opinion <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p><a id="Chapter3" name="Chapter3"></a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <center>
        <h2>CHAPTER III. REASON IN AID OF RELIGION</h2>
      </center>
      The Koran says: "No one questions Him about anything He does,
      but men are questioned" (21:23). God does not have to justify
      his norms even if Muslim jurists are of the opinion that
      divine norms are intended to bring good to Man. The criteria
      of goodness elude Man most of the time. 

      <p>However, there is a tendency among the Muslims as well as
      the Jews today, to try to justify religious norms a
      posteriori, conferring beneficial results upon them, real or
      fictitious. It is a recourse to reason to justify religion.
      Cases in point are circumcision and dietary taboos. It proves
      that the idea of God hurting human beings simply in order to
      brand them like cattle is not accepted anymore.</p>

      <p>The supporters of male and female circumcision, after
      proving the existence of a related religious norm, will
      buckle down to demonstrate the advantages of circumcision as
      well as the disadvantages of non-circumcision, in order to
      comfort the believer, while answering back to those opposed
      to it. As for the opponents of female circumcision, they,
      unless they are unbelievers, rejecting any religious
      justification, also fight on two fronts: after denying the
      existence of a religious norm prescribing female circumcision
      (the only one they are interested in), they try to prove its
      harmful characteristics in order to ban it.</p>

      <p>And if reason does not succeed in proving that religion is
      correct? Then, let it be challenged, as will be seen further
      on.</p>

      <p><a id="Male" name="Male"></a></p>

      <h3>I. MALE CIRCUMCISION</h3>

      <h4>1. Advantages of male circumcision</h4>
      Muslim authors skim over male circumcision. They only see
      advantages and, most of all, the subject does not trigger any
      debate in the West. According to Al-Hadidi (an opponent of
      female circumcision), male non-circumcision can cause penile
      infections arising from urine droplets. It can develop into
      cancer, requiring the penis to be amputated entirely <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup></font>.
      Circumcision is even believed to prevent cancer in the
      circumcised man's partner, as mentioned by Doctor Al-Fangari,
      who goes on to state that it helps to extend the length of
      copulation, thanks to the liberation of the glans <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup></font>. Their
      Jewish counterparts make the same type of arguments. It is
      enough to have the Christians, to whom Saint-Paul suggests
      circumcision in their heart rather than in their flesh, turn
      green with envy <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup></font>! If only Saint Paul could
      have heard our Jewish and Muslim medical experts before
      rejecting the obligation to circumcise! 

      <p>Imam Shaltut does not find any basis for male and female
      circumcision, be it in the Koran or in the Sunnah from
      Mohammed. Therefore it must be judged according to the
      general Islamic consensus which forbids hurting anyone,
      unless advantages outnumber disadvantages. For the boys, he
      states that circumcision is beneficial because it cuts off
      the foreskin which harbours filth and promotes cancer and
      other diseases. As such, it is a protective and preventive
      measure. Thus its mandatory quality in Muslim law <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Logically, if male circumcision were beneficial, it should
      be generalized. Male circumcision cannot however be justified
      solely on the basis of its usefulness in certain pathological
      conditions. A foot may be amputated under medical imperative
      if it is gangrenous and amputation will then certainly be
      beneficial. Nevertheless, nobody would call for generalized
      foot amputation among the followers of any given
      religion<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n96">96</a></sup></font>. The argument is compelling,
      unless it can be shown that the relevant religious adepts
      have penises noticeably different from those of their fellow
      humans.</p>

      <p>Let us point out here that circumcision has its
      enthusiasts among Christians who believe the Bible to be a
      scientific book. This is especially the case in the U.S.A.
      where obstetricians "sever at birth the foreskins of future
      Methodists, Adventists, Catholics, Sectarians of Love, if not
      good brave Atheists". To them, uncircumcised males "can only
      be country people and half-witted"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n97">97</a></sup></font>. In that country, the number
      of new-born who are circumcised is estimated at 50%. But in
      1975, the American health commission stated that circumcision
      was not a good hygienic measure. Since then, circumcision has
      been reduced considerably <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n98">98</a></sup></font>. The pro-circumcision people
      then launched a campaign to persuade the commission to
      reverse its decision, claiming that circumcision prevents
      infantile urinary tract infections and even AIDS
      transmission, a claim denied by Swedish experts <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>2. Disadvantages of male circumcision</h4>
      As noted above, male circumcision is of no interest to most
      people. Doctor G&eacute;rard Zwang, quoted above, stands out
      as one of the very few opponents of male circumcision in
      France. Not only does he not see any advantages, but he
      notices disadvantages. He writes: 

      <p>One must be extremely suspicious when magicians and
      shamans try to irrefutably legitimate ritual sexual
      mutilations (unless one belongs to the clan of those
      incurably naive ethnographers). As heirs of the only
      extra-European culture touched by some sort of scientific
      thinking and often contributing to its development, it is the
      Judaizers who provide the so-called "logical" arguments in
      favour of circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>He names the five "reasonable" reasons produced by the
      Western partisans of circumcision, reasons which support
      those given by the Muslims:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Circumcision testifies to the legitimate concern of
        lifting the sexuality of the individual to perfection;</li>

        <li>Circumcision is a good hygienic precaution;</li>

        <li>Circumcision prevents masturbation;</li>

        <li>Circumcision prevents cancer;</li>

        <li>Circumcision allows better control at the "plateau"
        stage.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After taking apart those reasons one by one <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n101">101</a></sup></font>, he points
      out that the foreskin of the infant acts as a sheath
      preventing the glans from soaking permanently in urine and
      protecting it from irritations and inflammations due to
      contact with clothing, soaked swaddling clothes and diapers.
      He insists that circumcision at birth is "practically always
      responsible for inflamed stricture of the urinary meatus".
      The protective function of the foreskin for the glans and the
      penis retains its usefulness during erotic activities, thus
      the importance of the foreskin at the affective level during
      childhood, youth and adulthood <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n102">102</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>He concludes that "there is no [medical] reason to
      systematically deprive all new-born, little boys or men of an
      integral part of the normal human anatomy". Even for
      foreskins with problems, he advises against circumcision and
      prefers those simple, surgical procedures which retain the
      foreskin. He recommends that plastic surgeons apply
      themselves to mastering the technique of possible preputial
      reconstruction for circumcised patients suffering from
      "balanic peeling", one of the consequences of circumcision
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n103">103</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>As for surgeons requested to perform circumcision, he asks
      them to refuse to comply. If it is an adult who makes the
      request, the surgeon has the right to raise the matter of
      conscience, as some do, based on liberalism, to avoid
      carrying out abortions. If it is a normal child brought in by
      his parents, "the surgeon is entitled to call upon the
      impossibility of committing an assault and battery on a minor
      and advise them to wait until their offspring reaches his
      majority" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>It might be necessary to add to the doctors' advice, the
      psychologists' answer to these questions: what is the
      influence of circumcision on the victims of paranoia<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n105">105</a></sup></font> On the
      conscious or unconscious male rage and violence in the
      American culture? On the conflicts between Muslims themselves
      or between Jews and Muslims? It would be also useful to know
      what is the relation between circumcision and situational
      homosexuality (by opposition to constitutional
      homosexuality).</p>

      <h3>II. FEMALE CIRCUMCISION</h3>

      <h4>1. Advantages of female circumcision in compliance with
      the sunnah</h4>
      Circumcision not carried out according to the sunnah is
      forbidden by all Muslim religious circles. For some, "the
      practice of female circumcision as it is carried out on their
      daughters by some women from backward countries, is an
      offence punishable by law"106. Nobody comes to its defense
      even if it is the most practiced form of circumcision in
      Muslim countries. This condemnation is based mostly on the
      exciser's narration, mentioned earlier. What is strange in
      this case is that those very religious circles do not try to
      use this narration in a positive way to fight the practice.
      As an example, it is estimated that 89.2% of the women in
      North Sudan are circumcised: 82.3% by infibulation; only
      19.2% of Christian women are circumcised that way. More
      Christians (57.7%) than Muslims (20.8%) appear to favour
      abolition of this practice for their daughters<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>If these religious scholars, all male chauvinists, are
      opposed to female circumcision not in compliance with the
      sunnah, they nevertheless do approve of it when it is
      sunnah-conform. This type of female circumcision, by the way,
      is not described fully: for some, it is only removal of a
      minimal amount of clitoris skin in application of the
      exciser's narration; for others, it involves the whole
      clitoris and labia minora.</p>

      <p>The goal of defending female circumcision in compliance
      with the sunnah is expressed in no uncertain terms by
      Al-I'tissam, an Islamic magazine from Cairo. This magazine
      protests against the WHO, accusing the organization of
      "distorting the truth of Islam"; Al-I'tissam requests
      Al-Azhar and all religious scholars to "open their eyes and
      be on the alert for those ideas coming to us from outside, so
      we can fight them, prove their foolishness and save Islamic
      customs" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n108">108</a></sup></font>. Here are the advantages of
      female circumcision according to its male supporters:</p>

      <h5>A) It maintains cleanliness</h5>
      Doctor Hamid Al-Ghawabi states that bad smells in women,
      cleanliness notwithstanding, can only be eliminated by
      cutting off the clitoris and labia minora<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n109">109</a></sup></font>. 

      <h5>B) It prevents diseases</h5>
      The number of nymphomaniacs is less among circumcised women.
      The husband may catch this disease and even die of it <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n110">110</a></sup></font>. Female
      circumcision prevents vaginal cancer <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n111">111</a></sup></font> and swelling of the
      clitoris which could drive the woman to masturbation or
      homosexual relations <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup></font>. 

      <h5>C) It brings calm and gives radiance to the face</h5>
      Female circumcision shields the girl from nervousness at an
      early age and prevents her from getting a yellow face. This
      statement is based on a narration by Mohammed: "Circumcision
      is makrumah for women" and "give them a glowing face"<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n113">113</a></sup></font>. The
      exciser's narration is also quoted to say that circumcision
      makes a woman's face more beauutiful and makes her more
      attractive for her husband <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n114">114</a></sup></font>. According to a supporter
      of female circumcision, the latter brings good health and
      feminine grace to the girl and protects her morality,
      chastity and honour, maintaining within reason, of course,
      the necessary sexual sensitivity <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n115">115</a></sup></font>. 

      <h5>D) It keeps the couple together and prevents drug
      use</h5>
      Doctor Hamid Al-Ghawabi admits that female circumcision does
      reduce the sexual instinct in women, but he sees this as a
      positive effect. With age, the male sexual instinct lessens.
      His circumcised wife will then be at the same level as him.
      If she was not, her husband would be unable to satisfy her,
      which then would lead him to drug-use in order to succeed
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n116">116</a></sup></font>. 

      <h5>E) It prevents her falling into what is forbidden</h5>
      This is the most frequently cited reason. Professor Al-'Adawi
      from Al-Azhar says that female circumcision is makrumah, that
      is helps (the woman) "to remain shy and virtuous. In the
      Orient, where the climate is hot, a girl gets easily aroused
      if she is not circumcised. It makes her shameless and prey to
      her sexual instincts, except those to whom God shows
      compassion" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n117">117</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>Judge 'Arnus says that female circumcision diminishes
      sexual instinct which, if not kept in control, reduces the
      person to the condition of an animal, but if this sexual
      instinct does not exist, then circumcision reduces her to a
      lifeless state. He favours moderation and notes that intact
      men and women have, more often than not, a "one track
      mind"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup></font>. Salim, Chairman of the
      Muslim Supreme Court (abolished in 1955), reiterates that
      female circumcision is a makrumah, a meritorious action, that
      the woman is under no obligation to submit to, but preferably
      she should. He adds that circumcision protects girls from
      infection, swelling of her external genitalia and from strong
      psychic reactions and sexual excitement which, if repressed,
      lead to neurosis or, if unleashed, lead to the path of vice.
      This happens especially during youth, when hormones of
      reproduction are at their peak. Salim goes on to describe
      this circumcision. The procedure consists of cutting off the
      bulging part of the clitoris which is out of the hood "so as
      not to become a cause of arousal while the girl is moving,
      rubbing against her clothing, riding animals, etc... Thus its
      name khafd: to lower the level" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup></font>. Gad-al-Haq, Great Sheikh
      of Al-Azhar, adds that our times call for female circumcision
      "because of mixing of the sexes at public gatherings. If the
      girl is not circumcised, she subjects herself to multiple
      causes of excitation leading her to vice and perdition in a
      depraved society"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n120">120</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>2. Disastrous consequences of any kind of female
      circumcision</h4>
      Opponents of female circumcision reject it because of the
      seriousness of the complications which depend on the method
      adopted. 

      <h5>A) Physical and mental damage</h5>
      Many complications may occur after female circumcision.
      Doctor Mahran classifies them as follows: 

      <ul>
        <li>Immediate complications: post-operative shock, pain,
        haemorrhages, infections, urinary complications and
        accidental injuries to surrounding organs.</li>

        <li>Later physical complications: painful scars, keloid
        formation, labial adherences, clitoridal cysts, vulva
        mutilation, kidney stones, sterility.</li>

        <li>Psychosexual complications: in the woman: a sense of
        loss of her femininity, lack of libido, less frequent
        coitus, absence of orgasm, depression and psychosis, high
        rate of divorce; in the man: premature ejaculation,
        polygamy.</li>

        <li>Obstetric complications <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n121">121</a></sup></font>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is no surgical technique which will ever repair this
      mutilation, which will ever bring back the erogenous
      sensitivity of the amputated receptors. The erotic function
      in an excised woman is destroyed for ever. The surgeon can
      only correct the complications; if the mutilated woman's
      genitalia will never again give her pleasure, at least it
      should not cause her undue suffering <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n122">122</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>The Muslim enthusiasts of female circumcision do not deny
      those complications, but state that they arise out of the
      manner in which the surgery is performed, mostly because
      nobody pays attention to the conditions laid down by Muslim
      law. Al-Sukkari writes: if one goes to a barber for an
      appendectomy, must we conclude that this form of surgery has
      never been provided for in an Islamic book and thus should be
      banned because the way it is performed is wrong? He adds that
      female circumcision has been a practice for centuries and is
      a custom accepted by Muslim law. The so-called consequences
      never occurred in the past. And if we hear of them today, the
      responsibility lies with those who perform it <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n123">123</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h5>B) Drug use</h5>
      We saw earlier that the enthusiasts of female circumcision
      called sunnah plead in favour of it because it prevents the
      use of drugs. The opponents use the reverse argument <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n124">124</a></sup></font>. The link
      between female circumcision and the hashish plague in Egypt
      has been widely exposed by El-Masry. Female circumcision
      distorts sexual relations: "Very few healthy males can fully
      succeed in bringing a circumcised woman to orgasm. She has
      lost her capacity for pleasure. The man will soon have to
      admit that he alone cannot do it. There is only one solution:
      hashish". He quotes many references, including Police Chief
      Safwat for whom: 

      <blockquote>
        "narcotics are widely used in Egypt, because they are
        linked in people's minds to sexual activities, themselves
        linked to excision, unknown in Europe"
      </blockquote>
      . Doctor Hanna adds: 

      <blockquote>
        "The man will resort to narcotics to satisfy his wife
        sexually. Excision is responsible for her lack of arousal
        and the husband has to take drugs to be able to hold his
        erection as long as necessary".
      </blockquote>
      He states that women are the ones to request that their
      husbands use drugs before sex: "They know from experience
      that it is their only chance of reaching orgasm, for hashish
      is the only cure for their mutilated clitoris" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n125">125</a></sup></font>. The Cairo
      magazine Al-Tahrir draws the following conclusion in its
      issue of August 20, 1957: 

      <blockquote>
        "If you want to fight against narcotics, ban excision".
        <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n126">126</a></sup></font>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The same link is observed between female circumcision and
      narcotics in Yemen where the plague of qat is widespread. An
      attempt to ban it in the British Colony of Aden, in April
      1957, almost triggered a revolt. Yemenis saw in this measure
      "an infringement upon their basic rights". Women themselves
      showed their reprobation, claiming it was an attack on their
      conjugal lives. Since June 24, 1958, the use of qat has been
      legal in Aden <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h5>C) Familial problems</h5>
      The woman, having no sexual release, becomes rebellious and
      neurotic. Instead of protecting her morality, female
      circumcision leads her elsewhere looking for sexual
      satisfaction at any cost. Thus the obsessive belief in djinn
      (zar), which does not exist anywhere else but in Egypt "as if
      genies (djinns) could only live in Egypt" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n128">128</a></sup></font>. 

      <h5>D) Ineffectiveness in preventing diseases</h5>
      For Doctor Al-Hadidi, there is no medical value in female
      circumcision, contrary to male circumcision, since the woman
      does not have a foreskin retaining germs <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n129">129</a></sup></font>. Doctor
      Nawal El-Saadawi denies also that female circumcision will
      reduce the incidence of genital cancer <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n130">130</a></sup></font>. 

      <p><a id="Mitigated" name="Mitigated"></a></p>

      <h3>III. MITIGATED POSITION OF RELIGIOUS CIRCLES CONFRONTED
      WITH REASON</h3>
      The arguments on costs and benefits of male and female
      circumcision might be of some value if one accepts an
      absolute parameter to begin with: respect for physical
      integrity. Any infringement upon the latter must be forbidden
      or permitted only on the basis of the costs and benefits of
      circumcision. At present, this seems to be the case neither
      among Muslims, nor among others, especially where male
      circumcision is concerned. 

      <p>As for female circumcision, as we said earlier, Muslim
      religious circles are opposed to it, if it is not conform to
      sunnah, mostly because of the exciser's narration. As far as
      sunnah itself is concerned, those circles refuse to condemn
      it on principle and the criteria mentioned above, even if
      differences of opinion can be noticed among them.</p>

      <h4>1. To apply the norm for the norm's sake</h4>
      Hamrush, Chairman of the fatwa Committee at Al-Azhar, rejects
      the idea that female circumcision prevents diseases or keeps
      girls healthy since, contrary to boys, they do not have a
      foreskin to harbour filth. He also rejects the idea that it
      is a protection of the woman's honour and morality, keeping
      her from throwing caution to the winds. If it were the case,
      then one would assume that circumcision is an obligation, and
      not just a makrumah. However, the Sheikh holds the opinion
      that female circumcision should be performed to fulfil the
      teaching of Mohammed <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n131">131</a></sup></font>. 

      <h4>2. The norm has benefits unknown to reason</h4>
      Professor Al-Laban says that simple scientific observation
      must not be used to destroy the norms established by God
      (including male and female circumcision) and announced by
      Mohammed, but rather confirm them<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n132">132</a></sup></font>. If we do not understand
      the wisdom of those norms, the deficiency is to be found in
      our reasoning, not with God. The Islamic law is the final law
      and is to rule at all times. Our human brains cannot possibly
      find fault with it. Mohammed does not speak from the heat of
      passion <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n133">133</a></sup></font>. He explains how science
      confirms the religious norm. Sunnah circumcision lets the
      blood vessels heal (what other types of circumcision do not)
      and makes purification easy once the excrescence is cut off
      because it is this part which retains urine and menstrual
      fluid. This wisdom of the Islamic norm was subsequently
      acknowledged by science <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>In an Egyptian fatwa of June 23, 1951, it is said:</p>

      <p>Medical theories relative to diseases and to their cure
      are not constant; they are subjected to changes with time and
      research. Therefore, it is impossible to use them as grounds
      to criticize female circumcision. The Lawmaker, wise, expert
      and knowledgeable, uses his wisdom to rectify the human
      creation. Experience has taught us that, given time, the true
      meaning of the Lawmaker's wisdom, which was hidden, is
      unveiled to us<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n135">135</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>3. Neither misdeed nor interdiction</h4>
      Al-Sukkari states that Mohammed never indicated any
      reservations regarding the harmfulness of female
      circumcision. How, in these conditions, could any ordinary
      man forbid it under this pretense? Can we imagine the Prophet
      keeping silent about something hurtful to the girl136? Man
      has no power to allow or to forbid, only God does, and his
      wishes are set out in the Koran or by His Prophet137. If in
      spite of that, some countries forbid female circumcision, it
      is a State decision and does not make any difference: the
      religious law allows it <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n138">138</a></sup></font>. 

      <h4>4. To maintain the custom in the absence of misdeeds</h4>
      Imam Shaltut, as mentioned above, does not see any reason for
      male or female circumcision, either in the Koran or in the
      Sunnah of Mohammed. To him, female circumcision has no
      medical value, the girl having no foreskin to hold filth. He
      packs into one sack those for and those against female
      circumcision: both groups go too far. He comes to the
      conclusion that female circumcision could be a makrumah for
      men who are not used to feeling the clitoris protruding; for
      the girl, it comes to the same as taking care of her beauty,
      dabbing perfume or removing axillary hair <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n139">139</a></sup></font>.
      Elsewhere, Imam Shaltut is in favour of keeping the tradition
      of female circumcision until proven harmful <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>Sheikh Al-Nawawi comes to another result through the same
      reasoning. For him, the narrations of Mohammed regarding
      female circumcision are weak and do not have a <i>raison
      d'&ecirc;tre</i>. Islam aimed to moderate this practice among
      Arabs and it is still performed in this moderate form,
      without ever becoming the rule, apart from exceptional cases.
      One cannot make a rule out of one exception <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n141">141</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>A less clear stand-point is taken by Al-Banna, Egyptian
      Deputy Minister for Religious Affairs. To him, female
      circumcision cannot be separated from the benefit criterion:
      God does not burden us, if there is no benefit. So, if there
      is any value to circumcision, one must abide by it. If not,
      one must give it up. Competent physicians must take a stand,
      having considered all girls from different climates, because
      the problem might not be the same in every country, or even
      with every girl. If a girl is in peculiar circumstances, she
      must be circumcised; if not, let Nature take its course, as
      God intended it. As long as no study has been done, Muslims
      are free to go either way <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>According to Professor Khallaf, physicians may not condemn
      female circumcision based on isolated cases alone, but
      compare excised and uncircumcised girls and then give their
      opinion. If they conclude that female circumcision is harmful
      and as such, they decide to forbid it, the prohibition will
      neither be contrary to a religious text, nor to the unanimous
      position of religious scholars <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n143">143</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>5. Permitted but soon to be forbidden because of adverse
      consequences</h4>
      Doctor 'Abd-al-Wahid presents a strange reasoning, to say the
      least. After stating that female circumcision is forbidden
      the same way as it is forbidden to chop off one's finger, he
      admits that the Lawmaker (God) gave permission for the
      sunnah, any excess being forbidden. However, he adds that
      this form of circumcision is allowed, but not mandatory and
      suggests that it be forbidden due to its medical and
      psychological consequences, which he recounts in detail <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n144">144</a></sup></font>. 

      <h4>6. It must be forbidden</h4>
      The most daring and most coherent opinion coming from a
      religious leader against female circumcision is that of
      Sheikh Abu-Sabib, a Sudanese, whom we mentioned earlier. He
      spoke at the Seminar on Traditional Practices (Dakar, 1984).
      The narrations of Mohammed about female circumcision are not
      reliable. They and the Koran do not require anyone to suffer,
      when science proves the harm done by this mutilation <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>Only the two last-mentioned opinions urge the banning of
      female circumcision and opt in favour of physical integrity.
      Others take great care to saying nothing about prohibition,
      even if some leave the choice up to the believer. Let us
      study this prohibition at the State level.</p>

      <center>
        <h2>CHAPTER IV. LEGAL PROHIBITION OF FEMALE
        CIRCUMCISION</h2>
      </center>
      Female circumcision brings up many questions: 

      <ul>
        <li>Do we have the right to judge the customs of other
        societies and if so, on which criteria?</li>

        <li>Can we remain indifferent, in the name of "difference",
        to mutilations inflicted upon young children?</li>

        <li>Must we make a distinction between the different kinds
        of circumcision?</li>

        <li>Must we forbid circumcision immediately and completely
        or progressively?</li>

        <li>May the practice be allowed in hospitals on a temporary
        basis?</li>
      </ul>
      <a id="Judge" name="Judge"></a> 

      <h3>I. TO JUDGE OTHERS' CUSTOMS</h3>
      The Muslim circles in favour of female circumcision see an
      imperialistic action in the Western campaign against it.
      Al-Sukkari writes that, if some are trying to forbid it, "it
      is because the West has succeeded in imposing secular
      materialistic views on our sciences, our tradition, our
      artistic culture"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n146">146</a></sup></font>. Imam Shaltut who accepts
      the idea of forbidding female circumcision if proven harmful,
      underlines the fact that it should not be prohibited under
      pressure from others - a polite nod toward the West - , but
      only if proven harmful <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n147">147</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>Jomo Kenyatta, late President of Kenya, used to say:
      "Excision and infibulation unite us tightly; they prove our
      fecundity" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n148">148</a></sup></font>. To which Pierre Leulliette
      replies:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Millions of children between the age of 2 and 14 are
        horribly tortured in an atmosphere of collective hysteria,
        in contempt of their genitalia, in scorn of their bodies,
        in defiance of their lives... That barbarian culture! Is it
        not the lowest manifestation of the unlimited, omnipresent
        phallocracy? Those mutilations! Aren't they first and
        foremost an example of man acting out his most secret
        hatred and deepest fear of woman <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n149">149</a></sup></font>?
      </blockquote>
      This problem is now on the agenda of international
      organizations. On July 10, 1958, the Economic and Social
      Committee of the United Nations invited the WHO "to undertake
      a study on the persistence of customs involving ritual
      practices on girls and on the measures in effect or planned
      to put an end to those practices"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n150">150</a></sup></font>. The answer was clear:
      "[The World Health Assembly] believes that the ritual
      practices in question, resulting from social and cultural
      conceptions, are not within the WHO's jurisdiction" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n151">151</a></sup></font>. And this,
      in spite of an overwhelming report prepared by the WHO's very
      own Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>In a communication on excision dated September 23, 1980,
      UNICEF explained that its approach to eradicating a 2000 year
      old cultural and traditional practice "is based on the belief
      that the best way to handle the problem is to trigger
      awareness through education of the public, members of the
      medical profession and practitioners of traditional health
      care with the help of local collectivities and their leaders"
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>In 1984, the Inter-African Committee stipulated that "for
      understandable psychological reasons, it is the black women
      who should have the say in the matter". This committee asked
      for restraint, in order that the project might be successful,
      claiming that "the wave of uncontrollable and violent
      denunciations of those mutilations on the part of Western
      countries" was doing more harm than good<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n154">154</a></sup></font>. On the
      subject of legal prohibition, this same committee, in 1984,
      warned against "untimely haste which would result in rash
      legal measures that would never be enforced" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n155">155</a></sup></font>. As for
      the health professionals, they were quite satisfied with
      themselves in condemning "the medicalisation and
      modernisation of the female circumcision procedure, as
      non-conform to medical ethics" and to advise that "no medical
      or paramedical personnel be allowed to practice it", for the
      same reason <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n156">156</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>This problem is puzzling for the Western countries.
      Dominique Vernier writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        As soon as the first preliminary investigations of cases on
        excision started [in France] (the Press mentions them as
        early as 1982-83), the Justice Department was put in an
        awkward position and has been ever since<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup></font>.
      </blockquote>
      This perplexity is due to the principles of the French penal
      code. Indeed, the parents have no intention to do violence to
      their children or to batter them, but rather intend to
      respect a custom, without the application of which their
      daughters, once adults, would not be able to integrate into
      their country of origin <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n158">158</a></sup></font>. On the other hand, in
      practice, it is easy for a couple who want their daughter
      excised to take her back to her country of origin, paralysing
      the law of the adopted country. Last, but not least, even if
      the countries of origin adopt some laws against those
      practices, those laws would not be able to defeat a massively
      accepted practice, which has become an integral part of that
      society <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n159">159</a></sup></font>. 

      <h3>II. RIGHT TO DIFFERENCE OR INDIFFERENCE</h3>
      This debate about the right to be different was settled in
      favour of the girl's right to physical integrity (but not the
      boy's). 

      <p>The WHO gave up its above mentioned reservations of 1959.
      It became involved in 1977 in the creation of the first
      Workshop on female excision. In February 1979, its Eastern
      Mediterranean Regional Office organized in Khartoum the first
      International Seminar on Traditional Practices affecting
      Women's and Children's Health. This Seminar recommended that
      specific national policies be adopted in order to abolish
      female circumcision <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n160">160</a></sup></font>. In June 1982, the WHO made
      a formal declaration of its position on excision to the
      Committee of Human Rights of the United Nations. The WHO
      approved the recommendations made at the Seminar in Khartoum
      and added: "It has always been the WHO's opinion that female
      circumcision should never be performed by health
      professionals in any situation under any conditions, be it in
      hospitals or other specialized settings"<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n161">161</a></sup></font>. The most
      recent stand was taken in 1989: the Regional Committee of the
      WHO for Africa passed a resolution urging the participating
      governments:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>to adopt appropriate policies and strategies in order
        to eradicate female circumcision;</li>

        <li>to forbid medicalisation of female circumcision and to
        discourage health professionals from performing such
        surgery <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n162">162</a></sup></font>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A turnaround was also made by the Inter-African Committee.
      Whereas in 1984, it had warned against promulgating laws
      against female circumcision, it requested such laws in 1987,
      because "neither the efforts nor the research nor the
      campaigns ever had any real impact" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n163">163</a></sup></font>. Three years later, it
      reinforced its position, requesting promulgation of specific
      laws "forbidding the practice of female genital mutilations
      and other sexual abuses and making provision for sentencing
      anyone guilty of such practices". This law should provide "an
      especially severe punishment for health professionals" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n164">164</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Some Western countries have timidly followed in the
      footsteps of the two above-mentioned organizations.</p>

      <p>For instance, in 1981, France adopted article 312,
      paragraph 3 of the Penal Code, stating:</p>

      <blockquote>
        When acts of violence or privation have been habitually
        inflicted, the sentence to be imposed upon the guilty party
        shall be: life imprisonment if there is mutilation,
        amputation, deprivation of the use of a limb, blindness,
        loss of an eye and other permanent disabilities or death,
        even if the guilty party did not intend such a result.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This article is invoked against female circumcision even
      though the word is not mentioned in the text. In Sweden, a
      1982 law forbids any operation on an external organ aiming at
      mutilating it or altering it definitely, whether or not
      consent is given165. Great Britain did the same in 1985 <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n166">166</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>In Switzerland, article 122 of the Penal Code
      stipulates:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Anyone who has mutilated a person's body, one of the limbs
        or one of the important organs, or rendered the limb or the
        organ unfit to function, will be sentenced to a maximum of
        10 years reclusion or to between 6 months and 5 years of
        imprisonment.
      </blockquote>
      Moreover, in 1983, the Central Committee for Medical Ethics
      of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences took a very firm
      position against female circumcision and its practice by
      medical professionals <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n167">167</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>The Convention on the Rights of the Child is not clear
      about it. Article 24, paragraph 3 states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate
        measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices
        prejudicial to the health of children.
      </blockquote>
      No definition is given of the expression "traditional
      practices detrimental to the health of children". The travaux
      pr&eacute;paratoires are of no help either. The definition
      therefore is left up to the Member States. Those States will
      surely not hesitate to quote article 29 paragraph 1.c of this
      Convention: 

      <p>The development of respect for the child's parents, his or
      her own cultural identity, language and values, for the
      national values of the country in which the child is living,
      the country from which he or she may originate, and for
      civilizations different from his or her own.</p>

      <p>Lastly, let us point out the London Declaration born out
      of the First Study Conference on Genital Mutilation of Girls
      in Europe/Western world (London, July 6-8, 1992). This
      Declaration states: "Any form of genital mutilation or
      genital injury to the girl child is a violation of her basic
      human rights, and must be abolished". It asks national groups
      and individuals to "promote a framework for legal action,
      based on either specific anti-FGM [female genital mutilation]
      or on general laws against the injury to the body of the
      child". This Declaration "urges all governments and all
      health authorities to stand firm against any attempt to
      medicalise the genital mutilation of or genital injury to the
      girl child"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n168">168</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p><a id="Distinct" name="Distinct"></a></p>

      <h3>III. DISTINCTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF
      CIRCUMCISION</h3>
      One must reiterate here that a distinction is wrongfully made
      at the medical and intellectual level between male
      circumcision, which is generally accepted, and female
      circumcision. Neither the WHO nor the Inter-African
      Committee, nor UNICEF, nor the London Declaration, nor the
      Western laws forbidding female circumcision make any mention
      of male circumcision. It is not mentioned in the travaux
      pr&eacute;paratoires to article 24, paragraph 3 of the
      Convention for the Rights of the Child either. Female
      circumcision is sometimes mentioned, but never male
      circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n169">169</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>One might have logically expected that those Western
      organizations and laws would draw a distinction between the
      different forms of female circumcision, in as much as minimal
      female circumcision can be compared to male circumcision. But
      this is not the case as already seen. During the above
      mentioned Conference of European Studies on Female Genital
      Mutilation, the Netherlands tried to have such a distinction
      made, to no avail; the WHO vetoed it. Doctor Mehra,
      representing the WHO, explained to me that this organization
      fears it would be impossible to control the practice if one
      permitted one particular form <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n170">170</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>This firm attitude opposed to all forms of female
      circumcision is not shared by Muslim law. The latter makes a
      distinction between the permitted female circumcision called
      sunnah, while other forms, though widely practiced, are
      condemned by religious circles. This distinction seems also
      to apply in Muslim countries.</p>

      <p>In Sudan, a law of 1946 classified infibulation as an
      infraction punishable by a fine and imprisonment. It was
      abrogated under public pressure and replaced by an
      authorization for professional midwives to practice sunnah
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n171">171</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>On an undated flyer, written in Arabic, the Sudanese
      Association of Struggle against Traditional Practices
      states:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Female circumcision (khafd) is an attack on the
        physical integrity and an alteration of the human being
        created by God in the very best way and in the very best
        form.</li>

        <li>Female circumcision is a savage butchery that divine
        religions do not allow.</li>

        <li>Female circumcision is neither a duty nor a sunnah, but
        a practice of the pre-Islamic era (al-gahiliyyah: the era
        of ignorance) against which the Prophet warned us in his
        narration: "Cut lightly and do not overdo it as it is more
        pleasant for the woman and better for the husband".</li>

        <li>Female circumcision does not protect chastity which is
        better guarded by education promoting good morality and
        healthy teaching of Islam.</li>

        <li>Female circumcision preceded religions and is practiced
        by many peoples of different religions and beliefs of which
        only the Sudan, Egypt and Somalia are Muslim.</li>

        <li>Therefore, stop circumcising girls.</li>
      </ul>
      This organization, while rejecting female circumcision in
      general, seems, in the 3rd paragraph, to propose the sunnah,
      instead of the pharaonic circumcision now prevalent in Sudan.
      A document prepared by the National Committee of Social
      Assistance in collaboration with UNICEF-Khartoum is doing the
      same. This document explains that the light form of
      circumcision is named sunnah which means it is conform with
      the tradition of Mohammed: it is a way of legitimating it
      rather that eradicating it <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n172">172</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>A similar attitude is adopted in Egypt. This country has
      promoted a governmental decree (No. 74-1959) regarding female
      circumcision. The text is far from clear. It states:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>1. It is forbidden for physicians to perform the
        surgical procedure of female circumcision. If one wishes
        it, then only partial circumcision may be carried, but not
        total circumcision.</li>

        <li>2. Female circumcisions are forbidden in the clinics of
        the Ministry of Health.</li>

        <li>3. Certified midwives have no right to perform any
        surgical procedure whatsoever including female circumcision
        <font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n173">173</a></sup></font>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This text is taken from a recent collective report on the
      woman's life and her health. The authors state that this text
      is not good as it does not forbid female circumcision. A law
      should be promulgated to abolish once and for all any kind of
      female circumcision <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n174">174</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Egyptian juridical works and anthologies of law pertaining
      to public health never mention this decree. One never finds
      any judgements on it. On the other hand, the Egyptian courts
      have convicted a barber for having practiced circumcision on
      a boy who consequently died. Contrary to the physician, the
      judgement states, the barber is not protected by law if the
      result of his action is death or disability. The judge
      refused to consider laudable or charitable intentions or the
      absence of criminal intent. In this case, the Court applied
      article 200 of the Penal Code which makes provision for 3 to
      7 years of forced labour or imprisonment in cases of
      voluntary injury without intention to kill, but in fact
      causing death <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n175">175</a></sup></font>. In another judgement, the
      Court of Cassation stated that a midwife has no right to
      practice circumcision, the right to perform surgery being
      reserved to physicians only, in pursuance of the first
      article of law 415/1954. The Court added that any attack on
      physical integrity, except in cases of necessity authorized
      by law, is punishable, unless the acts are performed by a
      physician. The midwife had circumcised a boy and mistakenly
      amputated his glans, causing permanent disability that the
      Court estimated at 25%. The midwife was sentenced to 6 months
      forced labour, suspended on condition of good behaviour
      during 3 years<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n176">176</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p><a id="Temporary" name="Temporary"></a></p>

      <h3>IV. TEMPORARY AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES</h3>
      Everybody agrees that legal measures will never be enough to
      stop female circumcision. A conscious awareness must be
      raised among the victims themselves. First, one must try to
      understand the reasons for those practices. In the meantime,
      in order to avoid the worst, shouldn't they be permitted to
      be performed in hospitals, in a less severe form? 

      <h4>1. Provision of medical care</h4>
      As we have noted above, the WHO, the Inter-African Committee,
      the Declaration of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and
      the London Declaration all dismiss this possibility as
      ethically wrong. They even ask for strict sanctions against
      members of the medical profession who perform female
      circumcision. 

      <p>This attitude may be open to criticism. A radical legal
      prohibition will only encourage female circumcision to go
      underground. It will then be performed by persons without
      proper knowledge of the possible complications, thus
      endangering the woman's health. The Senegalese representative
      raised the issue while the Convention on the Rights of the
      Child was being drawn up. Thus the actual phrasing of article
      24, paragraph 3177.</p>

      <p>Dominique Vernier is of the opinion that the
      medicalisation of circumcision as is practised among the
      urban intellectual elite of some African countries and in
      some Italian hospitals, in spite of the physicians'
      hostility, should be accepted. She suggests that symbolic
      excision be substituted for de facto excision as it is done
      in Guinea, where the blacksmith's wife performs a light cut
      sufficient to draw a few drops of blood. This is a way to
      respect the ritual without mutilating the child<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n178">178</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Medical care implies the risk of legalising and
      perpetuating female circumcision especially because of the
      economic repercussions. During the U.N. Seminar in
      Ouagadougou, some mentioned that the medical profession takes
      the place of the traditional matrons and excises in hospitals
      in order to make a financial profit and, by reducing health
      risks, they perpetuate the practice: a guarantee of making
      money. Their greed, having no limit, leads them to ignore the
      horror behind each sexual mutilation. Well aware of the trust
      and respect given to them by the masses, they abuse the naive
      parents and reassure them that the custom is well grounded.
      According to those at the Seminar, one must fight against
      such a tendency which is only going to add a new legitimacy
      to excision <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n179">179</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>2. Comprehension</h4>
      A. Gaudio and R. Pelletier see in female circumcision "an
      expression of male power"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n180">180</a></sup></font>, "a demonic desire to
      control female sexuality, an endless tyranny of the
      dominating male behind the alibi of culture" <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n181">181</a></sup></font>. 

      <p>Nawal El-Saadawi, a victim of excision, explains why
      female circumcision still goes on in Arab society under the
      male iron will:</p>

      <p>The importance given to virginity and an intact hymen in
      these societies is the reason why female circumcision still
      remains a very widespread practice despite a growing
      tendency, especially in urban Egypt, to do away with it as
      something outdated and harmful. Behind circumcision lies the
      belief that, by removing parts of girls' external genitals
      organs, sexual desire is minimized. This permits a female who
      has reached the dangerous age of puberty and adolescence to
      protect her virginity, and therefore her honour, with greater
      ease. Chastity was imposed on male attendants in the female
      harem by castration which turned them into inoffensive
      eunuchs. Similarly female circumcision is meant to preserve
      the chastity of young girls by reducing their desire for
      sexual intercourse <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n182">182</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>She adds that female circumcision is a means of dominating
      women in a patriarchal society where a man can have more than
      one wife. The society uses various means to sexually bind her
      to one man and to control who is the father of her children
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n183">183</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>For Doctor G&eacute;rard Zwang, the motive behind
      circumcision is "metaphysical guilt". It is the motivation
      "for all the sexual mutilations which human beings have
      inflicted upon themselves since they discovered the stone
      knife and the metal blade, a motivation which renders any
      non-religious, non-metaphysical consideration null and
      void":</p>

      <p>As a result of metaphysical culpabilization, men present
      sacrifices to gods, divinities, spirits: any earthy
      pleasures, carnal desires, organs destined to provide
      pleasure. In order to be among the "chosen ones" in another
      life, be it extra-, or supra-, or infra-terrestrial, which
      follows automatically (!) upon death. That is the origin of
      fasts, Lent, Ramadan, prohibited foods; that is the origin of
      ordinances restricting sexual life: chastity, abstinence,
      continency, reshaping of genitalia (circumcision, excision,
      infibulation, subincision, hemicastration, etc...)<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n184">184</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Economics can also explain why circumcision is still going
      on, to take an example mentioned above, when it is performed
      in hospitals. It is also evident among traditional circles
      where midwives are not about to give up so lucrative a
      practice <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n185">185</a></sup></font>. In some areas, the
      profession of exciser is inherited from mother to daughter
      and the economic survival of the family depends upon it. If
      the practice were to be eradicated, it would remove the
      family's only source of income. Accordingly, some have
      recommended retraining women who practise excision; as
      matrons, they can give up practicing excision and still earn
      a living <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n186">186</a></sup></font>. Economics plays a role in
      male circumcision as well. In Canada, where medical insurers
      in some Provinces refuse to reimburse the costs of
      circumcision, it appears to be becoming less common <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n187">187</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Also, the dowry is higher if the girl is a virgin at the
      time of her marriage. Virginity is a money-making asset. That
      is why some nations are so keen on infibulation<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n188">188</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>3. Education</h4>
      Nawal El-Saadawi states that the girls with whom she talked
      were not aware of the prejudice caused by their circumcision.
      Some even thought it was good for health and hygiene,
      especially because, in their language, the word taharah means
      purification. 

      <p>Girls believed that the purpose of the surgery was just
      that: purification. People would not speak ill of them, they
      would behave and their husbands would not be disgusted. After
      healing had taken place, they had the inner satisfaction of
      being purified. Nawal El-Saadawi got the same type of
      response from her medical students who had never been taught,
      be it by teachers or by textbooks, the sexual function of the
      clitoris. No question was ever put in exams on the role of
      the clitoris. The clitoris was considered unimportant <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>According to the testimonies gathered by Wedad
      Zenie-Ziegler from Egyptian women, peasants practice female
      circumcision because "it has always been done": they do not
      know why <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n190">190</a></sup></font>. "The idea that it could be
      a mutilation is foreign to them" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n191">191</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p>Wedad Zenie-Ziegler adds that women will "make efforts to
      perpetuate this ritual as long as they do not understand the
      uselessness of the sacrifice and that it is part of an
      immense conspiracy aimed at subjecting them to male
      domination" <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n192">192</a></sup></font>.</p>

      The <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/third/index.html">Third
      International Symposium on Circumcision</a> was held from May
      22-25, 1994, at the University of Maryland, College Park,
      Washington DC. I was invited to the symposium to speak of the
      attitudes of Muslims regarding male and female circumcision
      <font size="2"><sup><a href="#n193">193</a></sup></font>. The
      following report on the symposium gives an idea about the
      problem of male circumcision in the United States.

      <h3>I. ORGANIZERS AND PARTICIPANTS</h3>
      The symposium was organized by NOCIRC <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n194">194</a></sup></font>, and was attended by a
      hundred or so people belonging to the three great
      monotheistic religions (Christians, Jews and Muslims), coming
      from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, England,
      France, Switzerland, Somalia and Egypt. 

      <p>About forty of the symposium attendees delivered speeches,
      which were followed by open debates. We also viewed two
      films, one on male circumcision in the United States, and the
      other on female circumcision in Somalia.</p>

      <p>Every aspect of circumcision was considered: medical,
      psychological, economic, religious and legal. My own speech
      concerned circumcision within Islamic law. It was preceded
      and followed by speeches on circumcision within Christianity
      and Judaism.</p>

      <p>An exposition of photographs and art work was arranged in
      a room where one could also purchase or receive gratis
      numerous materials and publications produced primarily by the
      conference attendees and other groups that attended the
      symposium.</p>

      <p>The symposium concluded on May 25th with a banquet during
      which awards were presented to individuals who had
      contributed to the fight against male and female
      circumcision. On May 26th there was a demonstration in
      Washington DC against circumcision (see below).</p>

      <h3>II. REASONS OF THE SYMPOSIUM</h3>
      As its title indicates, this symposium was the third of its
      kind. Although female circumcision was discussed, this
      symposium principally dealt with male circumcision, which
      demonstrates in itself that this form of circumcision is a
      real problem, especially in the United States. What is the
      nature of this problem? 

      <p>Infant circumcision in the United States began not for
      medical or religious reasons, but for social reasons. It
      began in the 1870s as a Victorian attempt to prevent or cure
      masturbation, which at the time was believed to cause
      bedwetting, alcoholism, insanity, curvature of the spine and
      other physical and mental disorders. The practice spread from
      England concurrently to other English-speaking countries
      (Canada, Australia and the United States).</p>

      <p>When the masturbation theory was dispelled and declared
      false in 1948 by the British National Health Service, the
      rate of circumcision was reduced to less than 0.5% in
      England. The rate of circumcision in Canada and in Australia
      also was lowered, but remains still around 20%.</p>

      <p>In the United States, with the development of hospitalized
      births, male infant circumcision remains a common practice.
      The American medical community has tried to find "medical"
      justifications for the continuation of circumcision. Even
      today, the United States remains the only country on earth
      where the majority of male infants are circumcised for
      non-religious reasons. This rate is today 60% with
      differences from one region to another. Approximately 3'300
      babies each day are submitted to circumcision in American
      hospitals. This represents more than 1'25 million children
      circumcised each year. Several babies die as a consequence of
      the operation, which is performed without anaesthesia, and
      which results in numerous medical complications. Circumcision
      is considered today as one of the reasons for the violence
      which rages in American society, where the crime rate is six
      times larger than that in Europe: That which society does to
      its children, its children do to society. In effect,
      circumcision injures the brain of the child. It also impairs
      the normal functioning of the adult sexuality. On average one
      forth of the skin of the baby's penis is amputated. This has
      forced many Americans to seek restoration of their foreskin
      (see below). Many authorities estimate that the violence done
      to the infant during circumcision plays a role in the fatal
      conflicts in the Middle East between Muslims and Jews, two
      groups that practice circumcision.</p>

      <p>In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics
      has adopted a neutral <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">position</a>
      towards male circumcision, leaving the decision to parents.
      One cannot say, however, that they are properly informed of
      the implication of their decision. Circumcision takes place
      in hospitals in the first days of life. Doctors rarely give
      information on the benefits or risks of the surgery. They
      even exert psychological pressure by expressing disapproval
      when parents refuse to consent to the operation. The
      operation has become a sort of routine, notably in the lower
      and middle classes. It is performed in a barbarous (this word
      is not too strong) manner by doctors with clear financial
      motivations, at the request of ignorant parents, and in any
      case, it is forced upon infants who cannot express their
      wishes in the matter. Certainly, in rare instances,
      circumcision can be useful in the treatment of certain
      diseases like phimosis (but even in this case, there are
      medical means of treatment without resorting to
      circumcision). But the real practice of male circumcision in
      the United States, like everywhere else in the world, denotes
      a trivialization responsible for a contemptuous regard for
      the physical integrity of the child.</p>

      <h3>III. COMBATING MALE CIRCUMCISION BY IDENTIFYING THE
      RESPONSIBLE PARTIES</h3>
      During the symposium, the participants tried to see how one
      could put an end to male circumcision. In order to do this,
      it is necessary to consider the roles of those responsible
      for the practice of circumcision. 

      <h4>1. The doctors</h4>
      Doctors form an imposing body that is very difficult to
      confront. The participants of the symposium expressed little
      confidence in them. One participant indicated that it was
      pointless to try to convince doctors, for like all lobbies,
      they are against society. Doctors profit by the operation of
      circumcision and one can hardly expect them to willingly
      reduce their income. Circumcision and the commerce of the
      foreskin constitutes a lucrative industry in the United
      States, amounting to several hundred million dollars a year.
      Despite this, some doctors have been converted and have
      become opponents of circumcision, especially those at the end
      of their careers who have less to lose. Some came to bring
      their testimony and to argue against circumcision. One of
      these gave to NOCIRC the Circumstraint tray <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n195">195</a></sup></font> on which
      he used to perform circumcisions and delivered an address
      entitled, "Leave it alone!" 

      <h4>2. The nurses</h4>

      <p>Nurses also participate in circumcision. These nurses can
      be easily mobilized against circumcision by reason of the
      atrocious suffering they have witnessed during the
      circumcision of babies. Circumcision is performed without
      anaesthesia. We viewed a film of the operation and heard
      repeatedly the screams of the infant being operated upon. It
      was truly unbearable. It is not an accident that circumcision
      is always performed behind closed doors, the parents not
      being permitted to watch. The baby is strapped by its hands
      and feet and immobilized on a molded plastic tray which
      conforms to its body. The foreskin is pulled to its maximum
      length and crushed by a metal clamp before it is sliced off
      with a scalpel. We saw one of these plastic trays: a
      veritable instrument of torture.</p>

      <p>Nurses, however, fear that they will be relieved of their
      duties and dismissed if as conscientious objectors they
      refuse to participate in the operation. The founder of
      NOCIRC, for example, was a nurse. She lost her job because of
      her opposition to circumcision. Actually, it would seem that
      opposition is now becoming easier to assert. A dozen nurses
      from St. Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, New Mexico (of which
      several were Jewish) <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n196">196</a></sup></font>, were present at the
      symposium and gave us their reasons for taking their
      decision. These reasons are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Neonatal circumcision is a violation of a new-born
        male's right to a whole (intact) body.</li>

        <li>There are no compelling medical reasons for amputation
        of the penile foreskin. Amputating the foreskin deprives
        the infant of a protective and sexually functional part of
        his body.</li>

        <li>Circumcision is a surgical procedure with risks of
        complications, including bleeding, infection and
        mutilation.</li>

        <li>Neonatal circumcision is painful. Often, inadequate or
        no anaesthesia is used. Post-operative pain management is
        rare.</li>

        <li>Parental information on this subject is all too often
        incomplete or based on myths.</li>

        <li>The infant is unable at this vulnerable age to state
        his own wishes or to protect himself.</li>
      </ul>
      The nurses moved everyone in the auditorium to tears. 

      <h4>3. The insurance companies</h4>
      Insurance companies could play an important role in the
      abolition of male circumcision. In Canada, where insurance
      companies refuse to pay the cost of circumcision, the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/Canada/">rate of
      circumcision</a> is falling dramatically. This is also the
      case in certain American states. The organizers and
      participants of the symposium would like to convince the
      insurance companies to cease covering the expense of male
      circumcision. 

      <h4>4. The religions</h4>
      Male circumcision is practiced by the adherents of the three
      monotheistic religions: Jews, Muslims, and Christians. 

      <p>Concerning Jews, the mandate for male circumcision comes
      from the Bible. There one reads:</p>

      <blockquote>
        God told Abraham: "...Here is our alliance which shall be
        observed between me and you, i.e. thy race after thee, may
        all your males be circumcised. You shall have the flesh of
        your foreskin cut off and it shall be a sign of alliance
        between me and you...When they reach their 8th day all your
        males shall be circumcised from generation to generation...
        My alliance shall be branded in your flesh as a perpetual
        alliance. The uncircumcised, the male whose foreskin has
        not been cut off, this very life shall be cut off. He
        violated my alliance" (Genesis 17:9-14).
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is in fact from this community that the fiercest
      opposition to the abolition of circumcision is mounted. The
      so-called "medical" justifications for circumcision were
      formulated principally by Jewish doctors. It would seem even
      that the development of male circumcision among Christians in
      the United States was a premeditated action on the part of
      the Jewish medical community after the second World War. By
      circumcising as many Christians as possible, they sought to
      make it more difficult to distinguish between Jews and
      non-Jews in the event of a future persecution of the Jews. It
      would seem also that there is a hint of Jewish proselytising
      behind circumcision : A circumcised Christian is more easily
      converted to Judaism than an uncircumcised one because he
      will not fear having to submit to circumcision as an adult.
      Notice here that the Western world has passed laws
      prohibiting female circumcision, but dares not to do the same
      for male circumcision for fear that they will be considered
      anti-Semitic by the Jews. One must note, however, that even
      the voice of American Jews is being added to the cry against
      the practice of circumcision (see below).</p>

      <p>Muslims systematically practice male circumcision.
      However, the Koran makes no mention of circumcision. On the
      contrary, one can find verses which can be interpreted as
      being against circumcision:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Our Lord, You did not create all this in vain
        (3:191).</li>

        <li>He perfected everything He created (32:7).</li>

        <li>[The devil said]: "I will mislead them, and I will
        create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the
        ears of cattles, and to deface the fair nature created by
        God" (4:119).</li>
      </ul>
      One can deduce from the first verses that the foreskin is an
      integral part of the human body created by God, and that one
      should not imagine that by cutting it one is perfecting the
      work of God. The third verse considers the alteration of
      Nature as obedience to the Devil. 

      <p>The practice of male circumcision among Muslims derives
      from the practice of the Jews: Each Muslim must be
      circumcised like Abraham, who is considered a model man. One
      invokes also the recitations attributed to Mohammed. These
      recitations, however, were collected 200 years after the
      death of Mohammed.</p>

      <p>Concerning Christians, Saint Paul advocates circumcision
      of the heart instead of circumcision of the flesh (Epistle to
      the Romans 2:29). Despite this, there is a trend among
      evangelical Christians in the United States, who follow the
      Bible to the letter and who believe that this book contains
      principles of medical science which the believer must follow,
      such as circumcision. According to them, "what is good enough
      for the Chosen People, is good enough for all mankind".
      Mormons too practice circumcision even though their holy book
      considers the dictates of the Bible concerning circumcision
      to be obsolete.</p>

      <h4>5. International organizations</h4>
      International organizations refuse to involve themselves in
      this issue. They are afraid of being considered anti-Semitic.
      This is the case notably with the World Health Organization,
      The Population Council of the UN, the Inter-African
      Committee, UNICEF, and Amnesty International. These
      organizations, responsible for overseeing the respect of
      human rights, are always ready to criticize -correctly so -
      female circumcision, but have become accomplices in the
      violation of the rights of male infants to an intact body.
      The fear of anti-Semitism paralyzes them. 

      <h4>6. National legislature: Towards a criminalization of
      Male circumcision</h4>
      Is it necessary to pass a law criminalizing male
      circumcision? This was the question that arose frequently at
      the symposium. Although numerous Jews who are opposed to
      circumcision attended the symposium, they were generally
      against the adoption of such a law. The majority of
      participants, however, were of the opinion that a law should
      be enacted which criminalizes male circumcision along with
      female circumcision. There is no reason to distinguish
      between the two forms of circumcision: both are mutilations
      of healthy sexual organs of non-consenting children. There is
      no justification for such mutilations. If the foreskin were
      useless, Nature would not have make it. It is imperative in
      any case to leave the child intact until the age of 18 when
      he will have the freedom to decide for himself whether he
      wants to be circumcised or not. He is then even free to have
      his ears amputated if he chooses, but one does not have the
      right for forcibly remove his body parts when he is a baby. 

      <p>I was the only lawyer present at the symposium. I
      requested that next time the organizers should invite other
      lawyers and professors of law in order to be able to begin a
      law project with the aim of condemning male and female
      circumcision. I also proposed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>To identify those professors of law who might be
        interested in presenting this subject in their lectures and
        to make available to them the necessary materials;</li>

        <li>to provide law libraries documents to enable
        researchers to make further studies in this area.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Certainly, the adoption of a law criminalizing male
      circumcision would provoke the anger and opposition of the
      Jews. But if a law were adopted, the United States would be
      the first to be able to do so because of its unconditional
      support of Israel. This is the only country which need have
      no fear of being considered anti-Semitic, and it is in this
      country that opposition to circumcision is the best
      organized.</p>

      <h3>IV. HOW TO RESTORE THE FORESKIN</h3>
      This title may cause laughter. It is actually a technique
      known in the past, notably in the Hellenistic Period (323-30
      B.C.) and the Roman Empire (27 B.C. to 140 A.D.). It is being
      revived in the United States. 

      <p>This technique starts with the viewpoint that male
      circumcision is an affront to the physical integrity and an
      impairment of the normal functioning of the male organ,
      especially when a large part of the foreskin is amputated.
      This technique consists in stretching the skin of the penis
      in order to compensate for the parts removed in circumcision.
      One must pull the skin of the penis and tape it in place in
      the first stage before suspending metallic objects of a
      certain fixed weight using surgical tape. The process takes
      about 15 months before the skin of the penis returns to the
      length it would have had had it not been circumcised.</p>

      <p>This technique was used by Jim Bigelow on himself and on
      others <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n197">197</a></sup></font>. Jim Bigelow is not a
      physician, but a psychologist. He earned his doctorate in
      psychology at Claremont Graduate School and served as a
      Professor of Psychology at Whittier College. He also pastored
      several Evangelical churches. He has explained this technique
      in a book <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n198">198</a></sup></font>. I bought this book, which
      is full of observations not only about restoration of the
      foreskin, but also about circumcision in general, notably as
      it is practised in the United States. It is a scientific
      publication, 239 pages long, very serious and heavily
      documented. It is probably the most vibrant attack on male
      circumcision ever written.</p>

      <p>Jim Bigelow is a charming man, full of humor. He was
      present at the symposium. He delivered a speech using many
      slides. He did not hesitate to mention his history of success
      and confessed to me at the end that he wrote the book in the
      spirit of Christian charity. The restoration of the foreskin
      using his method was successfully achieved by hundreds of
      circumcised men, not only Christians, but also Jews (a fact
      which has not failed to provoke the anger of Rabbis).
      Received at first with skepticism by the medical community,
      his publication and his technique has ended by being
      recognized. Several Europeans have tried it. Two doctors even
      came to the symposium from Australia. Testimony from numerous
      Christians and Jews in the auditorium offered support to Jim
      Bigelow, and confessed that they experienced an enormous
      increase in sexual pleasure after restoration. Furthermore,
      many support groups for circumcised men wishing to restore
      their foreskin exist all over the United States, and even in
      Europe with the mission of providing free advice and moral
      support <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n199">199</a></sup></font>. <a id="Demonstrate"
      name="Demonstrate"></a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>V. DEMONSTRATION IN WASHINGTON</h3>
      On the 26 of May the organizers of the symposium and the
      participants made a demonstration in Washington in front of
      the Physicians Committee for responsible medicine (P.O.Box
      6322, Washington DC 20015). Many participants brought with
      them copies of their birth certificates, signed by the doctor
      who circumcised them. In front of this organization they
      burned their birth certificates along with copies of the
      Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which does not protect
      the rights of children against sexual mutilation. As this
      organization is situated across the street from a national
      television station, several photographers and cameramen were
      present at the demonstration. 

      <p>The director of the organization (Mr. Neal Barnard, M. D.)
      asked that the demonstrators form a committee to meet him.
      The president of <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a>,
      the president of NOHARMM <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n200">200</a></sup></font>, two other members of
      NOCIRC, a Jewish nurse, who is a conscientious objector who
      refuses to participate in circumcision, and myself (a
      Christian of Palestinian origin) were selected. The
      discussion lasted about 45 minutes.</p>

      <p>The director was very nice and allowed each a chance to
      speak. I introduced myself as a Swiss Lawyer, a Christian of
      Palestinian origin, and the nurse introduced herself as an
      American Jew, proud to be in my company as a Palestinian.
      This served to relax the director. He said that there were so
      many medical problems to regulate in the United States that
      he could not take up the problem of circumcision without
      ignoring some other problem. He also mentioned the budget
      problem, to which we replied, that by beginning with respect
      for the child, he would have less to bother with and at the
      same time would save a lot of money. As for our goals, we
      told him that it was necessary to educate parents and to make
      a law forbidding male as well as female circumcision. The
      child does not give his consent, and in the case of
      circumcision the parents cannot give such consent. In any
      case, in order for the parents to give valid consent, it is
      necessary that they be informed, which is never the case in
      the United States. I expressed my indignation at the high and
      unjustified rate of circumcision performed in the United
      States; a practice which violates the same human rights which
      the United States pretend to defend.</p>

      <p>After leaving the meeting with the director, the Jewish
      nurse and I declared before the cameras that this marked the
      very first time in human history that a Jew and a Palestinian
      stood united to protect each others children instead of
      killing them as in the Middle East. We were very proud
      indeed.</p>

      <p>This feeling of pride was shared by all the participants
      of the symposium. All had the sense of being pioneers and
      that taking this position had historic significance. It is
      the first time in history that a group has decided to fight
      to put an end to a practice unanimously considered to be
      barbaric and degrading.</p>

      <p>The various speeches of the symposium are being published.
      I fervently hope that the European medical community will
      take an interest in this research and will take a position
      against both male and female circumcision. I especially hope
      that European nurses will follow the example of the
      courageous Santa Fe nurses and will refuse to assist in any
      more circumcisions.</p>

      <p><a id="Conclusion" name="Conclusion"></a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <center>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      </center>
      In our opinion, a God who demands that his believers be
      mutilated and branded on their genitals the same as cattle,
      is a God of questionable ethics. It could be legitimate to
      perform either male or female circumcision, as any other
      surgery, for specific, extremely rare, medical reasons on
      specific individuals. But to arbitrarily mutilate children,
      boys or girls, under the pretext that it is for their own
      good, shows an influence of cynicism and fanaticism. 

      <p>That is why there is no valid justification of the
      distinction made between male and female circumcision. Doctor
      Zwang goes further: "Female circumcision will never stop as
      long as male circumcision is going on. How do you expect to
      convince an African father to leave his daughter
      uncircumcised as long as you let him do it to his son?"<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n201">201</a></sup></font> There is
      no alternative but to condemn the attitude of international
      and non-governmental organizations which dissociate one type
      of circumcision from the other, giving legitimacy to male
      circumcision in the process.</p>

      <p>Religion has been a means of justifying both male and
      female circumcision. It is time to expose the irrationality
      behind this thinking and reveal the harmful influence of some
      religious circles which are in favour of it or refuse to
      denounce it.</p>

      <p>That is the goal of this study which, I hope, will
      contribute to the respect of the rights of all children.</p>

       <a id="n4" name="n4"></a> 4 The term female circumcision is
      used by the WHO (World Health Organization). Its "position
      relative to female circumcision" was submitted in June 1982
      to the United Nations Sub-Committee for Prevention of
      Discrimination against and Protection of Minorities, Workshop
      on Slavery. At the Conference on Traditional Practices, Addis
      Abeba, 1990, the delegates considered that the terms "female
      circumcision and excision could lead to confusion and
      possibly could not fully describe the different methods used
      for the practice". They recommended that they be replaced by
      female genital mutilations (Report on Traditional Practices,
      Addis Abeba, 1990, p. 8).<br />

      their support and encouragement in the preparation of this

       <a id="n7" name="n7"></a> 7 One should take note here that
      neither Rifa'ah Al-Tahtawi (1801-1873) nor Qassim Amin
      (1863-1908), two prominent personalities in the 19th-century
      fight for women's liberation, ever mentioned the issue of
      female circumcision.<br />
       <a id="n8" name="n8"></a> 8 I have studied many juridical
      works in Arabic relative to the penal code and to the
      protection of the child. Some of those papers devote a few
      lines to the phenomenon, drawing a line between excessive
      circumcision and minimal circumcision, the latter being
      considered a part of the prophetical sunnah (see for example
      Muhammad, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Gawwad: Himayat al-umumah
      wal-tufulah fil-mawathiq al-duwaliyyah wal-shari'ah
      al-islamiyyah, Mansha'at al-ma'arif, Alexandria, 1991, pp. 92
      and 136-137). As customary in the Arab world, those works
      compare public international law to the Muslim law, stating
      that Muslim law preceded international documents in regard to
      the protection of the child (Ibid, pp. 15 and 251).<br />

       <a id="n17" name="n17"></a> 17 On April 9,1981, the Belgian
      Department of Public Prosecutions declared male and female
      circumcision an assault on physical integrity and
      consequently contrary to the Belgian International Public
      Order; thus male circumcision should not be protected under
      the guarantee of freedom of religion. This decision was
      rejected by the Court of Appeal in Liege, which considered
      excision and infibulation to be of a different nature than
      male circumcision (without explaining how). Any physician who
      would practiced circumcision would be guaranteed medical
      immunity. However, the Court rejected a request from an
      Algerian father who wanted his son circumcised. The son, a
      minor, whose Belgian mother had been granted custody, had
      been baptised in the Catholic faith. In this specific case,
      the respect of the rights of the child demanded respect for
      his right to chose which ideology, religious or
      non-denominational, to embrace once he becomes an adult.

      the Israeli army in its repression of Palestinians often aims
      at their genitals. In a letter dated November 29, 1988,
      received by a priest in Jerusalem, one reads: "Witnesses
      often see the Army beating up boys on their private parts
      (lately in Ramallah and all around). The victims do not dare
      to talk too much about it, but they are not men any more,
      their mothers say. Isn't this a form of genocide ?" (Aldeeb

      'Abd-al-Razzaq quotes comments by Christ out of the Gospel
      according to Barnabe: Adam, after his sin, swore to cut his
      body. The Archangel Gabriel is said to have reprimanded him.
      As he was unwilling to commit perjury, the Archangel is said
      to have shown him the foreskin which he then cut off.
      Therefore, according to 'Abd-al-Razzaq, "each of Adam's
      descendant must fulfil Adam's oath and be circumcised".

      one of the narrations, some of Mohammed's companions were
      taking part in a razzia. As they were experiencing
      deprivation, they asked Mohammed if they could castrate
      themselves. Mohammed forbade it. Commenting on the narration,
      Ibn-Hagar wrote: "Emasculation brings among other damage much
      suffering and deformity as well as a probability of death; it
      deprives someone of his manhood and transforms God's
      creation. It is ungratefulness toward God's blessings because
      to be created a man is one of God's supreme blessings.
      Without it, the man looks like a woman and in fact chooses
      imperfection versus perfection". According to other
      commentators, the interdiction comes from the fact that
      castration changes the creation and brings an end to having
      progeny (Ibn-al-Dardir, Abd-al-'Aziz: <i>Li-maslahat man
      tahdid al-nasl wa-tanzimuh</i>, Maktabat al-Qur'an, Cairo,

       <a id="n96" name="n96"></a> 96 Jewish male circumcision was
      banned on several occasions through the centuries. Closer to
      us, it was banned in Strasbourg, France, in 1793 after the
      establishment of the Cult of Reason. In Russia, Jewish and
      Moslem circumcision was fought against by the Bolshevist
      Revolution, but for the same reason as any other religious
      practice. Tendencies can be found favouring exemption from
      this practice for converts to Judaism in order to help
      proselytism (already during the 2nd Century). In the middle
      of the 19th Century, the Judaic German Reform urged the
      abolition of mandatory circumcision for new-born Jews. In
      spite of the failure of this attempt in Frankfurt, Germany,
      in 1843, the American Reformed Judaism, some 40 years later,
      adopted the official policy that non-circumcised converts be
      accepted (Erlich, Michel: <i>Les mutilations sexuelles</i>,
      Presses Universitaires de France, Paris, 1991, pp.
      110-113).<br />

      the use of drugs in the Arab and Moslem world" (Fangari:
      Al-tib, op. cit., p. 144). Doctor Mahran writes: "Excision is
      one of the causes of the ever increasing use of hashish among
      men who believe, albeit wrongly, that smoking it delays
      ejaculation, giving men their orgasms at the same time as
      their excised wives: 16% of excised women admit that their
      husbands smoke hashish for sexual reasons". (Mahran: Les

       <a id="n167" name="n167"></a> 167 This declaration,
      formulated after Mr. Edmond Kaiser's intervention, states: We
      ask every physician in a hospital or private practice to be
      very attentive to the content of the following
      Declaration.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <font size="2">The Central Committee for Medical Ethics of
        the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences,<br />
         - attentive to the fact that some parents coming from
        countries where ritual practices of sexual mutilation are
        performed on women, are trying to get their children
        admitted into our hospitals or day surgery clinics in order
        to have those types of surgery performed,<br />
         - preoccupied by the fact that one might be tempted to
        accede to such demands for reasons of misconceived
        compassion or other badly thought out reasons,<br />
         - convinced that such procedures, performed according to
        customs in opposition to our ethical principles concerning
        minors unable to judge by themselves, are cruel and
        degrading, and convinced that they contradict the eminently
        personal right to physical integrity and as such constitute
        an infraction automatically prosecuted as serious bodily
        assault according to article 122, numeral 1, paragraph 2 of
        the Swiss Penal Code,<br />
         declares:<br />
         - Anyone, be it a physician and practicing in clinical
        conditions beyond reproach, who performs sexual mutilations
        on children and teenagers of the female gender, is guilty
        of serious deliberate bodily assault according to article
        122 of the Swiss Penal Code. This person therefore must be
        prosecuted automatically.<br />
         - Moreover, this person violates the fundamental rights of
        a human being in performing a degrading and cruel procedure
        on a minor incapable of judgement and who is unable to
        enforce her own claim to the right to physical
        integrity.<br />
         - Whoever collaborates in such a procedure becomes an
        accomplice under the criminal law and, generally speaking,
        is guilty of the violation of human rights.<br />
         - The guilty parties and their accomplices, doctors and
        auxiliary nursing staff, are moreover violating in the most
        serious way, the moral principles applicable to the
        exercise of their duties. (Declaration published in
        Bulletin des m&eacute;decins suisses, Vol. 64, 1983,
        notebook 34, 24.8.1983, p. 1275).</font>

      One can see the same problem in another document against
      circumcision: Al-Dareer, Asma' 'Abd-al-Rahman: <i>Murshid
      muharabat al-khifad</i>, Khartoum, 1982, p. 5.<br />
       <a id="n173" name="n173"></a> 173 According to another
      source, a decree from the Ministry of Health on June 24,
      1959, created a committee in charge of studying female
      circumcision in Egypt as well as its religious, sanitary and
      social aspects. This committee then took the decision
      mentioned above, but the first paragraph should be read as:
      "It is forbidden for anyone but a physician to practice
      excision". . . . A fourth paragraph is added: "Excision as it
      is practiced in Egypt today has harmful consequences for
      women before and after marriage. As the religious authorities
      have decided that it is contrary to Islamic dogma to practice
      total excision of sexual organs, it is not therefore a ritual
      of Islam" (Report on Traditional Practices, Dakar, 1984, p.
      88).<br />
