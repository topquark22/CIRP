      <p><font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">About 80% of the world's male population
      remains uncircumcised: most male circumcision is now
      practised for religious reasons, largely in Moslem and Jewish
      communties [<a href="#n1">1-3</a>]. One major exception is
      America and it is often assumed that America is the only
      country where circumcision is practiced for no major
      religious reason [<a href="#n1">1-3</a>]. This belief is only
      partly true, for South Korea probably has the highest
      circumcision rate among those not Moslem or Jewish.
      Furthermore, South Korea has possibly the largest absolute
      number of teenage or adult circumcisions anywhere in the
      world. At present, South Korea is the only country that
      practises routine male circumcision among its immediate
      geographical and cultural neighbours. For instance, the vast
      majority of the population in Russia, Mongolia, China and
      Japan do not practise circumcision. (PY Yu, T Ishihara, I
      Brener, W Shan, private communication).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Throughout their long history, Koreans did not circumcise
      males until 1945, when Korea gained its independence after 36
      years of Japanese occupation. Independence brought
      trusteeship by the American military in the southern half of
      the country. Many thousands of American troops were involved
      in the Korean War, starting from its outbreak in 1950, and
      remain heavily involved in the military institutions. The
      present day routine circumcision of teenage and adult males,
      as well as infant boys in South Korea, has its roots in this
      American involvement; 1950 can be safely regarded as the year
      when widescale circumcision started in South Korea.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      this article, preliminary statistics on the rate of
      circumcision in Korean males of various age groups and the
      age at which it is practised are reported. The wide range of
      individual reasons for being circumcised or remaining intact
      will be reviewed. In addition, the origin of the current
      situation is investigated by assessing previous Korean
      studies, recent newspaper articles and textbooks.</p>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>Circumcision rates with
      age</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">We surveyed the circumcision rate and the
      time at which the procedure was performed in four different
      age groups, i.e. group I, 16-29 years old; II, 30-39, III,
      40-49, and IV, 50-79. The response sample sizes are shown in
      Table 1. The survey was concluded largely by the authors,
      taking the questionnaires to interviewers in the Seoul area
      (mostly on the street) and concentrating on those aged 16-39
      years, for these groups reflect the most recent trend in the
      circumcision rate. Older groups reflect the situation in the
      past and from these individuals, the point when Korean
      circumcision began could be identified. Table 1 shows the
      circumcision statistics for the four age groups. If those
      individuals who wish to be circumcised later are included,
      the rate is as high as 91% in group I. The rate decreases
      with increasing age and among those 50-79 years old, it is
      about 50%. The rate of circumcised males plus those who wish
      to be circumcised later is plotted against the median ages of
      groups I-IV in Fig. 1. The decrease in circumcision rate with
      increasing age suggests that circumcision is a recently
      acquired custom. To investigate this and related issues
      further, we examined the approximate age at which the
      operation was performed.</p>

      </center>

      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1.gif" alt="Figure 2" /></p>
      </center>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>Age at circumcision and the origin of
      Korean circumcision</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">Table 1 also shows the results from the
      survey of circumcised men for their age at operation; while
      most males in group I were circumcised before age 18, the
      reverse is true for the remaining groups. In group I,
      circumcision was carried out at various ages, with a peak
      during their elementary and middle-school years. Most of the
      interviewees said that they were circumcised during the
      summer and winter breaks, mainly because they had to be at
      home for at least a week after the operation. In addition,
      the percentage of those circumcised before 18 years old
      decreases dramatically with increasing age (Fig. 2).
      Therefore it is likely that most of those in group IV had not
      heard of circumcision until they were well into adulthood,
      which again suggests that circumcision is a very recent
      phenomenon in Korean history. This was verified by
      interviewing seven men aged 69-79 years; three were
      circumcised and four were not. All were born and began
      puberty during Japanese colonial rule, which ended in 1945.
      None had heard of circumcision during the Japanese occupation
      or during the American military trusteeship. All became aware
      of circumcision during or after the Korean War and one was
      circumcised while serving in the Korean military during his
      military service in the late 1950s. One 79-year-old man said
      that although circumcision was first introduced during the
      Korean war, the main increase occurred during the 1960s when
      many newspapers published articles about circumcision,
      largely about its various medical and sexual benefits. For
      this reason he was circumcised when he at the age of ~48
      years after all his children were born.</p>

      <center>
        <p><img src="fig2.gif" alt="Figure 2" /></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From
      the results shown in Table 1 and Figs 1 and 2, aided by
      interviewing older men, we can conclusively determine the
      Korean War as the onset of widespread Korean circumcision. As
      American military personnel were by far the most dominant
      foreign influence during the Korean War, it can be deduced
      that the American influence was essential in starting Korean
      circumcision.</p>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>Reasons for remaining uncircumcised: the
      uniquely Korean concept of 'naturally
      circumcised"</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">Because the circumcision rate is so high,
      especially among younger men, the authors asked uncircumcised
      males who intended to remain so why they chose that option.
      Of 571 individuals who were questioned, 92 were in this
      group; as there was no significant difference between the age
      groups, these individuals were analysed together. By far the
      largest proportion (Table 2) said that they were 'naturally
      circumcised'; one individual felt it was 'God's will' that he
      should remain uncircumcised, while two reported never hearing
      of the term circumcision.</p>

      <center>
        <p><img src="table2.gif" alt="Table 2" /></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      term 'naturally circumcised' features prominently in Korean
      popular language, but this term might be hard to understand
      for non-Koreans. There is no medical term that corresponds
      precisely with this term; its meanings could differ among
      different individuals using the term. By 'naturally
      circumcised' a Korean man could be saying any one or several
      of the following: (i) he does not have 'phimosis'; (ii) he
      has a relatively short prepuce but not 'phimosis'; (iii) his
      prepuce is fully retractable when the penis is erect and
      therefore looks the same as a circumcised penis; (iv) his
      penis looks more or less the same as a circumcised penis even
      when not erect. Importantly, the man may not have 'phimosis'
      but still feel that he is not 'naturally circumcised'. This
      was verified by interviewing 40 men in their 30s who were
      circumcised after puberty; none reported having had phimosis,
      but still decided to be circumcised. While this low rate of
      phimosis is consistent with the low rate among Japanese males
      [<a href="#n4">4</a>], many still felt that their prepuces
      were too long and therefore not 'naturally circumcised', and
      thus needed the operation. It is plausible that many of the
      22 men who reported that they felt 'no need to be
      circumcised' also meant that they were 'naturally
      circumcised'. Therefore many uncircumcised males who wish to
      remain so feel that they can be classified as 'circumcised'
      with no need for the operation. The two individuals who
      preferred to 'remain natural' were probably well informed;
      both were highly educated and had noticed while living in
      Europe and Japan, that Europeans and Japanese were
      uncircumcised. The two who were afraid of pain obviously felt
      that they needed to be circumcised, but that need was offset
      by their unwillingness to undergo pain.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus
      we conclude that even among uncircumcised males who would
      likely remain so, many think that circumcision is still
      mandatory but that they belong to the statistically few who
      have very short prepuces, so that they view themselves as
      'naturally circumcised'.</p>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>Reasons for being
      circumcised</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">We asked those who were circumcised (450)
      or wished to be circumcised later (30, total 480) why they
      felt that they had to be circumcised; the results are
      summarized in Table 2. When citing medical or hygienic
      benefits, they mentioned prevention of cervical cancer in
      their wives, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases,
      advantags in penile cleaning, and prevention of premature
      ejaculation. Therefore, it is clear that some men, when
      mentioning 'medical benefit' actually mean enhancement of
      sexuality. Therefore, there could be a significant overlap
      between 'medical benefits' and 'enhancement of sexualty' as
      reasons for being circumcised. Note that 'not naturally
      circumcised' does not mean the presence of phimosis, as
      discussed previously. Indeed, all 39 men who cited 'not
      naturally circumcised' said they had fully retractable
      foreskins. Therefore, what is most likely to be meant by 'not
      being naturally circumcised' in this case is that they felt
      that their foreskins are too long. That none of the 39 men
      who supposedly not 'naturally circumcised' had phimosis is
      consistent with a previous Korean study that showed only 0.9%
      of men 19-31 years old had phimosis[<a href="#n5">5</a>].
      Interestingly, the various medical benefits cited by
      circumcised men largely reproduce the opinions held by some
      Americans, many of which are now controversial [<a
      href="#n6">6</a>] and in some cases possibly invalid (as in
      the case of premature ejaculation). This again supports our
      deduction that Korean circumcision originated through
      American influence.</p>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>What the interviewees knew or did not
      know</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">We asked some of the interviewees whether
      they knew that mose of the world's male population remains
      uncircumcised; of 194 who were asked, only two were vaguely
      aware of this fact. One had personally witnessed in a
      Japanese public bathhouse, that Japanese men were not
      circumcised. Another asked his European friends and was
      surprised to discover that Europeans are generally not
      circumcised. All the remaining 192 individuals were very
      surprised to hear that circumcision is by no means
      universally practised. They implicitly or explicitly assumed
      that circumcision is mandatory, and therefore that all the
      world's male population is circumcised. It is possible that
      many Korean doctors might share this belief, implicitly or
      explicitly. For instance, most interviewees received little
      advice from doctors about whether they should be circumcised.
      Mot simply visited the doctor's office and underwent surgery.
      Five interviewees performed the surgery on themselves, using
      a 'self-operating' circumcision instrument. In addition, we
      asked those who were aged 16-29 years whether they knew when
      the Korean practice of circumcision started; none had an
      answer. Conversely, when we indicated that it could be the
      onset of the Korean War, most found this conclusion
      reasonable. Therefore in 50 years, virtually all Koreans have
      come to believe that circumcision is universally practised
      throughout the world. This is in sharp contrast to the
      situation 50 years ago; then none had heard of circumcision,
      other than in a Biblical context.</p>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>Previous studies on Korean
      circumcision.</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">There is one previous study by a Korean
      investigator [<a href="#n5">5</a>] on male circumcision; we
      were unable to find any other studies of circumcision
      published in an international journal ad performed by Korean
      researchers. The study group in the one known study [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>] comprised men 19-31 years old who were
      examined for military service. At the time of the study
      (1971) only 5% of the sample group were circumcised. Most of
      the remaining 95% of uncircumcised males would probably have
      eventually been circumcised. In addition, 0.9% of this study
      group had phimosis; this low rate of phimosis is consistent
      with those of European, Japanese and American studies in
      adults [<a href="#n4">4,7-9</a>]. An interesting observation
      was that of the uncircumcised Korean men, 90% had an abnormal
      'redundant prepuce' and therefore required circumcision.
      Since that study, the term 'redundant prepuce' has been
      largely replaced in Korean popular language and in medical
      articles by another term, 'pseudo-phimosis'.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      view in the Korean study [<a href="#n5">5</a>] is helpful in
      understanding the meaning of 'naturally circumcised', i.e.
      that the normal prepuce in uncircumcised men should look
      similar to circumcised men. According to the study, a
      'normal' prepuce implies an extremely short prepuce, which
      the author claimed occurred in 9.6% of uncircumcised men.
      Therefore while most of the uncircumcised men who do not have
      phimosis still need to be circumcised because their prepuces
      are too long ('redundant' prepuce or pseudo-phimosis), 9.4%
      have a sufficiently short prepuce to be considered 'normal'
      and therefore 'naturally circumcised'. With this study in
      mind, it is perhaps coincidence that ~11% of the present
      interviewees claim that they are 'naturally circumcised';
      this proportion agrees well with the 9.4% quoted in [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>].</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Another study was conducted by a US military surgeon while
      stationed in Korea between 1985 and 1987 [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]; this study reported cultural differences
      between the American soldiers and Korean auxilliaries
      attached to the US Army (KATUSAS) in their reasons for
      requesting circumcision. While both groups tended to have
      similar medical symptoms (or lack thereof), the KATUSAS were
      more likely to equate circumcision with adulthood, peer
      pressure, expectation of reduced sexually transmitted
      diseases and improved sexual satisfaction. This condition is
      entirely consistent with that discussed previously.</p>
      <br />
       &nbsp; 

      <p><font size="4"><b>Information from Korean
      Doctors</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">As far as we are aware, there has been no
      article on circumcision written by a Korean doctor and
      published in an international journal. Thus we must rely
      largely on articles published by doctors in the lay press to
      determine their views on circumcision. This attitude apparent
      in [<a href="#n5">5</a>], i.e. to classify both the very
      small percentage of males with phimosis and most of those
      with normal uncircumcised prepuces as 'abnormal', seems to
      have changed little over recent years. Therefore, most
      sources are very much in favor of universal circumcision and
      the question is not whether a male should be circumcised but
      when the operation should be performed. For instance a
      popular textbook [<a href="#n11">11</a>] states that
      'Phimosis or redundant (long) prepuce may cause: (i) penile
      or cervical cancer, (ii) increased susceptibility to various
      sexually transmitted diseases; (iii) bad smells in the penis;
      (iv) premature ejaculation'. While offering no references for
      the origin of these statements, this text mentions the
      supposedly lower penile cancer rates in Jews and Moslems
      compared with Hindus. Most of these beliefs are still held by
      some Americans. Most are controversial, e.g. the association
      with cervical cancer [<a href="#n6">6</a>]. In America,
      premature ejaculation is seldom if ever mentioned as a
      justification for circumcision, whereas in Korea, the belief
      in the enhancement of sexuality through circumcision is very
      popular, not only among the general public but also
      apparently in the medical community. A popular Korean website
      advises, with no reference, that 'nearly all Korean males
      need circumcision'. The same website states, 'there is no
      specific age at which circumcision should be performed'.
      Another popular website advises, with no reference, that
      'nearly all Korean males need circumcision'. Another popular
      website [<a href="#n12">12</a>] providing sexual education
      for teenagers states that the best age for circumcision is
      known to be between 12 and 14 years', again with no reference
      cited. Yet another site advises parents that 'if a child
      feels different because he is not circumcised and his friends
      boast of having a superior penis because of circumcision, it
      is good to have him circumcised for psychological reasons'.
      In one widely read Korean encyclopaedia it is stated that 'if
      prematurely ejaculating, circumcision must be performed' and
      'cervical cancer should be prevented through circumcision'.
      For comparison, a recent edition of the Encyclopaedia
      Britannica mentions nothing about premature ejaculation or
      cervical cancer, and states that the practice is in decline
      even in America.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      also instructive to consider some of the leading newspaper
      articles on circumcision. Although these articles might not
      best reflect the general attitude of the Korean medical
      community, most are written by popular urologists, or refer
      to them. These articles no doubt influence popular beliefs
      about circumcision and therefore warrant consideration,
      especially because they help to understand why most males
      choose to be circumcised. Some of these titles are listed in
      Appendix 1. A relatively liberal position taken by Korean
      doctors on circumcision can be found in a recent textbook [<a
      href="#n14">14</a>] in which the authors state that 'not
      every male needs to be circumcised'. It is apparent that
      nearly all textbooks, encyclopaedias and newspaper articles
      essentially advocate universal or near-universal
      circumcision, and the debate is about when rather than
      whether to be circumcised.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      clear that the beliefs held by the Korean public and medical
      community were directly influenced by the beliefs of
      Americans in the past and, to a lesser degree, at present. It
      is interesting as to why Koreans are circumcised at much
      later ages, after popular medical advice. At the start of
      Korean circumcision, nearly all procedures were performed on
      adults. Therefore, it is possible that simply by habit, the
      operation is performed mostly on older males and not on
      infants. Currently, many Korean doctors tend to recommend
      circumcision mostly at the onset of puberty.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
      appears that the recently changing American attitudes toward
      circumcision have exerted some indirect influence. There are
      numerous American studies on the pain felt by infants when
      circumcised and this is a cause for debate. When recommending
      circumcision at specific ages, Korean doctors routinely cite
      recent American studies that show that even infants feel the
      pain. It seems that Koreann doctors recommend circumcision at
      the onset of puberty because at that age boys tend to accept
      the procedure as a 'rite of passage'. One recent newspaper
      article by a urologist states that 'these days, even in
      America, the neonatal circumcision rate is declining and only
      about 60% are neonatally circumcised because infants also
      feel pain'. This urologist goes on to recommend near
      universal circumcision at the onset of puberty. However, it
      is possible that this doctor assumed that most of the
      uncircumcised American infants would later be circumcised.
      This assumption goes against the present American situation
      where the decision about circumcision is made primarily at
      birth and not later.</p>

       &nbsp; Conclusion</b></font></p>

      <p align="justify">Most Korean males are circumcised not in
      infancy but at puberty, as teenagers or in their 20s. There
      are several unique characteristics in Korean circumcision, of
      which the world medical community seems to be largely
      unaware. They are: (i) it is a custom recently acquired
      through contact with Americans, and no older than 50 years;
      (ii) during this relatively short time, most Korean males
      were circumcised and for those in their 20s, the circumcision
      rate is now &gt;90%; (iii) unlike in America, it is seldom
      practised in infancy; (iv) the current situation occurred
      with little open debate and the decision to be circumcised;
      (v) while circumcision in Korea has no religious background,
      it is nevertheless practised during adolescence, largely
      initiated by peer pressure. Therefore, it has partly become a
      'rite of passage' and is fully integrated into present Korea
      culture; (vi) the medical justification offered by doctors
      seems to be acquired from the initial contact with the
      American practices of circumcision and therefore largely
      reproduce previous, now controversial, American beliefs;
      (vii) it appears that the recent decrease in American
      circumcision is being interpreted by some of the South Korean
      medical community as universally recommending a later
      procedure.</p>

      Finally, although the subjects interviewed were exclusively
      from the Seoul area, most of the present population of Seoul
      was born outside of the city. As Seoul is very metropolitan
      the population sampled probable reflects the general trend in
      the rest of Korea. A more extensive and detailed study of the
      circumcision rate at various ages, the regional and
      educational differences, etc., is being undertaken by the
      authors.</p>

      ritual bath upon his death!<br />
       <i>Danger!: Self-Operating Circumcision Machine</i><br />
       (SeGye Ilbo, August 15, 1996)<br />
       <i>The time to be circumcised: Is it when a baby is born, or
      is it around 10 years of age? Medical Community sharply
      divided.</i><br />
       (Segye Ilbo, Aus. 12, 1995)<br />
       <i>Premature Ejaculation</i> (states that 'phimosis or long

      to prevent cervical cancer, the male partner must be
      circumcised.</p>
