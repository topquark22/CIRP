      <blockquote>
        <p><tt><b>CIRCUMCISION</b> (Heb. milah), removal of the
        foreskin in an operation performed on all male Jewish
        children on the eighth day after birth and also upon male
        converts to Judaism. Circumcision was enjoined by God upon
        Abraham and his descendants (Gn. 17.10-12) and has always
        been regarded as the supreme obligatory sign of loyalty and
        adherence to Judaism. As the sign of the *covenant (berit)
        "sealed in the flesh," circumcision came to be known as
        berit milah or the "covenant of our father
        Abraham."</tt></p>

        <p><tt>The presence of the foreskin was regarded as a
        blemish, and perfection was to be attained by its removal
        (cf. Ned. 31b). The generation born in the wilderness,
        however, was not circumcised, an omission repaired by
        Joshua (Jos. 5.2-9). Many Hellenistic Jews, particularly
        those who participated in athletics at the gymnasium, had
        an operation performed to conceal the fact of their
        circumcision (I Me. 1.15). Similar action was taken during
        the Hadrianic persecution, in which period a prohibition
        against circumcision was issued. It was probably in order
        to prevent the possibility of obliterating the traces of
        circumcision that the rabbis added to the requirement of
        cutting the foreskin that of peri'ah (laying bare the
        glans).</tt></p>

        <p><tt>To this was added a third requirement, metsitsah
        (sucking of the blood). This was originally done by the
        mohel (circumciser) applying his lips to the penis and
        drawing off the blood by sucking. For hygienic reasons, a
        glass tube with a wad of cotton wool inserted in the middle
        is now generally employed, or the blood is simply drawn off
        by the use of some absorbent material.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>Unless medical reasons interpose, the circumcision
        must take place on the eighth day after birth, even if that
        day falls on a Sabbath or Yom Kippur. If circumcision has
        been postponed for medical reasons, the ceremony may not
        take place on a Sabbath or major festival.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>The only exception permitted to the otherwise
        universal requirement of circumcision is if two previous
        children of the family have died as a result of the
        operation: that is, in cases of hereditary hemophilia. The
        duty of circumcising the child is the responsibility of the
        father. In his absence or in case of his failure to do so,
        the religious authorities are bound to see that it is
        performed.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>The occasion of a circumcision is regarded as a
        festive event for the whole community and takes place,
        where possible, in the presence of a minyan. If one of the
        participants (the father, godfather, or mohel) is in
        synagogue on that day, all penitential and supplicatory
        prayers are omitted. A sentence in the prayer of Elijah (I
        Kgs, 19.10), "for the children of Israel have forsaken your
        covenant," was understood by the rabbis to mean that the
        Israelites had abandoned the rite of circumcision, which is
        always referred to (on the basis of Gn. 17.9) as the berit
        (covenant). Elijah is regarded as the patron of
        circumcision, and it is said that his spirit is present at
        all circumcisions. This is the origin of the chair of
        Elijah (see ELIJAH. CHAIR OF), now an integral part of the
        ceremony. In eastern communities, and in Hasidic groups,
        where the ceremony takes place in the synagogue, such a
        chair is a permanent feature of synagogue
        appurtenances.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>Among Ashkenazim, it is customary to appoint a
        couple as kvatter (godparents). The godmother carries the
        child from his mother's room to the room in which the
        ceremony will take place and gives him to the child's
        father, who, in turn, hands him to the mohel.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>The mohel places the child upon the chair of Elijah
        and proclaims, "this is the chair of Elijah, may he be
        remembered for good." He then lifts up the child, places
        him upon a cushion in the lap of the godfather (*sandaq),
        and, in this position, after the mohel recites the
        appropriate blessings, the operation is performed.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>The father also recites a blessing to God "who has
        sanctified us by his commandments and commanded us to enter
        our sons into the covenant of Abraham." According to some
        authorities, the father also says the *She-Hebeyanu
        blessing. The mohel then recites a prayer dating from
        geonic times, in the course of which a name is bestowed on
        the child. The circumcision ceremony is normally followed
        by a Se'udat Mitsvah, a meal of religious character.
        Special hymns are sung, and blessings for the parents, the
        sandaq, the child, and the mohel, as well as for the advent
        of the Messiah and the righteous priest, are inserted in
        the Birkat ha-Mazon.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>Nineteenth-century Reform Jews were opposed to
        circumcision, but now it is usually performed, although
        often by a doctor rather than a mohel.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>Circumcision is enjoined upon male proselytes (and
        slaves) as an essential condition of their acceptance into
        the Jewish faith.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>Circumcision was widespread in many ancient
        cultures. Some of these also practiced female circumcision,
        which was never allowed in Judaism.</tt></p>
