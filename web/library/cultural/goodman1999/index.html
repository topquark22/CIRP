      <h2>Jewish circumcision: an alternative perspective</h2>

      <p class="author">J. GOODMAN</p>
      <hr size="1" color="black" />
      <br />
       

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">As a Jew, I used to take ritual circumcision
      completely for granted. I watched the procedure many times,
      when a son was born to family or friends. It is unusual for a
      woman to watch, but I was a young medical student, unafraid,
      curious and, eventually horrified. My concern about this
      issue has arisen slowly, simply from what I have seen.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the first section, I examine the reasons
      for circumcision, and compare some of the physiological and
      clinical findings about the procedure with popular Jewish
      beliefs about its nature and consequences. I consider the
      effect of the procedure on the mother as well as the child,
      and discuss the ethical implications. In the second section,
      I discuss some Jewish texts and traditions that could
      surprisingly, lend support to challenging the established
      practice of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the third section, I describe the
      historical and psychosocial factors that make challenging
      Jewish circumcision so problematic, and that sometimes lead
      to intensely negative responses to new information about it.
      I also discuss the vexed question of whether challenging
      Jewish circumcision is necessarily anti-Semitic.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the penultimate section, I examine the
      received view that Jewish people practise circumcision
      because of God&rsquo;s commandment to Abraham (in Genesis
      17:11&ndash;14). I show that for most Jewish people, the
      reasons have more to do with a sense of belonging than with a
      sense of being divinely commanded. I then argue that
      circumcision is, nevertheless, not as essential to our Jewish
      identity as most of us have assumed. Finally, I consider the
      possibility of cultural evolution, providing examples from
      within and outside the Jewish community of how, despite the
      difficulties, customs can and do change.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Reasons for questioning religious circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text1">There are several reasons to reconsider the
      practice of religious circumcision, including the pain,
      trauma and complications associated with the procedure, the
      lack of previously supposed medical benefits, and the effect
      of circumcision upon the mother of the circumcised child.</p>

      <p><i>Pain and trauma</i></p>

      <p class="text1">Jewish boys are circumcised at 8 days of
      age, i.e. well within the neonatal period; no anaesthetic is
      used. The level of pain associated with the operation,
      whether judged by the babies screams or by objective
      physiologically indices such as heart rate and plasma
      cortisol levels, is severe. Even using a lignocaine injection
      for neonatal circumcision, Stang <i>et al.</i> [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>] showed plasma cortisol levels of 331
      nmol/L. whereas the normal level is 28-138 nmol/L. Similarly
      Benini <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n2">2</a>] found heart rates
      of 180 bpm in recently circumcised babies, which were only
      slightly reduced (to 160) by anaesthetic. Paediatrician Paul
      Fleiss, writing in <i>Lancet</i>, considers these cortisol
      levels and heart rates to be &lsquo;consistent with
      torture&rsquo; [<a href="#n3">3</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Other researchers have found comparable
      physiological responses indicative of severe stress during
      circumcision, including dramatic rises in respiratory rate
      and trancutaneous oxygen, as well as plasma cortisol level
      and heart rate [<a href="#n4">4&ndash;6</a>]. Circumcision is
      so painful that it has now, according to Stang <i>et al.</i>
      &lsquo;become a model for the analysis of pain and stress
      responses in the newborn&rsquo; [<a href="#n1">1</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">These findings contrast starkly with the
      beliefs commonly expressed in the Jewish community that
      &lsquo;its only a little snip that doesn&rsquo;t hurt&rsquo;,
      and &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just like changing their nappy or
      cutting their fingernails&rsquo;. Even though most babies
      scream, tremble and go pale or ever blue, many Jewish people
      will describe a circumcision they attended at which
      &lsquo;the baby didn&rsquo;t cry, in fact he just went to
      sleep&rsquo;. This is taken to mean that the baby felt no
      pain. However, studies suggest that rother than feeling fine,
      these babies may actually be lapsing into a lethargic,
      semicomatose state as a reaction to overwhelming stress [<a
      href="#n7">7-9</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Another popular belief, perpetuated even by
      those <i>Mohelim</i> (ritual circumcisers) who are also
      doctors, is that &lsquo;there are no nerve endings in the
      foreskin, so it can&rsquo;t possibly hurt&rsquo;. However, it
      has been clearly show that the foreskin is a complex and
      important sensory organ, containing many nerve endings,
      including the specialized Meissner&rsquo;s corpuscles,
      similar to those found in the fingertips and lips [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">In conversations about circumcision, many
      Jewish people claim that Jewish circumcision is less
      traumatic than, say, Muslim circumcision, precisely because
      it is performed at such an early age. The underlying myth,
      common until recently in the wider community, is that newborn
      babies simply do not feel pain. But medical research
      contradicts the wishful thinking of folk beliefs. Not only do
      newborn babies feel pain, they feel it more intensely, for
      longor and over a wider area of the body than do older
      children or adults subjected to the same stimulus. Fitzgerald
      and her team at University College London, have shown clearly
      that the nervous system of a newborn baby differs from that
      of an older child or adult, bouth anatomically and
      physiologically, so that what would constitute a light or
      harmless stimulus to the older child or adult actually
      produces pain in the newborn. Furthermore, newborns lack the
      inhibitory or &lsquo;damping down&rsquo; mechanisms of the
      more mature nervous system, so they cannot protect themselves
      from the experience of pain in the way they could at a later
      stage. [<a href="#n11">11</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The developmental anatomy of the penis also
      suggests that the earlier circumcision is performed the more
      painful it will be. In the neonatal period, only 4% of
      children have a retractable foreskin. For 96% of Jewish
      babies therefore, circumcision will involve the forcible
      tearing of the foreskin from its attachment to the glans, as
      well as the cutting of its attachment to the sulcus. However,
      at the age of 3 years, 90% of boys have a retractable
      foreskin and this trauma would only apply to 10% of them [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Closely following (and contradicting) the
      &lsquo;no pain&rsquo; story, one frequently encounters the
      following statement: &lsquo;Alright, maybe it hurts, but it
      only lasts a moment and they forget about it the minute its
      over. They&rsquo;re too young to have any memory of
      it&rsquo;. In fact, the raw surface of the glans may bleed
      and be painful for several days after the circumcision, so
      the pain is far from momentary. Further, there is ample
      evidence that newborns do have some memory of the event,
      which takes the form, not of conscious remembering, but of a
      permanent restructuring of the nervous system. The result is
      an intensification of the behavioural response to subsequent
      painful stimuli, as though the nervous system has been
      &lsquo;sensitized&rsquo;. Thus, for example, Taddio <i>et
      al.</i> [<a href="#n13">13</a>] found that pain responses in
      children being vaccinated were significantly greater in those
      who had been circumcised (several months previously) than in
      those who had not. Other studies show that pain experienced
      in early infancy can disrupt breast-feeding, mother-infant
      bonding [<a href="#n14">14</a>] and sleeping patterns [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to pain, circumcision is
      traumatic because it constitutes an experience of utter
      helplessness [<a href="#n16">16</a>]. Not only is the child
      in great pain, but nothing he does can help to avoid or
      reduce the pain. His cries have no effect and movement to
      escape is impossible, because he is held down; he learns that
      he is powerless.</p>

      <p><i>Complications</i></p>

      <p class="text1">Many serious complications of ritual
      circumcision have been reported. [<a href="#n17">17</a>],
      including haemorrhage, infection, meatal stenosis [<a
      href="#n18">18</a>], amputation of the penis [<a
      href="#n19">19,20</a>], trapped penis [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>], urinary retention (frequently from tight
      bandaging) and renal impairment (rarely [<a
      href="#n22">22</a>], UTI [<a href="#n23">23</a>], septicaemia
      [<a href="#n24">24</a>], and four cases of acute heart
      failure [<a href="#n25">25</a>], Williams and Kapila [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>] reported a horrifying list of surgical
      disasters leading to permanent severe damage to the
      penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">I have listened to several Jewish women
      describe how their sons hemorrhaged severely after
      circumcision, requiring hospital admission and blood
      transfusion. In one case, an orthodox Jewish woman, whose
      only child had bled nearly to death, felt so traumatized that
      she chose to have no more children although deeply wanting
      them. She said &lsquo;if I had another boy, I couldn&rsquo;t
      bear to have him circumcised. But I also could not bear
      <i>not</i> to have him circumcised&rsquo;. Her son is 16
      years old now and has no siblings.</p>

      <p class="text2">While haemorrhage, infection and the
      occasional tragic accident may be acceptable risks in surgery
      performed to treat disease, and to save life and limb, i.e.
      where the risks clearly outweigh the risks, they are
      unacceptable risks in &lsquo;surgery&rsquo; that has no such
      healing function. As far as I have been able to ascertain,
      neither the Jewish nor the Muslim community in Britain keep
      any statistical records of the complications of circumcision
      performed by their practitioners.</p>

      <p><i>Lack of presumed medical benefits</i></p>

      <p class="text1">According to the Jewish religion,
      circumcision should be carried out purely for reasons of
      faith, not for any real or imagined medical benefits.
      Nevertheless, in conversations with secular and non-orthodox
      Jewish people, &lsquo;hygiene&rsquo; and &lsquo;preventive
      medicine&rsquo; are frequently given as reasons for
      continuing the practice. Most Jewish people seem unaware that
      claims for the prevention of cervical cancer, penile cancer,
      UTI, etc., have been thoroughly discredited [<a
      href="#n27">27</a>], as were the claims for prevention of
      asthma, epilepsy and &lsquo;masturbatory insanity&rsquo;
      which preceded them. In any case, preventive medicine is
      normally about choices that a free adult can make, relating
      to diet, lifestyle, screening programmes, etc. It is not
      usually about removing healthy body parts from infants.</p>

      <p><i>Effects on the mother</i></p>

      <p class="text1">The strongest instinct of the new mother is
      to hold, cherish and protect her baby. In the Jewish world,
      this natural and vital desire is brought into immediate and
      painful conflict with the demands of tradition. In gatherings
      of Jewish women over the past several years, I have listened
      to scores of Jewish mothers and grandmothers describing how
      they felt torn between loyalty to their child and loyalty to
      their tradition, at what should have been a time of resting
      and rejoicing. I have heard African and Muslim mothers
      describe the same agonizing dilemma. Usually, the
      circumcision goes ahead and the mother feels impotent,
      guilty, and full of regret, even many decades later. Many
      mothers say they only consented because they had been told it
      was a painless, minor procedure. Had they realized the degree
      of blood and trauma involved, they would never have agreed;
      they felt betrayed.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Jewish law, it is the father not the
      mother, who is commanded to circumcise the boy. It is a rite
      of male bonding, designed (unconsciously), as are all such
      rites worldwide, to separate the baby boy from his mother and
      to claim him as &lsquo;one of the men&rsquo; of the tribe. It
      was Abraham, not Sarah, who was commanded to circumcise. It
      is Jewish men, not the woman or children, who have defined
      circumcision as sacred. As Pollack points out [<a
      href="#n28">28</a>], Jewish women now need to redefine what
      is sacred, and every mother knows in her heart that there is
      nothing sacred about taking a knife to a child&rsquo;s
      genitals. There is nothing sacred about shattering a
      child&rsquo;s inborn trust, his basic assumption that his
      parents will do their utmost to protect him from harm.
      Pollack states, &lsquo;Circumision is fundamental to
      patricarchy, but it is not holy&rsquo; [<a
      href="#n29">29</a>].</p>

      <p><i>Ethical implications</i></p>

      <p class="text1">Anyone subjecting an adult to what is
      permitted in regard to an 8-day-old baby would be charged
      with assault. If children and babies are to be regarded as
      fully human beings, then it must surely be unethical for them
      to be held down forcibly while a healthy functional part of
      their body is excised. It is not only that babies are
      helpless, or that they are too young to give consent. Their
      reactions, their screams, and that they have to be held down
      at all, are best and only way of indicating that they are
      actually <i>withholding</i> their consent.</p>

      <p class="text2">Judaism, like all religious traditions, has
      many layers and many strands. In the next section, I show
      that despite the Biblical injunction to circumcise, support
      can be found from many Jewish sources for the view that
      circumcision of infants is unethical and should therefore be
      abandoned.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Textual support for change within Judaism</h4>

      <p class="text1">In Judaism, and in Islam, the human being is
      considered to be made in the image of God, and God is
      conceptualized as perfect. So one could not argue that
      interfering with God&rsquo;s perfect creation is a form of
      blasphemy. In Judaism there is a law of &lsquo;<i>Shmirat Ha
      Guf</i>&rsquo;, the guarding or protecting of the body.
      Body-piercing, tattooing and amputation are all forbidden for
      this reason. Further, there is the Talmudic concept of
      &lsquo;<i>Tsa&rsquo;ar ba&rsquo;alei chayyim</i>&rsquo;,
      compassion for all living creatures. If compassion in all its
      fullness were applied to 8-day-old babies, circumcision would
      become impossible.</p>

      <p class="text2">The literal commandment to circumcise that
      is found in Genesis appears in the later books of Deuteronomy
      and Isaiah with a metaphorical meaning. The prophet Isaiah
      urges people to &lsquo;circumcise the foreskin of your
      hearts&rsquo;, i.e. to melt the hard shell of defensive
      insensitivity with which each of us armours our innermost
      selves. This is highly inapplicable today; as we
      &lsquo;circumcise the foreskins of our hearts&rsquo;, we
      become able to hear the anguished cries of our babies.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, the authoritative
      Code of Jewish Law, says: &lsquo;Extreme care should be taken
      not to circumcise an infant who is ailing, as <i>the
      fulfilment of all ordinances is suspended if there is danger
      to human life</i>. Moreover, the circumcision can be
      performed at a later date, but the life of a human being can
      never be restored&rsquo;. [<a href="#n30">30</a>] (emphasis
      added by present author).</p>

      <p class="text2">The Talmud discusses at length the
      imperative of &lsquo;<i>Pikuach Nefesh</i>&rsquo;, the
      obligation to save human life in any situation in which it is
      endangered, whether the danger is immediate or only
      potential, as in the case of a condition which is not
      dangerous now but could suddenly deteriorate [<a
      href="#n31">31</a>]. The rabbis derive this ruling from
      Leviticus 19:16; &lsquo;Neither shalt thou stand idly by the
      blood of thy neighbour&rsquo;. It could certainly be argued
      that circumcision of an 8-day-old baby constitutes a
      condition which could, and sometimes does, suddenly
      deteriorate.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Talmud goes on to say (Hul. 10a) that
      &lsquo;One should be more particular about matters concerning
      life and health than about ritual observances&rsquo;. It
      insists, for example, that even the laws of the Sabbath
      <i>must</i> be broken to give medical treatment or comfort to
      a sick person or a postpartum woman (Yoma 85a). This is
      despite the fact that keeping the Sabbath is of the Ten
      Commandments; circumcision, significantly, is not.</p>

      <p class="text2">Jewish law is an evolving process that has
      always taken into account new developments in science and
      understanding, and attempted to integrate them. Given what is
      known about life-threatening complications of neonatal
      circumcision, there is an argument from within Judaism to
      adapt Jewish law, so that the circumcision of helpless,
      non-consenting babies becomes forbidden, not demanded.</p>

      <p class="text2">The medieval rabbi Maimonides, regarded as
      the greatest Jewish sage of all time, writes of circumcision:
      &lsquo;&hellip;&hellip;one of its objects is to limit sexual
      intercourse, and to weaken the organ &hellip; the use of the
      foreskin to that organ is evident &hellip; there is no doubt
      that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and
      sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment; the organ
      necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is deprived
      of its covering from the beginning&rsquo; [<a
      href="#n32">32</a>]. Maimonides was a physician as well as a
      rabbi. His words foreshadow current medical understanding of
      the protective and sexual functions of the foreskin. Although
      he was writing in defence of circumcision, the text might be
      interpreted very differently today.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Difficulties of questioning circumcision in the Jewish
      community</h4>

      <p class="text1">Many Jewish people, when they encounter the
      arguments outlined in the first section about the pain,
      trauma, and dangers of circumcision, say something along the
      lines of: &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re quite right. I
      can&rsquo;t disagree with you. &mdash; I know its completely
      irrational, but I just feel we must carry on doing it&rsquo;.
      Others become very angry, dismissing solid medical evidence
      and genuine humane concern as an anti-Semitic attack. To make
      sense of these responses, and of the tremendous resistance
      (i.e. fear manifesting as defensiveness) which will be
      encountered by any person challenging Jewish circumcision,
      whether from within or outside the community, the
      psychological meaning of circumcision for the Jewish people
      must be understood. To understand that requires some
      knowledge of Jewish history.</p>

      <p class="text2">Persecutors of the Jews have always
      attempted to ban circumcision. That their motivation was the
      extermination of the Jewish people, rather than any
      humanitarian concern for children, is shown by the fact that
      circumcision is frequently punishable by death. In 168 BCE,
      Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Syria ordered his soldiers to
      execute circumcised Jewish babies and their parents. In CE
      135, the Roman Emperor Hadrian forbade Jewish religious
      teaching and the keeping of the Sabbath, and made
      circumcision an offence punishable by death. Jews defied
      these decrees, and thousands were tortured and died the death
      of martyrs, refusing to abandon this symbol of their faith.
      The story was repeated in the Spanish Inquisition, under the
      Soviet government and under the Nazis. Circumcision thus
      became an emblem not just of faith, but of loyalty, courage
      and the defiant fight for freedom against terrible
      oppression. Even in the cattle-cars on the way to Auschwitz,
      Jews circumcised their children. They were doing what they
      believed to be right, affirming their identity and faith even
      in the depths of hell.</p>

      <p class="text2">All Jewish people, including myself, carry
      this history in our collective memory, and any challenge to
      circumcision evokes it, whether consciously or unconsciously.
      Even the most well intentioned criticism can therefore sound
      like a massive threat. Circumcision has become, in
      Pollack&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;laminated to our psyches by
      generations upon generations of trauma&rsquo; [<a
      href="#n28">28</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">As well as those features that are specific
      to Jewish history, there are other powerful reasons why
      ritual circumcision continues, i.e. psychological mechanisms
      common to any communities practising circumcision or
      equivalent rites. Familiarity breeds numbness and denial. The
      men present at a <i>Bris Milah</i> (Covenant of Circumcision;
      women are usually absent, from choice in the Reform Jewish
      world and by exclusion in Orthodox circles) have all been
      circumcised themselves. To them, it is the
      &lsquo;normal&rsquo; state. They are present at a
      &lsquo;celebration&rsquo;, bringing their child into the
      Covenant. In a very real sense they do not hear the
      child&rsquo;s screams of agony. This desensitization is a
      cross-cultural phenomenon; it was apparent in the obstetric
      wards of the 1970s and 1980s, where nurseries full of
      screaming newborn, isolated from human touch in cribs far
      away from their mothers, were approvingly dismissed with
      phrases such as &lsquo;healthy pair of lungs&rsquo;. This was
      also &lsquo;normal&rsquo;. For the circumcised Jewish man,
      therefore, it takes tremendous courage and insight to say
      &lsquo;I have been damaged. My parents made a mistake. I
      won&rsquo;t pass this wound on to my son&rsquo;.</p>

      <p class="text2">Fear of anti-Semitism must not be allowed to
      stifle dissent. Nevertheless, for those choosing to challenge
      Jewish circumcision from outside, it is necessary to know the
      history outlined above and to be aware of how any criticism
      may therefore be misinterpreted. It is also crucial to be
      absolutely certain that the message and motivation are free
      from racism in the present. Specifically, criticizing a
      custom must to degenerate into attacking or demonizing those
      who practise it. They are good-hearted people who love their
      children, but have grown up with a different set of rules.
      Most people of all races and religions do what they have
      always done, unquestioningly most of the time, and Jews,
      Muslims and others who circumcise are no exception. One way
      to avoid racism is to take the broad multicultural view, that
      we all have something to learn from each other. An example
      will make this clearer; many African mothers have their
      daughters genitally mutilated. White westerners find this
      appalling and wonder secretly whether the parents can really
      love their daughters. But then, many white western parents
      even now leave their young children to sob, alone, behind a
      closed door, night after night, because it is past 7.30 pm
      and &lsquo;they must learn that bed-time means
      bed-time&rsquo;. Any African mother would be appalled and
      would wonder secretly whether the parents can really love
      their children. She would tell us that young children need
      human contact, carrying and cuddling, whatever time of day or
      night; she would tell us that we are doing something
      wrong.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anti-Semitism is a particularly virulent
      form of racism and avoiding it while challenging Jewish
      circumcision must be a matter of deep intent, not merely of
      style. This is not only because racism is counterproductive
      in the effort to educate people fully about the reality of
      circumcision, but because racism is itself as cruel and
      unethical as the circumcision of helpless babies. I am
      challenging circumcision because it is the particular form of
      violence to children that occurs in my own culture: however,
      every culture has its own form of oppression that needs
      attention.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Religious circumcision and Jewish identity</h4>

      <p class="text1">The usual defence advanced for Jewish
      circumcision is that it is commanded by God (Genesis 17:
      11&ndash;14) so it simply must be done. However, on closer
      examination, this statement (which in any case is not
      amenable to rational argument) turns out not to be the real
      reason, except for the tiny minority of Jews who take the
      Bible literally. Surveys show that even among traditional
      Jewish women (those attending orthodox synagogues), only 32%
      consider belief in God to be central to being a good Jew [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>]. Most Jewish people do not carry out most
      of the 613 biblical commandments. Even the ultra-orthodox
      would not dream of carrying out the whole of the circumcision
      commandment, which actually states that servants and
      non-Jewish house-guests must also be circumcised! (Genesis
      17: 12).</p>

      <p class="text2">The inconsistency is even more striking when
      considering Reform, Liberal, atheist and unaffiliated Jewish
      people. The Reform and Liberal movements select freely among
      commandments, modernizing the tradition and re-interpreting
      biblical texts in metaphorical, socially conscious ways.
      Atheist and unaffiliated Jewish people have often abandoned
      all contact with the tradition. Yet all these groups still
      circumcise their sons, indicating that they feel
      psychologically just as &lsquo;bound&rsquo; as the strictest
      traditionalist. What binds them is not a sense of devine
      command, but a fear of not belonging; there is a real terror
      of being the one to &lsquo;break the chain&rsquo;. The weight
      of history and the resultant social pressure mediated through
      the family are very difficult forces to resist.</p>

      <p class="text2">For all of these reasons, and those
      discussed in the previous section, circumcision seems to be
      inextricably welded to Jewish identity and challenges to that
      identity are experienced as challenges to Jewish survival
      itself. Yet there are arguments to show that Jewish identity
      is not, after all, as dependent upon continuing circumcision
      as it might appear.</p>

      <p class="text2">First, whose Jewish identity? Only that of
      the men. Jewish women have maintained their identity
      perfectly well for 4000 years, with no equivalent marking or
      scarring, and to say that &lsquo;circumcision is vital to
      Jewish identity&rsquo; is to exclude 52% of the Jewish
      population. Second, although Jewish people like to think of
      circumcision as an identifying sign unique to them, it
      clearly is not. It is also practised by Muslims, non-Muslim
      Africans, Australian Aborgines and much of white North
      America (and Korea, see Kim and Pang, this supplement), and
      is described in Egyptian papri from 4000 BCE. Thirdly,
      although some rabbis still believe that circumcision will
      keep Jewish males &lsquo;within the fold&rsquo;, the reality
      is that it has not stopped many young Jewish men from leaving
      the faith. Lastly, in Jewish law (Halacha), the son of a
      Jewish mother is <i>de facto</i> Jewish, whether circumcised
      or not.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Conclusion: Possibilities of cultural change</h4>

      <p class="text1">All cultures evolve and change, and what was
      indepensible in one era becomes redundant in the next.
      Generations of Chinese women were crippled by footbinding, a
      practice that was considered absolutely essential to the
      Chinese way of life, until the 1920s, when feminist
      campaigners successfully stopped it, and the predicted
      &lsquo;collapse of the culture&rsquo; failed to materialize.
      Similarly, the Sabine people of Eastern Uganda have recently
      abandoned their long-entrenched, traditional practice of
      female genital mutilation; their culture, too, has
      survived.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the British Jewish community, a small but
      growing member of young parents are refusing to circumcise
      their baby boys. They are beginning to create alternative
      non-violent rituals, gentle ceremonies to welcome babies of
      both sexes into the Jewish community and the wider world. The
      greatest fear of Jewish parents, that their child will be
      ostracized from the community if he is not circumcised turns
      out to be a circular, self-perpetuating argument, only true
      so long as everyone believes it. As more parents have the
      courage to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;, then the intact Jewish boy
      becomes no longer the exception, no longer the &lsquo;odd one
      out&rsquo;. In fact, the uncircumcised Jewish boys and their
      families have remained firmly within the Jewish community.
      Judaism has many joyful and life-affirming customs to
      maintain and pass on, and I believe Jewish culture will be
      strengthened, not weakened, by our outgrowing of neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">I have shown that circumcision is painful,
      traumatic and potentially dangerous, but that because of our
      past, it carries huge symbolic significance to the collective
      Jewish psyche. However, I suggest that our tremendous
      historical suffering does not negate or justify the
      continuing pain of our baby boys. Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks,
      interviewed on the BBC [<a href="#n34">34</a>], stated that
      the purpose of circumcision was to &lsquo;sanctify
      sexuality&rsquo;. When asked how it could do so, he replied,
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not causal, its symbolic&rsquo;. However,
      in the final analysis, circumcision is not symbolic for the
      baby: it is horribly real. Now is the time to lay the knife
      aside and to move forward into the 21st century with a form
      of ritual that is truly welcoming and that is truly purely
      symbolic.</p>
