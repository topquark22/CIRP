      <p><b>Objective</b> To evaluate knowledge about the foreskin
      and circumcision, and to understand the attitudes of parents
      to circumcision in Korea, where circumcision in childhood is
      widely practised with no particular religious or medical
      background. Subjects and methods A nationwide study involving
      questionnaires was conducted on 5500 parents with at least
      one son attending elementary school. Responses were obtained
      from one of the parents.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b> The response rate was 76.1% (4183);
      circumcision was most common in boys when aged 11 years,
      followed by neonatal circumcision. Of the parents, 91.3%
      believed that circumcision is necessary, while 2.1% believed
      it to be unnecessary. The principal reasons given for
      circumcision were 'to improve penile hygiene' (82.4%),
      followed by 'to improve future sexual potency' (7.5%). Among
      those who did not believe circumcision to be necessary, the
      most common reason was the expectation of spontaneous
      retraction of the prepuce with age (55.1%). Most (88.4%) of
      the parents believed that smegma is not a clean material, and
      is infected by microorganisms. Most parents (80.6%) thought
      that circumcision would prevent genital tract infection of
      the future spouse. Peer pressure was one of the most
      influential factors in deciding upon circumcision; 41.9% of
      the parents were anxious that their child might be ridiculed
      by his peer group unless he was circumcised, while 27.4% of
      the parents believed that their child might be ridiculed if
      he was circumcised. Mothers were more positive about
      circumcision than fathers (P &lt; 0.05). Parents with a
      higher education and higher socio-economic status were also
      more positive about circumcision (P &lt; 0.05). Mothers were
      prone to emphasize improved sexual potency (P &lt; 0.05).
      There was no significant difference in response between urban
      and rural areas.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion</b> This study indicates that common beliefs
      held by parents about the prepuce or circumcision differ
      significantly from current medical knowledge, and these
      beliefs have a major influence on the practice of
      circumcision in Korea. More clinical research on the natural
      history of the foreskin is needed, and it is critical that
      both children and parents are informed about the potential
      benefits and disadvantages of circumcision.</p>
