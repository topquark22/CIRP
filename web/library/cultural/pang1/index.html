            <p class="abstract"><b>Subjects and methods</b>&nbsp;
            From January to December 2000, 5434 South Korean males
            (or their parents) aged 0-92 years were interviewed in
            detail about their circumcision status, their age at
            circumcision, and the possible effect of circumcision
            on their sexuality. In addition, 267 practising medical
            doctors were surveyed about their basic understanding
            of circumcision and phimosis.</p>

            <p class="abstract"><b>Results</b>&nbsp; Currently the
            circumcision rate for high-school boys is &gt;90% and
            for those &gt;70 years old is &lt;10%. The circumcision
            rate in 1945 was &lt;0.1%. When averaged over the whole
            population, the present South Korean circumcision rate
            is ~60%; the rate has increased dramatically with time
            and particularly in the past 20 years, when the
            estimated number of male circumcisions has exceeded the
            number of male births. Although circumcision in South
            Korea has been strongly influenced by American culture,
            it has never been predominantly neonatal. The age at
            circumcision has continued to decrease and boys are now
            circumcised at ~12 years old. Of those who were

            but, unlike in America gynaecologists and
            paediatricians rarely did so. Among the factors
            contributing to the high circumcision rate was the
            mistaken notion held by both doctors and the general
            public that circumcision is directly correlated with
            industrialization and general progress of living
            standards. Many doctors believe the out-dated and
            sometimes controversial benefits of circumcision, i.e.
            prevention of cervical cancer and sexually transmitted
            diseases, and improved sexuality. Thus the vast
            majority of doctors recommend circumcision regardless
            of the patient's age Peer pressure was also an
            important contributing factor.</p>

            has an unusual history of circumcision. The mistaken

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p>Male circumcision is undertaken mostly for religious
      reasons, notably in Moslem and Jewish communities. Starting
      from the mid-19th century, circumcision began to be adopted
      in English-speaking countries but at present, only in the USA
      are half the boys circumcised. In other English-speaking
      countries the circumcision rate has been declining or is
      already fairly low. [<a href="#n1">1,2</a>]. e.g. at ~5.6%
      for England or ~2% for New Zealand.</p>

      <p class="2">We recently reported that South Korea has a
      surprisingly high circumcision rate [<a href="#n3">3</a>]; it
      is the only country among its geographical and cultural
      neighbors in which most boys are circumcised. No other
      countries with strong Confucian and Buddist traditions
      circumcise in this way. Indeed, circumcision is directly
      against Korea's long and strong tradition of preserving the
      body as it is given by his or her parents [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>]. As throughout its 2000-year history, the
      recent popularity of Christianity in South Korea, both
      Prostestant and Catholic, cannot account for the situation
      either. There are virtually no Muslim and Jewish populations
      living in South Korea. Thus all circumcisions have supposedly
      been `medical'. While an indirect American influence was
      evident in our previous study [<a href="#n3">3</a>], it was
      unclear why South Korean circumcision has never been
      neonatal, in stark contrast with the practice in the USA.</p>

      <p>As the supposed initiation of circumcision in South Korea
      is so well defined (1945-1950 [<a href="#n3">3</a>]), it is
      the only country where the first generation of those who are
      circumcised and those practicing circumcision are still
      alive. In the present study we investigated how the
      circumcision rate increased so rapidly in such a short time
      and why it is still so high.</p>

      <p><b>Subjects and Methods</b></p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig1.jpg" width="494" height="308"
        alt="Figure one" />
      </center>

      <p>The study included 5434 males (or their parents), aged
      0-92 years, who were questioned as to whether and when they
      were circumcised; for this information we obtained the
      present rate with age; the rate as a function of the calendar
      year, and the mean age at circumcision vs. age. The 712 men
      who were circumcised long after they had been sexually active
      were asked what the effect of circumcision was on their sex
      lives (whether it became better or worse).</p>

      <p class="2">In South Korea, most circumcisions are performed
      in local clinics by practising medical doctors; thus to
      determine how the present situation arose, 267 practitioners
      were surveyed to ascertain their basic knowledge of and
      beliefs about circumcision and phimosis, whether they
      themselves were circumcised, and why they recommended
      circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig2.jpg" width="513" height="666"
        alt="Figure two" />
      </center>

      <p>The number of interviewees in age groups is summarized in
      Fig. 1 Their present (year 2000) circumcision status is
      summarized in Figure 2. The circumcision rate is &gt;90% for
      ~18-year-olds and continues to decrease until it becomes
      &lt;10% for those &gt;70 years old. Circumcision is
      predominantly carried out long after birth, because &lt;10%
      of infants are circumcised. There were no noticable variation
      in circumcision rate with educational or economic background,
      geographic origin or where the survey was conducted. Also,
      older men had lower circumcision rates regardless of where
      the survey was conducted. The distribution of the
      circumcision rate was deduced for the same population in
      1970, when the polled group was 30 years younger. The
      resulting distribution is also shown in figure 2.The peak
      circumcision rate in 1970 was in those aged ~28 years, at
      35%. Within 30 years the circumcision rate for 16-year-olds
      increased 20 fold; furthermore, the neonatal circumcision
      rate in 1970 was practically zero.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig3.jpg" width="494" height="528"
        alt="Figure three" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">In the survey over 1400 males were born before
      1945 but only one person was circumcised before then, the
      year of the start of the American trusteeship of South Korea.
      He was circumcised in 1943 and was a student of a medical
      school originally established by American missionaries.
      Therefore it can be concluded that, while there might have
      been isolated instances of circumcision before 1945, the vast
      majority of circumcisions occurred afterwards. The abrupt
      start of circumcision is shown clearly in Fig. 3, where each
      circumcised male amongst the interviewees is represented by a
      point whose horizontal and vertical locations indicate
      respectively, his age and the year of his circumcision. Three
      things are apparent; circumcision started in 1945, mass
      circumcision began in the 1960s and circumcision has been
      mostly after birth.</p>

        alt="Figure four" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">Currently most boys are being circumcised at ~12
      years old; as shown in Fig. 4, the prevalent age of
      circumcision is 9&ndash;14 years. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the
      distribution of age at circumcision for those aged 45-50
      years; the distribution is wider and the mean age at
      circumcision greater; at ~27 years. Figure 4 suggests that
      the mean age at circumcision continued to decrease since
      circumcision started in 1945. Figure 5 shows the mean age at
      circumcision of circumcised males plotted against their
      present age. While circumcision is rare amongst older men
      aged &gt;70 years, they were circumcised on average after the
      age of 30 years.</p>

        alt="Figure five" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">Figure 6a shows the circumcision rate of
      then-20-year-old men as a function of the calendar year.
      Using Census Bureau data (http://www.nso.gov.kr) for the
      population structure over time, the circumcision rate
      averaged over the entire population was estimated for the
      past 50 years (Fig. 6b); the present estimated rate is ~60%,
      whereas in 1960 it was ~3%. The steepest increase in the rate
      was between 1980 and 1995, with the rate for the entire
      population increasing at ~2.9% per year between 1985 and
      1995%. With a birth rate of ~1.5% and death rate of ~0.5%,
      the number of male circumcisions must have far exceeded the
      number of male births during this period. Considering the
      actual death rate of each age group with time, the number of
      circumcisions performed each year can be estimated; the
      results are shown in Fig. 7. As expected, the circumcision
      rate has been &gt;100% for the last 10-15 years.</p>

        alt="Figure six" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">More than 80% of the 593 men who were
      circumcised long after they had been sexually active reported
      no noticeable difference in sexuality, <span class="high">but
      a man reporting a change was twice as likely to have
      experienced diminished than improved sexuality (78 vs 41
      respondents). The most common complaints were painful
      erections, resulting presumably from the removal of too much
      prepuce, and diminished sexual pleasure. A few respondents
      complained of penile curvature on erection.</span></p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig7.jpg" width="486" height="702"
        alt="Figure seven" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">Overall, 41% of the doctors polled (267)
      practised circumcision; the percentage in each speciality
      using circumcision was: urology (92%), general surgery (88%),
      general practice (80%), dermatatology (80%), thoracic,
      orthopaedic and plastic surgery (72%), family physician
      (58%), anaesthesiology (50%), obstetrics and gynaecology
      (28%), and internal medicine (2%). No paediatricians reported
      using circumcision.</p>

      <p class="2">Of the doctors using circumcision, 72% were
      circumcised themselves (52 of 72%). However, 56% of those who
      did not circumcise were circumcised themselves. (49 of 88);
      this difference is statistically significant
      (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Of the two major circumcisers (urologists
      and general surgeons) 91% were circumcised (31 of 34) and 92%
      practised circumcision. In sharp contrast, among internists
      and paediatricians who rarely, if ever, practise
      circumcision, 51% were circumcised (20 of 39); these
      differences are also statistically significant
      (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p>

      <p class="2">To analyse the doctors' perceptions of
      circumcision rate in developed and neighbouring countries,
      they were asked, using a multiple-choice format, what the
      approximate circumcision rates were in Scandinavian countries
      and which of South Korea's neighbouring countries routinely
      used mass circumcision; their answers are summarized it Table
      1. For the circumcision rates in Scandinavian countries, more
      than half of the doctors believed that the rate was &gt;50%.
      More than half of the polled doctors believed that Japan also
      had circumcision rate of &gt;50%. In contrast only 8% of the
      doctors believed that North Korea and China had a
      circumcision rate of &gt;50%. There was no noticeable
      difference in doctors' perceptions depending on whether they
      used circumcision or not.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="table1.gif" width="489" height="660"
        alt="Table one" />
      </center>

      <p class="2">Two multiple-choice questions were also asked
      about phimosis (Table 1; which also summarizes the doctors'
      answers); &gt;70% of the doctors defined phimosis as `glans
      covered by foreskin', `long foreskin', or `foreskin itself',
      Less than 30% offered the definition accepted by doctors
      worldwide, i.e. an unretractable foreskin. On the second
      question, &gt;75% of doctors reported an astonishingly high
      percentage of phimosis (&gt;40%), consistent with most of the
      polled doctors having the wrong definition of phimosis.
      Incidentally of 267 polled doctors, only five answered all
      four questions correctly.</p>

      <p class="2">The vast majority of polled doctors (99%)
      recommended circumcision regardless of age; as to why they
      recommended universal circumcision, 75% of doctors cited
      `prevention of cervical cancer'. Most of the same doctors
      also cited `improved hygiene and prevention of sexually
      transmitted diseases'. Other than medical benefits, 18% of
      doctors also cited parental request as the primary cause for
      their circumcising their patient.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p>The history of circumcision in Korea was examined by
      undertaking a large-scale detailed study of &gt;5000 males of
      all ages up to 92 years, and by questioning 267 practising
      medical doctors about their basic understanding of
      circumcision. While this survey was mostly conducted in
      Seoul, this population comprises about half of the general
      population, most of whom originate from elsewhere. Therefore
      it can be assumed that the interviewees are generally
      representative of the general population of South Korea.</p>

      <p class="2">Circumcision in South Korea is unique in several
      aspects; while most young males are being circumcised for
      `medical' and not for religious reasons' unlike medical
      circumcision in the USA, &lt;10% of circumcision is neonatal;
      interestingly there is no fixed age for circumcision in South
      Korea. Older men were circumcised when they were older. The
      dramatic increase in circumcision rate in the short period
      since circumcision started in 1945 is unprecedented in modern
      medical history; the mean estimated circumcision rate over
      the population is ~60%, whereas it was ~3% in 1960. The
      circumcision rate for young males is high, at &gt;90% for
      those aged ~18 years. Circumcised boys are the majority and
      thus boys who resist circumcision until later often face many
      years of peer and psychological pressure. The circumcision
      rate has been &gt;100% of male births for the last 15 years.
      We cannot explain this large increase, even if it is assumed
      that every boy who is born is circumcised and that every male
      who dies is uncircumcised. Therefore, the number of male
      circumcisions must have been far exceeding the number of male
      births during this period.</p>

      <p class="2">As circumcision in South Korea has never been
      predominantly neonatal, most circumcisions were of boys,
      adolescents and adults. Currently, as the age at circumcision
      continues to decrease with time, there can be a situation
      whereby a father and son who are 30 years apart in age, were
      circumcised 15 years apart. Consistent with this there were
      among the interviewees three generations of males circumcised
      within 20 years. Indeed, there were a few grandfathers among
      the interviewees who were circumcised after their sons and
      grandsons, after being urged to do so by their sons and
      daughters-in-law. Added to such peer pressure has been the
      `culture of public bath-houses'. Most South Korean men often
      go to public bath-houses and uncircumcised men tend to feel
      embarrassed.</p>

      <p class="2">Male circumcision removes 33-50% of the penile
      skin and nearly all of the penile fine-touch neuroreceptors
      [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. While there has been debate over
      whether circumcision affects the sexual sensation of the
      penis, there have been few relevant studies. Studies on
      circumcision were mostly found in neonatally circumcised
      males [<a href="#n5">5,6</a>]; little difference was found in
      sexuality in these studies. However, there is a widespread
      perception in South Korean society that circumcision is good
      for sex, i.e. the prevention of premature ejaculation and
      prolonging of intercourse [<a href="#n3">3</a>]. How these
      perceptions may have affected the responses of the present
      interviewees is difficult to guage. While the present study
      does not answer the large question of circumcision and
      sexuality, South Korea offers a unique opportunity to study
      the effect on sexuality, as millions of men were circumcised
      long after they had been sexually active. In the present
      study, &gt;80: reported no noticeable difference but a man
      reporting a change was twice as likely to have experienced
      diminished than improved sexuality. While the reasons for
      complaints were specific, those who reported that their sex
      lives improved after circumcision were less specific; no
      details were given about how and why their sex lives
      improved.</p>

      <p class="2">The results obtained from the 267 South Korean
      doctors surveyed were helpful in understanding how a
      traditionally Confucian country has adopted widespread
      circumcision in one generation. No paediatrician and
      relatively few gynaecologists practised circumcision.; this
      contrasts with the situation in the USA where most
      circumcisions are neonatal and conducted by those groups. [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>]. More than half of the doctors surveyed
      believed that the circumcision rate in Scandinavia was
      &gt;50%; this perception is of course wrong, as the
      circumcision rate there is 1-2% [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. The
      possible source of this error is the belief that most males
      in any medically and economically advanced countries, like
      the USA should be routinely circumcised. Moer interestingly,
      more than half the South Korean doctors also considered that
      Japan used routine male circumcision; in reality, only South
      Korea among its neighbours practises routine circumcision.
      What is striking is that none of the doctors considered that
      North Korea uses mass circumcision. Therefore, it is clear
      that most South Korean doctors believe in the strong
      correlation between economic prosperity, medical advance and
      circumcsion. They tend to think that prosperous countries
      such as Scandinavia and Japan should be using routine
      circumcision, while the generally poor North Koreans or
      Chinese do not. This erroneous yet strong belief in this
      direct correlation must be important in South Korean doctors
      recommending indiscriminate male circumcision; mass
      circumcision is viewed as part of `advancement'.</p>

      <p>Phimosis is generally defined as an `unretractablae
      foreskin': the percentage of phimotic males at ~20 years of
      age varies depending on the study, but is 0.8&ndash;1.5% [<a
      href="#n9">9-11</a>]. These males are prime candidates for
      medical circumcision in most countries outside the USA. In
      South Korea, &gt;70% of doctors defined phimosis incorrectly
      and &gt;75% believed that the incidence of phimosis was
      &gt;40%. Most of the doctors surveyed recommended
      circumcision (99%); as South Korean doctors define
      circumcision as a `phimosis operation', and as they believe
      that most adult males have phimosis, indiscriminate
      circumcision regardless of patient age seems obvious.</p>

      <p class="2">The reasons given by most doctors recommending
      universal circumcision were `prevention of cervical cancer'
      and `improved hygiene and prevention of sexually transmitted
      diseases'. Preventing cervical cancer by circumcision is now
      an outdated notion, as recent American Association of
      Paediatricians and American Cancer Society reports
      unequivocally note [<a href="#n12">12,13</a>]. Circumcision
      has been suggested as an effective method of maintaing penile
      hygiene, but there is little evidence to affirm the
      association between circumcision status and optimum penile
      hygiene. There is no clear evidence that circumcision
      prevents sexually transmitted diseases. The only consistent
      trend is that uncircumcised men are more prone to genital
      ulcer disease, while circumcised men are more prone to
      urethritis [<a href="#n14">14</a>]. Recently there have been
      reports on the possible correlation between HIV infection and
      circumcision status [<a href="#n15">15-17</a>]. Most of these
      articles were based on research in African males with
      generally poor hygiene, and the potential preventive measure
      of circumcision against circumcision was not intended to be
      applied to developed countries. However, these results have
      often been quoted as one of the main causes of the low
      incidence of HIV infection amongst South Korean males, and
      another reason for recommending universal circumcision. These
      recommendations probably stem in part from South Korea's
      general unawareness that Japanese males are mostly
      uncircumcised, yet they also have as similarly low incidence
      of HIV infection.</p>

      <p class="2">Recent articles [<a href="#n12">12,18-20</a>] on
      UTI suggest that even though the incidence of UTI may be less
      in circumcised boys, it always occurs in the first year of
      life; it is also rare (&lt;1 in 100) and easily treatable
      with antibiotics. However, in South Korea these same articles
      are quoted or interpreted as recommending universal
      circumcision not at infancy but at, say, 12 years of age,
      which in reality has no bearing on preventing UTI.</p>

      <p class="2">In conclusion, male circumcision started 50
      years ago in South Korea but now the country has one of the
      highest circumcision rates in the world. The mistaken and
      outdated notions of South Korean doctors about circumcision,
      and their lack of knowledge about phimosis, seem to be a
      leading contributory factor to the extraordinarily high rate
      of circumcision.</p>
