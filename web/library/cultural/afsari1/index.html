      <h2>Attitudes of Pacific parents to circumcision of

      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Circumcision for cultural reasons is
      routine in Pacific Island countries. In New Zealand routine
      circumcision for which there is no medical indication is
      uncommon and no longer publicly funded within the public
      hospital system. This has caused difficulties for the Pacific
      people of New Zealand.</p>

      <p><b>AIM:</b> This study documents the differences in the
      attitudes of Pacific parents and their male children to
      cultural circumcision, and assesses the strength of their
      beliefs.</p>

      <p><b>METHODOLOGY:</b> Pacific boys between the ages of 8-18
      and their parents resident in Christchurch were given a
      questionnaire to complete and then were interviewed. The
      participants were obtained mainly through church
      organisations and after broadcast on Pacifica radio.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> One hundred and sixteen of the 123
      participants felt that they had strong ties to the Pacific
      community. The majority (89%) of the Pacific people felt that
      circumcision should be performed mainly for reasons of
      culture and hygiene. Only a small number were aware of the
      possible complications that might occur with circumcision.
      The average age that most Pacific people were circumcised and
      would want their children to be circumcised is between 6 and
      10 years of age. Boys were less sure than their fathers that
      they would get their own sons circumcised.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study has shown that circumcision
      is expected and surprisingly well accepted by the boys of
      Pacific families despite the discomfort they know the
      procedure causes. There is a strong cultural demand from
      parents for circumcision. Guidance from church leaders or
      sexual health lessons at schools or elsewhere may alter the
      cultural importance of circumcision for Pacific Island
      people. However, the preference for circumcision is so well
      entrenched into their cultural beliefs and may take years to
      influence.</p>
