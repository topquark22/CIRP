      target="_blank">Pope Eugenius IV</a> issued a papal bull
      regarding reconciliation with the Coptic Christians during
      the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06111a.htm"
      target="_blank">Ecumenical Council of Florence</a>. Coptic
      Christians, in contrast with other Christians, practice male
      neonatal circumcision. Therefore it was necessary for the
      Roman Catholic Church to state its position on male
      circumcision. This is an extract from the Bull of Union with
      the Copts (1442) that describes the Roman Catholic Church's
      position on circumcision for Christians.]</span></p>

              <p><b>[Bull of Union with the Copts]</b></p>

              <p>It [The Holy Roman Church] firmly believes,
              professes and teaches that the legal prescriptions of
              the old Testament or the Mosaic law, which are
              divided into ceremonies, holy sacrifices and
              sacraments, because they were instituted to signify
              something in the future, although they were adequate
              for the divine cult of that age, once our lord Jesus
              Christ who was signified by them had come, came to an
              end and the sacraments of the new Testament had their
              beginning. Whoever, after the passion, places his
              hope in the legal prescriptions and submits himself
              to them as necessary for salvation and as if faith in
              Christ without them could not save, sins mortally. It
              does not deny that from Christ's passion until the
              promulgation of the gospel they could have been
              retained, provided they were in no way believed to be
              necessary for salvation. But it asserts that after
              the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be
              observed without loss of eternal salvation. Therefore
              it denounces all who after that time observe
              circumcision, the sabbath and other legal
              prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and
              unable to share in eternal salvation, unless they
              recoil at some time from these errors. <span
              class="yellow">Therefore it strictly orders all who
              glory in the name of Christian, not to practise
              circumcision either before or after baptism, since
              whether or not they place their hope in it, it cannot
              possibly be observed without loss of eternal
              salvation.</span></p>
