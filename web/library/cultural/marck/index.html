        <h3 align="left">Abstract</h3>

        <p class="text1">This paper describes the general cultural
        background of male circumcision for the Bantu speaking
        peoples of sub-equatorial Africa. Where the contemporary
        cultural context of male circumcision is now variable and
        often transformed among groups who continue the practice,
        traditional practices were commonly of a particular and
        rather narrow profile linked to the toughening, training
        and initiation of male adolescents into warrior status. For
        those groups the normal social context of circumcision was
        in the adolescent rites of passage typically called
        'initiation schools' in the ethnographic literature. These
        in turn were highly associated with 'age-grades', age
        ranked male cohorts whose membership was defined by
        participation in the same initiation schools in the same
        year. Linguistic evidence suggests the schools and
        circumcision are very ancient and typological arguments
        suggest that these Bantu groups which do not circumcise
        males have abandoned a once more widespread practice. In
        the main, the Bantu groups which do not circumcise males
        belong to certain contiguous linguistic groups and their
        neighbours from amongst bordering Bantu subgroups. Almost
        all groups which have abandoned male circumcision have also
        abandoned initiation schools and age-grades. This
        constitutes a culture area in terms of those dimensions of
        those societies. Circumcising and non-circumcising groups
        are suggested to have their distribution due to diffusion
        of loss and it cannot be expected that differential risk
        behaviours in relation to HIV infection will be found to
        sort similarly among Bantu-speaking or other African
        peoples. But such mapping, for those who would do it, can
        now take place with the knowledge that a cluster of
        cultural traits typify the non-circumcising Bantu
        groups.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The African AIDS
      epidemic is a predominantly heterosexual epidemic with a
      subordinate epidemic involving mother to child
      transmission.</span> Transmission through intravenous drug
      use, male homosexual activities and other means significant
      on other continents are rarely observed in the African
      epidemic. Mundane penile-vaginal sex acts are the main mode
      of transmission accross the continent. The primary
      demonstrated cause for elevated rates of HIV transmission
      through sexual contact is the presence of genital ulcer
      diseases and this seems to be the general background as to
      why parts of Africa have a raging heterosexual epidemic and
      why other parts of the continent and, for instance, poor
      people in wealthier nations do not<sup>1</sup> or have seen
      such develop more slowly. Lack of male circumcision has been
      mentioned as a possible factor in elevated rate of
      female-to-male transmission in published case-control studies
      from Africa since about 1986 or 1987 and in
      <i>prospective</i> studies of individuals since 1988 (Cameron
      et al. 1988, 1989). Cameron et al. (1988, 1989) inspired two
      ecological studies (Bongaarts et al. 1989; Moses et al. 1990)
      which showed a striking positive relationship between those
      parts of Africa which have high rates of HIV-1 and those that
      have low rates of male circumcision. I shall not comment here
      on the resulting literature but refer the reader to some
      recent articles<sup>2</sup> concerning the
      'chancroid/circumcision' model of the epidemic. Here, over
      ten years after lack of male circumcision began to be
      mentioned as a possible factor in the epidemic, I wish to
      start talking about what male circumcision means to Africans
      in the Bantu-speaking portions of the 'AIDS Belt' of
      sub-equatorial Africa, and to consider why it has its
      historical distribution amongst Bantu speakers.</p>

      <h3>Organization and results</h3>

      <p class="text2">The geographical distribution of African
      groups traditionally practising male circumcision is
      reviewed. It is noted that the central and southern portions
      of a region where it was not practised in the AIDS belt is
      dominated by groups speaking 'Bantu' languages. Recent
      archeological and linguistic theories as to how Bantu
      languages came to have historical distribution are mentioned.
      Terms for 'male circumcision' and 'male initiation school'
      amongst Bantu languages are discussed in light of what
      evidence they might offer for the general antiquity of male
      circumcision amongst Bantu-speaking groups. A typological
      argument is presented suggesting that either male
      circumcision was a practice of societies speaking Proto-Bantu
      or that the practice came to be general amongst Bantu
      speakers quite anciently but after the
      disintegration<sup>3</sup> of Proto-Bantu or that the
      practice came to be general amongst Bantu speakers is
      explained as due to subsequent loss through a continuous area
      whose edges are defined by the edges of a series of Bantu
      language subgroups. It is noted that sub-equatorial groups,
      regardless of language family, tend to do what their
      neighbours do in respect to circumcision.</p>

      <p><span class="CIRP">[CIRP Note: A large amount of text,
      maps, and other data are omitted here]</span></p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="text2">Here we have asked how male circumcision has
      come to have its particular distribution among Bantu-speaking
      peoples. The result has been the suggestion that male
      circumcision was an ancient practice amongst the Bantu and
      that non-circumcising Bantu groups have abandoned the
      practice. The abandonment of initiation schools and age
      grades is implied by this model. These observations may come
      to be of significance in isolating other cultural variables
      that distinguish some of the non-circumcising Bantu groups,
      or groups of such groups.</p>

      <p class="text2">While this may be of interest in AIDS
      intervention strategies, I hold little hope that it will
      result in the identification of different risk behaviours
      between circumcising and non-circumcising groups. Lack of
      male circumcision among Bantu speakers is a real phonomenon:
      at the time of the earliest relevant European description,
      the non circumcising Bantu groups had abandoned the practice
      through a contiguous area. In an ultimate sense they had
      abandoned it because their neighbours had, and differences in
      sexual risk behavior for HIV transmission cannot be expected
      to sort according to those same boundaries. Still, there may
      be some hope of isolating significant differences when it is
      observed that the core whih have also abandoned male
      adolescent rites of initiation and, except in the south,
      age-grades. But these are a kind of 'package' of interrelated
      institutions and cannot presently be shown to have anything
      to do with differences in heterosexual risk behaviour.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The only material seen
      in the present work to suggest different risk behaviour
      between circumcised and uncircumcised persons was for
      <i>individuals</i> within the same <i>group</i> and concerned
      men leaving their traditional lands for wage labour in cities
      or at mines before they were of an age to be circumcised,
      including men who specifically left for such employment to
      avoid circumcision. Then, commonly, the uncircumcised men had
      wages to avail themselves of prostitutes while those who
      remained in traditional lands were circumcised and availed
      themselves of prostitutes less frequently or not at
      all.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">In general, male circumcision amongst Bantu
      speakers defined a change in status at the time of earliest
      European description. This involved a clear break between a
      childlike status, elevation to warrior status (except in
      Group E) and generally toughening or hardening of boys to
      men. The model proposed here suggests that the tendency
      through Bantu-speaking areas in prehistory was for more and
      more groups to abandon this practice. Presumably this is
      accelerating, especially amongst the fringes of the
      non-circumcising areas, as male circumcision is now sometimes
      simply emblematic or traditional, although still signifying
      adult status, and commonly lacks the wider social
      significance it once had.</p>
