      <p>To the totality of purposes of the perfect Law there
      belong the abandonment, depreciation, and restraint of
      desires in so far as possible. You know already that most of
      the lusts and licentiousness of the multitude consist in an
      appetite for eating, drinking and sexual intercourse.</p>

      <p>To the totality of intentions of the Law there belong
      gentleness and docility; man should not be hard and rough,
      but responsive, obedient, acquiescent, and docile. You know
      already His commandment... "Circumcise therefore the foreskin
      of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. Be silent, and
      hearken, O Israel. If ye be willing and obedient."</p>

      <p>Similarly with regard to <i>circumcision</i>, one of the
      reasons for it is, in my opinion, the wish to bring about a
      decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ
      in question, so that this activity be diminished and the
      organ be in as quiet a state as possible. It has been thought
      that circumcision perfects what is defective congenitally.
      This gave the possibility to everyone to raise an objection
      and to say: How can natural things be defective so that they
      need to be perfected from outside, all the more because we
      know how useful the foreskin is for that member? In fact this
      <i>commandment</i> has not been prescribed with a view to
      perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting
      what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that
      member is the real purpose of circumcision. None of the
      activities necessary for the preservation of the individual
      is harmed thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible,
      but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is
      needed are diminished. The fact that circumcision weakens the
      faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes
      the pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has
      been made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from
      it, it must indubitably be weakened. The <i>Sages, may their
      memory be blessed</i>, have explicitly stated: <i><a
      href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">It is hard for a woman with
      whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to
      separate from him.</a></i> In my opinion this is the
      strongest of the reasons for circumcision.</p>
      <hr color="black" size="1" width="30%" />

      <p><i>Pages 609-610:</i></p>

      <p>According to me circumcision has another very important
      meaning, namely, that all people professing this opinion-that
      is, those who believe in the <i>unity of God</i>-should have
      a bodily sign uniting them so that one who does not belong to
      them should not be able to claim that he was one of them,
      while being a stranger. For he would do this in order to
      profit by them or to deceive the people who profess this
      religion. Now a man does not perform this act upon himself or
      upon a son of his unless it be in consequence of a genuine
      belief. For it is not like an incision in the leg or a burn
      in the arm, but is a very, very hard thing.</p>

      <p>It is also well known what degree of mutual love and
      mutual help exists between people who all bear the same sign,
      which forms for them a sort of covenant and alliance.
      <i>Circumcision</i> is a covenant made by <i>Abraham our
      Father</i> with a view to the belief in the <i>unity of
      God</i>. Thus everyone who is circumcised joins <i>Abraham's
      covenant</i>. This covenant imposes the obligation to believe
      in the unity of God: <i>To be a God unto thee and to thy seed
      after thee</i>. This also is a strong reason, as strong as
      the first, which may be adduced to account for
      <i>circumcision</i>; perhaps it is even stronger than the
      first.</p>

      <p>The perfection and perpetuation of this Law can only be
      achieved if circumcision is performed in childhood. For this
      there are three wise reasons. The first is that if the child
      were let alone until he grew up, he would sometimes not
      perform it. The second is that a child does not suffer as
      much pain as a grown-up man because his membrane is still
      soft and his imagination weak; for a grown-up man would
      regard the thing, which he would imagine before it occurred,
      as terrible and hard. The third is that the parents of a
      child that is just born take lightly matters concerning it,
      for up to that time the imaginative form that compels the
      parents to love it is not yet consolidated. For this
      imaginative form increases through habitual contact and grows
      with the growth of the child. Then it begins to decrease and
      to disappear, I refer to this imaginative form. For the love
      of the father and of the mother for the child when it has
      just been born is not like their love for it when it is one
      year old, and their love for it when it is one year old is
      not like their love when it is six years old. Consequently if
      it were left uncircumcised for two or three years, this would
      necessitate the abandonment of circumcision because of the
      father's love and affection for it. At the time of its birth,
      on the other hand, this imaginative form is very weak,
      especially as far as concerns the father upon whom this
      <i>commandment</i> is imposed.</p>
      <hr color="black" size="1" width="30%" />

      <p><i>Page 611:</i></p>

      <p>The fact that <i>circumcision</i> is performed on the
      eighth day is due to the circumstance that all living beings
      are very weak and exceedingly tender when they are born, as
      if they were still in the womb. This is so until seven days
      are past. It is only then that they are counted among those
      who have contact with the air. Do you not see that this point
      is also taken into account with regard to beasts
      ?&mdash;<i>Seven days shall it be with its dam, and so
      on.</i> It is as if before that period it were an abortion.
      Similarly with regard to man; he is circumcised after seven
      days have passed. In this way the matter is fixed: <i>You do
      not make out of it something that varies.</i></p>

      <p>This class of commandments also includes the prohibition
      against mutilating the sexual organs of all the males of
      animals, which is based on the principle of <i>righteous
      statutes and judgments</i>, I mean the principle of keeping
      the mean in all matters; sexual intercourse should neither be
      excessively indulged, as we have mentioned, nor wholly
      abolished. Did He not command and say: <i>Be fruitful and
      multiply</i>? Accordingly this organ is weakened by means of
      circumcision, but not extirpated through excision. What is
      natural is left according to nature, but measures are taken
      against excess. <i>He that is wounded in the stones or hath
      his privy member cut off</i> is forbidden to marry a woman of
      Israel, for such cohabitation would be perverted and aimless.
      Such a marriage would likewise be a stumbling block for the
      woman and for him who seeks her out. This is very clear.</p>
