      who lived in Southern France in the late 13th century,
      explained why he considered circumcision to be advised for
      the Jewish male.]</b></font> 

      <blockquote>
        A quotation from Rabbi Isaac ben Yedaiah of Southern
        France, late 13th century, as provided by Marc Saperstein: 

        <p><b><i><u>Pages 97-98</u></i></b></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man
          uncircumcised in the flesh desires to lie with a
          beautiful-looking woman who speaks seductively to attract
          him. He vexes his mind to be with her day after day,
          growing weary in his attempt to fulfil his desire through
          lovemaking with her.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
          too will court the man who is uncircumcised in the flesh
          and lie against his breast with great passion, for he
          thrusts inside her a long time because of his foreskin,
          which is a barrier against ejaculation in intercourse.
          Thus she feels pleasure and reaches an orgasm first. When
          an uncircumcised man sleeps with her, and then resolves
          to return to his home, she brazenly grabs him, holding on
          to his genitals and says to him, "Come back, make love to
          me." This is because of the pleasure that she finds in
          intercourse with him, from the sinews of his
          testicles&mdash;sinew of iron&mdash;and from his
          ejaculation&mdash;that of a horse which he shoots like an
          arrow into her womb. They are united without separating,
          and he makes love twice and three times in one night, yet
          the appetite is not filled.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
          so he acts with her night after night. The sexual
          activity emaciates him of his bodily fat, and afflicts
          his flesh, and he devotes his brain entirely to women, an
          evil thing. His heart dies within him; between her legs
          he sinks and falls. He is unable to see the light of the
          King's face, because the eyes of the intellect are
          plastered over by women so that they cannot now see
          light.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
          when a circumcised man desires the beauty of a woman, and
          cleaves to his wife, or to another woman comely in
          appearance, he will find himself performing his task
          quickly, emitting his seed as soon as he inserts his
          crown. If he lies with her once, he sleeps satisfied, and
          will not know her again for another seven days. This is
          the way a circumcised man acts time after time with the
          woman he loves. He has an orgasm first; he does not hold
          back his strength. As soon as he begins intercourse, he
          immediately comes to a climax.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
          has no pleasure from him when she lies down on when she
          arises, and it would be better for her if he had not
          known her and not drawn near to her, for he arouses her
          passsion to no avail, and she remains in a state of
          desire for her husband, ashamed and confounded, while the
          seed is still in her "reservoir." She does not have an
          orgasm once a year except on rare occasions, because of
          the great heat and the fire burning within her. Thus he
          who says "I am the Lord's" will not empty his brain
          because of his wife or the wife of his friend. He will
          find grace and good favor; his heart will be strong to
          seek out God. he will not fear to behold that which is
          beyond, and when He speaks to him, he will not turn
          away.</p>
