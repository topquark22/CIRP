      <h2>The Morality of Circumcision</h2>

      <p class="author"><b>BY FATHER JOHN DIETZEN</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Q. What is the morality of circumcision?
      The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that amputations
      and mutilations performed on innocent people without strictly
      therapeutic reasons are against the moral law.</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Pope Pius XII taught that circumcision is
      morally permissible if it prevents a disease that cannot be
      countered any other way.</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>In spite of these and other church
      statements against circumcision through the centuries, I'm
      told there is no strict Catholic rule against the practice
      today. Why not? No medical association in the world today any
      longer says circumcision is therapeutic. (Ohio)</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>A.</b> I'm not sure why not, but the fact
      is male circumcision generally just doesn't appear very much
      on the "radar screen" of Catholic moral teaching. Many major
      moral theology texts don't mention it. A notable except is
      "Medical Ethics," by Father Edwin Healy SJ (Loyal University
      Press), who holds that since routine circumcisions are not
      medically defensible they are morally objectionable.</p>

      <p class="text2">A few observations may help explain. The
      practice of circumcision arose thousands of years ago and is
      prevalent in many cultures around the world. Nearly always it
      has religious or social significance, signifying full
      membership in the group and establishing one's social
      position in the society.</p>

      <p class="text2">The first divine command to the Jews, for
      example, was that every male child be circumcised,
      symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham (Gn 17).</p>

      <p class="text2">After the famous confrontation between Paul
      and other leaders of the early church (Acts 15 and Galatians
      2), Christians pretty much rejected the necessity of
      circumcision for becoming a believer in Christ.</p>

      <p class="text2">The idea didn't entirely die, however. The
      theory that circumcision still held some spiritual benefits
      even for Christians, prompted at least some of the
      condemnations you speak of. The <a
      href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15423a.htm"
      target="_blank">Council of Vienne</a> (1311), for example,
      decreed that Christians should not be lured into Judaism or
      be circumcised for any reason.</p>

      <p class="text2">The following century, the <a
      href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06111a.htm"
      target="_blank">Council of Florence</a> (1438-1435) ordered
      "all who glory in the name of Christian not to practice
      circumcision either before or after baptism, since whether or
      not they place their hope in it, it cannot possibly be
      observed without loss of eternal salvation."</p>

      <p class="text2">Today, while nontherapeutic male
      circumcision remains common in some places, as a general
      practice it is forbidden in Catholic teaching for more basic
      reasons of <a
      href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.htm#2297">
      respect for bodily integrity</a>. The Catechism of the
      Catholic Church states, "Except when performed for strictly
      therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations,
      mutilations and sterilizations performed on innocent persons
      are against moral law" (N. 2297).</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Elective circumcision
      clearly violates that standard. It is an amputation and
      mutilation, and, to my knowledge, and as you note, no
      significant medical group in the world defends it as having
      any therapeutic value.</span> In 1999 the Council on
      Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association stated
      that neonatal circumcision is nontherapeutic because no
      disease is present and no therapeutic treatment is
      required.</p>

      <p class="text2">Modern Catholic Church documents do not deal
      explicitly with the morality of elective circumcision. <span
      class="yellow">The above basic principles, however, clearly
      render it immoral.</span> It violates the bodily integrity of
      infant male children and unnecessarily deprives them of a
      part of their body that can protect the glans of the penis
      during infancy and serve at least a sexual function for
      adults.</p>

      <p class="text2">My understanding from physicians is that
      circumcision rarely if ever arises as an ethical
      consideration. Usually it is requested by the parents for
      more social reasons such as, it's always been done in our
      family. In that case, the procedure might be carried out in
      some places rather routinely, even if it is not what the
      child needs and no curative or remedial reason renders it
      ethical.</p>

      <p><b>Biographical note</b>*</p>

      <p class="text3">Father John James Dietzen, M.A., S.T.L., who
      is now retired from parish pastoral duties, has written a
      column for more than thirty years that is syndicated,
      distributed by the Catholic News Service, and carried in
      numerous Catholic publications across America.</p>

      <p class="text3">Father Dietzen's background in the Catholic
      press, parish work, and in family life programs in and
      outside of his diocese qualify him for his role as "pastor in
      print." A native of Danville, Illinois, he studied at St.
      Bede College, Peru, Illinois, and at <a
      href="http://www.vocations.org/history.htm"
      target="_blank">St. Mary of the Lake Seminary</a> in
      Mundelein, Illinois, before his ordination to the priesthood
      for the Diocese of Peoria in June, 1954. He holds a Master of
      Arts degree in English, and Licentiate degree in Sacred
      Theology.</p>

      <p class="text3">Father Dietzen's work as a priest includes
      16 years as associate editor of <i>The Catholic Post</i>,
      weekly newspaper of the Peoria diocese, and service to the
      Catholic Press Association of the United States and Canada as
      secretary and member of the board of directors. In the same
      period, he was responsible for the Family Life programs in
      his diocese, and gave pre-marriage, marriage and family life
      education programs in many cities. He also conducted seminars
      on marriage for the armed forces in Alaska, Japan and the
      Philippine Islands, and gave retreats to high school
      students, men and women and married couples in many parts of
      the country.</p>

      <p class="text3">In 1973, Father Dietzen elected to re-enter
      parish work full time. He served as pastor of St. Mark's
      Parish in Peoria for nine years, and in January, 1983,
      accepted a position as pastor of <a
      href="http://parishesonline.net/scripts/HostedSites/Org.asp?ID=4931"
       target="_blank">Holy Trinity Parish</a> in Bloomington,
      Illinois, from which he has now retired. He has a background
      in radio broadcasting, and has been a popular radio guest on
      topic shows in Central Illinois, often appearing with clergy
      of other denominations in debates on timely subjects.</p>

      <p class="text3">Father Dietzen began writing The Question
      Box column for <i>The Catholic Post</i> in 1975; it proved
      popular and was soon accepted by National Catholic News
      Service for nationwide publication.</p>
