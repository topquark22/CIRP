ABSTRACT. Humans are intensely biocultural beings. The linkages and causal feedback loops among their symbolic world, their cultural world, and their physical bodies can be exquisitely complex and subtle. It is suggested in this article that one cultural event--circumcision--exemplifies that subtlety and complexity. It is hypothesized that circumcision reorganizes the males sensory somato-cortex to raise the threshold of sexual excitability/distraction. This threshold shift thereby allows the young men of a social group (a) to be slightly more tractable in exectuting corporate activities beneficial to the community and (b) to be slightly more restrained sexually and more cooperative in the pair bond. The practice is accepted because the procedure is deeply ingrained in the ritual and symbolic life of the social group and is applicable to all young males. Suggestions are made on how to test this hypothesis empircally.</FONT>

ALTHOUGH THE NATURE-NURTURE PROBLEM has had an uneven history, there 
is consensus on one element within the overall argument: behavior,
 including motivation, is mediated through the central nervous system. 
Hence, changes in the central nervous system are aligned with changes 
in behavior. The correspondence is, of course, not necessarily a one-
to-one relationship. Nevertheless, it is clear that nontrivial reorganization 
or lesions to the central nervous system affect behavioral outputs. 
Depending on the locus of the neural shifts, the change can be in 
sensory perceptions, internal analysis, or motor outputs.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also clear that cultural inputs that surround and immerse the 
individual are analyzed by his or her central nervous system, and 
culturally appropriate behaviors are typically emitted. Distinct cultures 
have their own distinct inputs, implemented via cultural traditions,
 and individuals will typically behave with the appropriate, culturally 
sanctioned behaviors.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we offer an attempt to link a cultural ritual - circumcision 
- with behavioral changes. The act of circumcision itself is deeply 
enmeshed in a culture's symboling system. The behavioral changes are 
purposed to be mediated by neural changes.
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<I>Circumcision: Cultural Rituals</I>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision involves the permanent removal of the foreskin of the 
male - invariably a young male and often an infant. Diverse religions 
and cultures have included circumcision in their ritual and religious 
worlds: Judaism, Islam, tribes in sub-Saharan Africa, tribes of Australian 
aborigines (Murdock, 1957; for a history and geography of circumcision,
 see Bryk, 1934). Each group has developed an elaborate set of images,
 metaphors, symbols, and rationales for circumcision. (For Moslem 
examples, see Pierce, 1964; Bowen & Early, 1993; cf. Abu-Sahlieh, 
1994; for sub-Saharan African examples, see Turnbull, 1962; Winter,
 1959; for an Australian aboriginal example, see Tonkinson, 1978. 
For a biocultural overview, see Immerman & Mackey, in press. For a 
map of the distribution of levels of circumcision in contemporary 
sub-Saharan Africa, see Caldwell & Caldwell, 1996. For a Freudian 
interpretation, see Young, 1962. For the history in the United States 
of the ongoing medical debate on the value of circumcision, see <A HREF="/library/history/gollaher/">Gollaher,
 1994</A>. For the various positions of the current medical debate on 
the benefits and costs of circumcision, see <A HREF="/library/procedure/mansfield/">Mansfield, Hueston, & 
Rudy, 1995</A>; Roberts, 1996; Spach, Stapleton, & Stamm, 1992; <A HREF="/library/pain/taddio/">Taddio,

<P><I>
Circumcision from the Jewish perspective.</I> The written history of Jewish 
circumcision is both long and rich and illustrates well the ornate 
cultural context that surrounds the physical procedure itself. The 
Encyclopaedia Judaica (1972, pp. 568-576) gives the following perspective 
on circumcision in Judaism. It originated, according to the Biblical 
account, from a divine behest. From Genesis 17: 11-12 comes the 
prescription: "Every male among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall be circumcised 
in the flesh of our foreskin, and it shall be a token of a covenant 
betwixt Me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised 
among you, every male throughout your generations." The covenant 
involved 
a promise that Abraham's lineage would be multitudinous and that these 
multitudes would inherit the land of Canaan if Abraham and his 
descendants 
would practice circumcision. Abraham circumcised himself, his son 
Ishmael, all the males of his household, and his slaves. In the following 
year, Abraham's second son, Isaac, was born and was circumcised at 
eight days old. Circumcision was considered so important that the 
rabbis taught that were it not for the blood of the covenant (circumcision),
 heaven and earth would not exist. The ritual of circumcision was 
and is viewed as a sign of faith. Any perceived medical overlay of 
the practice occurred only recently.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing any religious-symbolic function, the biological question 
remains: "What consequences occur by the removal of the human 
foreskin?"
<P>&nbsp;<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>


Biological and Cultural Consequences of Circumcision</B>

<P>
<I>Biological consequences.</I> The relevant but sparse literature that deals 
with the human foreskin tends to tacitly refer to it as a mere flap 
of skin. Anatomically, however, this reference is not accurate. The 
intact human foreskin is richly innervated and contains holocrine 
glands (e.g., Tyson's glands). (For reviews of the development of 
sensory nerve endings in the human penis, see Dail & Evan, 1974; <A HREF="/library/anatomy/halata/">Halata 
& Munger, 1986</A>; Sommerova, 1976.) In terms of surface area, the human 
foreskin represents approximately 36% - more than one third - of the 
intact penis's skin (Ritter, 1992; also see <A HREF="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor, Lockwood, & Taylor,
 1996</A>). As a facet of the man's reproductive apparatus, the foreskin 
seems nontrivial.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensation is localized within the brain. If circumcision affects the 
sensory pathways of the brain, then the implication should be strong 
that subsequent sexual sensations will also be affected. Studies on 
the triangulation of the foreskin, the central nervous system, and 
circumcision have yet to be conducted or, at least, are not easily 
located. Nonetheless, inferential evidence is available.
<P>

<I>Lesions and cortical reorganization.</I> Researchers have demonstrated 
that if an animal's digit is removed or de-afferentated, the somato 
- sensory area that serves that digit is both structurally and functionally 
reorganized, sometimes extensively (e.g., Doetsch, Johnston, & Hannan,
 1990; Doetsch, Standage, Johnston, & Lin, 1988; Kelahen & Doetsch,
 1984; Kelahen, Ray, Carson, Massey, & Doetsch, 1981; Welker & 
Seidenstein,
 1959). The effects of the digit removal are greater if the trauma 
occurs early in the organism's development (cf. Florence et al., 1996; 
Garraghty & Kaas, 1991). The reorganization of the cortex is generally 
not orderly. Cortical cells that serve the areas adjacent to the removed/de-
afferentated digit expand their influence into the region of the cortex 
that would have served the affected digit. The expansion seems stochastic 
rather than pre-ordered or patterned.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as was shown in monkeys, when the affected, damaged area 
or areas adjacent to the damaged area are stimulated, the threshold 
for activating the relevant cortical cells is often higher (Wall, 
Huerta, & Kaas, 1992). Subcortical areas (e.g., the thalamus; Florence 
& Kaas, 1995; Garraghty & Kaas, 1991) that project to the somato-
sensory 
cortex are also reorganized. Given that the thalamus is a primary 
sensory "switchboard" for the brain, any reorganization at this subcortical 
level would be expected to influence both cortical and subcortical 
functioning.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When nerves that innervated the hands of monkeys were severed, the 
cortical-sensory areas serving those hands did not recover responsiveness 
to cutaneous stimuli (Huerta & Wall, 1987; Wall & Kaas, 1986; also 
see Pons et al., 1991; cf. Jackson & Diamond, 1981). After de-afferenting 
digits of the squirrel monkey, Garraghty, Hanes, Florence, and Kaas 
(1994) noted that much of the sensory cortex normally activated by 
the removed digit remained unresponsive to cutaneous stimulation. 
Garraghty et al. concluded that there is a limit to the scope of new 
receptive fields that cortical neurons can acquire. (For a similar 
discussion on the owl monkey, see Wall; Kaas, Sur, et al., 1986.) 
Wall and Kaas (1986) and Wall, Huerta, and Kaas (1992) offered 
corroborating evidence and interpretation.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florence, Wall, Garraghty, and Kaas (1988) noted that nerve regeneration 
is often incomplete and disorderly and that the remaining area of 
the somato-cortex becomes reorganized. Large zones of such "silent"
 cortex persist over time. Similar reorganization of the somato-sensory 
cortex (after amputation of a digit or after severing nerves) has 
been reported for cats (Kalaska & Pomeranz, 1982; Metzler & Marks,
 1979) and rats (Cusick, 1996; Cusick, Wall, Whiting, & Wiley, 1990; 
Rhoades, Wall, Chiala, Bennett-Clarke, & Killackey, 1993; Wall & Cusick,
 1984).
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that any sensory deprivation of a system can also lead 
to cortical changes. For example, Kandel (1991) noted in his work 
with ocular dominance that
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">
If one eye is closed during a critical period, the columns [of neurons 
in the visual cortex] devoted to that eye <I>shrink</I> while those devoted 
to the open eye <I>expand</I>. This modifiability of the ocular dominance 
columns is restricted to a relatively short period just after birth 
(p. 1024; emphasis added)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(See Jessell, 1991, for an overview of neuronal reactions to injury.) 
It is also useful to note that the phantom limb phenomenon (Melzack,
 1992) has not been reported or found regarding the circumcised foreskin.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a review of the literature on the plasticity or malleability of 
sensory maps, Kaas (1991) offered the following summary:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Reorganization of sensory maps in the brain follows changes in 
neural activity patterns induced by the relative inactivation of feed 
forward pathways produced by lesions or by the removal of the (i) 
sensory surfaces, (ii) peripheral nerves, or (iii) more central structures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Sensory maps in the brain, both early and late in processing 
hierarchies,
 are mutable, but such changes are more dramatic in higher stations. 
The increased level of change in these higher areas, closer to the 
cortex, may be because of the accumulation of serial changes and/or 
the greater potential plasticity.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Sensory maps in the somato-sensory visual and auditory systems 
in the brain are all capable of change.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Sensory maps within the brain have been shown to change in a wide 
range of mammalian species (e.g., raccoons, monkeys, rats, cats et 
al.). The clear implication is that adult plasticity is a feature 
of all mammalian brains. And, as a large reservoir of data demonstrates,
 the younger the individual is, the greater is the plasticity in the 
development of the nervous system. See Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell 
(1991) for examples.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) There is presently little evidence related to the behavioral consequences 
of the reorganization of maps in the brain. Nevertheless, partial 
recoveries of lost abilities which follow central damage include the 
possibilities of alterations and improvements in sensory skills.
<P>

<I>Synopsis.</I> Framed a little differently within the context of circumcision,
 the removal of the foreskin would be expected to reorganize the somato-
sensory cortex of the brain of the affected individual. Because sexual 
stimuli normally travel to the cerebral cortex via the thalamus and 
then to those subcortical areas that are aligned with emotion - for 
example, the septum (Rivard, 1982) - any reorganization of the cerebral 
cortex would be expected to affect the overall sexual behavior of 
that individual (for supporting evidence, see <A HREF="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann, Masi, & Zuckerman,
 1997</A>; cf. Masters & Johnson, 1966). The earlier in the male's life 
the circumcision occurs, the more impact the ablation would be expected 
to have on his nervous system and, hence, his behavioral tendencies.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we argue here that removal of an individual's foreskin has 
consequences in that person's brain. The removal of the foreskin - part of the 
male's reproductive apparatus - is hypothesized to affect sexual 
excitability. 
The most intuitive direction of any change would be to lower excitability 
or raise the threshold for sexual arousal.
<P>

<I>Circumcision and skin texture.</I> A result of circumcision is the keratinization 
and desensitization of the surface epithelium of the glans penis. 
In other words, if the moistening, protective covering of the glans 
penis were removed, then the skin on the surface of the glans penis 
would dry out and become toughened and callused. Again, the end result 
is a desensitization of the man's reproductive tissues. Excitability 
would be lowered, and the threshold for sexual arousal would be raised.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I>Benefits to the Community From Circumcision</I>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultures, not unlike stars and species of flora and fauna, seem to 
have a life cycle. They are born. They flourish. They die. Large numbers 
of cultures from antiquity, such as the Aztecs, the Incas, the Maya,
 Pharaoh's Egypt, Socrates' Greece, Caesar's Rome, the Vikings, and 
Babylon, are no more. Some North American Indian tribes are gone. 
Extant South American Indian tribes are currently destined for eradication. 
To remain viable and competitive, intact cultural units must solve 
various communal problems: secure food (especially proteins); secure 
potable water; maintain internal cohesion and minimize internal disruption 
(especially caused by young, energetic males); and maintain defenses 
against marauding young, energetic males from competing groups (see 
Harris 1974a, 1974b, 1977, for examples of problems met and solutions 
found for various facets by a myriad of cultural groups).
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suggest that circumcision originated as a mechanism to lower, even 
if only slightly, sexual excitability/sexual distractions of young 
men. Because historical records will probably never be found and validated 
(circumcision was practiced in Pharaoh's Egypt and is thereby at least 
that ancient), the suggestion is not amenable to proof. Nonetheless,
 the argument is as follows.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy and aggressiveness of young men are valued assets in a 
society. Dangers from the young men of other groups need to be prevented,
 or, if not preventable, then thwarted. Internal tasks, such as communal 
hunts, require the young men's coordinated activities. If distractions 
from these tasks are minimized - not eliminated, just minimized - 
then the efficiency of the coordinated task is improved.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual interest of young men in young women is a very real event. 
Sexual distraction and excitability for the individual man can certainly 
compete for his attention and focus. Circumcision could raise the 
threshold for sexual excitability and distraction. That is, circumcision 
would not eliminate the sex drive, it would just raise the threshold. 
(For the importance of "sensory" input to the brain from the man's 
genitalia for his effective sexual behavior, see Bemelmans et al.,
 1991; Gerstenberg, Nordling, Hald, & Wagner, 1989; Rowland, Leentvaar,
 Blom, & Slob, 1991; Xinet al., 1996.) That is, sexual behavior (of 
males) is not simply motor/reflex driven.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the argument here is that circumcision is low-grade neurological 
castration. As a consequence of circumcision, the young men would 
be expected to be a ply more tractable and a ply less distractible. 
Fertility is not impaired. Aggressiveness is not impaired. The threshold 
for sexual excitability is simply raised.
<P>

<I>Benefits to the Pair Bond From Circumcision</I>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as we hypothesized, circumcision results in raising the threshold 
for sexual excitability, then a putative benefit would accrue to the 
institution of marriage. Men's sexual impulsiveness would be lessened 
a ply. Again, men's sex drive is not removed, just abated. Consequently,
 the men's sexual behaviors, which are traditionally viewed as quicker 
and more direct, would be shifted in the direction of the women's 
sexual behaviors, which are traditionally viewed as slower and less 
direct. In addition, extramarital sexual activity would be similarly 
expected to be reduced.<SUP>1</SUP> Enhanced sexual compatibility within a 
marriage generally enhances the durability and coordination within 
that marriage. Consequently, strengthened marriages would be a positive 
vector within any society.
<P>

<I>The Trade-Offs Between the Man and His Society</I>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The societal calculus and trade-offs are as follows: The individual 
male is denied some additional or more intense sexual feelings. The 
community gains some additional compliance, and women gain some 
additional 
satisfaction within the pair bond. If all males are so affected within 
the group, no one male or cohort of males is at a courting or amorous 
disadvantage. The problem, of course, is how to convince parents that 
their sons' genitalia need to be mutilated. The next section addresses 
that legitimate query.
<P>

<I>The Juggernaut of Cultural Inertia</I>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The socialization process in humans begins at birth and is pervasive. 
Early learning - the systemization of the rules and worldview of a 
culture - is very resistant to re-systemization. That is, a process 
similar to imprinting is in evidence. (For classical discussion on 
imprinting, see Hess, 1973; Lorenz, 1958, 1965; Tinbergen, 1951, 1965; 
for current discussions, see Bolhuis & Horn, 1992; Bornstein, 1989; 
Bower, 1993; Cook, 1993; Leland, 1994; for specific discussions on 
human mating strategies, see Freedman & Gorman, 1993; Rossi & Rossi,
 1990.) Once a child is enveloped in the cultural matrix, wherein 
each major institution reinforces every other major institution, the 
mind-set of the child is crystallized. As the child grows to maturity,
 cultural givens are not questioned, they simply "are" and are about 
as visible as the wind.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child, grown to adulthood and parenthood, will pass on his learned 
givens to the next generation. The culture of a child is presented 
to that child in ways and by means a child can understand. For example,
 were the young Western child to ask, "Why is the sky blue?" or "Why 
cannot a brother marry his sister?" or "Why is dishonesty not the 
best policy?" the most effective answers adults can give are "because 
it is, because he can't, because it isn't...now go outside and play."
 Complex feedback loops of economic-political-social-psychological 
forces are well beyond the ken of all children to understand and most 
adults to convey. However, Rabbi Moses Maimonides (cited in Ritter,
 1992), who was also a physician of note, clearly articulated our 
thesis in the 13th century, when he wrote about the Jewish version 
of circumcision:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">
The bodily injury caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; 
it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it destroy the 
power of generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; 
for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual 
excitement.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is understood by young children is the concept of authority (Piaget,
 1954, 1977). Children universally obey parents and elders. Once so 
inculcated, children are then predisposed to obey the supernatural,
 deceased ancestors, and omnipotent deities. If the unseen, powerful 
forces mandate circumcision, then circumcision it will be. Again, 
if all sons by all parents are affected, then the cultural rule will 
have less difficulty getting started and less difficulty in being 
maintained. There is no exception toward which parents can maneuver. 
If someone is a member of our group and is a young male, then ipso 
facto, that boy will be circumcised.
<P>

<I>The Lack of Universality</I>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legitimate question can be raised, "If the procedure is beneficial 
to the competitiveness of a society, then why is the procedure not 
universal?" Part of the answer must lie in the variability of both 
humans and human culture. Circumcision is not found in cultures indigenous 
to northern climates. Arguably, a harsh winter, over time, selects 
for characteristics that obviate the need for added young male tractability 
(for theoretical discussions, see Calvin, 1990; Freedman, 1974, 1979). 
Similarly, cultural rules that systematically inhibit informal interaction 
between the sexes would preclude the need for an additional factor 
in tamping down young men's ardor. In short, there could well be alternative 
strategies that successfully cope with male sexual assertiveness.
<P>

<I>A Hypothesis to Be Tested</I>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument presented here has a number of assumptions and 
conclusions,
 some untested, some validated. The key untested conclusion is that 
a circumcised man's brain is reorganized and changed, compared with 
an uncircumcised man's brain. One of Popper's (1959, 1962) contributions 
to the philosophy of science is the recognition of the need for falsifiability. 
A good discipline generates falsifiable hypotheses; a poor discipline 
does not. With current technology, living tissue (e.g., the brain) 
can be studied in living individuals. The argument put forward by 
this thesis is that imaging of the brain via positron emission tomography 
(PET) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect differences 
in the somato-sensory cortex when it receives stimuli from the genitalia 
of circumcised men compared with similar cortical areas of uncircumcised 
men. These differences ought to be structural as well as functional. 
Furthermore, additional differences may be detected in other areas 
of the brain that are involved in sexual functioning.
<P>

Were such a hypothesis to be unsupported, then Huxley's definition 
of a tragedy, "a beautiful theory killed by an ugly fact," would be 
fulfilled. On the other hand, were such a hypothesis to be supported,
 then the Gordian knot that interlinks human symboling, human behavior,
 and human neurophysiology can be unraveled one notch.<P>

<SUP>1</SUP> An additional advantage to the community of reduced extramarital 
sexual relations - i.e., reduced numbers of sexual partners - is the 
concomitant reduction in sexually transmitted diseases. (See Immerman 
& Mackey, 1997, for a discussion on the threats to the commonweal'
s reproductive capabilities resulting from endemic sexually transmitted 
diseases.)
