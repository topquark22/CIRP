               Guidance Needed on Circumcision Method<P>

New medico-legal statistics have highlighted the need for clear GP
guidance on the issue of male circumcision.
<P>
The publication of figures from the <A HREF="http://www.the-mdu.com/">Medical Defence Union</A> [UK] last
week, comes as the <A HREF="http://www.gmc-uk.org/">General Medical Council</A> [UK] reinforced its advice
to doctors asked to perform the operation.
<P>
According to the statistics, the MDU has opened 50 files relating to
allegation of medical negligence involving male circumcision over a
six-year period.  Most cases involve GPs.
<P>
Head of risk management at the MDU, Dr Stephen Green, said the number
of complaints was rising by about 15 per cent a year, in line with
other complaints.  However, he told <I>GP</I>: This issue is of particular
concern. The complaints are of a serious nature if you are operating
on a child and potentially damaging his sexual performance for the
rest of his life.  The GMC is concerned about the level or complaints
reaching them and our experience mirrors theirs very closely.
Eighteen of the 50 files involved religious circumcision.  According
to the MDU, complaints arose after patients sustained amputation or
damage to the distal glans penis and damage to the urethral meatus,
haemorrhage and poor cosmetic results.
<P>
Many of the cases involved a lack of written consent and parental
understanding of pre- and post-operative information, ineffective
analgesia or anaesthesia, and poor surgical technique.  These issues
were addressed in <A HREF="/library/statements/gmc/">GMC guidance</A> drafted earlier this year (GP,
June 6). and stating that GPs unwilling to perform the operation
should inform patients [sic] that they could see another doctor.
<P>
When it was first proposed, the advice caused a storm of protest from
GPs across the country concerned with the ethical nature of
circumcision an issue which the GMC has left for MPs to resolve.
<P>
A US paediatrician has advocated universal circumcision, a move which
would cost the NHS 10 million.
<P>
Claiming that circumcision protects against STDs and penile cancer,
Dr  Edgar Schoen said: `Particularly in the face of an expanding
worldwide AIDS epidemic, these benefits are a powerful argument in
favour of encouraging universal newborn circumcision. (Archives of
Disease in Children, September)
