      <p class="text">One difficulty in dealing with the concept of
      medical treatment in Canadian criminal law is to reconcile
      some of the dictates of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> which have ancient origins, with the
      reality of modern medicine. Such a situation arises when we
      ask whether a surgical operation is <i>prima facie</i> legal
      or illegal. This may be considered a rather narrow and
      esoteric question, but it has and will become increasingly
      important with the development of modern medical technology.
      The initial presumption of legality or illegality may
      determine the final characterization of a given medical
      intervention as lawful or unlawful. This is particularly
      important in such areas as non-therapeutic human medical
      research and live-donor organ transplantation.</p>

      <p class="text">This enquiry explores the present situation
      in Canadian criminal law with respect to the legality of
      medical interventions and makes some recommendations for
      change.</p>

      <h4>I. The theoretical issue</h4>

      <p class="text">Ask the average man in the street whether he
      thinks that a surgical operation is <i>prima facie</i> legal
      or <i>prima facie</i> a criminal offence. His answer will
      almost intuitively be that it is legal, because this answer
      accords with the reality that innumerable surgical
      interventions take place each day, and it is an extremely
      rare occurrence to see a physician arraigned in a criminal
      court. Now, ask a judge the same question. He may reply that
      medical interventions are <i>prima facie</i> illegal when
      they fall within the provisions of the <a
      href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Criminal Code</i></a>, such as causing
      bodily harm with intent (section 228), assault (section 244);
      but that the physician will probably have a defence based on
      <a
      href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/267029.html#rid-267058"
       target="_blank">section 45</a> of the Code.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> This section provides:</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
      width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td>

          <td width="90%">Everyone is protected from criminal
          responsibility for performing a surgical operation upon
          any person for the benefit of that person if (a) the
          operation is performed with reasonable care and skill,
          and (b) it is reasonable to perform the operation having
          regard to the state of health of the person at the time
          the operation is performed and to all the circumstances
          of the case.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text">The judge's reasoning is also consistent with
      the traditional approach taken by the common law. The
      Canadian <i>Criminal Code</i> is based on the common law,
      which enforced a prohibition against the maiming of oneself
      or another. Maim was defined as follows in <i>Stephen's
      Digest</i>:</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
      width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td>

          <td width="100%">A maim is bodily harm whereby a man is
          deprived of the use of any member of his body, or of any
          sense which he can use in fighting, or by the loss of
          which he is generally and permanently weakened; but a
          bodily injury is not a maim merely because it is a
          disfigurement.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text">Hence, on the whole, any more than <i>de
      minimis</i> wounding was <i>prima facie</i> illegal, but some
      woundings could be justified.</p>

      <p class="text">Such justification could have had the effect
      of preventing the initial designation of the wounding as
      illegal, or it could have operated by way of a defence which,
      at a second and later stage, rebutted the primary
      characterization of illegality. Stated more specifically in
      relation to medical interventions, it may be that the effect
      of a defence, for example under section 45, is to negate the
      <i>prima facie</i> illegality of a surgical intervention,
      that is, to render such intervention <i>lawful</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Alternatively, section 45, or its
      equivalent at common law, may be a true defence in the sense
      that the absence of the defence need not be proved by the
      prosecution in order to establish all the necessary elements
      of an offence. According to this reasoning, proving the
      presence of the defence makes any putative offence
      <i>excusable</i>. One consequence of accepting the latter
      analysis is that all surgical interventions will be illegal
      until justified. Moreover, the burden of proof of the
      applicability of a justification, such as that in section 45,
      will rest with the physician claiming its protection.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">One way of avoiding the discussion as to
      whether surgical interventions are <i>prima facie</i> legal
      or illegal at common law would be to propose that any
      <i>prima facie</i> presumption of illegality has been
      reversed in Canada by the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Such a
      proposition derives from section 198 of the Code, which
      provides:</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
      width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td>

          <td width="100%">Everyone who undertakes to administer
          surgical or medical treatment to another person or to do
          any other lawful acts that may endanger the life of
          another person is, except in cases of necessity, under a
          legal duty to have and to use reasonable knowledge, skill
          and care in so doing.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text">If this section is construed in such a way as
      to qualify the phrase "surgical or medical treatment" by the
      words "lawful act," that is, that medical or surgical
      treatment is just one example of lawful acts dangerous to
      life, the <i>prima facie</i> presumption would be one of
      legality. The difficulty with such an interpretation is that
      the forerunners of section 198 were, first, <i>Stephen's
      Digest</i><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> and then section 212
      in the first Canadian <i>Criminal Code</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and there is no indication that these
      provisions were meant to alter the substantive law as it then
      stood. Rather, in all probability, they merely formulated the
      standard of care required in order to avoid criminal
      liability where persons undertook acts requiring special
      skill or knowledge<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> which were
      of "a dangerous character."<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      Thus, it may be argued that the <i>prima facie</i> legality
      or illegality of any such act was not contemplated by these
      provisions, and remained to be determined by a separate
      enquiry.</p>

      <p class="text">However, this argument does not quite explain
      the terms used in section 198. It is arguable that the word
      "lawful" only refers to "other ... acts" and not to "surgical
      or medical treatment," if one proposes that the reason for
      including the word "lawful" is to preclude any presumption
      arising that an unlawful act would not be unlawful or
      criminal if a sufficient standard of care were observed. But
      this does not indicate the function of the word "other."
      There are two possible explanations. On one view, the word
      has no purpose except to include "surgical or medical
      treatment" within the description of lawful acts of a
      dangerous character. The alternative view is that surgical or
      medical treatment may be lawful or unlawful and that section
      198 only refers to the standard of care required in relation
      to lawful treatment. The word "lawful" is referred back to
      modify "surgical or medical treatment" by use of the word
      "other." This qualification of lawfulness is necessary to
      rebut any presumption that unlawful treatment could be
      rendered lawful by a sufficient standard of care. Pursuant to
      such an interpretation, section 198 is silent as to whether
      treatment is <i>prima facie</i> lawful or unlawful; it simply
      provides that where treatment is, or becomes, otherwise
      lawful, a certain standard is required to maintain
      legality.</p>

      <p class="text">Thus there is room for argument both at
      common law and under Canadian criminal law, as to which
      analysis of the <i>prima facie</i> legality or illegality of
      surgical interventions is more correct legally and, further,
      which is more desirable, taking into account the wider
      ramifications of each approach. The debate is not entirely
      academic, as apart from legal considerations such as burden
      of proof and ultimate liability, it certainly makes a
      psychological difference whether or not one initially regards
      all surgical interventions as putative criminal offences.
      Further, this initial designation as to legality, although
      almost irrelevant when therapy is involved, may be important
      in the regulation of which non-therapeutic medical
      interventions will be allowed by the law.</p>

      <p class="text">Although it may seem ludicrous today to
      regard all surgery as <i>prima facie</i> criminal, it must be
      remembered that relatively safe and effective surgery is a
      very recent phenomenon. The aim of the common law of crimes
      and of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is protection of the person,
      and at the time these rules were developed, a person may well
      have been better protected by a prohibition against surgery,
      unless some justification were shown. Justifications were to
      be determined according to the concept of public policy,
      which at common law included a requirement of therapeutic
      benefit.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> General provisions
      of the Canadian <i>Criminal Code</i> were similarly
      interpreted. For example, section 7(3), which retains the
      common law defence of necessity and hence could be relevant
      to all medical interventions, and section 45, which may
      sometimes function as a particular application of the defence
      of necessity to a surgical intervention, or in other
      instances may justify surgery which would not be justifiable
      under a doctrine of necessity,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> were construed as requiring
      therapeutic benefit before they became effective defences in
      medical situations.</p>

      <p class="text">In fact, section 45 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> has often been treated as codifying this requirement
      of therapeutic benefit. Moreover, it has generally been
      treated as setting out the minimum requirements that must be
      present to justify, and hence legalize, any particular
      surgical operation. This approach has caused courts some
      difficulty which, on occasion, has led to innovative
      interpretations of section 45. One such example is found in
      the judgement of Chief Justice Desch&ecirc;nes in
      <i>Cataford</i> v. <i>Moreau</i>. The provision in section
      45, that it be "reasonable to perform the operation, having
      regard to the state of health of the person at the time the
      operation is performed and to all the circumstances of the
      case," was used to extend the notion of what constitutes a
      benefit within the meaning of that section. The learned Chief
      Justice held that</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
      width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td>

          <td width="90%">[d]ans le pr&eacute;sent cas, compte tenu
          de l'&acirc;ge des parties, du nombre de Ieurs enfants,
          de leur situation &eacute;conomique et sociale, il fait
          peu de doute que "toutes les autres circonstances de
          l'esp&egrave;ce'', pour citer le langage de l'article 45
          C. cr., conduiraient &agrave; la conclusion que
          l'intervention a &eacute;t&eacute; pratiqu&eacute;e "pour
          le bien" de la demandresse.<sup><a
          href="#n12">12</a></sup></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text">With respect, it is submitted that, both from
      an historical point of view and as a matter of construction,
      this is a misinterpretation of section 45. This provision
      enacts an additional requirement over and above that of
      therapeutic benefit before a defence under section 45 is
      available. Its purpose is to ensure that a person who
      undergoes an operation is not put at greater risk through
      having it than not having it. In current medical-law
      parlance, the provision enacts a risk/benefit criterion which
      will take all relevant circumstances into account and which
      must be positive on the side of overall benefit.</p>

      <p class="text">Yet the question remains as to which factors
      may be taken into account as relevant circumstances. However,
      even if the scope of the criteria were extended to include
      wider considerations, such as socio-econornic factors, as
      Desch&ecirc;nes C.J. suggests, this does not obviate the
      traditional requirement of therapeutic benefit. The very fact
      that benefit is expressly mentioned in section 45 indicates
      that this use of the word must have a specific purpose if it
      is not to be superfluous, and that purpose must be to require
      an aim of therapeutic benefit: this construction is
      especially compelling when, under the broad interpretation
      adopted by the Chief Justice, the Court will already have
      considered the prospects of general benefit, pursuant to the
      provision that "all the circumstances of the case... be
      considered."</p>

      <p class="text">It should be noted that Chief Justice
      Desch&ecirc;nes's interpretation of section 45 has already
      been adopted in an unreported case, <i>Re "Eve"</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> which was an application to the
      Prince Edward Island Family Court for approval of the
      sterilization of a mentally retarded woman. Mr Justice
      McQuaid held, on the basis of the <i>Cataford</i> case,
      that</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
      width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td>

          <td width="90%">the "benefit" referred to in <a
          href="http://insight.mcmaster.ca/org/efc/pages/law/cc/cc.45.html">
          Section 45</a> was thereby extended to include not only
          the health of the patient but as well socio-economic and
          other considerations with the result that surgery might
          be employed not only to preserve and protect health, but
          as well to preserve the quality of life in a broader
          non-medical sense.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text">Despite the use of this wide criterion, the
      learned judge refused to authorize the particular
      sterilization procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">An alternative method for a court to reach a
      decision which it feels to be appropriate, without having to
      adopt such a strained interpretation of section 45 as that
      adopted in the two cases just mentioned, would be to treat
      section 45 as merely one example of a wider range of public
      policy justifications which are available to authorize
      medical interventions.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> More
      pointedly, we might well ask whether it is still the law in
      1980 that therapeutic aim is required in order to legalize a
      surgical intervention. The answer depends on an analysis of
      both the content of current public policy concerning medical
      interventions and the operation of section 45.</p>

      <h4>II. The practical reality</h4>

      <p class="text">Whether non-therapeutic medical interventions
      are lawful has become a matter of increasing importance, as
      such procedures have been more frequently undertaken and are
      even regarded as commonplace. The question of their legality
      first arose with the increasing availability and
      effectiveness of cosmetic surgery. The courts stretched the
      law a little by asserting that these operations were within
      the traditional concept of therapeutic benefit because there
      was psychological benefit present. The problem became even
      more acute with live-donor organ transplants and, after
      initial use of the psychological benefit test, most courts
      faced the reality that in many cases there was no therapeutic
      benefit to the donors.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      However, even before the enactment of legislation authorizing
      such donation,<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> the operation
      was not in practice considered illegal, at least when
      performed on a competent consenting adult. Similarly,
      non-therapeutic sterilization of consenting adults and
      non-therapeutic medical experimentation are frequent, indeed
      daily events in our society that do not foment court actions
      by the mere fact of their performance. With respect to the
      latter practice, it is worth noting that in <i>Halushka</i>
      v. <i>University of Saskatchewan</i>, <sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> one of the earliest modern cases
      involving non-therapeutic medical research, the question of
      the illegality of the intervention itself was not raised. How
      can this <i>de facto</i> legalization of non-therapeutic
      interventions be reconciled with the legal precedents which
      have been outlined? A solution depends on determining how
      public policy and section 45 act and interact to legitimize
      medical interventions.</p>

      <h4>III. Possible reconciliations</h4>

      <p>A. <i>Public policy</i></p>

      <p class="text">It is suggested that certain non-therapeutic
      interventions are not considered illegal because they are not
      regarded as contravening public policy. In relation to the
      use of public policy as a justification of non-therapeutic
      medical interventions, it is important to remember that the
      law has always recognized public policy as a doctrine of
      changing content.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> In general
      terms, public policy requires protection of the individual
      for his own sake and for the benefit of the community. When
      these individual and community interests came into conflict
      with respect to a proposed medical intervention, public
      policy was traditionally to the effect that the individual's
      interest, as he perceived it, could prevail, but only if the
      intervention were for his therapeutic benefit. It is this
      latter requirement that, it is suggested, has changed. A
      broader range of individual interests may now outweigh the
      interests of the community, and these community interests
      have likewise changed in content. Hence, the balance str uck
      in the resolution of any conflict is open to constant
      modification.</p>

      <p>B. <i>Criminal Code, section 45</i></p>

      <h5>1. Historical approach</h5>

      <p class="text">If section 45 legislates a requirement of
      therapeutic benefit in order to legitimize any surgical
      intervention, then clearly it would not be arguable that
      certain non-therapeutic interventions are lawful. But, from
      an historical point of view, section 45 may only need be
      applied to justify a medical intervention where the person on
      whom the procedure is to be performed is incapable of giving
      consent. Section 45 is based on article 205 of <i>Stephen's
      Digest</i> and Stephen's annotations to this section make it
      clear that this is what he intended.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> A further reason in support of this
      interpretation of section 45 is that the section makes no
      mention of any requirement of consent in order to legalize a
      surgical operation.</p>

      <p class="text">If it is true that section 45 is inapplicable
      except where the person cannot consent for himself, then the
      legality of a non-therapeutic intervention on a person
      capable of consent is determined according to the general
      provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and will ultimately
      depend on current public policy: but this changes and,
      consequently, so may be the legality of a particular surgical
      intervention.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> For instance,
      in a nineteenth century colonialist society, reduction of
      family size might be regarded as inimical to the community
      welfare, but the same would not be true in an over-populated
      twentieth century community. Moreover, since the safety of
      the surgical intervention required for sterilization has
      increased dramatically during this period, the acceptability
      of non-therapeutic sterilization could well change. This
      change can be demonstrated by comparing two cases.
      <i>Dicta</i> handed down in 1954 by Lord Denning in
      <i>Bravery</i> v. <i>Bravery</i><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> reflect the old approach that
      non-therapeutic sterilization was prohibited by the dictates
      of public policy. Yet, in 1979, Chief Justice Desch&ecirc;nes
      clearly stated the contrary in <i>Cataford</i> v.
      <i>Moreau</i>.</p>

      <p class="text">To take the example of non-therapeutic
      sterilization a little further, there may be no perceived
      threat to other individual or community values when such
      sterilizations are performed on consenting adults. The
      situation may be entirely different when incompetent persons
      unable to consent for themselves are involved. The latter
      interventions may be contrary to public policy while the
      former may not be. Thus, even apart from the fact that the
      requirements of section 45 (including that of therapeutic
      benefit) would apply to medical interventions on incompetent
      persons, the doctrine of public policy may also prohibit the
      performance on them of non-therapeutic procedures.</p>

      <p class="text">Yet another, slightly different, analysis to
      determine which non-therapeutic interventions will be
      permitted under a doctrine of public policy is possible. In
      the case of minors able to consent for themselves, this
      analysis may arrive at a different result from the general
      approach outlined above. But, as far as competent adults and
      all incompetent persons are concerned, the conclusion as to
      whether or not an intervention is allowed by the law will be
      the same as on the previous analysis. If, as is suggested
      below, personal consent and benefit are alternative
      validating criteria of a medical intervention, is the consent
      of a "mature minor" (one whose consent is recognized by the
      law as valid) as effective to validate a non-therapeutic
      intervention on him as it would be if he were a competent
      adult? One may argue that it is not and justify this stance
      on the basis of public policy. It is also possible to adopt a
      more conceptually pleasing approach and arrive at the same
      conclusion.</p>

      <p class="text">The full extent of the dissimilarity between
      non-therapeutic and therapeutic interventions, as far as the
      law is concerned, may not always be recognized, because the
      circumstances surrounding these two types of intervention are
      factually similar, except for the one aspect of therapeutic
      aim. Hence, it is usually assumed that any legally
      significant difference in the way that the law deals with
      therapeutic and non-therapeutic interventions must depend
      entirely on this difference in aim. More explicitly, if two
      similar interventions with different aims are to be treated
      similarly, the difference must be rationalized or found
      legally irrelevant. Conversely, if two such interventions are
      to be treated differently by the law, the difference in aim
      will be used as the justification of the dissimilar
      treatment.</p>

      <p class="text">It may be, however, that the justification of
      legally dissimilar treatment of therapeutic and
      non-therapeutic interventions only depends <i>partly</i> on
      this difference in aim. For instance, it is arguable that the
      ability to give the necessary consent to a non-therapeutic
      intervention is a legal incident of competent
      adulthood.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> That is, where a
      non-therapeutic intervention is otherwise legal, consent to
      it will be ineffective unless given by a person who is both
      competent <i>and adult</i>. By contrast, the ability to
      consent to therapeutic interventions at common law or under
      <i>le droit commun</i> may depend on the individual's factual
      capacity and power of discernment: in the absence of
      legislation to the contrary, the minor who is capable of
      discernment may consent to therapeutic interventions. This
      suggested distinction accommodates the problem of explaining
      why a minor's consent is ineffective in non-therapeutic
      circumstances where an adult's is effective, although that
      minor can consent to the rapy to the same extent as a
      competent adult. Such a distinction and its consequential
      difference in result may be desirable.</p>

      <p class="text">Therefore, therapeutic aim distinguishes a
      class of procedures to which certain persons may give legally
      effective consent. Non-therapeutic aim likewise distinguishes
      a class of procedures to which a narrower group of these same
      persons may give legally effective consent, provided that
      these procedures are not otherwise contrary to public policy.
      Thus, it is not therapeutic aim which directly justifies a
      procedure; rather, this aim is relevant to identifying the
      persons who may validly consent to it.</p>

      <h5>2. "Presumption alternative" approach</h5>

      <p class="text">The second possible approach to reconciling
      the performance of non-therapeutic medical interventions and
      the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not require
      the proposition that section 45 is inapplicable to these
      procedures. Rather, the argument is that section 45 requires
      benefit, and benefit is presumed when personal consent is
      present. The basis for this argument is that it will normally
      be assumed that individuals act self-protectively and hence,
      at least in relation to themselves, promote the Code's
      fundamental purpose of protecting persons. Thus, if valid
      consent is obtained, one may presume the necessary benefit.
      Such an approach means that consent and benefit are viewed as
      alternative, not cumulative, validating criteria of a medical
      intervention. This is probably what has occurred in practice:
      for instance, before there was legislation dealing with
      live-donor organ transplants, authorization of a court was
      not sought in relation to donation by competent consenting
      adults, which indicates that their consent was being treated
      as a sufficient validation.</p>

      <p class="text">However, there are limits to the right to
      consent to the infliction of harm on oneself; and, again,
      these limits are a matter of public policy. In general, it
      may be stated that the two most important factors in
      determinating what is allowed are the degree and nature of
      the harm inflicted, and the purpose of the
      interventions.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> But to the
      extent that consent is a validating factor in the absence of
      therapeutic benefit, and to the extent that the interest
      promoted by consent has changed from being one of
      self-protection (or, as has been explained, therapeutic
      benefit) to one of self-determination or autonomy, some
      non-therapeutic interventions may be justified in law by
      consent alone, within the limits set by public policy.</p>

      <h5>3. Cumulative approach</h5>

      <p class="text">The other possible approach here is to retain
      the notion that consent and benefit are cumulative
      requirements for the lawfulness of a medical intervention,
      but in doing so to give a very wide definition of
      benefit.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> There are two
      problems in such an approach which are avoided under either
      of the other approaches to section 45 just outlined.</p>

      <p class="text">First, it distorts the notion of benefit for
      all purposes, so that section 45 fails to perform its
      protective function where it is most needed, that is, when
      the person is not capable of consent. This occurs because it
      is apparently inconsistent to argue that it can be
      beneficial, within the terms of section 45, to carry out
      non-therapeutic sterilization on a competent consenting adult
      but not on an incompetent person. The result will be that the
      presence of sufficient benefit can more readily be found in
      all cases.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> But for the
      incompetent there is not then the further protection of the
      requirement of personal consent, with its correlative right
      of personal refusal of the procedure. As already noted,
      section 45 does not mention consent, and thus the general law
      would apply with respect to what is required for consent to
      medical interventions on an incompetent person. As far as
      third party or "proxy" consent or authorization<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> is concerned, this requires that the
      intervention be beneficial to the patient before the
      authorization becomes legally effective. Again, in this
      context benefit has traditionally been interpreted as
      therapeutic benefit. But it would seem rather inappropriate
      to require a potential of therapeutic benefit for a valid
      consent to the intervention, but not for the application of
      section 45 to protect the doctor who performs the operation.
      Hence it is possible that, due to a desire for consistency,
      the result of broadening the notion of benefit within section
      45 will be to widen considerably the notion of what
      constitutes a sufficient nature or degree of benefit for
      effective third-party authorization on behalf of those
      incapable of consent. This could have far-reaching
      ramifications: for example, there is the controversial issue
      of whether persons incapable of consent should participate in
      medical research. One limitation on such participation is the
      requirement of therapeutic benefit, which can be used to
      prohibit the involvement of such persons in non-therapeutic
      research. This control would be severely compromised under an
      extended notion of benefit.</p>

      <p class="text">The second reason why it is suggested that
      benefit and consent should not be retained as cumulative
      criteria concerns the doctor-patient relationship and the
      patient's right to self-determination. Although personal
      autonomy deserves the highest respect, there are and should
      be limits to what even a mentally competent person can
      effectively consent to have inflicted on himself. Such limits
      must be determined according to public policy (that is,
      theoretically, by the community as a whole) and certainly not
      by just one other person, even a physician. The latter is a
      possibility, if it be accepted that benefit is a requirement
      for the legality of a medical intervention and that such
      benefit is established in law, not simply according to the
      patient's predilections concerning himself (as long as these
      do not contravene public policy), but also by the doctor,
      because section 45 requires that the doctor make an
      independent judgement<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> as to
      whether the operation is "really for ... the good [of the
      patient]."<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> This judgement may
      be more restrictive in its assessment of the degree and
      nature of benefit comprised in undertaking any particular
      medical procedure than either the patient's or the
      community's. To this extent, the patient's autonomy is denied
      and his wish to have the procedure performed frustrated,
      without the usual justification being present, namely, that
      to respect his wish would be contrary to public
      policy.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Finally, it is to be remembered that section
      45 only applies to "surgical operation[s]." Consequently, to
      the extent that the requirement of therapeutic benefit is
      restrictive of what interventions are legally valid, it would
      not apply to purely medical procedures such as the use of
      drugs or ionizing radiation. It may be incongruous in terms
      of the type and degree of harm risked, to require therapeutic
      benefit in order to justify a surgical intervention, but not
      these other procedures. The legality of the latter
      interventions will clearly be governed by public policy,
      which will include considerations of both consent and
      therapeutic benefit. But it is submitted that such policy
      should not and does not state that both consent and
      therapeutic benefit are always required: either alone may
      sometimes suffice. Similarly, these criteria should be
      treated, in the circumstances and within the limits
      suggested, as alternative validating criteria of surgical
      interventions.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion and recommendations</h4>

      <p class="text">It is necessary for the law to recognize and
      accommodate three realities in the context of medical
      interventions. First, medical intervention are not regarded
      in practice as <i>prima facie</i> illegal. Second, some
      non-therapeutic interventions are accepted by our society.
      Third, those unable to consent for themselves need increased
      protection. It is proposed that the most satisfactory
      approach to such an accommodation is to regard therapeutic
      interventions as <i>prima facie</i> legal and to retain the
      present criteria of <i>prima facie</i> illegality with
      respect to non-therapeutic medical procedures.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> Then, at a second stage of the
      analysis of the legality of any particular medical
      intervention, therapeutic benefit and personal "informed"
      consent should be treated as necessary, but not always
      sufficient, <i>alternative</i> validating requirements within
      the limits set by public policy.</p>

      <p class="text">Under such a scheme, the <i>prima facie</i>
      presumption of illegality of any non-therapeutic intervention
      on those incapable of consent could not be rebutted without
      statutory authorization of that procedure. In comparison, the
      personal "informed" consent of at least a competent
      adults<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> would rebut this
      presumption where to do so was not contrary to public policy.
      In the therapeutic situation, the use of therapeutic benefit
      and consent as alternative validating criteria must be
      subject to the proviso that where the person is capable of
      consenting, his consent must be obtained if the intervention
      is not to constitute a criminal offence. That is, the
      <i>prima facie</i> presumption of the legality of therapeutic
      interventions would be rebutted in such circumstances by the
      absence of consent.</p>

      <i>Morgentaler</i> v. <i>The Queen</i> there are various
      statements showing that, depending on the circumstances, the
      defence of necessity may be narrower or wider than the
      defense codified in s. 45: see supra, note 5, 647, 651, 653.
      S. 45 would have a wider operation than the defence of
      necessity in circumstances where the latter defence could not
      apply because there was no emergency. On the other hand, the
      defence of necessity could have a wider operation than s. 45
      would appear to allow, if, as Laskin C.J. suggests, the test
      for determining whether it applies were a subjective one,
      based on the honest belief and good faith of the surgeon,
      whereas the test of reasonableness for performing an
      operation under s. 45 "raise[s] only an objective question":
      <i>ibid.</i>, 647. This means, for instance, that a surgeon
      could subjectively believe an operation was urgent when the
      defence of necessity would apply, and yet a reasonable
      surgeon would not have thought it reasonable to perform that
      surgery when s . 45 would not be available. The Chief Justice
      makes the point that to the extent that this reasoning is
      based on <i>R</i>. v. <i>Bourne</i> [1939] 1 K.B. 687, it may
      be applicable only to certain eases of abortion. Certainly it
      must be asked whether such a subjective test would be applied
      more generally in determining whether the defence of
      necessity were available.</p>

      Starkman, <i>Preliminary Study on Law and the Control of
      Life</i>, an unpublished paper prepared for the Law Reform
      Commission of Canada, Aug. 23, 1974: after examining various
      editions of <i>Stephen's Digest</i>, the author concludes
      that "[i]n light of the above [analysis], it would appear
      that section 45 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> was intended to
      deal with the situation where the patient is not capable of
      consenting. If the patient is not capable, the person
      performing the operation is protected from criminal liability
      provided the patient's condition necessitates surgery for the
      preservation of life or limb. If these conditions are met,
      the surgeon is protected even if the patient resists
      treatment. Support for this interpretation of section 45 is
      obtained from editions of the Digest published after the
      Draft Code, which state that article 67 of the Draft Code,
      which is now section 45 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, is based
      on article 205 of the Digest" (pp. 5-6). For the contrary
      view, see <i>Morgentaler</i> v. <i>The Queen, supra</i>, note
      5, 643, where Laskin C.J. states that "<i>Stephen's Digest of
      the Criminal Law</i>" (5th ed. 1894) at p. 164 shows that s.
      67 was deemed by him to apply both to consensual and
      non-consensual surgery. Certainly, there is no limitation in
      s. 45 or anywhere else in the <i>Criminal Code</i> to suggest
      that s. 45 is confined to situations where an unconscious or
      disabled person is the subject of the surgical operation and
      is unable to give a consent."</p>

      <p class="cites">Compare Dickson J. in <i>Morgentaler</i>
      (<i>ibid.</i>, 676): "Section 45 may be available as an
      answer to a charge arising out of a surgical operation
      performed on an <i>unconscious patient</i> but it is not, in
      my view, available as an answer to a charge of procuring an
      abortion contrary to S. 251" [emphasis added].</p>

      While the Code itself reflects public policy, the manner of
      its practical application is also a matter of public policy.

      be prosecuted as a criminal assault.</p>

      donation," when this is reserved by law to adults, as an
      example of such a restriction. The decision that reserves
      this right of consent to competent adults can only be
      rationalized on the basis of public policy apart from express
      legislation to this effect. Thus a decision based on public
      policy cannot be avoided; merely the content of the public
      policy underlying the decision differs from that previously
      invoked.</p>

      <i>Cataford v. Moreau, supra</i>, note 2, and the discussion,
      supra, at pp. 86-7. Also see Fortin, Jodoin &amp; Popovici,

      <p class="cites"><a id="n26" name="n26"></a><sup>26</sup> It
      should be noted that sufficient benefit will still not
      necessarily be found in all cases. This can be seen from the
      fact that, even though the wide definition of "benefit"
      within s. 45 by Chief Justice Desch&ecirc;nes in
      <i>Cataford</i> v. <i>Moreau</i> was adopted by McQuaid J. in
      <i>Re "Eve," supra</i>, note 13, such that it included
      "socio-economic and other considerations," sufficient benefit
      to the mentally incompetent woman to legalize and hence
      authorize the sterilization operation on her was not found to
      be present in the circumstances of the latter case. In
      contrast, sufficient benefit to the competent woman who
      underwent sterilization was held to be present in
      <i>Cataford</i> v. <i>Moreau</i>. In effect, the wider notion
      of benefit gives competent persons, or a court which is
      approached in the case of an incompetent person, a wider
      discretion as to what medical interventions are allowed or
      perhaps more accurately, are not prohibited by law. It should
      be noted that McQuaid J. expressly allows consideration of
      the "preservation and protection of <i>quality of life</i>"
      (p. 44) [emphasis added] as among the factors to be
      considered in exercising this discretion, that is, in
      assessing benefit.</p>

      <p class="cites"><a id="n27" name="n27"></a><sup>27</sup> It
      is suggested that the word "consent" be reserved for personal
      consent in order to distinguish clearly this situation from
      the one where authorization is given to intervene on another
      person, which involves different considerations. See
      Somerville, <i>supra</i>, note 24, 81.</p>

      This is to assume that the only reason that the physician
      refused the intervention was his decision that it was not
      beneficial to the patient. Apart from the fact that a
      physician is generally not bound to enter a doctor-patient
      relationship, there are other reasons, such as a physician's
      own moral or ethical beliefs, which would allow him to refuse
      to perform a particular medical procedure.</p>

      <p class="cites"><a id="n31" name="n31"></a><sup>31</sup>
      This is the approach which has been recommended by the Law
      Reform Commission of Canada in <i>Medical Treatment and
      Criminal Law</i> (1980), 61.</p>

      <p class="cites"><a id="n32" name="n32"></a><sup>32</sup> I
      leave open for discussion the extent to which the suggested
      approach should, or arguably does under the present law,
      apply to minors capable of discernment and hence of giving or
      refusing consent to medical procedures.</p>
