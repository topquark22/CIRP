      <h1 align="center"><b>Male Circumcision: An Ethical and Legal
      Affront</b></h1>

      <p>By Christopher Price M.A.(Oxon)</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The origins of circumcision are lost in antiquity. Male
      circumcision is depicted in Egyptian tombs 5,000 years ago,
      while Gairdner <a href="#n1">1</a> refers to evidence that it
      originated in prehistory up to 15,000 years ago. Well before
      it acquired its religious overtones, it was clearly
      sacrificial, demanding the loss of something of great
      value.</p>

      <p>The words of Rabbi Maimonides <a href="#n2">2</a> from the
      12th century support this view of the losses: "As regards
      circumcision, I think that one of its objects is to limit
      sexual intercourse, and to weaken the organ of generation as
      far as possible, and thus cause man to be moderate....This
      commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a
      deficient physical creation, but as a means for perfecting
      man's moral shortcomings. The bodily injury caused to that
      organ is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt
      any vital function, nor does it destroy the power of
      generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust;
      for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of
      sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural
      enjoyment ... ."</p>

      <p>In the 19th century circumcision was advanced, in Britain
      and other English-speaking countries, as a preventive for
      masturbation and the ills believed to be caused by
      masturbation, and was labelled as 'hygienic', a
      misdescription which persists. Thereafter it became a
      procedure credited with a wide range of supposed benefits.
      Even today the prepuce is popularly seen as no more than a
      piece of vestigial skin of no, or minimal, function and whose
      removal causes no real pain, involves few or no risks and
      produces no short or long-term harm. It is usually claimed
      that when done in infancy it confers benefits. The practice
      is still widespread in the USA where currently 60% (down from
      90% in the 1970s) of male neonates are circumcised; the
      increasingly bizarre attempts to justify this routine
      mutilation<a href="#n3">3</a> only raise questions as to the
      psychopathology of the procedure.</p>

      <p>From the perception of harmlessness flows the belief that
      it represents a cheap, easy and appropriate solution to
      medical problems with the prepuce, and that its removal for
      ritual, cultural or social reasons is ethical and legal,
      giving rise to neither criminal nor civil liability since the
      operator may rely on parental consent to the procedure.</p>

      <p>Brazier<a href="#n4">4</a> encapsulates the misconceived
      discussion of the medical facts and legal issues that is
      common:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Medical opinion on male circumcision is divided. Until
        recently many doctors regarded it as rarely medically
        indicated. Now it seems circumcision provides some
        protection against venereal disease, at any rate for the
        circumcised man's partner! Male circumcision is a matter of
        medical debate. For Jewish and Muslim parents it is an
        article of faith. The child suffers momentary pain.
        Although medical opinion may not necessarily regard it as
        positively beneficial, it is in no way medically harmful if
        properly performed. The community as a whole regards it as
        a decision for the infant's parents."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Even the more thoughtful view of <a
      href="/library/legal/poulter/">Poulter</a><a href="#n5">5</a>
      errs:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The basic right to bodily integrity which everyone
        possesses under the English common law means that any
        interference with this right amounts to an assault or
        battery... The question raised in cases of circumcision,
        excision or infibulation is whether the operation can be
        justified as constituting lawful as opposed to unlawful
        interference with this right... Although there are no
        precedents in this field there would appear to be three
        possible grounds upon which a defence of lawfulness might
        succeed at common law. The first is that the procedure is
        therapeutic. If this can be established a parent can
        validly consent to it on behalf of a child who is too young
        to understand what is being done. It would appear unlikely
        that this defence could generally succeed other than in
        comparatively rare instances of physical defect or
        abnormality. Second ... it seems that a parent may equally
        validly authorise a non-therapeutic operation, provided it
        is not actively against his child's interests. This would
        appear to be the basis upon which the vast majority of male
        infants have been circumcised in this country with impunity
        from time immemorial. There is no need under this heading
        for the parent to establish that the operation is
        positively beneficial for the child, merely that he was
        acting reasonably in authorising it. Third, it has been
        tentatively suggested that a parent may even authorise
        something that is against his child's interests if it is
        compensated by sufficient advantage to others and is not
        seriously detrimental to the child... It seems extremely
        unlikely that it could justify the more remote and
        controversial benefit of satisfying a deeply-felt community
        attachment to traditional customs."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Poulter concludes that male circumcision is lawful. This
      can only be so if he is correct both in his analysis of the
      legal right of a parent to assent to an assault on his child
      for non-therapeutic reasons (i.e. his grounds 2 and 3), and
      in the view that male circumcision is harmless and not to be
      equated with female circumcision. His view of parental
      consent is open to doubt; but even if correct, the evidence
      of harm would defeat his conclusion on 'ground' 2, and more
      so for 'ground' 3. I shall not attempt to review here all the
      medical studies on the adverse effects of circumcision, nor
      the issues raised when doctors perform circumcision to treat
      a medical condition, for which a less invasive treatment
      would have been effective. There is however an extensive
      literature.<a href="#n6">6</a></p>

      <p>This paper proceeds from the basis that circumcision
      incontrovertibly:-</p>

      <p>inflicts severe pain, and that anaesthetics if used to
      manage that pain are themselves risky;</p>

      <p>-carries significant risks;</p>

      <p>- produces short and long-term harm and diminution in
      sexual function;</p>

      <p>- and has no medical benefits<a href="#n7">7</a>.</p>

      <p>Since it is clear that 'traditional' thinking as to the
      supposed legality of the procedure for non-therapeutic
      reasons is predicated on conventional beliefs about the
      nature of circumcision, this paper examines the consequences
      that flow from a recognition of the harmfulness of
      circumcision.</p>

      <h3>Assault</h3>

      <p>In <i>Collins v. Wilcock</i> <a href="#n8">8</a> Robert
      Goff LJ said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "the fundamental principle, plain and incontestable, is
        that every person's body is inviolate. It has long been
        established that any touching of another person, however
        slight, may amount to a battery. ....As Blackstone wrote in
        his Commentaries, 17th ed.(1830)vol. 3, p 120: 'the law
        cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence,
        and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage
        of it; every man's person being sacred, and no other having
        a right to meddle with it, in even the slightest manner.'
        The effect is that everybody is protected not only against
        physical injury but against any form of physical
        molestation. But so widely drawn a principle must
        inevitably be subject to exceptions."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Lord Lane CJ <a href="#n9">9</a> has said that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "...Nothing we have said is intended to cast doubt upon the
        accepted legality of properly conducted games and sports,
        lawful chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical
        interference, dangerous exhibitions, etc. These apparent
        exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of a
        legal right, in the case of chastisement or correction, or
        as needed in the public interest, in the other cases."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Although earlier cases<a href="#n10">10</a> indicated
      common law exceptions to the general rule that it was not
      permissible to inflict injury even with the victim's consent,
      circumcision was not mentioned as one. The first specific
      mention of it arose in the prosecution of a mother for
      scarifying the cheeks of her sons in accordance with tribal
      custom <a href="#n11">11</a>. Judge King-Hamilton QC said
      that the potential for serious injury was great because the
      slightest movement might lead to an eye injury; in
      distinction, he considered, from the 'accepted practices of
      ear-piercing and ritual circumcision'. But there is an
      obvious difference between piercing an ear-lobe and
      amputating a prepuce; and even in 1974 there was enough
      evidence of the harm from neonatal circumcision. Indeed,
      unattractive as ritual scarification of a child's body might
      be (it clearly was to Judge King-Hamilton), it is far less
      unacceptable than ritual circumcision: it amputates no flesh
      and causes no loss of function.</p>

      <p>Lord Templeman said in <i>R v. Brown</i>:<a
      href="#n12">12</a></p>

      <blockquote>
        "In some circumstances violence is not punishable under the
        criminal law ... Surgery involves intentional violence
        resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm but
        surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities carried on
        with consent by or on behalf of the injured person have
        been accepted as lawful notwithstanding that they involve
        actual bodily harm. Ritual circumcision, tattooing,
        ear-piercing and violent sports .. are lawful activities."
      </blockquote>
      The express inclusion of circumcision as lawful was not
      essential to the finding of the majority of the law lords
      that consensual sado-masochistic injuries were criminal.
      Further, as Lord Templeman observed, some activities, once
      thought of as legal, were no longer regarded as such: "In
      earlier days other forms of violence were lawful ... when
      they ceased to be lawful they were tolerated until well into
      the 19th century. Duelling and fighting were at first lawful
      and then tolerated provided the protagonists were voluntary
      participants". 

      <p>Lord Templeman's view clearly depended on a perception
      that the harm caused by circumcision was minimal, that
      parental consent sufficed and, it would seem, on a tacit
      belief that religious and/or multicultural tolerance demanded
      its continuing acceptance; he was bolstered no doubt by
      doctors whose readiness to circumcise for spurious reasons
      provided a misplaced respectability.</p>

      <p>His remarks, both about ritual circumcision <i>per se</i>
      and as contrasted with the sado-masochistic practises in
      Brown, were made without regard to the ordinary law of
      assault to the person, to the criminal offence of wilful harm
      to children (<a
      href="http://www.swarb.co.uk/acts/1933CaYPAct.shtml"
      target="_blank">Children and Young Persons Act 1933</a>) or
      to the limits on parental consent implicit in the duty to
      treat the child's welfare as paramount (<a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children
      Act 1989</a>).</p>

      <p>The Law Commission,<a href="#n13">13</a> in its
      consultation paper on consent in the criminal law, asserts
      that "Male circumcision is lawful under English common law..
      It is generally accepted that the removal of the foreskin of
      the penis has little, if any, effect on a man's ability to
      enjoy sexual intercourse, and this act is not, therefore,
      regarded as mutilation".</p>

      <p>Male circumcision was also considered by the Queensland
      Law Reform Commission <a href="#n14">14</a> (QLRC) - a common
      law jurisdiction. QLRC made no claim for its legality at
      common law. In Queensland a person can consent to what would
      otherwise be a simple assault, but consent does not remove
      criminal responsibility for more serious injuries such as
      wounding. QLRC stated that: "In the absence of 'real'
      consent, circumcision of male infants would fall within the
      definition of assault under s.245 of the Queensland Criminal
      Code. It might also be an offence endangering life or health.
      A number of criminal offences may be committed depending on
      the circumstances."</p>

      <p>QLRC concluded:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Whether or not circumcision would be for the benefit of
        the particular child and whether or not it would be
        reasonable having regard to the child's state at the time
        and to all the circumstances of the case would need to be
        assessed on a case-by-case basis". It appears to have based
        the permissibility of male circumcision on the exemption
        given by law to medical procedures, rather than on some
        general rule of common law that it is an exception to the
        general prohibition on consensual infliction of injury.
      </blockquote>

      <p>QLRC also discussed the limits on parental consent:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The common law operating in Queensland appears to be that
        if a young person is unable, through lack of maturity or
        other disability, to give effective consent to a proposed
        procedure and if the nature of the proposed treatment is
        invasive, irreversible and major surgery and for
        non-therapeutic purposes, then court approval is required
        before such treatment can proceed. The court will not
        approve the treatment unless it is necessary and in the
        young person's best interests ... The basis of this
        attitude is the respect which must be paid to an
        individual's bodily integrity...Unless there are immediate
        health benefits to a particular child from circumcision, it
        is unlikely that the procedure itself could be considered
        as therapeutic ... The circumcision is invasive,
        irreversible and major. It involves the removal of an
        otherwise healthy organ part. It has serious attendant
        risks... On a strict interpretation of the assault
        provisions of the Queensland Criminal Code, routine
        circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a
        criminal act. Further, consent by parents to the procedure
        being performed may be invalid in the light of the common
        law's restrictions on the ability of parents to consent to
        the non-therapeutic treatment of children".
      </blockquote>
      It is clear that the QLRC believes non-therapeutic
      circumcision to be unlawful. 

      <h3>Parental consent and child welfare</h3>

      <p>The law recognises limits on the parental discharge of
      responsibilities for children. First, the law sees parents as
      having duties (from which flow rights in order to discharge
      those duties). As Lord Scarman says in <i>Gillick</i><a
      href="#n15">15</a>: "The principle of the law, as I shall
      endeavour to show, is that parental rights are derived from
      parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed for
      the protection of the person and property of the child.
      ...Giving consent to medical treatment of a child is a clear
      incident of parental responsibility arising from the duty to
      protect the child."</p>

      <p>Professor Dwyer<a href="#n16">16</a> convincingly argues
      that the view that parents have rights over their children is
      incorrect and untenable: the rights reside in the children
      with the parents acting as agents for the children to enforce
      those rights. Dwyer writes from a culture and constitution
      (that of the US) which sets great store on freedom from state
      interference and on religious freedom, to the point that the
      correct position has been blurred. Dwyer echoes English law
      as to the nature of the parent-child relationship.</p>

      <p>Approaches to medical interventions involving children are
      discussed also by Linda Delany.<a href="#n17">17</a> Those
      who would apply to all non-therapeutic circumcisions a
      different and/or lower level of protection of the child than
      either of those identified by Delany must clearly articulate
      this, demonstrating why such a differing approach would be
      necessary, proper and justified against general legal
      principles and civilised legal norms.</p>

      <p>The factual situation discussed by Delany is the practice
      of requiring a child to donate an organ or bodily material
      for the benefit of another, such as a seriously-ill sibling;
      whilst these procedures may often involve reduction in
      function (at least potentially, as when a kidney is donated)
      they may also merely involve the loss of body fluids which
      the donor will restore naturally. One approach, wholly
      consistent with the Children Act 1989, is that of the House
      of Lords in <i>Gillick</i>, permitting a medical procedure
      only if it serves the best interests of the child who
      undergoes it. The second, stemming from <i>S v. S, W v.
      Official Solicitor</i>,<a href="#n18">18</a> accepts that
      parents can give valid consent to treatments which are not
      "against the interests of the child".</p>

      <p>Applying either approach to non-therapeutic circumcision
      (where the loss and risks are significant, there is no
      recipient to benefit and, at best, the 'benefit' to the
      victim is an intangible cultural identity) leads to the
      conclusion that a parent cannot give a valid consent to a
      non-therapeutic circumcision.</p>

      <p>The law has for many years also recognised the need to
      protect children from the wilful infliction of harm by
      parents, guardians or those <i>in loco parentis</i>. Thus,
      under section 1(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act
      1933, a person who 'wilfully assaults' a child or 'causes or
      procures him to be assaulted..... in a manner likely to cause
      him unnecessary suffering or injury to health' commits an
      offence. As Brigman <a href="#n19">19</a> has observed,
      routine circumcision is child abuse.</p>

      <p>It is hard to see why criminal liability should not
      properly attach to all those complicit in the non-therapeutic
      circumcision of a boy, including the consenting parent, as
      well as the circumciser, since the parent "causes or procures
      him to be assaulted". Irrespective of any criminal liability
      the circumcised child would seem to have a strong claim for
      substantial damages against all those involved in his
      mutilation.</p>

      <h3>The defence of necessity</h3>

      <p>Doctors who perform ritual circumcisions usually plead
      'necessity': in its least repellent form the argument runs
      that since boys will be ritually circumcised anyway, it is
      'better' that this be done by doctors in a clinical setting;
      alternatively that it is a 'service' to the community which
      'ought to be made available'. The Bradford Royal Infirmary
      provides such a service, with the knowledge and, seemingly,
      encouragement of the NHS Executive.</p>

      <p>Quite where the interests of the child-patient figure in
      this, and how this approach is compatible with the ethical
      principle that the doctor owes his duty solely to his patient
      - the child - and not to a parent and/or some religious
      behest, is hard to see.</p>

      <p>Even the American Academy of Pediatrics in guidance on
      treating children <a href="#n20">20</a> has said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Thus 'proxy consent' poses serious problems for pediatric
        health care providers. Such providers have legal and
        ethical duties to their child patients to render competent
        medical care based on what the patient needs, not what
        someone else expresses ... the pediatrician's
        responsibilities to his or her patient exist independent of
        parental desires or proxy consent."
      </blockquote>
      Those who advance the plea of necessity and/ or expediency
      might wish to consider how they would rebut comparison with
      unethical behaviour by other doctors, such as those involved
      in torture, who also use such excuses. They might also
      explain why abusive behaviour towards a child is less abusive
      when performed by a doctor. 

      <p>Perhaps the antiquity and religious overtones of the
      procedure, coupled with the continuing unease at masturbation
      that provided the 19C arguments for routine circumcision in
      the name of 'hygiene', provide the oil for this 'slippery
      slope' where the interests of the patient are subordinated to
      demands of the State, religion, or parents. Thus we should be
      alarmed but not surprised that "the Royal College of
      Physicians requires as a condition of admission to fellowship
      the completion of a 'form of faith' in which the doctor
      promises to 'do everything ... to the honour of the College
      and welfare of the State' without mention of responsibilities
      to individual patients."<a href="#n21">21</a></p>

      <h3>Discrimination</h3>

      <p>Discrimination against boys in permitting inevitably
      damaging mutilation of their genitals, whilst enacting
      legislation<a href="#n22">22</a> to criminalise a similar
      procedure when done to girls, is as offensive as any other
      expression of discrimination. Kluge<a href="#n23">23</a>
      compares female with male circumcision and, expressing
      similar views on both, writes: "To argue differently is to be
      guilty of discrimination on the basis of sex...Both involve
      what in other contexts would be called nonconsensual
      mutilation of a minor for nonmedical reasons". Circumcision
      further discriminates - between those boys who, because of an
      accident of birth, face non-therapeutic circumcision and
      those more fortunate boys who do not.</p>

      <p>Rejoicing in our multicultural society does not mean that
      we should be blind to practices, whatever their source and
      motive, which are them-selves abusive and discriminatory of
      others, directly and inevitably diminishing the freedoms,
      human rights, integrity and dignity of others.</p>

      <h3>International law</h3>

      <p>Certain rights are recognised as so fundamental that they
      are part of customary international law, as well as being
      found in a host of international conventions on human rights:
      these include the right to bodily integrity, freedom from
      cruel and inhuman treatment (which would include circumcision
      once its harmful effects were recognised), and freedom from
      discrimination on a variety of grounds including birth, sex,
      race, creed.<a href="#n24">24</a></p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> makes the position
      clearer in respect to circumcision. Article 24(3) provides:
      "States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate
      measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices
      prejudicial to the health of children." Some have sought to
      argue that this provision was only aimed at female
      circumcision; but this argument cannot hold when the
      Convention is read with the interpretative provisions of the
      <a
      href="http://193.135.136.30/archives/vienna/vien_69.htm">Vienna
      Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> 1969.<a
      href="#n25">25</a></p>

      <h3>"God commands it"</h3>

      <p>Since the Holocaust it has been regarded as virtually
      impossible to criticise any Jewish practice, or even ritual
      circumcision by the two main religions that perform it
      (Judaism and Islam). Any such criticism is seen as
      essentially racist and/or a denial of religious freedom. But
      it is not. Rather it is an assertion of the rights of the
      individual over the perceived rights of others to behave
      towards that individual in any way that they think fit.</p>

      <p>Customary international law provides that an individual's
      exercise of his freedoms can legitimately be restrained when
      so to exercise them is to damage or deny those freedoms to
      another. Thus Article 9(2) of the <a
      href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm">European
      Convention on Human Rights</a> provides:</p>

      <p>"Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be
      subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and
      are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
      public safety, for the protection of public order, health or
      morals, <i>or for the protection of the rights and freedoms
      of others</i>" (emphasis added). The Convention thus
      distinguishes between the unfettered right to freedom of
      thought, and the more restricted right to manifest one's
      religion.</p>

      <p>As Dwyer<a href="#n26">26</a> says: "... even if it does
      on the whole further parents' interests to possess rights to
      direct their children's lives in ways that are harmful to the
      children, the state should deem such interests illegitimate
      and refuse to give them precedence over the interests of
      children. The problem with such 'interests' is that they
      entail treating children instrumentally, using children in
      ways that sacrifice their welfare interests in order to
      further the ulterior interests of parents....This is true
      whether the parents' motives are self-regarding or solely
      concerned with the well-being of the child (e.g. if the
      parents believe they are sacrificing the child's temporal
      interests in order to further the child's spiritual
      interests)....The reluctance of liberals in particular to
      take a stand against religiously motivated parenting of which
      they personally disapprove is, I believe, due largely to
      their believing that liberal values of tolerance and respect
      for diverse ideological views require the state to defer to
      the viewpoint of the parents in determining whether
      particular parenting practices should be permissible. This
      might be a defensible position from which to determine the
      permissibility of what individuals do to themselves or what
      consenting adults do to each other. However, it is a mistake
      in the case of children, who are not the same persons as
      their parents, nor, in general, consenting participants in
      the religious practices of their parents."</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>At a time when society is wrestling with legal and ethical
      issues such as those of conception for infertile couples,
      xenotransplants and animal cloning, it may seem trivial to
      look critically at male circumcision. But so to look
      (combining the state of medical knowledge of the inevitable
      harm of the procedure, and the absence of benefits from
      non-therapeutic circumcision, with a return to a critical
      examination of the law and ethical principles in the light of
      the known medical position) reveals current attitudes which
      do no credit either to doctors, lawyers or ethicists. The BMA
      <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/bma/">guidance
      on circumcision</a>, published in September 1996 by its
      Medical Ethics Committee, and the recent GMC <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/gmc/">guidelines</a>,
      are but examples of shabby and sectionalist attempts by the
      medical profession to pander to the ritual circumcisers, at
      the expense of the child-patient. Non-therapeutic
      circumcision is clearly discriminatory, unethical and
      illegal. Its pre-historic origins, and its kinship with
      subincision and other forms of penile mutilation, show its
      essential barbarity. It should no longer be tolerated,
      despite its religious overtones.</p>

      <p>"A remedy [for masturbation] which is almost always

      <p>"Finally, circumcision probably tends to increase the
      power of sexual control. The only physiological advantage
      which the prepuce can be supposed to confer is that of
      maintaining the penis in a condition susceptible to more
      acute sensation than would otherwise exist. It may increase
      the pleasure of coition and the impulse to it: but these are
      advantages which in the present state of society can well be
      spared. If in their loss increase in sexual control should
      result, one should be thankful." Jonathan Hutchinson. "Our

      <p>"It has been urged as an argument against the universal
      adoption of circumcision that the removal of the protective
      covering of the glans tends to dull the sensibility of that
      exquisitely sensitive structure and thereby diminishes sexual
      appetite and the pleasurable effects of coitus. Granted that
      this be true, my answer is that, whatever may have been the
      case in days gone be, sensuality in our time needs neither
      whip nor spur, but would be all the better for a little more
      judicious use of curb and bearing-rein." E. Harding Freeland.

      <p>"I suggest that all male children should be circumcised.
      This is "against nature," but that is exactly the reason why
      it should be done. Nature intends that the adolescent male
      shall copulate as often and as promiscuously as possible, and
      to that end covers the sensitive glans so that it shall be
      ever ready to receive stimuli. Civilization, on the contrary,
      requires chastity, and the glans of the circumcised rapidly
      assumes a leathery texture less sensitive than skin. Thus the
      adolescent has his attention drawn to his penis much less
      often. I am convinced that masturbation is much less common
      in the circumcised. With these considerations in view it does
      not seem apt to argue that "God knows best how to make little
      boys." R.W. Cockshut. "Circumcision," <i>British Medical
      Journal</i>, 2 (1935): 764.</p>

      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights</a> provides in Article 2
      that:</p>

      <p>`Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set
      forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind,
      such as: race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or
      other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or
      other status.'</p>

      <p>In the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN
      Convention on the Right of the Child</a>, Art 2 provides:</p>

      <p>"1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set
      forth in the present Convention to each child within their
      jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective
      of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's
      race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
      opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property,
      disability, birth or other status.</p>

      <p>2. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to
      ensure that the child is protected against all forms of
      discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status,
      activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's
      parents, legal guardians, or family members."</p>

      <p>9 "Circumcision causes pain, trauma, and a permanent loss
      of protective and erogenous tissue...Removing normal,
      healthy, functioning tissue for no medical reason has ethical
      implications: circumcision violates the United Nations'
      Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 5) and the
      United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child
      (Article 13). Leo Sorger, MD. To AGOC: Stop Circumcisions,
      <i>Ob.GYN. News</i> (November 1, 1994): p. 8</p>

      <p>"Despite the obviously irrational cruelty of circumcision,
      the profit incentive in American medical practice is unlikely
      to allow science or human rights principles to interrupt the
      highly lucrative American circumcision industry. It is now
      time for European medical associations loudly to condemn the
      North American medical community for participating in and
      profiting from what is by any standard a senseless and
      barbaric sexual mutilation of innocent children." Paul M.
