      <h4>SPECIFIC ISSUE ORDER</h4>

      <h5>Re J (Specific Issue Orders: Child's Religious
      Upbringing and Circumcision)</h5>

      <h6>(Court of Appeal): Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P,
      Schiemann and Thorpe LJ, 25 November 1999) [2000] FLR
      (forthcoming)</h6>

      <p class="text">The 5-year-old boy was being brought up by
      his &lsquo;non-practising Christian' mother with whom
      he lived and his &lsquo;non-practising Muslim' father
      with whom he had staying contact. The boy therefore had a
      mixed heritage and an essentially secular lifestyle with no
      settled religious faith. In the High Court Wall J refused the
      father's applications for specific issue orders under <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s8.html" target="_blank">s
      8</a> of the <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/" target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a> that the boy be brought up in the
      Muslim religion and that he be circumcised (see <a
      href="/library/legal/Re_J/"><i>Re J (Specific Issue Orders:
      Muslim Upbringing and Circumcision)</i> [1999] 2 FLR
      678</a>). In summary, his Lordship found that circumcision
      would be more the exception than the rule in the circles in
      which the boy was likely to move; that he was not going to be
      brought up as a Muslim; that he was in the middle of a
      hostile contact battle between the parents; and that it is a
      strong thing to impose a medically unnecessary procedure on a
      residential parent opposed to it. The father appealed on the
      basis that the judge had confused the child's religion
      with the child's religious upbringing - that the child
      was born a Muslim and his religion was not terminated by the
      separation of his parents.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Held</b> - dismissing the appeal - <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html" target="_blank">s 1(7)</a>
      of the <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/" target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a> does not enable a parent to arrange
      circumcision without the consent of the other. As
      circumcision is irreversible and of considerable consequence
      it must join the exceptional categories where disagreement
      between holders of parental responsibility must be submitted
      to the court for determination.</p>

      <p class="text">LINDSEY KUSHNER QC and MICHARD HUMPHREY

      <h5>COMMENT</h5>

      <p class="text"><b>In determining this appeal against a
      judgment described by Thorpes LJ as &lsquo;impregnable'
      the Court of Appeal roundly endorsed Wall J's approach
      (see the insightful comment by Professor Rebecca
      Bailey-Harris at (1999 Fam Law 543) on this important case)
      and addressed a significant point of principle in relation to
      the exercise of parental responsibility. <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s2.html" target="_blank">Section 2(7)</a> of the
      <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/" target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a> provides that:</b></p>

      <p class="quote"><b>&lsquo;Where more than one parent has
      parental responsibility for a child, each of them may act
      alone and without the other (others) in meeting that
      responsibility; but nothing in this Part shall be taken to
      effect the operation of any enactment which requires the
      consent of more than one person in a matter affecting the
      child.'</b></p>

      <p class="text"><b>Clearly, there are issues recognized by <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s13.html">s
      13(1)</a> of the Children's Act 1989, such as changing the
      child's surname or removing him from the jurisdiction,
      that requires the written consent of every person with
      parental responsibility. However, both Thorpe LJ and Dame
      Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P made clear that there is a small
      group of important decisions which should not be made by one
      parent, albeit with parental responsibility, in the absence
      of the agreement of the other. Circumcision is one of these.
      The sterilization of a child was cited by the President as a
      further example of a procedure requiring the specific
      approval of the court and which only will be carried out in
      the best interests of the child. It should be noted, however,
      that the sterilisation of a child requires the approval of
      the court even where the parents, as in Re HG (Specific Issue
      Order: Sterilisation) [1993] 1 FLR 587, are in agreement. The
      act of bringing the issue before the court was itself an
      exercise of parental responsibility, according to the High
      Court in this case. The same cannot be true for ritual
      circumcision. Where two parents agree to have their child
      circumcised the carrying out of the operation is a lawful
      exercised of parental responsibility in English law</b></p>
