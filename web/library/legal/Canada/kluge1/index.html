      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><font size="+2"
        face="Lucida Calligraphy">S</font>UPPOSE</strong> a
        physician is asked to perform a procedure that has no
        recognized medical value and may harm the person who
        undergoes it. Suppose that the person requesting it is
        doing so not on her own behalf, but for her young daughter.
        How should the physician respond?</p>

        <p>The answer is easy. The doctor will probably say that
        medical ethics forbids undertaking any procedure that is
        potentially harmful and has no therapeutic value.</p>

        <p>But suppose that the request is so deeply rooted in the
        cultural background of the woman making the request that
        the mere suggestion that the procedure is inappropriate
        would be regarded as a deep insult to her cultural
        identity. Furthermore, suppose that the woman claims that
        failure to perform the procedure would harm the girl's
        self-esteem and cultural identity, and affect her societal
        integration. And suppose she points out that the World
        Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health includes
        the notion of social well-being.</p>

        <p>Is the physician who refuses to perform the procedure
        not making a judgement about the ethical acceptability of
        those cultural values and rejecting WHO's definition of
        health?</p>

        <p>Female circumcision, which has already been banned by
        the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, does
        indeed present an ethical problem. But is it unethical for
        a physician to perform it? The answer is yes, but
        explanations are needed.</p>

        <p>If a woman competently requests the circumcision for
        herself and fully understands the nature and implications
        of what she is asking, it is like any other request for a
        procedure that involves medical skill and expertise. The
        physician must be sure that the woman really does
        understand the nature of her request, and that it is
        voluntary. When all is said and done, if there really is an
        informed, competent and voluntary request, then it is
        essentially a request for cosmetic surgery, albeit an
        extreme version.</p>

        <p>But this does not mean that a physician automatically
        has to perform the procedure. Here the nature of the
        physician-patient relationship, and the ethical duties of
        the medical profession, come into play.</p>

        <p>The profession has a monopoly on providing medical
        services. This means that it must provide all medical
        services that are appropriate and necessary, and can be
        provided under the prevailing circumstances. Therefore
        physicians have a duty to provide such services even if
        they do not like it---assuming the duty is a condition of
        their profession.</p>

        <p>However, having a duty to provide all medically
        appropriate and necessary services that are possible is
        different from having a duty to provide all medical
        services that are possible and that anyone might ask for.
        At that point, we are no longer dealing with the services
        that form the basis of the professional monopoly or that
        are socially mandated.</p>

        <p>We are in the realm of what physicians and patients
        might voluntarily agree to as a matter of contract. Here,
        the personal values of physicians can play a role as long
        as they are not unethical: the physician may refuse to
        provide the service.</p>

        <p>People who think that physicians have to ignore their
        own qualms and simply do what they are asked have a
        mistaken understanding of the physician-patient
        relationship, and of the medical profession's
        obligations.</p>

        <p>The patient (or patient proxy) does have the ultimate
        right to decide whether to accept or reject any diagnostic
        measure or treatment---this is the heart of patient
        autonomy. However, the physician's entry into a
        professional relationship with a patient does not turn that
        doctor into a moral eunuch. Unquestionably, physicians may
        not impose their own values on patients. But that does not
        mean that physicians must be ethically uncritical.</p>

        <p>If what the patient wants violates a fundamental ethical
        principle, then no matter how much the patient wants it,
        the physician does not have to agree to do it. The reason
        is simple: no one has a duty to do something that is
        unethical. This is not a matter of personal values, but of
        basic, universal and fundamental ethical principles that
        apply to all people.</p>

        <p>Of course, the request for female circumcision is
        usually made by a woman on behalf of a child. Should the
        physician then refuse? Yes. Female circumcision is special
        because the woman is acting as a proxy decision maker for a
        child. Proxy decision makers do not have the right to use
        their values and perspectives---they must do what is in the
        best interests of the incompetent person, and may use their
        values or standards as long as this will not imperil the
        welfare of their charge. Most important, they may use them
        only if they do not demean the incompetent person.</p>

        <p>Values that treat people as mere objects for the
        gratification of others, or for advancing a certain view,
        fail that test. It does not matter that such values are
        hallowed in tradition and are a cultural mainstay.</p>

        <p>Canada is not a melting pot of cultures: it is a mosaic.
        The people who live here are not forced to abandon their
        cultural heritage and adopt a homogeneous cultural
        identity. In fact, at its best Canada encourages its people
        to preserve their cultural heritage. By charter and law, it
        is illegal to discriminate on the basis of that heritage or
        background. This cultural attitude is the reflection of a
        fundamental ethical principle: respect for people. Every
        person is someone of incommensurable value, and the beliefs
        of that person are worthy of respect.</p>

        <p>Respect---but not unreflective acceptance. Some of the
        countries where female circumcision is common have accepted
        that it is a violation of the dignity and integrity of a
        woman. They have outlawed the practice, tradition
        notwithstanding. The United Kingdom and France have done
        the same.</p>

        <p>For its part, Canada and Canadian physicians cannot
        consistently espouse the principle of respect for people on
        the one hand, and then agree to a practice that violates
        that principle. Canadian physicians cannot consistently
        accept the principle of respect for people in the name of
        medical ethics, and then perform procedures they know to be
        medically inappropriate, harmful, and demeaning only
        because they do not want to offend a misplaced cultural
        sensitivity.</p>

        <p><span class="yellow">With due alteration of detail, the
        same ethical reasoning holds for male circumcision. There
        rarely are medical reasons for performing the procedure;
        personal preference or religious values of the parents
        usually underlie the request.</span></p>

        <p>If these are insufficient to justify the circumcision of
        girls then, unless there are distinguishing medical
        reasons, they are also insufficient to justify the
        circumcision of boys. To argue differently is to be guilty
        of discrimination on the basis of sex. The fact that female
        circumcision is a more serious intervention does not alter
        the situation. Both involve what in other contexts would be
        called non-consensual mutilation of a minor for non-medical
        reasons.</p>

        <p><strong>LETTER</strong><br />
        <i>Can Med Assoc J</i> 1994;<strong>149(1):</strong>16-17.
        [1 July 1993]</p>

        <p>Dr. Kluge has done a commendable job of discussing the
        ethical implications of female circumcision. He has also
        succinctly argued why ethical physicians should not condone
        a procedure that is seen as a violation of the dignity and
        integrity of a woman.</p>

        <p>However, he has suggested that the circumcision of boys
        is also "non-consensual mutilation of a minor for
        non-medical reasons" and as such, is no different from the
        circumcision of girls. This seems a much less ethically
        tenable position.</p>

        <p>Although there is ample evidence that the clitoris plays
        an important role in the life of adult women, the prepuce
        serves little, if any, physiologic function.<font
        size="2"><sup>1</sup></font> There are no known medical
        indications for or benefits from the circumcision of a
        healthy newborn girl, but the circumcision of the penis
        decreases the risk of urinary tract infections,<font
        size="2"><sup>2</sup></font> virtually eliminates the
        development of phimosis and balanitis,<font
        size="2"><sup>3,4</sup></font> improves penile hygiene<font
        size="2"><sup>3</sup></font> and almost eliminates the risk
        of penile tumours.<font size="2"><sup>5</sup></font></p>

        <p>With all this in mind I find it difficult to consider
        circumcision of the prepuce and the clitoris medically and
        ethically equivalent.</p>

        <p>Dr. Shabbir M.H. Alibhai attempts with meretricious
        arguments to justify male circumcision (<i>ibid:</i>
        16-17). He cites references suggesting that circumcision
        prevents urinary tract infections and phimosis and that it
        improves penile hygiene---a screed of canards.</p>

        <p>It has been suggested that venereal disease is more
        common in uncircumcised males.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#y1">1</a></sup></font> Although this may be true in
        the United States, where being intact is not socially
        acceptable,<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#y2">2</a></sup></font> a closer examination of the
        habits of those who contract these conditions provides a
        more scientific explanation.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#y1">1,3</a></sup></font> Physicians with experience
        in the Middle East, especially during World War II, noticed
        no shortage of venereal disease in the local inhabitants.
        After the Allied landings in Italy there was a titanic
        outbreak of gonorrhea among US troops. The incidence was so
        high that what little penicillin was available had to be
        diverted from the treatment of wounds.</p>

        <p>Alibhai seeks to ask whether circumcision is
        cost-effective in preventing penile cancer. A renowned US
        genitourinary surgeon calculated that "if a surgeon
        performed one circumcision every 10 minutes, 8 hours a day,
        5 days a week, he would seem to be able to prevent one
        penile cancer by working steadily between 6 and 29 years.
        Since a significant number of penile cancers are curable,
        still more time and labour might be required to prevent a
        fatality from this disease."<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#y4">4</a></sup></font> He went on to write that "if
        cancer prevention is to be an end in itself, then simple
        mastectomy of female infants would presumably be an even
        more effective measure."</p>

        <p>Some years ago I echoed our medical school teaching:
        that the prepuce has a function---namely, to protect the
        glans, which is almost insensitive to most ordinary tactile
        and thermal stimuli.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#y1">1,3</a></sup></font> Removal of the prepuce
        exposes the glans to foreign stimuli, which dull the
        special receptors. During coitus the uncircumcised phallus
        penetrates smoothly, the prepuce retracting as the organ
        advances. In contrast, when the circumcised organ is
        introduced, friction develops. Penetration in the
        circumcised man is akin to thrusting the foot into a sock
        held open at the top. In contrast, in the intact
        counterpart it has been likened to slipping the foot into a
        sock that had been previously rolled up. (This simile has
        been attributed to the late Philip Mitchener, a fine
        surgeon and a mordant wit, who reigned for years at
        St.&nbsp;Thomas's Hospital in London, England.)<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#y3">3</a></sup></font></p>

        <p>The hazards of circumcision are considerable,<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#y5">5-7</a></sup></font> and the
        indications for the procedure are few.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#y8">8</a></sup></font>
        Nevertheless, there may be one reason for it, and this came
        to my attention when I was in the Royal Army Medical Corps.
        Those circumcised British servicemen who served in the
        Western desert found themselves slightly more comfortable
        in a sandstorm than their uncircumcised comrades.</p>

        <p>Finally, we should ask ourselves whether it is likely
        that nature, in her wisdom, would permit every male child
        to be born with a useless appendage, the presence of which,
        according to some, frequently leads to serious
        consequences, including death. Why do men in Europe live so
        long despite not being raped at birth?</p>

        "Female circumcision: When medical ethics confronts
        cultural values" (<i>Can Med Assoc J</i>

        letter "Male and female circumcision in Canada" (<i>Can Med

        equates male circumcision with clitoridectomy and then
        dismisses the former as having little medical value, and
        Lynch ridicules parents who think male circumcision will
        prevent phimosis or urinary tract infections (UTI).</p>

        than 50 studies showing that uncircumcised men are at
        increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Important
        African studies---some by Canadians---have demonstrated
        that uncircumcised heterosexual men have a fivefold to
        eightfold increased risk for HIV infection.<font

        <p>It is unfortunate that some provincial health plans no
        longer prophylactic circumcision in male newborns and even
        more unfortunate that some doctors appear to be giving
        false information on the subject. Medical ethics dictates
        that new parents receive informed counselling about consent
        for and refusal of the procedure.</p>

        <p><strong>[Dr. Kluge responds:]</strong></p>

        <p>Mr. Jones presents a one-sided picture of research into
        the medical appropriateness of male circumcision. To get
        another picture one should read Dr. Keith Morgan's letter
        (<i>Can Med Assoc J</i> 1994;<strong>149:</strong>1382-3)
        and research cited by <a
        href="/library/general/poland/">Poland</a>.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#z1">1</a></sup></font></p>

        <p>However, to continue citing opposing research results
        would merely be to engage in a battle of references without
        coming to grips with the central issue, as outlined by
        Morgan in his discussion of penile cancer, among other
        issues: <span class="yellow">Is it ethically appropriate to
        perform circumcisions because there is some statistical
        evidence that a potentially curable disease with a low
        incidence may be prevented by surgery, even though the
        disease also occurs in people who have undergone the
        surgery<font size="2"><sup><a href="#z2">2</a></sup></font>
        and the incidence of the disease in countries where the
        surgery is not routinely performed is similar to that in
        countries where it is?</span><font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#z3">3</a></sup></font></p>

        <p>If the answer to this question is Yes, then the same
        underlying principle should be applied to all similar
        cases: whenever there is statistical evidence that a
        potentially curable disease or condition with a low
        incidence could be prevented by surgery, but the evidence
        also indicates that the incidence is the same in other
        countries where the surgery is not routinely performed, we
        should still perform the surgery in every person in whom
        the disease or condition might develop. All sorts of
        medical conditions would be implicated. I suspect that we
        would be operating nonstop on just about every part of the
        human body if we took this stance. I shudder to think of
        the cost---and the implications for public health. The more
        appropriate action would be to investigate why the
        incidence of the disease or condition differs between
        countries.</p>

        <p>Even if further investigation corroborated the results
        of studies Jones cites on the risk of HIV infection among
        uncircumcised men, the very mention of this issue in this
        context is disturbing. Because condoms are good protection
        against HIV infection the transmission rates among
        circumcised and uncircumcised men using condoms should be
        the same. Therefore, Jones must be talking about
        transmission rates among men who do not use condoms. It is
        universally agreed that unprotected sexual intercourse is
        inappropriate. The sexual transmission of HIV will be
        retarded or stopped not by circumcising males but, rather,
        by appropriate sexual behaviour. To suggest that all men be
        circumcised so that some who engage in inappropriate sexual
        behaviour will have a lower rate of HIV transmission runs
        the risk of encouraging such behaviour among circumcised
        men. Is that appropriate?</p>
