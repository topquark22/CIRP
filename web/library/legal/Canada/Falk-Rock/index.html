    <h3>Letter of Allan Rock, Minister of Justice, to Geoffrey T.

          <p class="sig"><tt>The Hon. Allan Rock<br />
           Minister of Justice<br />
           and Attorney General of Canada<br />
           House of Commons<br />
           Ottawa ON<br />
           K1A 0H8<br />
           February 6, 1996</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Dear Mr. Falk,</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Thank you for your correspondence in which you
          question why there are no legal sanctions against the
          practice of male infant circumcision in Canada,
          especially given the existing prohibitions against the
          practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). I regret
          that I was unable to reply earlier.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Male circumcision is often compared to FGM and,
          while it is still my view that the practice of FGM is an
          offence under the <a
          href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
          target="_blank">Criminal Code</a> as it currently exists,
          you may be aware that I have received a lot of support
          for adding a specific reference to FGM in the Code.
          Therefore, on December 14, 1995, I tabled Bill C-119, "An
          Act to amend the Criminal Code (child prostitution,
          criminal harassment and female genital
          mutilation)."</tt></p>

          <p><tt>It is important to recognize, however, that FGM
          and male circumcision are not comparable procedures.
          Whereas the Canadian medical profession coes not
          recognize FGM as an appropriate medical procedure in any
          case for any girl or woman, male circumcision remains a
          medically accepted procedure. More specifically, there
          are recognized medical benefits to male circumcision in
          appropriate cases but there are none on the case of FGM.
          FGM always poses serious life-threatening and life long
          health risks for women.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I am aware that although the Canadian Paediatric
          Society's policy entitled "<a
          href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
           target="_blank">Circumcision in the Newborn Period</a>"
          does not advocate routine male circumcision for newborns,
          neither does it prohibit the practice for newborns. In
          contrast, the Canadian Medical Association, the Society
          of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and the
          Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia,
          Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario have each
          adopted specific resolutions against the performance of
          FGM on any girl or woman, for any reason.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Accordingly, the practice of male circumcision is
          really an issue to be discussed by parents with their
          medical practitioner and is not an issue that should be
          addressed by the criminal law.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>With respect to your comments about human rights,
          it may interest you to know that, while section 15 of the
          <a
          href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#I"
          target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and
          Freedoms</a> guarantees equality before and under the law
          without discrimination based on a number of enumerated
          grounds, including "sex" and "age", the Supreme Court of
          Canada in the <a
          href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989rcs1-143/1989rcs1-143.html"
           target="_blank">Andrews case</a> (a decision handed down
          in 1989) stated that "every difference in treatment
          between individuals under the law will not necessarily
          result in inequality and as well identical treatment may
          frequently produce serious inequality." In the case of
          male circumcision, it is important to note that female
          and male genitalia are quite different. Therefore, a
          Criminal Code that prohibits FGM but not male
          circumcision may not amount to unequal treatment or
          protection given the differences between the genders and
          the differences between the two procedures.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Thank you again for taking the time to share your
          views with me.</tt></p>

          <p class="sig"><tt>Yours very truly,<br />

          <p class="sig"><tt>Toronto, ON<br />
           February 27, 1996</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Dear Mr. Rock,</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Regarding your letter of Feb. 6, 1996: Thank you
          for responding to my question regarding Bill C-119 and
          male circumcision.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>As you acknowledged, the Canadian Paediatric
          Society has stated that "...there is no medical
          indication for circumcision during the neonatal period."
          You also stated that in appropriate cases circumcision of
          the male newborn has "recognized medical benefits"; but
          this is true only in the presence of a disorder. Canada
          does not accept surgery of any kind on healthy female
          genitalia; surely the same standards of diagnosis and
          treatment must be applied to all children. Your letter
          does not address this issue to my satisfaction. Normal
          foreskin is not a disorder, and I continue to believe
          that the practice of circumcision of healthy children is
          unethical and illegal according to a strict
          interpretation of the <a
          href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
          target="_blank">Canadian Criminal Code</a>.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>The Canadian Paediatric Society has not adopted a
          specific resolution against male circumcision. This is, I
          believe, due to the widespread prevalence of the
          procedure in Canada, whereby it would be politically
          awkward to adopt such a resolution at this time. On the
          other hand, various mild and severe forms of female
          genital mutilation are a cultural tradition in parts of
          Africa, that have no widespread acceptance in Canada. We
          must not let cultural biases cloud our judgement in the
          handling of health care issues.</tt></p>
