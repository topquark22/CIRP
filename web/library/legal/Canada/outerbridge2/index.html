      <p>Dear Dr. Anderson:</p>

      <p>Your letter to Elizabeth Moreau of the Canadian Paediatric
      Society has been passed on to me for comment as I was the
      principal author of the <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
      target="_blank">CPS clinical practice guidelines on
      circumcision</a> and am therefore familiar with the
      discussions and perspectives that went into their
      preparation.</p>

      <p>If we had found references that were other than mere
      statements of opinion regarding the function of the prepuce
      and the consequences of its removal we would have included
      them. However we found only one in our extensive literature
      search. That was <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Dr.
      Taylor's paper</a> describing the specialized nerve endings
      in the inner mucosal surface of the prepuce. It had not been
      published in a peer reviewed journal by the time the CPS
      clinical practice guidelines were published in March 1996.
      However we knew about this work, thought it was important to
      include and used an earlier reference from the proceedings of
      a conference at which Dr Taylor had presented his data, in
      order to develop the discussion in the paragraph "What is the
      prepuce?" If the Globe and Mail's medical reporter had read
      that paragraph I do not believe he would have written what he
      wrote. Actually the CPS practice guidelines are on the
      internet and that paragraph title stands out clearly when you
      read the list of contents. So he would not even have had to
      phone or write the CPS for a copy, or wait for it to come.
      However the description of the prepuce as a simple fold of
      skin is what is written in the medical and anatomy textbooks,
      when it is commented upon at all. In reality it will take
      some time before this newer information becomes incorporated
      in medical textbooks, as there is at least a two to three
      year period for the preparation and publication of any new
      edition of a medical text. The real problem here may be that
      no one had actually looked at the histologic structure of the
      tissue previously.</p>

      <p>There is no one, or simple answer to your question. I am
      sure you know some of the answers (e.g. parental choice for
      religious reasons, or because other family members are
      circumcised) even though you may feel they are not
      acceptable. I personally do not believe legal processes are
      the answer in and of themselves. My understanding of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> is what you state. But in Egypt in
      1997, the female circumcision rate is 70% although Egypt
      (also a signatory I believe) has laws against the practice,
      (which incidentally were not upheld in a recent Egyptian
      court decision). Also on a point of accuracy, female
      circumcision is not generally performed by physicians in
      Egypt, but by others from my understanding.</p>

      <p>Abolition of child poverty is also a component of the
      Convention on the Rights of the Child, yet more than 20% of
      the children in Canada now live below the poverty line and
      the percentage is increasing. We have a lot yet to do in
      Society to correct inappropriate practices, and inequities.
      While the circumcision rate in Canada is now about 25%, that
      is about half what it was in the early 1970s. I think it will
      likely continue to fall. Indeed several provinces no longer
      pay for routine neonatal circumcision, which will also
      encourage the downward trend. A goodly number of parents
      however feel sufficiently strongly that they want their sons
      circumcised, that they will, and do, pay for the procedure
      themselves.</p>

      <p>In the long term I agree with you that education is the
      key to a reduction of the practice, education of health
      professionals, and of the public. However I have concern that
      it is very difficult to alter practices that are a part of
      religious or cultural beliefs. Until we better understand the
      origins of such practices, and how to alter people's belief
      structures I do not see a total end to the practice. I hope
      however, that we will see a continued reduction in its
      incidence without medical misinformation further contributing
      to the controversy.</p>

      <p>Yours sincerely<br />
