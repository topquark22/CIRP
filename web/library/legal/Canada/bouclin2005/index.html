      <p class="text1">On August 22, 2002, five-week-old Ryleigh
      McWillis died from complications resulting from of an
      elective circumcision. Two days after the procedure, his
      parents found his diaper soaked with blood and rushed him to
      a hospital in Penticton, British Columbia (Fournier, 2004). A
      Coroner&rsquo;s Report (2004) revealed that Ryleigh&rsquo;s
      lungs showed severe hemorrhage and areas of hyaline membrane
      disease, which can arise from asphyxia, shock, and
      acidosis.</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 206</span> 

      <p class="text2">It is interesting to note that, after almost
      three decades of explicit cautioning against routine
      circumcision of newborn male infants by the Canadian
      Paediatric Society (1975, 1996) and only weeks before
      Raleigh&rsquo;s death, the Canadian Medical Protective
      Association (CMPA) issued a statement (CMPA 2002) that there
      existed no unanimity within medical or legal communities
      about the justification for circumcising infant males. Six
      months before that, Saskatchewan&rsquo;s College of
      Physicians and Surgeons and the College of Physicians and
      Surgeons of Manitoba circulated memos to its members warning
      against routine circumcision of newborn boys (CPSS, 2002;
      CPSM, 2002). This was part of a broad-based educational
      strategy to raise professional and public awareness about the
      risks of routine circumcision. Shortly thereafter, the
      College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia began
      its own review of the procedure. It determined that infant
      male circumcision is ultimately a matter of parental choice
      (based on tradition, culture, religion, or personal
      preference) and that the procedure should be regarded as
      &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; (2002, p. 2). Even so, the College
      Council has not identified any need to place restrictions on
      the availability of elective infant male circumcision.
      However, it issued a notice that circumcision should be
      considered only after detailed discussion with the parents,
      explaining that neonatal circumcision is not a medical
      necessity, that currently the majority of boys are not
      circumcised, that a number of pediatric associations do not
      recommend the procedure, and that there are potential short-
      and long-term risks resulting from the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite shifts in the discourses adopted and
      reinforced by the Canadian medical community and the
      international medical community (American Academy of
      Pediatrics, 1999; Australian College of Paediatrics, 1996;
      British Medical Association 1996; Canadian Paediatric
      Society, 1996), routine neonatal male circumcision remains
      fairly normalized. Focusing on the Canadian context, this
      paper outlines the health-based and legal arguments against
      elective infant male circumcision. Part one provides an
      overview of routine neonatal male circumcision and deals with
      the crucial distinction between therapeutic and
      nontherapeutic intervention. It locates elective neonatal
      male circumcision within the nontherapeutic category. Part
      two outlines the theoretical underpinnings for medical
      consent in the Canadian context and discusses the legal
      requirements for &ldquo;informed consent.&rdquo; The aim of
      part three is to tease out issues of parental consent and
      question whether parents should be entitled to substitute
      consent for medically unnecessary, routine neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">With this in mind, an important caveat is in
      order. The debate surrounding both male <i>and female</i>
      circumcision demonstrates the struggle between respect for
      cultural differences and universal human rights (i.e., Braver
      Moss, 1991; Slack, 1988). Without doubt, a more thorough
      analysis of the balancing of ethnic and cultural traditions
      and the protection of individuals from harmful cultural
      practices is needed. However, such an endeavour is beyond the
      scope of this paper. For this reason, the discussion will
      focus on nonritual, nontherapeutic neonatal circumcision.
      Nevertheless, the discussion is framed in such a way as to
      acknowledge the cultural dynamics at play and respectfully
      listen to multiple perspectives in order to better grapple
      with this complex issue.</p>

        PRELIMINARIES:<br />
         LOCATING NEO-NATAL CIRCUMCISION
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Routine neonatal circumcision is the most
      common nonmedical surgical intervention carried out in the
      United States (Cendron, Elder, &amp; Ducket, 1996). In
      Canada, elective neonatal circumcision is performed as a
      primary procedure on less than 10% of the male population
      (CIRP, 2004). While in the past circumcisions were routinely
      performed without the consent of the infant&rsquo;s parents
      or guardians, today &ldquo;routine&rdquo; neonatal
      circumcision is an <i>elective</i> procedure that requires
      parental consent (Le Bourdais, 1995; Oh &amp; Merenstein,
      1997). Traditionally, the procedure did not include
      anaesthesia, due to the belief that infants did not feel pain
      because their nerves were not completely myelinated (Cope,
      1998). Today, however, most medical practitioners will inject
      a local anesthetic into the penis or use a topical
      anaesthetic cream (AAP, 1999).</p>

      <p class="text2">The procedure generally unfolds as follows.
      The fully conscious newborn is restrained while tissue is
      incised from the tip of the penis using instruments such as
      probes, clamps, and scalpels (Cohen, 1992; Gelbaum, 1993).
      Circumcision entails an incision over the circumference of
      the tip of the penis and the removal of the penile foreskin
      (prepuce), which exposes the gland underneath (Boyd, 1998;
      Boyle et al., 2002). The method most often used is direct
      surgery whereby the foreskin is held away from the glans with
      a clamp. Then</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text2">[one] blade of a scissor (or a scalpel) is
        inserted between the foreskin and glans and the foreskin is
        first cut along its full length.... The incision is spread
        apart to expose the glans. Then, using a scalpel or
        scissors, the foreskin is completely cut off close to the
        groove. (Romberg, 1985, p. 91)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Some parents justify the procedure for
      aesthetic reasons (Chessler, 1997) or to spare their sons
      from &ldquo;feeling embarrassed&rdquo; for looking different
      from others (Patel, 1996, p. 5). However, most proponents of
      circumcision see it as a preventative healthcare measure;
      namely, it does not allow for smegma (a sebaceous secretion
      that collects under the prepuce) to accumulate under the
      foreskin (Schoen et al., 2000). Circumcision is also believed
      to reduce the likelihood of urinary tract infections
      (Canadian Paediatric Society, 1996; Herzog, 1989; Schleupner,
      1997; Schoen et al., 2000). Some researchers have found that
      circumcision decreases the spread of HIV/AIDS and other
      sexually transmitted diseases. They found that mini-abrasions
      of the foreskin during intercourse increase the risk of
      uncircumcised men acquiring certain STIs (Cardwell &amp;
      Cardwell, 1996; Weiss et al., 2000). There is evidence that
      it provides protection against penile cancer as well as
      cervical cancer in female sexual partners (Rivet, 2003;
      Schoen et al., 2000). Moreover, there are a number of
      researchers who have found that the risks of circumcision are
      remote and insufficient to override a parent&rsquo;s decision
      to have their son undergo the procedure (Ottem, 1996). Note
      that circumcision in adulthood is a more complex procedure
      than surgery upon infants because the infant&rsquo;s foreskin
      is approximately half the size of what it will be in an adult
      male&rsquo;s penis (Cuckow, Rix, &amp; Mouriquand, 1994). In
      Canada at</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 208</span> 

      <p class="text1">least one man who has suffered grave
      injuries as a result of circumcision sought compensation in
      tort but was unsuccessful (<i>Sanzana</i> v. <i>Wiggens</i>,
      1998). At trial, the judge found that &ldquo;unhappiness with
      the cosmetic results in the circumstances&rdquo; was not a
      compensatable injury (1998, p. 2391). Further, Mr. Sanzana
      had not established a causal connection between the pain
      alleged and the circumcision. However, in <i>Voorthuyzen</i>
      v. <i>Orovan</i> (1988), the plaintiff underwent a
      circumcision to relieve paraphimosis, a condition whereby the
      foreskin becomes trapped behind the corona and forms a tight
      band of constricting tissue. He argued that the doctor had
      removed an excess amount of penile skin, and as a result the
      patient&rsquo;s penis was foreshortened and he suffered
      considerable sexual dysfunction and depression. The Ontario
      High Court found that the physician had met the standard of a
      reasonably competent urologist. The court nevertheless
      awarded the plaintiff $15,000 in general damages for loss of
      income and $5,000 to his spouse under Ontario&rsquo;s
      <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> for loss of care, guidance, and
      companionship.</p>

      <p class="text2">With this in mind, the circumcision of adult
      men will not be the focus of this discussion. Suffice it to
      say, a competent adult can give &ldquo;informed
      consent&rdquo; to the deliberate infliction of actual bodily
      harm such as tattooing (Bibbings &amp; Alldridge, 1993) so
      long as it does not offend public policy. For instance,
      female genital mutilation was found to be against public
      policy, and the <i>Canadian Criminal Code</i> was amended to
      include section 268(3). In addition, adults may not consent
      to have nontherapeutic and harmful interventions carried out
      on their children. What follows then are the arguments that
      locate neonatal elective circumcision within the type of
      procedure to which adults may not legally provide consent by
      proxy. The issue is important given the potential health
      risks to infant males when circumcision is performed on
      them.</p>

             Circumcised penises are not normal. They are
            mutilated. (Lewis, 2003, p. 1)
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text2">There has been increased international
      interest among lawyers, human rights activists,
      children&rsquo;s rights proponents, mental health
      practitioners, ethicists and men directly affected by the
      procedure in the legal and ethical issues surrounding male
      circumcision (i.e., AAP, 1999; AAPS, 1996; Boyle et al.,
      2002; INTACT, 2002; International Circumcision Information
      Reference Centre, 2004; Somerville, 2000; Svoboda et al.,
      1999). Apart from a few sociological analyses of the
      procedure (Boon, 1994; Campbell, 1991; Sweiden, 1996),
      however, most often the debate is approached from a medical
      perspective (Harrison, 2002, p. 301). At the core of the
      discussion is whether or not routine neonatal circumcision
      should be viewed as therapeutic (&ldquo;treatment&rdquo;) or
      nontherapeutic. This distinction is crucial when addressing
      circumcision because it touches upon the issue of
      consent.</p>

      <p class="text2">To begin, a working definition of treatment
      may be helpful. Section 2(1) of the <i>Ontario Consent to
      Treatment Act</i> (1992), which reflects other similar
      provincial legislation, defines treatment as &ldquo;anything
      that is done for a therapeutic, preventive,</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 209</span> 

      <p class="text1">palliative, diagnostic, cosmetic or other
      health-related purpose, and includes a course or a plan of
      treatment.&rdquo; On the other hand, nontherapeutic treatment
      is surgery for <i>other than</i> standard medical purposes
      (Butterworth&rsquo;s Medical Dictionary, 1978, p. 1700;
      <i>J.W.B. v. S.M.B.</i>, 1992, p. 226). Although common law
      once prescribed that only a therapeutic aim could justify
      &ldquo;wounding&rdquo; through medical intervention
      (Somerville, 1981), today nontherapeutic intervention is
      legal so long as the subject is capable of giving and has
      given informed consent and that the intervention does not
      offend public policy (<i>Attorney-General&rsquo;s
      Reference</i>, 1981). To this end, a number of authors have
      concluded that elective neonatal male circumcision is in fact
      a form of nontherapeutic procedure (Boyle et al., 2002) that
      is not justifiable by law (Somerville, 1981, 2000).</p>

      <p class="text1">Routine neonatal circumcision continues
      despite increasing ethical concerns about consent as well as
      medical concerns about its physical and psychological
      consequences. It is the latter that is the focus of this next
      section.</p>

      <p class="text2">To recognize the significance of the
      potential harm of this procedure, it is helpful to discuss
      some anatomical and physiological issues. The foreskin is a
      highly vascular and sensitive piece of body tissue that
      covers the glans of the penis. It contains mucosal glands,
      which secrete lubricants and protective antibodies, and
      enhances sexual stimulation because of the extensive
      concentration of nerve endings in the foreskin and its wide
      range of skin movement during intercourse (Taylor et al.,
      1996). Removal of the foreskin destroys the gliding action of
      the penis, and the overall effect of circumcision is the
      removal of highly erogenous tissue (Crawford, 2002; Gairdner,
      1949; Goodwin, 1990; Harrison et al., 1997; Taylor et al.,
      1996).</p>

      <p class="text2">Complications from the procedure occur in
      approximately 2 to 10% of cases (Williams &amp; Kapilla,
      1993). Romberg (1985) suggests that when the harm done is
      viewed in terms of the individuals and families concerned,
      &ldquo;the risks seem quite significant&rdquo; (p. 89). They
      range from relatively minor complications such as bleeding
      and scarring (Kaplan, 1983) to severe long-term aftereffects
      such as sensory pain behaviour (Anand &amp; Scalzo, 2000;
      Fitzgerald, 1998; Taddio et al., 1997), consistent pain in
      the genital area (Anand &amp; Hickey, 1987), amputation of
      the glans (Gluckman et al., 1995), acute renal failure (Eason
      et al., 1994), ruptured bladder (Jee &amp; Millar, 1990),
      heightened physiological pain responses (Bigelow, 1995;
      Taddio et al., 1997), and sometimes even death (Sullivan,
      2002).</p>

      <p class="text2">There is growing opposition to the practice
      on the grounds that it is medically unwarranted (Boyle et
      al., 2002; Gairdner, 1949), scientific accounts of its
      benefits are often methodologically and analytically flawed
      (Australian College of Paediatrics, 1996), and it is in and
      of itself harmful (Somerville, 2000).</p>

      <p class="text2">A few Canadian decisions have dealt with
      complications resulting from circumcision, although none has
      gone before the Supreme Court of Canada. First, in <i>Gray v.
      LaFleche</i> (1950), a circumcision performed by a doctor was
      so unskillfully done that the six-day-old infant sustained
      severe and permanent injuries to the glans. A second doctor
      examined the infant. The penis was covered with granulated
      tissue, was slightly retracted and flattened, and had no tip.
      The Manitoba court of Queen&rsquo;s</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 210</span> 

      <p class="text1">bench found that the child was entitled to
      damages for having to go through life with a deformed penis
      that could decrease his pleasure during coitus and diminish
      his chances of marriage. In <i>Bera</i> v. <i>Marr</i>
      (1988), a young man&rsquo;s penis was left
      &ldquo;deviated&rdquo; following circumcision. The court held
      that the doctor had not exercised the skill required by a
      physician for this procedure. In awarding damages, the trial
      judge considered the psychological trauma that resulted from
      years of humiliation and teasing. General damages were
      assessed at $40,000.</p>

      <p class="text2">Moreover, since the early 1990s, there has
      been a burgeoning of anti-circumcision groups throughout the
      West, including the Association for Genital Integrity (which
      is currently challenging Section 268 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> as failing to protect male children), the National
      Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Men
      (NOHARMM, a direct-action men&rsquo;s network concerned with
      circumcision), the International Coalition for Genital
      Integrity (which publishes a news feed for research on the
      issue of genital integrity), the National Organization of
      Restoring Men (NORM-UK, a British group engaged in public
      education about the foreskin and alternative treatments for
      foreskin problems), and the National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC). There is
      also vocal opposition from various professional associations
      such as Doctors Opposing Circumcision (DOC), Attorneys for
      the Rights of the Child, and Nurses for the Rights of the
      Child. The lack of medical indication of the procedure has
      been acknowledged by provinces such as Nova Scotia (1997) and
      Saskatchewan (1996), where it has been removed from the list
      of publicly insured medical services (<i>Cameron</i> v.
      <i>Nova Scotia</i>, 1999).</p>

      <p class="text1">The harm caused by routine neonatal
      circumcision is outside the <i>de minimis</i> range
      (Somerville, 2000), and the procedure should not fall within
      the exceptions justifying nontherapeutic medical
      intervention. This is particularly important given that a
      male infant himself cannot provide consent.</p>

      <p class="text2">The following section outlines the law of
      informed consent in Canada as it pertains to medical
      treatment. It begins with a consideration of the theoretical
      underpinnings of Canada&rsquo;s approach to issues of
      consent. It goes on to examine the exceptions to consent,
      such as when a patient is unable to provide informed consent
      on her or his own behalf. In thinking about elective neonatal
      male circumcision, a situation in which an infant cannot
      possibly provide consent himself, it is also important to
      understand when consent can or cannot be substituted by a
      parent or guardian. An overview of this law is provided.
      Finally, the interplay between parental rights to give
      consent and a child&rsquo;s security of person as guaranteed
      under the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> is
      considered in the context of routine neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to the Supreme Court of Canada,
      essential to the idea of consent is the principle that
      individuals have the right to determine what is to be done
      with and to their bodies. As Laskin J. states in <i>Hopp</i>
      v. <i>Lepp</i>, &ldquo;[t]he underlying principle is the</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 211</span> 

      <p class="text1">right of a patient to decided what, if
      anything should be done with his [or her] body (1980, p.
      661). In <i>White v. Turner</i>, Linden J. adds that
      &ldquo;the law . . . requires that patients be treated as
      intelligent, mature, and rational individuals&rdquo; (1982,
      p. 764). Moreover, in <i>Norberg</i> v. <i>Wynrib</i>,
      Justice La Forest wrote that consent is based on notions of
      liberty, autonomy, and individualism: &ldquo;It is presumed
      that the individual has freedom to consent or not to
      consent&rdquo; (1992, p. 247). This was confirmed in
      <i>Ciarlariello</i> v. <i>Schacter</i> (1993), where Justice
      Cory held that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">[E]very patient has a right to bodily
        integrity. This encompasses the right to determine what
        medical procedures will be accepted and the extent to which
        they will not be accepted. Everyone has the right to decide
        what is to be done to one&rsquo;s own body.... This concept
        of individual autonomy is fundamental to the common law and
        is the basis for the requirement that disclosure be made to
        a patient. (1993, p. 106)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">To this end, the concept of consent and
      especially informed consent is at its core intended to
      protect the individual&rsquo;s right to &ldquo;security of
      the person&rdquo; as contained in Section 7 of the
      <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, which reads:
      &ldquo;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security
      of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except
      in accordance with the principles of fundamental
      justice.&rdquo; Canadian medical law is fundamentally
      concerned with the issue of consent. It is a well-known
      common-law rule that a physician or healthcare provider may
      not engage in medical treatment or even touch a patient
      without his or her consent (<i>Re &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo;</i>
      1986). It is also well established that a competent adult has
      the <i>right to refuse</i> consent for &ldquo;medically
      necessary&rdquo; treatment (<i>Malette</i> v. <i>Shulman</i>,
      1990). As Justice Linden of the Supreme Court of Canada
      explained in <i>Allan</i> v. <i>New Mount Sinai
      Hospital</i>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Our law is clear that the consent of a
        patient must be obtained before any surgical procedure can
        be conducted&hellip;. This is not a mere formality; it is
        an important individual right to have control over
        one&rsquo;s own body, even where medical treatment is
        involved. It is the patient, not the doctor, who decides
        whether surgery will be performed, where it will be done,
        when it will be done and by whom it will be done. (1980, p.
        364)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Moreover, a patient can withdraw consent at
      any time during a surgical procedure (<i>Ciarlariello</i> v.
      <i>Schacter</i>, 1993). That said, there is an exception to
      the general rule of respect for individual&rsquo;s autonomy
      and bodily integrity, the medical emergency. Physicians are
      privileged to provide medical attention if required to save
      the life or preserve the health of a patient where the
      consent of that patient or her or his substitute decision
      maker is not readily available (Linden &amp; Klar, 2001, p.
      77). For instance, Section 45 of the <i>Canadian Criminal
      Code</i> provides that &ldquo;everyone is protected from
      criminal responsibility for performing a surgical operation
      on any person for the benefit of that person&rdquo; as long
      as</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 212</span> 

      <p class="leftindent">(a) the operation is performed with
      reasonable care and skill; and<br />
       (b) it is reasonable to perform the operation, having regard
      for the state of health of the person at the time the
      operation is performed and to all the circumstances of the
      case.</p>

      <p class="text1">However, once the patient has expressly
      refused treatment, emergency treatment as well as continued
      treatment constitutes a battery (<i>Fleming</i> v.
      <i>Reid</i>, 1991; <i>Malette</i> v. <i>Shulman</i>, 1990).
      Let us now examine more closely the doctrine of
      &ldquo;informed consent.&rdquo;</p>

      <center>
        THE LAW OF INFORMED CONSENT:<br />
         AN OVERVIEW
      </center>

      <p class="text1">In Canada, the common-law rule is that no
      legal wrong is done to an individual who consents to the
      intentional invasion of his interests (Linden &amp; Klar,
      2001, p. 65). Consent provides permission to engage in
      conduct that would otherwise result in liability for an
      intentional tort. As such, explicit or implied consent is a
      full defense to intentional torts. Consent is implied, for
      instance, when a court authorizes a medical procedure against
      the wishes of the patient. This was the case, for example, in
      <i>Institut Philippe Pinel de Montreal</i> v. <i>Dion</i>
      (1983), where the Qu&eacute;bec Superior Court implied
      consent to a patient found to be unfit to stand trial. The
      patient was being forced to undergo drug therapy determined
      by health professionals to be needed in order to prevent
      mental deterioration. In order to give valid explicit
      consent, the following criteria must be met: consent must be
      voluntary and genuine and is vitiated if</p>

      <ul>
        <li>obtained under duress or pressure,</li>

        <li>obtained by fraud or deceit as to the very nature of
        the intervention, or</li>

        <li>it would go against public policy to allow the
        defendant to rely on it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text1">Moreover, the person consenting must also
      have the legal or factual capacity to do so. In short,
      consent must be informed, that is, in accordance with
      accepted standards for disclosure of information by a
      physician to the particular patient (Dickens, 1999;
      <i>Norberg</i> v. <i>Wynrib</i>, 1992; <i>R.</i> v.
      <i>Cuerrier</i>, 1998; Rozovski, 1997).</p>

      <p class="text1">Certain legal issues arise when establishing
      whether consent is truly informed. In <i>Hopp</i> v.
      <i>Lepp</i> (1980) and <i>Reibl</i> v. <i>Hughes</i> (1980)
      the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law of consent and
      established the foundation of a new doctrine: &ldquo;informed
      consent.&rdquo; This doctrine has proven to be of fundamental
      importance in the context of legal liability of doctors to
      their patients. The Court established principles relating to
      (1) the proper cause of action, (2) the standard of
      disclosure, and (3) the means of determining causation. In
      <i>Reibl</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada established that,
      in most cases of medical failure to inform, the cause of
      action will be framed in terms of negligence rather than
      battery. The elements of negligence are as follows: (1) a
      wrongful conduct (a legal duty and a breach of that duty) on
      the part of the defendant, (2) causation of harm by the
      wrongful conduct, and (3) real harm to the plaintiff (Linden
      &amp; Klar, 2001, p. 36). The tort of battery, on the other
      hand, protects an individual&rsquo;s interest in her or his
      bodily security from unwanted physical interference that is
      harmful or offensive to her or his reasonable sense of
      dignity (<i>Malette</i> v. <i>Shulman</i>, 1990;</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 213</span> 

      <p class="text1"><i>Norberg</i> v. <i>Wynrib</i>, 1992). This
      cause of action is confined to cases where there is no
      consent due to fraudulent misrepresentation or a
      misrepresentation that goes to the very nature of the
      procedure (as opposed to incidental risks).</p>

      <p class="text2">Canadian courts have determined that the
      tort of battery is exceptionally serious. Unlike negligence,
      a defendant will be found liable for all consequences of a
      wrongful conduct, whether intended or not, and regardless of
      foreseeability or lack thereof (Linden &amp; Klar, 2001, p.
      45; <i>Bettel</i> v. <i>Yim</i>, 1978). To this end, an
      action framed in negligence deprives a plaintiff of the
      procedural advantages of battery. That is, the onus is on her
      or him to establish all the required elements of negligence;
      namely, that the defendant physician failed to properly
      inform her or him of the material risks involved and that
      there has been an actual harm to a legally recognized
      interest. Essentially, the plaintiff must establish that,
      <i>had she been properly informed, she would not have
      consented to surgery</i> and therefore <i>would not have
      suffered damages</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In terms of the standard of disclosure, the
      Supreme Court of Canada restated its previous decision in
      <i>Hopp</i> (1980) that a patient has the right to decide
      what will be done to her or his body and a doctor must fully
      disclose all material risks of the procedure. To this end, a
      patient must be informed about what a reasonable person would
      be required to know concerning the procedure in order to
      enable her or him to decide whether to undergo treatment.
      This is a question of fact, therefore to be determined by a
      trial judge rather than by the medical profession (Klar,
      1980, p. 76).</p>

      <p class="text2">The Canadian Supreme Court has adopted a
      &ldquo;modified&rdquo; objective test for causation: <i>would
      a reasonable person in the patient&rsquo;s position have
      consented to the operation where proper disclosure (of the
      material risks of the proposed treatment) had been made?</i>
      The patient&rsquo;s subjective circumstances are not to be
      ignored, so long as his or her concerns are reasonably based.
      As then Chief Justice Laskin states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">In obtaining the consent of a patient for
        the performance upon him [or her] of a surgical operation,
        a surgeon should generally answer any specific question
        posed by the patient as to the risks involved and should
        without being questioned, disclose to him the nature of the
        proposed operation, its gravity, any material risks and any
        special or unusual risks attendant upon the performance of
        the operation. (<i>Hopp</i>, 1980, p. 210)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The test is difficult to apply, however.
      With this review of informed consent law in the Canadian
      context, consider parents&rsquo; right to provide consent by
      proxy in the case of routine circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">Our society presumes that parents will
      exercise their freedom of choice in a manner that does not
      offend the rights of their children (per La Forest, J., in
      <i>B (R) v. Children&rsquo;s Aid Society</i> [1995, p. 373]).
      Whereas an adult may consent to medical procedures, a child
      is often not in a position to do so or simply lacks the
      capacity to make such a decision.</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 214</span> 

      <p class="text2">Many jurisdictions have circumscribed a
      minor&rsquo;s rights to consent to medical treatment. For
      instance, a Washington court determined that a minor was not
      capable of consenting to having a vasectomy (<i>Smith</i> v.
      <i>Seibly</i>, 1967). However, in <i>Planned Parenthood of
      Mo</i>. v. <i>Danforth</i>, the American Supreme Court held
      that a minor did not need parental consent to procure an
      abortion. There is a growing movement advocating the right to
      children&rsquo;s self-determination and their right to decide
      whether to undergo treatment (Shield &amp; Baum, 1994). That
      said, the basic legal framework in Canada is one that gives
      broad legislative and judicial deference to parents since
      they are most often the primary caregivers of children and,
      as such, are responsible for a child&rsquo;s rearing,
      protection, and education.</p>

      <p class="text2">Parents are usually given the responsibility
      for their children and have the right to make fundamental
      decisions regarding their health. Specifically, the Supreme
      Court of Canada has determined that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">[t]he common law has always, in the
        absence of demonstrated neglect or unsuitability, presumed
        that parents should make all significant choices affecting
        their children, and has afforded them a general liberty to
        do as they choose. (<i>Sheena B.</i>,1995, p. 372)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">More recently, the Court relied upon
      Professor Nicolas Bala&rsquo;s argument that, due to
      children&rsquo;s limited personal capacity, society
      temporarily confers on them only a limited legal capacity.
      This limited legal capacity is not arbitrary and does not
      stigmatize children. It is, rather, a reflection of their
      actual need, capacity, and circumstances (cited in <i>Law</i>
      v. <i>Canada</i>, 1999, p. 37). In the medical context, this
      means that a parent or guardian can provide informed consent
      in place of a child for medical interventions <i>in cases of
      imminent and serious danger to the child&rsquo;s life or a
      vital organ disease, requiring immediate treatment</i>. The
      law clearly indicates, however, that parental authority is
      limited to &ldquo;therapeutic treatment,&rdquo; and thus a
      parent cannot, for example, consent to nontherapeutic
      sterilization of his or her child (<i>Re
      &ldquo;Eve</i>,&rdquo; 1986).</p>

      <p class="text2">The State maintains a right to intervene
      when it considers it warranted to safeguard a child&rsquo;s
      autonomy or health or when a procedure is contrary to
      &ldquo;the best interest of the child.&rdquo; This is
      referred to as <i>parens patriae</i>, a common-law concept
      founded upon necessity, namely that the State will act on
      behalf of those who cannot care for or protect themselves
      (<i>Re &ldquo;Eve</i>,&rdquo; 1986). The main agent for the
      protection of children is the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, a
      group of quasi-governmental, local organizations. They are
      regulated under provincial legislation. In Ontario, the
      <i>Child and Family Services Act</i> (1990) sets the formal
      legal standard for intervention as a &ldquo;child in need of
      protection.&rdquo; In <i>Catholic Children&rsquo;s Aid
      Society of Metropolitan Toronto</i> v. <i>M(C)</i> (1994),
      the Supreme Court of Canada developed an interpretation of
      the &ldquo;best interest of the child.&rdquo; Madame Justice
      l&rsquo;Heureux-Dub&eacute;, writing for a unanimous bench,
      found that the best interest of the child encompasses
      &ldquo;concerns arising from emotional harm, psychological
      bonding and the child&rsquo;s desires&rdquo; (1994, p.
      201).</p>

      <p class="text2">The &ldquo;best interests of the
      child&rdquo; test was tightened by Madame Justice McLachlin
      in <i>Gordon</i> v. <i>Goertz</i> (1996). In that decision,
      she outlined the factors to be considered, limiting them to
      all relevant circumstances relating to the child&rsquo;s
      needs and</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 215</span> 

      <p class="text1">the ability of the respective parents to
      satisfy them, and expressly cited the views of the child as a
      factor to consider (1996, p. 61). To this end, a parent or
      substitute decision maker making decisions based on the
      child&rsquo;s &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; will be guided by
      the following considerations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is the condition of the child likely to be improved by
        the treatment?</li>

        <li>Will the child&rsquo;s condition deteriorate without
        the treatment?</li>

        <li>Are the anticipated benefits from the treatment
        outweighed by the risks of harm to the child?</li>

        <li>Is the treatment the least restrictive and least
        intrusive treatment that meets the first three criteria?
        (<i>Fleming</i> v. <i>Reid [Litigation Guardian]</i>,
        1991)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text1">Where a parent or substitute decision maker
      has deemed that it is in the child&rsquo;s best interest to
      undergo a treatment, there may be some conflict between that
      privilege and the fundamental right to security of the person
      protected under Section 7 of the <i>Charter</i>. Because the
      State&rsquo;s power to intervene is broad and can be
      permanent, parental decision making has been protected under
      the <i>Charter</i>. Nevertheless, the Court has determined
      that parents&rsquo; rights are not absolute and that the
      State will intervene when necessity is demonstrated.</p>

      <p class="text2">Section 7 of the <i>Charter</i> provides
      everyone with a certain degree of autonomy in decisions
      concerning their private lives, including those concerning
      medical treatment. The protection of the security of the
      person is so fundamental that medical treatment administered
      without a patient&rsquo;s informed consent may amount to
      battery. In the context of circumcision, if a medical
      practitioner performs routine neonatal circumcision without
      an infant&rsquo;s parental consent, that practitioner may be
      liable for criminal assault as well as for damages for any
      harm that resulted from her or his negligence (Somerville,
      2000).</p>

      <p class="text2">Given that a portion of the medical
      community has agreed that routine male circumcision is
      nontherapeutic and that it may be in and of itself be a
      harmful practice, it is arguable that when performed on
      neonates for nontherapeutic reasons, it amounts to a
      violation of the child&rsquo;s Section 7 rights. As stated at
      <i>the Declaration of the First International Symposium on
      Circumcision</i>, &ldquo;parents and/or guardians do not have
      the right to consent to the surgical removal or modification
      of their children&rsquo;s normal genitalia.&rdquo; The
      <i>Declaration</i> adds that the only person who may consent
      to medically unnecessary procedures upon herself or himself
      is <i>that</i> individual, having reached a stage in life
      where she or he can consent and <i>only upon</i> being fully
      informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure. Note,
      however, that the <i>Declaration</i> is not a binding legal
      instrument.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the United States, a case challenging the
      institution of routine neonatal circumcision was brought
      before the Superior Court of California. The plaintiff
      attempted to invoke protections similar to the rights
      protected under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter. In that
      case, the mother had signed a consent form which expressly
      stated that the procedure was of no medical purpose. The
      issue was whether <i>a parent was capable at law to consent
      to a surgical procedure without</i></p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 216</span> 

      <p class="text1"><i>medical purpose</i>. The California
      Superior Court found for the defendant, and this was upheld
      upon appeal.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mother of Adam London began a suit <i>ad
      litem</i> for her son against the physician who performed the
      circumcision and the medical facility where it was performed.
      The plaintiff alleged eight separate causes of action among
      which include: (1) <i>common-law battery</i>, (2)
      <i>violation of willful cruelty statute</i> (Penal Code
      273a), (3) <i>violation of The Infliction of Pain Statute</i>
      (Penal Code 273d), (4) <i>violation of the Willful Cruelty
      Statute</i> (Health and Safety Code 11165; Penal Code
      ss.273(a)(1) and 273 (a)(2), and (5) <i>violation of the
      Child Abuse Statute</i> (Health and Safety Code 11165). The
      few Canadian cases dealing with circumcision have been
      equally unfavourable.</p>

      <p class="text2">For example, in <i>Oliver v. Paras</i>
      (1993), an infant&rsquo;s penis was horribly disfigured after
      a circumcision was performed at his parent&rsquo;s request.
      The parents were not informed of the possible risks or of the
      substantial body of opinion against circumcising neonates.
      The action for malpractice was dismissed, however, because
      having taken into account &ldquo;the popularity in our
      society of what D. Paras refers to as a semimedical
      procedure,&rdquo; Justice McLellan was &ldquo;unwilling to
      hold that the usual rules for informed consent for surgery
      apply to the circumcision of the baby&rdquo; (1993, p.
      60).</p>

      <center>
        CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
      </center>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Since circumcision is medically
        unwarranted mutilation and disfigurement, it would appear
        to be a clear case of child abuse.<br />
         (Brigman, 1985, p. 343)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Only in rare circumstances can it be said
      that circumcision has a therapeutic aim. In fact, in many
      cases, circumcision can be considered &ldquo;the antithesis
      of therapy&rdquo; (Somerville, 1980, p. 85). Where there is
      doubt as to the medical benefits of circumcision, that is,
      where the physician cannot justify medical wounding, it
      should not be performed. Therefore, the burden is on the
      person who causes the wounding to establish justification for
      carrying out the procedure. Unless the physician can
      establish this, even with the parents&rsquo; &ldquo;informed
      consent,&rdquo; she or he should not proceed. Postponing the
      procedure until a time when the infant can be more active in
      the decision-making process seems a viable solution. As the
      College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan has
      recently stated:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Informed consent to a surgical procedure
        rests on an assumption that the decision maker possesses
        full and accurate information about the benefits and risks
        of the procedure. The issue becomes whether surgeons are
        providing parents with accurate and sufficient information
        about the benefits and the risks involved with the routine
        circumcision in order to allow them to provide meaningful
        and informed consent. (2002, p. 12)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">To this end, nonreligious circumcision that
      is not medically necessary should be put off until the boy is
      mature enough to understand all the material risks and
      provide his</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 217</span> 

      <p class="text1">own &ldquo;informed consent.&rdquo; In the
      interim, however, as Smith (1998) argues, parents should be
      fully informed about the function of the foreskin, the pain
      and possible risks involved in the procedure, and arguments
      for and against circumcision in order to make the best
      possible decision for their child. Moreover, education and
      dialogue are essential to the circumcision debate. Public
      awareness is increasing, as evidenced by the numerous
      parents, health practitioners, children&rsquo;s rights
      activists, ethicists, lawyers, and concerned citizens who
      have voiced their opinion. Insofar as male circumcision is
      the removal of healthy erogenous flesh without medical
      purpose and without the consent of the child and given that
      it is a painful procedure, neonatal circumcision is
      unnecessary and may well violate a child&rsquo;s bodily
      integrity.</p>
