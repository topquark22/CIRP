          <p><tt>Dear Ms. Somerville,</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Thank you for your thoughtful letter of June 10,
          1992, about female genital mutilation and male
          circumcision. I regret that I was unable to reply
          earlier.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I am grateful to you for drawing my attention to
          your <a href="/library/legal/somerville/">article on
          medical interventions</a> in the McGill Law Journal. I am
          certainly not at this time going to suggest that you are
          mistaken in the analysis you present in your letter.
          However, it is my position that another mode of discourse
          is possible on these topics.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I do not believe that it is always helpful to
          discuss in detail whether a particular act is or is not
          strictly speaking contrary to a provision of the <a
          href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
          target="_blank">Criminal Code</a>. As you know, there are
          many acts that occur daily that may, strictly speaking,
          be contrary to the Code, you they are nevertheless not
          prosecuted because they are not offensive to
          society.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>In response to this line of reasoning it is
          sometimes objected that one should not rely on
          prosecutorial discretion in criminal law matters. To
          this, my reply would be that Canadians are lucky, broadly
          speaking, in their criminal law, which is expressed in
          general terms and thus is not riddled with sections
          stating, for example, that deliberately hitting someone
          is illegal but deliberately bumping into them on the bus
          is not illegal. But, having a criminal law expressed in
          general terms does necessarily entail the existence of a
          prosecutorial discretion. At the same time, <span
          class="yellow">I am fully aware that society's opinion
          can change regarding whether a particular act that could
          be considered criminal, should in fact be
          prosecuted.</span></tt></p>

          <p><tt>In the conclusion of your article you state that
          medical interventions are not regarded in practice as
          prima facie illegal, and that some non-therapeutic
          interventions are accepted by our society. In my opinion
          these points are crucial in connection with female
          genital mutilation and male circumcision.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I do not believe that the issue of the therapeutic
          value of male circumcision has been finally decided in
          the medical literature. But regardless of this, it
          remains true that in our society male circumcision is at
          present accepted and indeed has been for many years. As I
          mentioned above, I am aware that there may come a time
          when this is no longer so. Furthermore, I am not yet
          persuaded that male circumcision can be said to cause
          harm that is above the de minimis level.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>On the other hand, female genital mutilation is
          not at present accepted in our society. I am fully aware
          of the respect and protection offered in Canada to
          multiculturalism and it is my opinion that female genital
          mutilation goes beyond the limit of what multiculturalism
          will allow. In addition, it must be stressed that female
          genital mutilation undoubtedly causes harm that goes well
          beyond the de minimis level. I gather that there is
          apparently an uncommon form of female genital mutilation
          that may not cause serious harm, but I do not believe
          that this procedure is currently accepted in our
          society.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I hope my reply will be of some use to you. In
          closing, I wish to repeat that, <span class="yellow">if
          the medical profession reaches a consensus that male
          circumcision is harmful beyond the de minimis range, or
          if female genital mutilation becomes accepted in our
          society, then I will certainly re-examine my opinions on
          these topics.</span></tt></p>
