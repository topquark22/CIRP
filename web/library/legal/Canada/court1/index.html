      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>THE ORIGINS of circumcision lie in the dim past. The
        earliest Egyptian mummies (2300&nbsp;B.C.) bear the marks
        of circumcision, and wall paintings to be seen in Egypt
        show that it was customary several thousand years earlier
        still. Many reasons for this practice have been proffered,
        ranging from obeying the law of God to promoting public
        health.</p>

        <p>Understanding circumcision is a formidable task.
        Religious requirements, ethical arguments, legal rulings,
        human rights issues, and medical study upon medical study
        threaten to overwhelm all but the most diligent researcher.
        The unwary are soon bogged down in a quagmire of myth and
        misinformation. Controversy has swirled around this
        practice, it seems, from the earliest times.</p>

        <p>Why all the fuss over a mere "piece of skin"?</p>

        <p>The answer is that fundamental principles are at
        stake--principles that form the very foundation of ethics,
        law, and human rights. These basic precepts are not
        receiving due attention in the current debate over
        circumcision. Instead, circumcision is being looked at
        almost exclusively from the standpoints of public health
        and theology, as though these two frames of reference were
        the only ones that mattered. This paper, however, puts
        ethics, law, and human rights at the centre of the debate
        over circumcision.<br />

      <h2>Genital mutilation</h2>
      <a id="s021" name="s021"></a> 

      <h3>Mutilation defined</h3>

      <p class="bodytext">Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines
      "mutilation" as "disfigurement or injury by removal or
      destruction of any conspicuous or essential part of the
      body." [<a id="b01" class="plain" href="#r01"
      name="b01">1</a>]</p>
      <a id="s022" name="s022"></a> 

      <h3>Classification of FGM</h3>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on
        Bioethics recognizes four types of female genital
        mutilation: [<a id="b02" class="plain" href="#r02"
        name="b02">2</a>]</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Type I -- often termed clitorectomy, involves
          excision of the skin surrounding the clitoris with or
          without excision of part or all of the clitoris.<br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>Type II -- referred to as excision, is the removal of
          the entire clitoris and part or all of the labia
          minora.<br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>Type III -- known as infibulation, is the most severe
          form in which the entire clitoris and some or all of the
          labia minora are excised, and incisions are made in the
          labia majora to create raw surfaces. The labial raw
          surfaces are stitched together to cover the urethra and
          vaginal introitus, leaving a small posterior opening for
          urinary and menstrual flow.<br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>Type IV -- includes different practices of variable
          severity including pricking, piercing or incision of the
          clitoris and/or labia; stretching of the clitoris and/or
          labia; cauterization of the clitoris; and scraping or
          introduction of corrosive substances into the
          vagina.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since the penis and clitoris arise from the same
        embryonic tissue,[<a id="b03" class="plain" href="#r03"
        name="b03">3</a>] removal of the male prepuce is comparable
        to removal of the female prepuce. Therefore Type I female
        genital mutilation and male circumcision are comparable
        practices. The prepuce of a newborn adheres firmly to the
        glans--these two structures normally take several years to
        separate. Consequently circumcision of a newborn male
        requires tearing apart what is essentially still a single
        structure, and in that respect resembles a partial
        clitorectomy.<br />

      <h3>Anatomy of the penis and foreskin</h3>
      <a id="s031a" name="s031a"></a> 

      <h4>Embryological development of the sex organs</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The external sex organs of both sexes originate from the
        genital tubercle of the fetus. Structures having the same
        origin are said to be homologous. The male and female
        foreskin, or prepuce, are homologous structures that
        develop similarly.[<a id="b04" class="plain" href="#r04"
        name="b04">4</a>] Differentiation of these tissues occurs
        prior to birth, and is dependent on the sex of the fetus.
        The prepuce in the male fetus appears at eight weeks as a
        ring of thickened epidermis which grows forward over the
        base of the glans. By 16 weeks the prepuce has advanced to
        the tip of the glans.[<a id="b05" class="plain" href="#r05"
        name="b05">5</a>] By 16 weeks the prepuce has advanced to
        the tip of the glans. At this stage, the epidermis of the
        prepuce is contiguous with the epidermis of the glans--that
        is, these two structures are fused together. The process of
        separation then begins, but this process is rarely complete
        by the time the child is born. In some cases, the prepuce
        does not become fully retractable until puberty.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <a id="s031b" name="s031b"></a> 

      <h4>Gross anatomy of the penis</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The penis consists of three main areas: the shaft, the
        glans and the prepuce. The penile shaft extends from the
        abdominal wall to the sulcus of the glans. The glans, or
        head of the penis, is attached to the shaft at the sulcus.
        The prepuce, or foreskin, is an extension of tissue that
        begins at the sulcus, proceeds forward to the level of the
        tip of the glans or beyond, then folds back on itself and
        becomes contiguous with the true skin of the penile shaft.
        Thus, the prepuce actually consists of two layers: an outer
        layer similar to the shaft skin, and an inner layer that is
        not skin at all, but mucosa similar to that found on the
        lips, female genital mucosa, and perianal mucosa.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <a id="s031c" name="s031c"></a> 

      <h4>Histology of the penis</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The inner layer of the prepuce consists of mucosa, which
        differs histologically from true skin in several important
        respects. For instance, mucosa lacks the dense collagenous
        zone normally associated with true skin. It also lacks the
        hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands often
        seen in histological preparations of true skin.[<a id="b06"
        class="plain" href="#r06" name="b06">6</a>] The mucosal
        surface of the prepuce is lined by variably keratinized
        squamous epithelium similar to that of the mouth, vagina,
        and esophagus.</p>

        <p>The prepuce possesses a richer variety and a greater
        number of nerve endings than any other part of the
        penis.[<a id="b07" class="plain" href="#r07"
        name="b07">7</a>] The inner layer of the prepuce is made up
        of two distinct zones of mucosa. The first zone, situated
        nearest the tip of the penis, displays a prominent band of
        ridged mucosa ("ridged band"). This band merges with the
        frenulum of the penis and when the prepuce is fully
        retracted, it lies across the upper surface and sides of
        the shaft of the mid-third of the penis. Histologically,
        the ridged band has a tremendously rich vascular supply,
        explaining its deep red colour. It is densely packed with
        Meissner, Pacinian, and Ruffini corpuscles. Even the least
        damaging forms of circumcision remove nearly all of these
        specialized sensory receptors.</p>

        <p>The second zone, located adjacent to the sulcus of the
        glans, is smooth mucosa, with no ridging and shallower
        papillae. It contains fewer end organs than the ridged
        mucosa.</p>

        <p>Taylor <i>et al</i>. found that circumcision results in
        a mean loss of 3.4 cm of preputial skin and mucosa, or 51
        percent of the length of the mean adult penile shaft.
        Taylor&nbsp;<i>et&nbsp;al</i>. also note that</p>

        <blockquote>
          Clearly, the penis is a complex organ with many different
          parts, each specialized for a specific function. The
          prepuce provides a large and important platform for
          several nerves and nerve endings. The innervation of the
          outer skin of the prepuce is impressive; its sensitivity
          to light touch and pain are similar to that of the skin
          of the penis as a whole. The glans, by contrast, is
          insensitive to light touch, heat, cold, and as far as the
          authors are aware, to pin-prick. Le Gros Clark noted that
          the glans penis is one of the few areas on the body that
          enjoys nothing beyond primitive sensory modalities.[<a
          id="b08" class="plain" href="#r08" name="b08">8</a>]

      <h4>Functions of the penis</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>Though the penis and clitoris arise from the same
        embryonic tissue, they serve different purposes. In the
        female, the clitoris acts as a focal point for sexual
        stimulation. The penis, on the other hand, is primarily an
        organ of copulation and a conduit for urination. As noted
        previously, recent anatomical evidence suggests the prepuce
        in the male is structured for a specialized sexual
        function. The prepuce contains the densest concentrations
        of fine-touch neuroreceptors to be found on the penis.[<a
        id="b09" class="plain" href="#r09" name="b09">9</a>] The
        prepuce and glans are complementary structures designed to
        work together.</p>

        <p>In most newborn males, the prepuce adheres tightly to
        the glans. Physical separation of these two tissues
        normally takes several years to complete. In 90 percent of
        cases, separation is complete by the age of three years.[<a
        id="b10" class="plain" href="#r10" name="b10">10</a>] In a
        small number of cases, total separation may not occur until
        puberty.<br />

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The pros and cons of circumcision have been the subject
        of intense debate in the medical community for decades.
        Proponents have focused on marginal benefits, while
        opponents have focused on pain and surgical risk. It is
        interesting to note that the value of normal anatomy has
        been almost totally excluded from consideration. The
        consensus of medical opinion today is that neonatal
        circumcision cannot be justified as a routine
        procedure.<br />

      <h4>Statements of medical organizations</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Canadian Paediatric Society</b> (1996):
          "Circumcision of newborns should not be routinely
          performed." [<a id="b11" class="plain" href="#r11"
          name="b11">11</a>]</li>

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />

          <li><b>American Academy of Pediatrics</b> (1999):
          "Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential
          medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however,
          these data are not sufficient to recommend routine
          neonatal circumcision." [<a id="b12" class="plain"

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li><b>British Medical Association</b> (1996): "It is
          rarely necessary to circumcise an infant for medical
          reasons." [<a id="b13" class="plain" href="#r13"
          name="b13">13</a>]</li>

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />

          <li><b>Australasian Association of Paediatric
          Surgeons</b> (1996): "The Australasian Association of
          Paediatric Surgeons does not support the routine
          circumcision of male neonates, infants or children in
          Australia." [<a id="b14" class="plain" href="#r14"

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />
          &nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Australian College of Paediatrics notes: "The
        possibility that routine circumcision may contravene human
        rights has been raised because circumcision is performed on
        a minor and is without proven medical benefit." [<a
        id="b15" class="plain" href="#r15" name="b15">15</a>]</p>

        <p>In summary, medical organizations around the world are
        in agreement that there is no medical justification for
        removing the healthy prepuce.<br />

      <h4>Changes in sexual practice</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>Laumann <i>et al</i>. report that circumcised men tend
        to exhibit a "more elaborated set of sexual practices than
        do men who are not circumcised." [<a id="b16" class="plain"
        href="#r16" name="b16">16</a>] This finding has been
        interpreted by some to mean that circumcised men have more
        fun. Van Howe and Cold, however, suggest that circumcised
        men may require more intense stimulation to make up for the
        loss of fine-touch receptors in the prepuce.[<a id="b17"

      <h3>Genital mutilation and Canadian criminal law</h3>
      <a id="s041a" name="s041a"></a> 

      <h4>The purpose of criminal law</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>According to the Canadian Department of Justice, "laws
        are not only designed to govern our conduct: they are also
        intended to give effect to social policies... Another goal
        of the law is fairness. This means that the law should
        recognize and protect certain basic individual rights and
        freedoms, such as liberty and equality. The law also serves
        to ensure that strong groups and individuals do not use
        their powerful positions in society to take unfair
        advantage of weaker individuals... In a democratic society
        like Canada, laws are not carved in stone, but must reflect
        the changing needs of society. In a democracy, anyone who
        feels that a particular law is flawed has the right to
        speak out publicly and to seek to change the law by lawful
        means." [<a id="b18" class="plain" href="#r18"
        name="b18">18</a>]</p>

        <p>Criminal law helps safeguard lives and property. We need
        criminal law to ensure a safe and peaceful society in which
        the rights of individuals are respected. The Canadian legal
        system guarantees the rights of each individual while, at
        the same time, ensuring that society functions in an
        orderly manner. We also believe in the Rule of Law, which
        means that the law applies to every person, including
        members of the police force and public officials.<br />

      <h4>Criminalization of FGM</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>In 1997 the Canadian Parliament passed an amendment to
        the Criminal Code of Canada expressly prohibiting all forms
        of female genital mutilation (FGM). This legislation was
        enacted in response to increasing flows of immigrants from
        countries where FGM is commonly practised. Genital
        mutilation is recognized as a human rights violation under
        the provisions of treaties and conventions to which Canada
        is a State party. There have been no prosecutions for FGM
        in Canada prior to or after the introduction of this
        amendment.</p>

        <p>The prohibition against FGM was added to Section 268 of
        the Criminal Code,[<a id="b19" class="plain" href="#r19"
        name="b19">19</a>] which deals with aggravated assault.
        This section now reads as follows:<br />
        &nbsp;</p>

        <blockquote>
          <strong><font size="-1">AGGRAVATED
          ASSAULT</font></strong> 

          <p class="level2">268. (1) Every one commits an
          aggravated assault who wounds, maims, disfigures or
          endangers the life of the complainant.</p>

          <p class="level1"><i>Punishment</i></p>

          <p class="level2">(2) Every one who commits an aggravated
          assault is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
          imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.</p>

          <p class="level1"><i>Excision</i></p>

          <p class="level2">(3) For greater certainty, in this
          section, "wounds" or "maims" includes to excise,
          infibulate or mutilate, in whole or in part, the labia
          majora, labia minora or clitoris of a person, except
          where</p>

          <p class="level2">(a) a surgical procedure is performed,
          by a person duly qualified by provincial law to practise
          medicine, for the benefit of the physical health of the
          person or for the purpose of that person having normal
          reproductive functions or normal sexual appearance or
          function; or</p>

          <p class="level2">(b) the person is at least eighteen
          years of age and there is no resulting bodily harm.</p>

          <p class="level1"><i>Consent</i></p>

          <p class="level2">(4) For the purposes of this section
          and section 265, no consent to the excision, infibulation
          or mutilation, in whole or in part, of the labia majora,
          labia minora or clitoris of a person is valid, except in
          the cases described in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).</p>

          <p class="level1">R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 268; 1997, c.
          16, s. 5.<br />
          &nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Section 268 prohibits interference with genitalia for
        non-medical reasons, but only in the case of female
        genitalia. Male anatomy is not mentioned. While it has been
        argued that non-therapeutic male circumcision is covered
        under this section even though it is not specifically
        mentioned, the question arises as to why female body parts
        are expressly referred to and what degree of protection is
        afforded to males. Sections 15 and 28 of the Canadian
        Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter)[<a id="b20"
        class="plain" href="#r20" name="b20">20</a>] stipulate that
        rights are guaranteed equally to both sexes.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <a id="s042" name="s042"></a> 

      <h3>The Constitution and Canadian criminal law</h3>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The Charter of Rights and Freedoms identifies the many
        forms of protection Canadians enjoy under the law. Sections
        7, 15, and 28 of the Charter are particularly germane to
        any discussion about genital mutilation, whether female or
        male:<br />
        &nbsp;</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and
          security of the person and the right not to be deprived
          thereof except in accordance with the principles of
          fundamental justice.</p>

          <p>15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the
          law and has the right to the equal protection and equal
          benefit of the law without discrimination and, in
          particular, without discrimination based on race,
          national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or
          mental or physical disability.</p>

          <p>28. Notwithstanding anything in this Charter, the
          rights and freedoms referred to in it are guaranteed
          equally to male and female persons.<br />
          &nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>When performed without a specific medical indication,
        circumcision of newborns, infants and children clearly
        violates the right to physical integrity guaranteed under
        Section 7. Non-therapeutic circumcision of newborns and
        children is a superfluous, invasive surgical intervention
        performed without consent. It limits the future choices of
        the patient with respect to sexual behaviour, aesthetics,
        and perhaps even religious affiliation.</p>

        <p>Section 268 of the Criminal Code prohibits genital
        mutilation of females, but by failing to extend the same
        protection to males, this section now contravenes Sections
        15 and 28 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section
        268 of the Criminal Code discriminates against males as a
        group solely on the basis of their sex. It is important to
        note that offering equal protection to men under the law
        would in no way diminish the protection offered to
        women.<br />
        &nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <a id="s043" name="s043"></a> 

      <h3>Legal arguments against circumcision</h3>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The basic moral principles of justice require that all
        parents and caretakers be treated equally by legislation
        enacted to protect children.[<a id="b21" class="plain"
        href="#r21" name="b21">21</a>] This means that a uniform
        standard should be applied to those entrusted with the care
        of children.</p>

        <p>Under Canadian law, the onus falls on physicians and
        parents to show that a child will benefit from a proposed
        surgical intervention. The consensus of medical opinion
        today is that neonatal circumcision confers no such
        benefit. Neonatal circumcision is a traumatic intervention
        that involves amputation of a normal body part without
        patient consent. It has a realistic complication rate of
        between 2 percent and 10 percent,[<a id="b22" class="plain"
        href="#r22" name="b22">22</a>] although published rates
        vary from 0.06 percent to 55 percent.[<a id="b23"
        class="plain" href="#r23" name="b23">23</a>] Scientific
        studies have shown that neonatal circumcision has long-term
        adverse effects on pain response,[<a id="b24" class="plain"
        href="#r24" name="b24">24</a>] and puts both males and
        their female partners at greater risk for disease.[<a
        id="b25" class="plain" href="#r25" name="b25">25</a>, <a
        id="b26" class="plain" href="#r26" name="b26">26</a>, <a
        id="b27" class="plain" href="#r27" name="b27">27</a>, <a
        id="b28" class="plain" href="#r28" name="b28">28</a>, <a
        id="b29" class="plain" href="#r29" name="b29">29</a>, <a
        id="b30" class="plain" href="#r30" name="b30">30</a>, <a
        id="b31" class="plain" href="#r31" name="b31">31</a>] Early
        work suggests that circumcision impacts adversely on female
        enjoyment as well.[<a id="b32" class="plain" href="#r32"
        name="b32">32</a>]</p>

        <p>Those who perform neonatal circumcision for ritual,
        cultural, or social reasons must show justification for
        interfering with the normal development of a child's body.
        The onus of proof is upon the proponents of circumcision to
        furnish clear and convincing evidence that a child will
        benefit from circumcision. It is not upon those opposed to
        the practice to prove that harm results to the child. Dr.
        Margaret Somerville, one of Canada's leading ethicists and
        Founding Director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics
        and Law, has put it this way:</p>

        <blockquote>
          All wounding of one person by another person is <i>prima
          facie</i> criminal assault (indeed, aggravated criminal
          assault), but it can become justified--that is, not
          illegal, not a crime--on certain conditions. The most
          common and important situation in which wounding is not a
          criminal assault, is when it is indicated as medically
          required surgery and it is undertaken with the informed
          consent of the person on whom it is carried out or, if
          this person is incompetent, of their legal representative
          (in the case of children, the parents). The difficulty
          with infant male circumcision is that when it is
          <b>not</b> medically indicated--the Canadian Paediatric
          Society, for instance, has stated it is not medically
          indicated as a routine procedure--medical justification
          is not present and, although adults can consent to have a
          non-therapeutic intervention carried out on themselves
          provided the intervention is not considered to be
          contrary to public policy, in general, they may not
          consent to having such interventions carried out on their
          children. The exception to this is if the intervention is
          considered to be what the law calls <i>de minimis</i>,
          that is, a trifle of which the law will not take notice.
          Arguably, ear-piercing, especially as it is reversible,
          falls within this category. However, even the rabbis with
          whom I talked agreed that male infant circumcision is not
          <i>de minimis</i>.[<a id="b33" class="plain" href="#r33"
          name="b33">33</a>]
        </blockquote>

        <p>Dr. Somerville has also written:</p>

        <blockquote>
          All woundings are criminal assault unless they can be
          justified. The burden of proof of justification is on the
          person who causes the wounding. A therapeutic aim is the
          justification for almost all medical wounding and is an
          essential justification for those unable to consent to
          the wounding for themselves. Consequently, a physician
          would need to show that infant male circumcision was
          medically necessary before it would be justified. If
          there is equal doubt as to whether or not it is medically
          necessary (which seems to me to be the most favourable
          position that, at present, could be taken in favour of
          infant male circumcision), then the procedure must not be
          carried out.[<a id="b34" class="plain" href="#r34"
          name="b34">34</a>]
        </blockquote>
        Insofar as both male circumcision and female circumcision
        are surgical interventions that remove normal erogenous
        tissue without therapeutic aim, they cannot fail to have
        the same legal status. Thus far, however, the legal system
        is protecting only females. Males are being discriminated
        against on account of their gender, and because of a
        perception that male genitals are somehow less worthy of
        protection. This is a clear violation of Sections 15 and 28
        of the Charter.

      <h4>Limitations on religious practice</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>A free and democratic society recognizes that there are
        limitations to the way in which religious beliefs can be
        exercised. Canadian case law includes many examples of
        these limitations. In <a id="c010" href="1a.html#c010"
        name="c010"><i>Re D.</i></a> (1982), the presiding judge
        held that legislation enacted to protect child welfare and
        public health does not violate the Charter Rights of
        Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>

        <p>Many cases can be cited to illustrate the limits placed
        on the exercise of religious beliefs when those beliefs may
        result in harm to an individual. The Government of Canada
        has made FGM a crime, though millions of people around the
        world believe this practice has a religious basis. In <a
        id="c020" href="1a.html#c020" name="c020"><i>Children's Aid
        Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. S.H.</i></a> (1996),
        specific reference is made to the limits that a free and
        democratic society may impose on the freedom of religion
        enjoyed under the Charter.</p>

        <p>In <a id="c030" href="1a.html#c030"
        name="c030"><i>O'Sullivan v. The Queen</i></a> (1991), the
        issue of religious freedom under the Charter is addressed
        in the context of taxation. The presiding judge, Muldoon J.
        speaks specifically to the limitations of Section 2 of the
        Charter.</p>

        <p>Though freedom of religion is guaranteed under the
        Charter, this guarantee is by no means unconditional. At
        times, the right to practise religion comes into conflict
        with the need to protect children. The state's obligation
        to protect children is most evident when parental religious
        practices threaten minor children with possible risk of
        harm or potential loss of life. The constitutional
        guarantee of freedom of religion does not give parents the
        unfettered right to harm children through religious
        practices, nor can these constitutional guarantees be used
        to defend wilful neglect or wilful harm.[<a id="b35"
        class="plain" href="#r35" name="b35">35</a>] There is no
        room for harm in the Name of God, even in a country that
        grants freedom of religion.<br />

        <p>The opportunity to grow and develop safe from physical
        harm is a fundamental right of every child in a free and
        democratic society. In Canada, respect for individual
        rights requires that children be involved in decisions
        regarding their own bodies whenever possible.</p>

        <p>Informed consent requires that physicians provide all
        the relevant information patients need to exercise their
        decision-making rights,[<a id="b36" class="plain"

        <p>Most parents seek to protect their children and to act
        in their children's best interests in matters of health
        care. Therefore the notion of proxy ("substitute") consent
        is appropriate, practical and necessary in the vast
        majority of circumstances. In a pluralistic society, one
        can find many religious, social, cultural, and philosophic
        positions on what constitutes acceptable child rearing and
        child welfare. The law generally provides parents with wide
        discretionary authority in raising their children. However,
        the existence of child protection and child neglect/abuse
        laws is testimony to the fact that, on occasion, parents
        fail to live up to their responsibilities toward their
        children. Hence proxy consent is limited in scope.</p>

        <p>The courts have imposed limits on parental consent in
        respect of both medical treatment and religious practice.
        These limitations are clearly illustrated in <a id="c040"
        href="1a.html#c040" name="c040"><i>Pentland v. Pentland et
        al.</i></a> (1979).</p>

        <p>In <a id="c050" href="1a.html#c050" name="c050"><i>Re
        S.E.M.</i></a> (1986), a case similar to the one above, the
        presiding judge took an even stronger position. The
        strength of this case lies in the fact that the decision
        was passed at the Queen's Bench level on appeal of a lower
        court decision.</p>

        <p>What stands out in this last case is that the Section 7
        rights of the child take precedence over the Section 2
        rights of the parents. It is abundantly clear that the
        courts limit the rights of parents to provide or withhold
        consent when the safety or well being of the child is at
        stake. This holds true whether the parental motivation is
        religious or otherwise. If circumcision is of no net
        medical benefit to a child, and has the potential for
        causing serious harm, then the authority of the parents to
        consent to such a procedure is doubtful. Thus circumcision
        of a newborn for non-therapeutic purposes is a clear
        violation of the infant's rights even when religion is the
        motivating factor behind the procedure.</p>

        <p>Proxy consent is problematic for physicians since they
        have a primary duty of care to their patients. The American
        Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics states:</p>

        <blockquote>
          In attempting to adapt the concept of informed consent to
          pediatrics, many believe that the child's parents or
          guardians have the authority or "right" to give consent
          by proxy. Most parents seek to safeguard the welfare and
          best interests of their children with regard to health
          care, and as a result proxy consent has seemed to work
          reasonably well. However, the concept encompasses many
          ambiguities. Consent embodies judgments about proposed
          interventions and, more importantly, consent (literally
          "to feel or sense with") expresses something for one's
          self: a person who consents responds based on unique
          personal beliefs, values, and goals. Thus "proxy consent"
          poses serious problems for pediatric health care
          providers. Such providers have legal and ethical duties
          to their child patients to render competent medical care
          based on what the patient needs, not what someone else
          expresses. Although impasses regarding the interests of
          minors and the expressed wishes of their parents or
          guardians are rare, the pediatrician's responsibilities
          to his or her patient exist independent of parental
          desires or proxy consent.[<a id="b37" class="plain"
          href="#r37" name="b37">37</a>]
        </blockquote>

        <p>This view of proxy consent is mirrored in Canadian case
        law. For example in <i>K. v. K.</i>, Justice Craig J.A.
        states of Justice Wood's decision:</p>

        <blockquote>
          [para21] He commenced his discussion on this aspect of
          his judgement with a statement that "the history of the
          non-therapeutic sterilization of the mentally handicapped
          is chequered with evidence of much abuse." He stated that
          "generally speaking a parent's decision to give a
          substituted consent for the performance of a therapeutic
          medical or surgical procedure" on a child "would not be
          the subject of review" by a court in the exercise of its
          parens patriae jurisdiction and that probably a court
          would not interfere with a parent's substituted consent
          in the case of a non-therapeutic procedure where the
          benefits obviously far outweigh the risks. He then said:
          "But what of those cases where the risks and benefits are
          closely divided, or where the risks outweigh the
          benefits? In such cases, and I believe this to be one,
          the court, in my view, must exercise its inherent
          jurisdiction to review and regulate the decision of the
          parents in order to ensure that the best interests of the
          child are met with the decision which has been made.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Patients today have a strong desire to be involved in
        decision-making with respect to their health needs. This
        trend is evidenced by the introduction and legal
        recognition of "living wills," "advance directives," and
        "powers of attorney for personal care." The foregoing are
        forms of proxy that a patient leaves and fully expects to
        be followed in the event that he or she becomes severely
        incapacitated.</p>

        <p>Parents do not have a right to surgically alter their
        children when there is no opportunity for the child to
        participate in the decision-making and the decision can
        reasonably be delayed. In the case of non-therapeutic
        circumcision, children should have the right to be involved
        in the decision. In <a id="c060" href="1a.html#c060"
        name="c060"><i>Stephenson v. Florant</i></a> (1925), the
        court recognized that minor children have the capacity to
        make decisions regarding their own lives.</p>

        <p>In <a id="c070"
        href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/1a.html#c070"
        name="c070"><i>Fleming v. Reid</i></a> (1991), it was held
        that physicians and others are not free to decide what is
        in the best interest of a patient when the patient has left
        advance directives. While the court recognized that the
        treatment had significant therapeutic value, it could not
        deny the patients' will to invoke Section 7 of the Charter
        and maintain the sanctity of their own persons. The
        judgment indicates that therapies which have side-effects
        and/or irreversible consequences are intrusive and violate
        patients' rights when performed without consent.</p>

        <p>In <i>Adan v. Davis</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 3030, the issue
        was whether the plaintiff, Fahmo Adan, had consented to a
        tubal ligation performed by the defendant, Bernard Davis,
        on May 7, 1992. The court found that apart from emergency
        situations, undertaking a surgical procedure without
        consent clearly constitutes battery.</p>

        <p>In <i>Reibl v. Hughes</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880, the
        issue under consideration was the scope of a physician's
        duty of disclosure. The court discussed the distinction
        between battery and negligence and defined the tort of
        battery at p. 890 as "...intentional...consisting of an
        unprivileged and unconsented to invasion of one's bodily
        security" and one which is "...confined to cases where
        there has been no consent at all or where, emergency
        situations aside, surgery or treatment has been performed
        or given beyond that to which there was consent." The court
        concluded that, absent fraud or misrepresentation to secure
        consent to treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant
        risks goes to negligence and not battery.</p>

        <p>As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in <i>Eldridge
        v. B.C. (A.G.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624 at 676-7:</p>

        <blockquote>
          The centrality of communication to the delivery of
          medical services is particularly evident in the context
          of negligence law. The duty of disclosure commands
          physicians to inform patients fully of the risks involved
          in treatment and answer their questions regarding such
          risks; see Reibl v. Hughes, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p.
          884, and Hopp v. Lepp, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 192, at p. 210.
          Physicians cannot discharge this obligation without being
          able to communicate effectively with their patients.

      <h4>Consent powers of the court</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The courts have set limits to proxy decision-making, or
        "substitute consent." In <a id="c090" href="1a.html#c090"
        name="c090"><i>Re "Eve"</i></a>, a mother applied for the
        legal authority to have her mentally disabled daughter
        sterilized. This case became a test of the degree to which
        the fundamental rights of an incompetent individual could
        be overriden by paternalistic instincts. The Supreme Court
        denied the mother's request, ruling that a procedure which
        the court saw as being both "a serious intrusion" and
        "irreversible" could not be authorized for non-therapeutic
        purposes under the parens patriae jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>In <a id="c100" href="1a.html#c100"
        name="c100"><i>Strong (Re)</i></a> [1993], the court did
        allow an application for authorization of surgery on a
        mentally incompetent woman. Citing "Eve," the presiding
        justice emphasised that the parens patriae jurisdiction of
        the court must be exercised for the benefit of the
        protected person.</p>

        <p>In <i><a id="c110" href="1a.html#c110" name="c110">K. v.
        K.</a></i> (1985), the court allowed an appeal by a mother
        for the authority to have a hysterectomy carried out on her
        mentally disabled daughter. The judgment affirmed that the
        onus falls on parents to establish that a proposed surgical
        intervention is in the best interests of the child. The
        judgment also drew attention to the need to protect the
        basic human rights of incompetent persons.</p>

        <p><i><a id="c120" href="1a.html#c120" name="c120">Malette
        v. Shulman</a></i> (1990) illustrates the importance
        attached by the courts to the principle of autonomy and
        respect for persons. Damages were awarded to a Jehovah's
        Witness who received a blood transfusion against her
        express wishes. The court held that the plaintiff's right
        to protection against unwanted infringement of her bodily
        integrity was more important than life itself.</p>

      <h3>International law</h3>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>Canada has ratified numerous international instruments
        in the field of human rights. These agreements are binding
        on Canada even though they may not constitute Canadian law.
        Canadian courts are obliged to interpret cases with due
        respect to international law except in cases where an
        agreement has expressly been denied standing in Canada
        through legislation. This obligation is well-documented in
        <i><a id="c130" href="1a.html#c130" name="c130">Hogarth et
        al. v. Hall et al.</a></i></p>

        illustrates the lengths to which governments must go to
        honour their international obligations. Clearly, Canadian

      <h4>UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</h4>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>In December 1991, Canada ratified the United Nations
        Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)[<a id="b38"
        class="plain" href="#r38" name="b38">38</a>] The Preamble
        of the UNCRC recognizes that children are particularly
        vulnerable, and thus in need of extra protection:</p>

        <blockquote>
          Recognizing that the United Nations has, in the Universal
          declaration of Human Rights proclaimed and agreed that
          everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set
          forth therein, without discrimination of any kind, such
          as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or
          other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth
          or other status, recalling that in the Universal
          Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has
          proclaimed that childhood is entitled to special care and
          assistance.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Within the UNCRC Art. 1 defines a child, Art. 2
        prohibits discrimination, and Art. 3 requires States
        Parties to protect children and their rights and
        re-iterates the test of the child's best interests which is
        familiar in common law jurisdictions.</p>

        <p>Preambular paragraph 12 of the UNCRC states:</p>

        <blockquote>
          Taking due account of the importance of the traditions
          and cultural values of each people for the protection and
          harmonious development of the child...
        </blockquote>

        <p>Some proponents of infant male circumcision have argued
        that paragraph 12 supports their perspective and cite the
        importance of the child's cultural background as supporting
        their view. However, cultural values, like religious
        beliefs, cannot be put into practice in such a way that
        they infringe on the rights of others. Thus FGM, though it
        is a cultural practice, is prohibited in Art. 24(3) UNCRC.
        Moreover, the female genital mutilation practised by some
        groups as a tradition or cultural value must have equal
        status to the mutilation involved in male circumcision.
        Paragraph 12 cannot be arbitrarily or prejudicially
        applied; it applies either to all forms of genital
        mutilation or to none at all.[<a id="b39" class="plain"
        href="#r39" name="b39">39</a>] It is clear from the
        structure of the UNCRC as a whole, as well as from the
        general body of the law, that cultural practices which harm
        children are not permitted.</p>

        <p>Within the main text of the UNCRC Art. 1 defines a
        child, Art. 2 prohibits discrimination, and Art. 3 requires
        States Parties to protect children and their rights and
        re-iterates the test of the child's best interests which is
        familiar in common law jurisdictions.</p>

        <p>Art. 14 contains provisions as to religion; however
        there is no provision within the article that endorses or
        permits the infliction of harm or disfiguring marks on a
        child. Religion has its limitations in any society and is
        not a shield behind which to hide. Just as we would not
        accept Art. 14 to apply in the case of a religion that
        demands we cut off a child's finger or ear, we cannot
        accept that it advocates genital mutilation.</p>

        <p>Art. 19 requires the child to be protected from abuse at
        the hands of parents, and Art. 24(3) provides that "States
        Parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures
        with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial
        to the health of children." Insofar as non-therapeutic
        circumcision is a painful, invasive, irreversible surgical
        intervention to which the child has not given consent, and
        whose alleged benefits are uncertain and remote, it is
        clearly prejudicial to the health of children. Furthermore,
        it is not a recommended medical practice by any credible
        medical body in the world. The prohibition in Art. 24(3)
        UNCRC covers, in view of Art. 1., children of both sexes
        and thus genital mutilation of both sexes.</p>

        <p>It is illogical to argue that the prohibition in Art.
        24(3) applies only to FGM. First, if female circumcision
        were the only traditional practice to be prohibited then
        the provision could have been drafted accordingly and it
        was not. More importantly, by virtue of Article 31 of the
        Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, the words of
        treaty provisions must be given their ordinary meaning; and
        by Article 32, recourse may not be had to the <i>travaux
        pr&eacute;paratoires</i> unless the meaning of the treaty
        provisions is on the face of it unclear, or possibly, where
        all the parties are in agreement so to refer. The wording
        of Article 24(3) is clear and unambiguous, and the parties
        have not agreed to have recourse to the <i>travaux
        pr&eacute;paratoires</i> to limit its ambit.</p>

        <p>Further, the UNCRC cannot be viewed in isolation. It
        must be read and applied against the backdrop of other
        international law provisions as to the fundamental human
        rights of every person, be they man, woman or child. It is
        a moot point whether these general principles have attained
        the status of <i>ius cogens</i>, though it is difficult to
        argue that they are not now customary international law.
        What the UNCRC does is to focus on the particular issues
        that pertain to childhood; but, as Art. 41 expressly
        states, nothing in it can derogate from the more general
        protections offered by international law.</p>

        Regard must be given, but not exclusively to, the Universal
        Declaration on Human Rights, and, especially, the United
        Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. These
        international instruments, and others, make it clear that
        circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons is a denial to the
        circumcised infant of his fundamental human rights.<br />

        <p>The provisions within the UDHR find echo in the
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
        (ICCPR) whose Art. 5 provides:</p>

        <blockquote>

        and in relation to the freedom of religion Art. 18 provides
        that 

        <blockquote>
          Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be
          subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law

          health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms

        </blockquote>
        The effect of the general and oft-repeated provision of
        Arts. 30 UDHR and the ICCPR, and of Art. 18 in the ICCPR is
        that a sharp distinction is drawn between the right to

      <h2>Ethical considerations</h2>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>Infant male circumcision is morally indefensible because
        it amputates a normal body part without patient consent. In
        general, medical ethics forbid treating any patient who has
        not provided informed consent. In rare circumstances, where
        life and limb are threatened and the patient is incapable
        of providing informed consent, physicians can proceed
        provided the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the
        potential risks and harms. The problem with infant male
        circumcision is that the procedure is not medically
        required, and there is no clear benefit to the child.</p>

        <p>Medical ethics also requires that extra protection be
        extended to vulnerable persons. That is, the range of
        procedures to which competent adults can consent on behalf
        of someone in their care or custody is narrower than the
        range of procedures to which competent adults can consent
        on their own behalf. In the former case, extreme caution
        must be exercised to ensure that vulnerable persons are not
        subject to unnecessary medical or surgical
        interventions.</p>

        <p>The best interests of the individual child are of
        paramount importance when making decisions regarding that
        child's medical treatment. This principle is clearly
        articulated by the Canadian Paediatric Society:</p>

        <blockquote>
          The primary concern of physicians caring for children
          must be the best interests of the individual child. All
          infants and children have intrinsic value and deserve our
          respect and protection...No other interests can override
          those of the child, whether they be family stability or
          well-being, or the well-being of other caretakers.[<a
          id="b40" class="plain" href="#r40" name="b40">40</a>]
        </blockquote>

        <p>Clearly it is not in the best interest of a healthy
        child to undergo an intrusive surgical intervention whose
        alleged benefits are remote and uncertain.</p>

        <p>Dr. Eike-Henner Kluge, Chair of the Philosophy
        Department at the University of Victoria and a former
        Director of Ethics and Legal Affairs at the Canadian
        Medical Association, prepared an ethical analysis of female
        circumcision published in the <i>Canadian Medical
        Association Journal</i> 1993. Dr. Kluge argues that
        circumcision of girls is unethical because it is
        potentially harmful, has no therapeutic value, and puts the
        interests of others ahead of the best interests of the
        child. Dr. Kluge adds:</p>

        <blockquote>
          With due alteration of detail, the same ethical reasoning
          holds for male circumcision. There rarely are medical
          reasons for performing the procedure; personal preference
          or religious values of the parents usually underlie the
          request. If these are insufficient to justify the
          circumcision of girls, they are also insufficient to
          justify circumcision of boys. To argue differently is to
          be guilty of discrimination on the basis of sex. The fact
          that female circumcision is a more serious intervention
          does not alter the situation. Both involve what in other
          contexts would be called non-consensual mutilation of a
          minor for non-medical reasons.[<a id="b41" class="plain"

      <a id="s061" name="s061"></a> 

      <h3>Human rights and the court</h3>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>In <a id="c080" href="1a.html#c080" name="c080"><i>Chan
        v. Canada</i></a> (1995), the appellant sought refugee
        status in Canada because he feared he would be forcibly
        sterilized if he returned to China. Justice Mahoney
        characterized non-therapeutic sterilization without consent
        as a serious violation of a person's rights, citing
        <i>"Eve."</i> He found no distinction between the sexes
        that would alter this characterization. It should be noted
        that vasectomy can be reversed, whereas circumcision is
        permanent in its effects.<br />

      <h3>OHRC and genital mutilation</h3>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>Koppelman[<a id="b42" class="plain" href="#r42"
        name="b42">42</a>] suggests four main reasons for the
        practice of FGM:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Preservation of group identity.</li>

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>Hygienic reasons including maintenance of cleanliness
          and health.</li>

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>Preservation of virginity, family honour, and
          prevention of immorality.</li>

          <li style="list-style: none"><br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>Furtherance of social and economic security for women
          by assuring marriage goals are attained.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These reasons have been echoed in the Ontario Human
        Rights Commission (OHRC) policy on FGM. The OHRC policy
        also refers to the Ontario Female Genital Mutilation
        Prevention Task Force, which cited a number of reasons for
        FGM including preservation of virginity, control over
        women's sexuality, good appearance, class distinction, and
        cultural identity.</p>

        <p>The OHRC identified several international agreements
        infringed on by the practice of FGM, including the United
        Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
        Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights
        of the Child, the African Charter of Human and People's
        Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social
        and Cultural Rights (Art.12).</p>

        <p>The OHRC specifically states that</p>

        <blockquote>
          International conventions and covenants to which Canada
          is a signatory recognize that human beings have the
          inherent right to life, equality, freedom and security,
          the right not to suffer discrimination, the right to the
          best possible state of physical and mental health, and a
          right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel and
          degrading punishment or treatment.
        </blockquote>

        <p>It is worthy of note that non-therapeutic circumcision
        of male infants and children is performed for the same
        reasons as FGM--namely, cleanliness, potential health
        benefits, good appearance, conformity to societal values,
        and preservation of cultural identity.</p>

        <p>A desire to control sexuality figures prominently in the
        history of circumcision. Indeed, routine circumcision as a
        medical procedure owes its very existence to an
        anti-masturbation hysteria that swept English-speaking
        countries in the 19th century. As recently as 1935, a
        physician wrote as follows in the <i>British Medical
        Journal:</i></p>

        <blockquote>
          I suggest that all male children should be circumcised.
          This is 'against nature,' but that is exactly the reason
          why it should be done. Nature intends that the adolescent
          male shall copulate as often and as promiscuously as
          possible, and to that end covers the sensitive glans so
          that it shall be ever ready to receive stimuli.
          Civilization, on the contrary, requires chastity, and the
          glans of the circumcised rapidly assumes a leathery
          texture less sensitive than skin. Thus the adolescent has
          his attention drawn to his penis much less often. I am
          convinced that masturbation is much less common in the
          circumcised. With these considerations in view it does
          not seem apt to argue that 'God knows best how to make
          little boys.' [<a id="b43" class="plain" href="#r43"
          name="b43">43</a>]
        </blockquote>

        <p>Dr. Thomas Szasz observes:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The significance of the idea of masturbatory insanity
          lies in the fact that sexual self stimulation was the
          first a long line of religious transgressions that were
          converted into medical diseases. The roots of both R.N.C.
          [routine neonatal circumcision] and anti-masturbatory
          measures lie in Jewish law, which recognizes the
          legitimacy of carotid pleasure associated with sexual
          intercourse, provided that the act is marital-genital
          congress between the Jewish man in the Jewish woman.
          Every other sexual act is strictly prohibited.
          Masturbation is condemned unequivocally both in the
          Talmud and in extra-Talmudic literature.</p>

          <p>Recognizing the obvious connections between touching
          the penis and sexual arousal, Jewish law "definitely
          prohibits touching one's genitals--the unmarried man
          never, and the married man only in connection with
          urination" (Epstein, 1967, p.137). When an Orthodox
          Jewish father bladder trains his son, he admonishes him:
          "Without hands! Better a bad aim than a bad habit." [<a
          id="b44" class="plain" href="#r44" name="b44">44</a>]</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Circumcision advocates cite the alleged health benefits
        of circumcision as justification for performing the
        procedure. Among these alleged benefits are reductions in
        the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI) and cancer
        of the penis. Other purported advantages include improved
        cleanliness because there is no foreskin to care for and a
        reduced risk of cervical cancer for partners of circumcised
        males. These health benefits have repeatedly been proven to
        be overstated or non-existent. For example, a recent
        Ontario study[<a id="b45" class="plain" href="#r45"
        name="b45">45</a>] found that less than one percent of
        intact newborn boys were hospitalized for UTI in the first
        year of life, and that nearly 200 circumcisions would be
        required to prevent one infection. Moreover, urinary tract
        infections are treatable with antibiotics and have a very
        low morbidity. The Canadian Paediatric Society exhaustively
        reviewed this topic in 1975, 1982, and 1996. Each time it
        has concluded that circumcision of newborns should not be
        routinely performed.[<a id="b46" class="plain" href="#r46"
        name="b46">46</a>]</p>

        <p>Circumcision also continues to serve as a group marker
        for both Moslems and Jews. It is so compelling as a group
        marker that during the Second World War, Jews throughout
        occupied Europe stopped circumcising male infants to
        conceal their Jewish identity. Circumcision also serves as
        a form of social control, for males cannot be considered
        for inclusion in the Moslem and Jewish faiths unless they
        comply with this requirement. Lastly, as clearly evidenced
        within a religious context, circumcision has and continues
        to be used as a form of sexual control of males.</p>

        <p>Infant male circumcision clearly meets all the criteria
        set out by the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) as
        grounds for condemning FGM. Yet the policy on FGM
        legitimizes infant male circumcision by making reference to
        outdated information and ignoring the recommendations of
        Canadian authorities such as the Canadian Paediatric
        Society. Furthermore, the OHRC undermines its own
        credibility by quoting well-known circumcision advocates
        who defend circumcision on religious as well as medical
        grounds.</p>

        <p>Circumcision of boys is gender-specific discrimination.
        Healthy, erogenous tissue that is functioning normally can,
        apparently, be removed from the genitals of boys without
        raising the eyebrows of human rights organizations or
        Canadian authorities. Such intrusions on girls, however,
        are expressly prohibited by the Criminal Code. Both FGM and
        MGM share the same irrational motives and myths, as Hanny
        Lightfoot-Klein[<a id="b47" class="plain" href="#r47"
        name="b47">47</a>] and others have shown. By failing to
        extend equal protection to males and females, the OHRC has
        committed the greatest transgression of human rights. The
        OHRC has protected females and summarily denied that same
        protection to males, even though protecting males would not
        diminish in any way the protection extended to
        females.<br />

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <div class="bodytext">
        <p>Circumcision of male infants is a clear violation of the
        rights guaranteed to all persons by the Canadian Charter of
        Rights and Freedoms. Furthermore, the practice contravenes
        human rights legislation on provincial and international
        levels.</p>

        <p>It is a fundamental principle of international law, as
        well as the mark of every civilized community, that
        discrimination is unlawful. Interpretations of human rights
        law that recognize FGM but not MGM as violations infringe
        on equal protection principles enshrined in national and
        international law. Female circumcision is, rightly, a
        criminal offence in almost every country even when
        "religious duty" is claimed; there can be no justification
        for not extending the same protection to boys. All forms of
        sexual cutting of children are profoundly damaging, whether
        male or female. To suggest that only female circumcision be
        regarded as in breach of the various conventions on human
        rights denies the medical evidence as to the pain, risks
        and sexual dysfunction from infant male circumcision. It
        argues for the formalization of discrimination against
        these male children on the grounds of their sex, race and
        the religious beliefs of the family into which they are
        born. Human rights principles are absolute, not subject to
        balancing in the scales of international justice relative
        to other violations.</p>

        <p>The presence of and tolerance for infant male
        circumcision in our societies harms us all. Male infants
        need our protection from unnecessary surgery. To
        contemplate a ban on non-ritual, non-therapeutic
        circumcision, while allowing ritual circumcision, would be
        a prohibited discrimination against a group of boys on the
        grounds of their parents' religion. These infants will
        always have the choice to be circumcised later in life, if
        they so choose to do as a sign of their faith. At that
        point, at least, it is their own decision and not one that
        has been imposed irreversibly upon them.</p>

        <p>Male genital mutilation (MGM), including circumcision,
        is much more of an issue in Canada than FGM, whose
        proponents and victims are found mostly abroad. For that
        reason, MGM deserves at least as much attention as FGM from
        Canadian authorities. It is difficult to conceive that the
        amputation of healthy, fully functional erogenous tissue
        without consent does not violate the most basic of human
        rights.</p>

        <p>Canadians proudly point to the Charter of Rights and
        Freedoms as the primary instrument for protecting their
        rights. The evidence is clear: infant male circumcision for
        anything other than real medical necessity violates both
        the Charter and the Criminal Code. As Canadians we have an
        obligation to rectify this injustice.<br />

        Price C, There is an important distinction to be drawn
        between the language of most paragraphs and that of
        preambular paragraph 12: namely between paragraphs starting
        with "Recognizing..." and those with "Taking account...".
        The clear signal from the difference in language is that
        those matters in the "recognizing" paragraphs formed a
        basis or framework for the Articles which follow, whereas
        the "Taking due account of the importance of the traditions
        and cultural values of each people for the protection and
        harmonious development of the child" is seen as not
        overriding the protections and rights enunciated in the
