          <div class="casetext">
            <p>Immediately following its birth the child developed
            a severe respiratory illness. Medical specialists
            agreed that its life was in danger and that a blood
            transfusion was immediately required. The parents, who
            were Jehovah's Witnesses, refused to consent to the
            blood transfusion. On the day following its birth the
            child was apprehended pursuant to s. 6 of the Child
            Welfare Act and a blood transfusion was administered
            under the authority of s. 9(1)(b) of the Act. The
            Director of Child Welfare applied to the Court for a
            declaration that the child was a neglected child. It
            was contended for the parents that ss. 6 and 9 of the
            Child Welfare Act contravened s. 2(a) of the Canadian
            Charter of Rights and Freedoms which guaranteed freedom
            of conscience and religion.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> Sections 6 and 9 of the Child Welfare
            Act constituted legislation in relation to child
            welfare and public health, not legislation in relation
            to religion. Since the pith and substance of the
            legislation was not religion, it did not contravene the
            guarantee of religious freedom enshrined in the
            Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
            notwithstanding that it might affect Jehovah Witnesses
            in the exercise of their religious beliefs.</p>

            <p>This was an application for a declaration that the
            constitutional rights of TH had been infringed by the
            manner in which a court hearing was conducted. TH was a
            13-year-old Jehovah's Witness. Her mother was also a
            Jehovah's Witness. TH suffered from aplastic anaemia.
            TH and her mother refused to allow treatment of TH
            involving blood products. The judge made a temporary
            order under the Child and Family Services Act, making
            TH a temporary ward of the Children's Aid Society for a
            two-week period, to ensure that she was treated with
            blood products. TH claimed that her rights under
            sections 7 and 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
            and Freedoms had been violated.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> TH's rights were not violated. TH's
            freedom of religion was infringed but the infringement
            was justified under section 1 of the Charter, as TH was
            not capable of making decisions and her mother would
            not consent to treatment. The ability of the state to
            protect a child requiring medical treatment, who was
            not capable of making a treatment decision, was a
            reasonable limit to TH's freedom of religion, that was
            demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
            society.</p>

            <p>A taxpayer remitted his taxes payable under the
            Income Tax Act, S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63, less a sum of
            $50, which he withheld to protest government funding of
            abortions, claiming that payment of the sum would
            violate his right to freedom of conscience and religion
            contrary to s. 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
            and Freedoms. The Tax Court dismissed his appeal, and
            the prothonotary granted a motion by the Crown to
            strike out his statement of claim, which was his means
            of appeal from the Tax Court decision.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> The taxpayer has standing to raise the
            constitutional issue. The preamble to the Charter,
            recognizing the supremacy of God, only prevents the
            Canadian state from becoming officially atheistic. It
            does not prevent Canada from being a secular state.</p>

            <p>The taxpayer here is lawfully pursuing the resort to
            law as administered by the court. His counsel invokes
            s. 2(a) of the Charter, the constitutionally entrenched
            "freedom of conscience and religion." He argues that
            the taxpayer's freedom of conscience and religion is
            infringed by being compelled by the government to pay
            over that portion of his taxes which proportionately
            represents financial support for abortions. It is
            correctly argued that the constitutional guaranty of
            that freedom means not only that the state must not
            infringe it, but also that the state must positively
            defend it from all infringement, or else there is no
            such guaranty. So, subject to the secular strictures
            expressed in s. 1 of the Charter, everyone is free to
            entertain, openly to declare, and to practise through
            worship or outward manifestation freely accepted or
            chosen religious beliefs without hindrance or reprisal:
            and the [page137] state is bound to defend this freedom
            along with the other rights and freedoms guaranteed by
            and in the Charter.</p>

            <p>Does legal compulsion to pay taxes some of which
            support abortions mean state coercion which infringes
            freedom of religion and conscience? It probably does,
            but in any event, given the rights of legal opposition
            in a free and democratic society it is no doubt
            justified in terms of s. 1, which, as noted above
            imposes secular limitations on the freedom. After all,
            there are religions and religions. Some exact not only
            beliefs, but also manifestations or practices which are
            inimical to Canada's constitutional values and
            imperatives; for example, religions or sects which
            exact suppression of the equal rights of women, or
            which exact the taking of stupefying drugs as a
            "sacrament," or which exact the involuntary servitude
            of some of their adherents, or which condone and incite
            their believers to the murder of an alleged
            blasphemer.</p>

            <p>There are certain vociferous believers in Canada who
            believe that their Creator has done such a lamentably
            poor job in forming female humans that they arrogate to
            themselves the right to improve on their God's
            allegedly fumbled handiwork. The improvement under the
            euphemistically misleading appellation of "female
            circumcision" is nothing less than the mutilation of
            their dependant daughters by cutting off the clitoris
            and outer and inner labia of the vulva. Whether called
            a manifestation of religion, ethnicity or culture this
            cruel mutilation is practised presumably because God
            bungled and to leave these girls and women as they were
            created would be to pander to sexual immorality. The
            adherents of this belief say it is a parent's right to
            inflict such mutilation upon their daughters, and
            moreover, they ought to have access to the health care
            system to do it.</p>

            <p>The court emphasizes the constitutional plane of
            approach, invoked by the taxpayer here, even although
            the practice of mutilation of daughters, which is
            nothing akin to the harmless male circumcision, causes
            irreversible bodily harm and should excite the
            attention of children's aid societies. The taxpayers
            counsel would not concede that this practice should be
            immunized and permitted by operation of s. 2(a) of the
            Charter. Indeed, he is correct, for if the state were
            to support that practice at the expense of the
            taxpaying public it would surely be infringing those
            unfortunate daughters' guaranteed rights to "security
            of the person" enunciated in s. 7 of the Charter.
            Section 28 emphasizes female persons' equal standing in
            all matters of rights and freedoms.</p>

            <p>In R. v. Morgentaler, supra, a majority judgment of
            the Supreme Court of Canada held that s. 251 of the
            Criminal Code which criminalized abortions, but also
            permitted them to be authorized by therapeutic abortion
            committees violated the pregnant woman's right to the
            security of her person guaranteed by s. 7, and that
            such infringement was not justified pursuant to s. 1 of
            the Charter. Thus does the well-known tenet of the
            taxpayer's religion collide with another right. It is
            on the same constitutional footing as the less
            well-known tenet of those parents who have their
            daughters mutilated, for such daughters are surely
            guaranteed the right to security of their persons as
            much as pregnant women who seek to abort their
            pregnancies.</p>

            <p>The court holds that this secular state of Canada
            simply leaves conscience and religion quite alone, with
            one exception, founded on pure reason. The exception
            requires the state to intervene to prevent the practice
            or expression of conscience and religion from causing
            harm to others physically or mentally, or from
            violating the constitutionally guaranteed rights of
            others.</p>

            <p>When it comes to practices which harm others,
            obviously the state not only must not foster or promote
            them, but is justified pursuant to the Charter's s. 1,
            to enact reasonable limits in law in order to prevent
            or to eradicate such harm, despite the guaranty of
            freedom of conscience and religion. Since those
            perceptions depend upon whose "ox is gored", the court
            must strive for fastidious objectivity. Here is how the
            taxpayer's counsel put the distinction between Mr.
            O'Sullivan and the daughter-mutilators: And in one case
            [the surgical procedure] destroys, terminates that
            particular young person, the child in utero and the
            case is what Mr. O'Sullivan wishes to prevent and not
            contribute towards. Whereas in the other case, I would
            imagine that female circumcision can in fact be harmful
            to the health and could even possibly be an assault on
            the child. It mutilates the child and that is what the
            religion is [standing] for and therefore I don't see
            why that should not be forbidden. In one case it's the
            harm that Mr. O'Sullivan is opposed to, in the other
            case in fact there is in fact there may be harm if the
            religious belief is fostered. I think that's the
            central distinction. So it is that sincere,
            conscientious religious beliefs can so often blind one
            to the sincerity of other conscientious religious
            beliefs. Thus, while the secular state is bound to
            defend, that is to guarantee, everyone's freedom of
            conscience and religion, it is not bound or even
            permitted, to promote every expression or manifestation
            of conscience and religion, just as it is not bound to
            promote every manifestation of freedom of opinion and
            expression, some of which are defamatory. Indeed, it is
            the constitutional entrenchment of these very disparate
            freedoms which demonstrates the inherent secularity of
            the Canadian state. The sorry story of human strife and
            savagery in the Name of God amply shows that the
            resolutely secular state is the sure foundation of
            everyone's security, even if it leaves something, or
            much, for sincere believers to desire.</p>

          <div class="casetext">
            <p>The decree nisi of divorce granted in 1969 gave
            custody of the child of the marriage, a boy, to the
            mother. The mother subsequently remarried and embraced
            the faith of her second husband, a Jehovah's Witness.
            In April 1978 the boy, then seventeen years old, was
            involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered head
            injuries, eye damage, bruising of the heart and other
            injuries. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of
            Victoria Hospital where medical experts struggled to
            save his life.</p>

            <p>A severe drop in his blood count convinced the
            doctors that blood transfusions were necessary. The
            mother and her husband refused their consent to the
            giving of blood transfusions or any blood substitutes
            to the boy. Their refusal was dictated by their
            religious faith. The boy, who was unable to speak but
            could write some notes, also refused to give his
            consent to the transfusions. His natural father and
            Victoria Hospital Corporation applied for a variation
            of the custody provision of the decree nisi. The boy's
            maternal grandmother gave evidence that she was
            prepared to accept custody of the boy and to give her
            consent to all necessary medical treatment, including
            blood transfusions.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> The decree nisi was varied and custody
            of the infant granted to his maternal grandmother. The
            Court accepted the medical evidence that it might be
            absolutely necessary to transfuse in order to attempt
            to save the boy's life. The concerns of the mother were
            real, genuine and honest beliefs. Her love for the boy
            was obvious and her decision attested to the strength
            of the faith in the Jehovah's Witnesses. However, the
            paramount consideration in the determination of custody
            was the best interests of the child. Every child had
            the right to the continuation of life so long as was
            humanly possible, as well as the fundamental right to
            the best medical care available in his community. If
            the boy had been under the age of sixteen years he
            could- in the circumstances of this case, have been
            made a ward of the Court by virtue of subparagraph
            20(1) (b) (x) of the Child Welfare Act. It was the duty
            of the Court to give custody of the boy to a person who
            would not deny him his fundamental rights. The boy's
            refusal of treatment was not, in the opinion of the
            Court, based on a rational, reasoned thought process:
            Of this he was incapable because of his condition.</p>

          <div class="casetext">
            <p>Fourteen weeks premature, the child S weighed less
            than one pound at birth. In the opinion of the
            specialists at the neonatal intensive care unit to
            which she was transferred, blood transfusions were
            essential, if the child was to have any chance of
            survival. The parents, who were Jehovah's Witnesses,
            refused to consent to transfusions. Following
            apprehension of the child, blood transfusions were
            authorized by the Provincial Court on a series of
            applications made pursuant to s. 20(2) of the Child
            Welfare Act. Finally, an order was made appointing the
            Children's Guardian temporary guardian of S for a
            period of 6 weeks. The parents appealed from all the
            court orders, relying on several grounds of appeal.
            They challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and
            legality of the relevant provision of the Child Welfare
            Act, and relied on several provisions of the Canadian
            Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> The appeal was dismissed. Section 83 of
            the Child Welfare Act did not give the court an
            independent discretion to review the evidence and make
            whatever order it deemed appropriate. The evidence
            supported the conclusions reached by the Provincial
            Court judge who made the temporary guardianship order.
            He acted properly in proceeding on the principle that
            the welfare of the child was paramount. Nor did any
            provision infringe rights guaranteed by the Canadian
            Charter of Rights and Freedoms. With regard to s. 7 of
            the Charter, the Act did not deprive the child S of the
            right to life: it protected that right. Assuming that
            the parents had a right under the same Charter
            provision to be free from state intervention, there had
            to be a balancing of protected but competing rights.
            The child's right to life took precedence over any
            competing right of the parents. The right to freedom of
            religion guaranteed by s. 2 of the Charter was not
            without qualification, despite its fundamental nature.
            It would be contrary to the purpose of the Charter if
            religious freedom were allowed to be exercised in such
            a way as to deprive an infant of a realistic chance to
            live.</p>

            <p>In cases involving the custody of children the
            judges of the common law courts have exercised a larger
            jurisdiction in granting writs of habeas corpus than in
            other cases. They have exercised powers somewhat
            analogous to those which the Court of Chancery has
            always exercised in its character of parens
            patriae.</p>

            <p>If an infant, brought before the Court on habeas
            corpus, is old enough to exercise a choice as to where
            he wishes to live, the Court will not constrain him,
            but will leave him to select. If, however, he is too
            young to make this choice, the Court will then look to
            the principles of law [in Quebec, to the Civil Code] to
            see who is entitled to custody, because there is a
            presumption that where the child is in legal custody,
            there is no restraint. The capacity to choose must be
            determined on the basis of the child's age, rather than
            of its mental capacity. The age at which a child should
            be deemed to have sufficient discretion was fourteen in
            the case of a boy, and sixteen in the case of a
            girl.</p>

            <p>The appellants were involuntary psychiatric patients
            who suffered from schizophrenia. The respondent, their
            attending physician, determined that they were not
            competent to consent to psychiatric treatment and
            proposed to treat them with neuroleptic drugs (which
            control or minimize psychotic episodes or symptoms
            associated with schizophrenia for many, but not all,
            patients and which have significant and unpredictable
            harmful side effects). While competent, the appellants
            had expressed the desire not to take the drugs. The
            Official Guardian was appointed pursuant to s. 1a(1) of
            the Mental Health Act as the appellants' substitute
            decision-maker. An incompetent patient's substitute
            decision-maker is obliged by s. 1a(6) of the Act to
            give or refuse consent to psychiatric treatment in
            accordance with the wishes of the patient where those
            wishes have been expressed while the patient was
            competent. The Official Guardian, pursuant to s. 1a(6),
            refused to consent to the proposed treatment. The
            respondent applied under s. 35a(1) of the Act to the
            review board for an order authorizing the treatment
            (only the decisions of substitutes of involuntary
            incompetent patients were subject to such review;
            voluntary incompetent patients could never be ordered
            to take drugs contrary to the their previously
            expressed wishes). The review board granted orders
            authorizing the administration of neuroleptic drugs to
            the appellants on the basis that such treatment was in
            the appellants' best interests. (A patient's prior
            competent wish is not one of the factors listed in s.
            35(5) of the Act as governing the determination of what
            is in the patient's best interests.) The orders were
            affirmed on appeal. Although the statutory scheme was
            found to deprive the appellants of their security of
            the person contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of
            Rights and Freedoms, the deprivation was held not to
            violate the principles of fundamental justice since the
            scheme was in accord with the common law principles
            that underlie the parens patriae jurisdiction of the
            court. The appellants appealed.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> the appeal should be allowed.</p>

            <p>At common law, every competent adult has the right
            to be free from unwanted medical treatment. A patient,
            in anticipation of circumstances wherein he or she may
            be unconscious or otherwise incapacitated and thus
            unable to contemporaneously express his or her wishes
            about a particular form of medical treatment, may
            specify in advance his or her refusal to consent to
            treatment. A doctor is not free to disregard such
            advance instructions, even in an emergency.</p>

            <p>The common law right to determine what shall be done
            with one's own body and the constitutional right to
            security of the person can be treated as
            co-extensive.</p>

            <p>The impugned provisions of the Act manifestly
            operated so as to deprive the appellants of their right
            to security of the person as guaranteed by s. 7 of the
            Charter. Few medical procedures are more intrusive than
            the forcible injection of powerful mind-altering drugs
            which are often accompanied by severe and sometimes
            irreversible adverse side effects.</p>

            <p>The impugned legislative scheme was not saved by s.
            1 of the Charter. The violation of the principles of
            fundamental justice worked by the scheme could be
            neither "reasonable" nor "demonstrably justified in a
            free and democratic society." The fundamental right to
            personal security should not be infringed any more than
            is clearly necessary. Although the right to be free
            from non-consensual psychiatric treatment is not an
            absolute one, the state had not demonstrated any
            compelling reason for entirely eliminating the right,
            without any hearing or review, in order to further the
            best interests of involuntary incompetent psychiatric
            patients in contravention of their competent wishes. To
            completely strip those patients of the freedom to
            determine for themselves what shall be done with their
            bodies could not be considered a minimal impairment of
            their Charter right.</p>

            <p>Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life,
            liberty and security of the person and the right not to
            be deprived of that right except in accordance with the
            principles of fundamental justice. In determining
            whether the legislation is in breach of this section of
            the Charter, I adopt the approach set out by the
            Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Beare; R. v. Higgins,
            [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, 45 C.C.C. (3d) 57, at p. 401
            S.C.R., p. 69 C.C.C.:</p>

            <p>The analysis of s. 7 of the Charter involves two
            steps. To trigger its operation there must first be a
            finding that there has been a deprivation of the right
            to "life, liberty and security of the person" and,
            secondly, that that deprivation is contrary to the
            principles of fundamental justice.</p>

            <p>On the first branch of the analysis, it is manifest
            that the impugned provisions of the Act operate so as
            to deprive the appellants of their right to "security
            of the person" as guaranteed by s. 7. The common law
            right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy is so
            entrenched in the traditions of our law as to be order
            of protection. This right forms an essential part of an
            individual's security of the person and must be
            included in the liberty interests protected by s. 7.
            Indeed, in my view, the common law right to determine
            what shall be done with one's own body and the
            constitutional right to security of the person, both of
            which are founded on the belief in the dignity and
            autonomy of each individual, can be treated as
            co-extensive.</p>

            <p>Appellant sought Convention refugee status because
            of his fear of being forcibly sterilized for a
            violation of China's one-child birth control laws. To
            be classified a Convention refugee, the appellant had
            to establish that he had a well-founded fear of
            persecution for reasons of membership in a particular
            social group (his family) or political opinion.</p>

            <p><b>Held:</b> appeal should be dismissed.</p>

            <p>Per La Forest, l'Heureux-Dub&eacute;, and Gonthier
            (Dissenting):</p>

            <p>Basic human rights transcend subjective and
            parochial perspectives and extend beyond national
            boundaries. Recourse can be had to the municipal law of
            the admitting nation, nevertheless, because that law
            may well animate a consideration of whether the alleged
            feared conduct fundamentally violates basic human
            rights. Forced sterilization constitutes a gross
            infringement of the security of the person and readily
            qualifies as the type of fundamental violation of basic
            human rights that constitutes persecution.
            Notwithstanding the technique, forced sterilization is
            in essence an inhuman, degrading and irreversible
            treatment.</p>

            <p>Federal Court of Appeal (1993) -- Mahoney
            (Dissenting):</p>

            <p>The forced sterilization of a woman is a fundamental
            violation of basic human rights. It violates Articles 3
            [life, liberty and security of the person] and 5
            [cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]
            of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
            Rights. [para35] Mahoney J.A. then referred, at p. 704,
            to E. (Mrs.) v. Eve, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388, in which this
            Court found, in the case of a female incompetent, that
            non-therapeutic sterilization without consent was a
            "grave intrusion on a person's rights" and an
            "irreversible and serious intrusion on the basic rights
            of the individual." He found no distinction between the
            sexes that would alter this characterization. Mahoney
            J.A. stated, at p. 704, that "[w]hatever view may be
            taken of the other sanctions by which the population
            control policy is enforced, involuntary sterilization
            -- physical abuse that is an irreversible and serious
            intrusion on the basic rights of the individual -- is
            persecution."</p>

            <p>[para72] In Eve, at pp. 431 and 432, this Court
            affirmed that forced sterilization constitutes a "grave
            intrusion on a person's rights" and as an "irreversible
            and serious intrusion on the basic rights of the
            individual." Certainly this is true in this kind of
            context. Two of the justices below followed this
            reasoning, citing Eve directly, while the other
            acknowledged that he found this particular penalty
            abhorrent. In my opinion, the sanction of forced
            sterilization against the appellant in the present case
            would constitute a gross infringement of the security
            of the person and readily qualify as the type of
            fundamental violation of basic human rights that
            constitutes persecution as discussed in the mentioned
            authorities and the UNHCR Handbook.</p>

            <p>APPEAL by the guardian ad litem of a mentally
            retarded woman from a judgment of the Prince Edward
            Island Supreme Court, in [page3] banco, 115 D.L.R. (3d)
            283, 27 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 97 and 28 Nfld. &amp;
            P.E.I.R. 359 (addendum), allowing an appeal by the
            mother of the incompetent from a judgment of C.R.
            McQuaid J., dismissing her application for
            authorization to consent to a sterilization operation
            being performed on her daughter.</p>

            <p>The judgment of the court was delivered by LA FOREST
            J.: -- These proceedings began with an application by a
            mother for permission to consent to the sterilization
            of her mentally retarded daughter who also suffered
            from a condition that makes it extremely difficult for
            her to communicate with others. The application was
            heard by McQuaid (C.R.) J. of the Supreme Court of
            Prince Edward Island, Family Division. In the interests
            of privacy, he called the daughter "Eve," and her
            mother "Mrs. E."</p>

            <p>From the evidence, he further concluded that Eve is
            not capable of informed consent, that her moderate
            retardation is generally stable, that her condition is
            probably non-inheritable, that she is incapable of
            effective alternative means of contraception, that the
            psychological or emotional effect of the proposed
            operation would probably be minimal, and that the
            probable incidence of pregnancy is impossible to
            predict.</p>

            <p>The courts below Mrs. E. wanted to be sure she had a
            right to consent to the sterilization of Eve, so she
            applied to McQuaid J. for the following remedies:</p>

            <p>that Eve be declared a mentally incompetent pursuant
            to the provisions of the Mental Health Act;</p>

            <p>that Mrs. E. be appointed the committee of the
            person of Eve;</p>

            <p>that Mrs. E. be authorized to consent to a tubal
            ligation operation being performed on Eve.</p>

            <p>McQuaid J. saw no problem regarding the first two
            remedies. These, in his view, were simply a prelude to
            the third, on which he concentrated, i.e., the
            authorization to consent to a tubal ligation operation
            on Eve. He noted that every surgical procedure requires
            the prior consent of the patient or someone lawfully
            [page5] authorized on her behalf; otherwise it
            constitutes battery. Though he thought a parent or a
            committee could give a valid consent for any strictly
            therapeutic procedure on behalf of a retarded person,
            in his view deeper issues arose where the procedure was
            only marginally therapeutic or, as in the present case,
            strictly contraceptive and specifically one of
            sterilization. For it would deprive Eve of the possible
            fulfilment of the great privilege of giving birth, a
            result that should cause a court to act with scrupulous
            caution even though Eve might not be able to understand
            or fully appreciate this.</p>

            <p>Having reviewed the Canadian and English case-law
            and found no governing authorities, McQuaid J.
            considered whether the court should, in the exercise of
            its parens patriae jurisdiction, intervene on behalf of
            Eve. He had no doubt that the court could authorize a
            surgical procedure necessary to health even though a
            side-effect might be sterilization, and he postulated
            that it could also do so where the public interest
            clearly required it, though he found it difficult to
            come up with an example. However, McQuaid J. was of the
            view that Eve, like other individuals, was entitled to
            the inviolability of her person, a right that
            superseded her right to be protected from pregnancy.
            That this might result in inconvenience and even
            hardship to others was irrelevant. The law must protect
            those who are unable to protect themselves; it must
            ensure the protection of the higher right. He,
            therefore, concluded that the court had no authority or
            jurisdiction to authorize a surgical procedure on a
            mentally retarded person, the intent and purpose of
            which was solely contraceptive. It followed that,
            except for clinically therapeutic reasons, parents or
            others similarly situated could not give a valid
            consent to such a surgical procedure either, at least
            in the absence of clear and unequivocal statutory
            authority. He, therefore, denied the application.</p>

            <p>In its decision the Supreme Court [La Forest] stated
            the following:</p>

            <p>The parens patriae jurisdiction is, as I have said,
            founded on necessity, namely the need to act for the
            protection of those who cannot care for themselves. The
            courts have frequently stated that it is to be
            exercised in the "best interest" of the protected
            person, or again, for his or her "benefit" or
            "welfare."</p>

            <p>The situations under which it can be exercised are
            legion; the jurisdiction cannot be defined in that
            sense. As Lord MacDermott put it in J. v. C., [1970]
            A.C. 668 at p. 703, the authorities are not consistent
            and there are many twists and turns, but they have
            inexorably "moved towards a broader discretion, under
            the impact of changing social conditions and the weight
            of opinion." In other words, the categories under which
            the jurisdiction can be exercised are never closed.
            Thus I agree with Latey J. in Re X, supra, at p. 699,
            that the jurisdiction is of a very broad nature, and
            that it can be invoked in such matters as custody,
            protection of property, health problems, religious
            upbringing and protection against harmful associations.
            This list, as he notes, is not exhaustive.</p>

            <p>But I can find nothing in the authorities to which I
            have been referred by counsel or in my own researches
            to suggest that there is any limitation in the
            theoretical scope of this jurisdiction; or, to put it
            another way, that the jurisdiction can only be invoked
            in the categories of cases in which it has hitherto
            been invoked, such as custody, care and control,
            protection of property, health problems, religious
            upbringing, and protection against harmful
            associations. That list is not exhaustive. On the
            contrary, the powers of the court in this particular
            jurisdiction have always been described as being of the
            widest nature. That the courts are available to protect
            children from injury whenever they properly can is no
            modern development.</p>

            <p>The court's discretion under its parens patriae
            jurisdiction must be exercised for the benefit of the
            retarded person, not for the benefit of others. Thus
            courts should never authorize a non-therapeutic
            sterilization of a mentally retarded person under its
            parens patriae jurisdiction. The grave intrusion on the
            retarded person's rights and the certain physical
            damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization
            without consent, when compared to the highly
            questionable advantages that can result from it, lead
            to the conclusion that it can never safely be
            determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of
            that person. Judges are generally ill-informed about
            many of the factors relevant to a wise decision in this
            difficult area. They generally know little of mental
            illness, of techniques of contraception or their
            efficacy. And, however well-presented a case may be, it
            can only partially inform. If sterilization of the
            mentally incompetent is to be adopted as desirable for
            general social purposes, the legislature is the
            appropriate body to do so. It is in a position to
            inform itself and is attuned to the feelings of the
            public in making policy in this sensitive area. The
            actions of the legislature will then be subject to the
            scrutiny of the courts under the <a
            href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/loireg/charte/const_en.html"
             target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and
            Freedoms</a> and otherwise.</p>

            <p>Though the scope or sphere of operation of the
            parens patriae jurisdiction may be unlimited, it by no
            means follows that the discretion to exercise it is
            unlimited. It must be exercised in accordance with its
            underlying principle. Simply put, the discretion is to
            do what is necessary for the protection of the person
            for whose benefit it is exercised: see the passages
            from the reasons of Sir John Pennycuick in Re X, at pp.
            706-7, and Heilbron J. in Re D, at p. 332, cited
            earlier. The discretion is to be exercised for the
            benefit of that person, not for that of others. It is a
            discretion, too, that must at all times be exercised
            with great caution, a caution that must be redoubled as
            the seriousness of the matter increases. This is
            particularly so in cases where a court might be tempted
            to act because failure to do so would risk imposing an
            obviously heavy burden on some other individual.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the implications of sterilization are
            always serious. As we have been reminded, it removes
            from a person the great privilege of giving birth, and
            is for practical purposes irreversible. If achieved by
            means of a hysterectomy, the procedure approved by the
            Appeal Division, it is not only irreversible; it is
            major [page30] surgery. Here, it is well to recall Lord
            Eldon's admonition in Wellesley's case, supra, at 2
            Russ p. 18, 38 E.R.p. 242, that "it has always been the
            principle of this Court, not to risk the incurring of
            damage to children which it cannot repair, but rather
            to prevent the damage being done." Though this comment
            was addressed to children, who were the subject-matter
            of the application, it aptly describes the attitude
            that should always be present in exercising a right on
            behalf of a person who is unable to do so.</p>

            <p>One may sympathize with Mrs. E. To use Heilbron J.'s
            phrase, it is easy to understand the natural feelings
            of a parent's heart. But the parens patriae
            jurisdiction cannot be used for her benefit. Its
            exercise is confined to doing what is necessary for the
            benefit and protection of persons under disability like
            Eve. And a court, as I previously mentioned, must
            exercise great caution to avoid being misled by this
            all too human mixture of emotions and motives. So we
            are left to consider whether the purposes underlying
            the operation are necessarily for Eve's benefit and
            protection.</p>

            <p>APPLICATION by a guardian ad litem for an order
            authorizing certain surgery and medical treatment on a
            mentally disabled adult. The applicant was the
            Registrar of the Supreme Court who by virtue of his
            position and in the absence of a public trustee or
            official guardian was appointed as guardian of the
            Estate and Effects of S, an 88-year-old woman who
            suffered from chronic organic brain syndrome with
            marked impairment in her cognition and judgment.</p>

            <p><b>HELD:</b> Application allowed. The Registrar of
            the court, as officer of the court was to execute such
            consents and authorizations in writing as were required
            by the physicians to facilitate and ensure the
            provision of the treatment of the incompetent.</p>

            <p>In Re <i>"Eve,"</i> LaForest, J., described the
            parens patriae jurisdiction of the court in general
            terms as follows at p. 295: "The parens patriae
            jurisdiction is, as I have said, founded on necessity
            namely, the need to act for the protection of those who
            cannot care for themselves. The courts have frequently
            stated that it is to be exercised in the 'best
            interest' of the protected person, or again, for his or
            her 'benefit' or 'welfare.'"</p>

            <p>The jurisdiction is of a very broad nature, and it
            can be invoked in such matters as custody, protection
            of property, health problems, religious upbringing and
            protection against harmful associations. This list is
            not exhaustive. A court may act not only on the ground
            that injury to person or property has occurred, but
            also on the ground that such injury is apprehended.</p>

            <p>Separate reasons for judgment were delivered by
            Craig, Aikins and Anderson JJ.A.</p>

            <p>[para1] CRAIG J.A.: -- On April 26th, we allowed the
            appeal of the appellant, the mother of Infant "K"
            ordering that a surgeon could perform a hysterectomy on
            Infant "K" (who is, physically, ten and a half years of
            age, but is, mentally, only two years or so old and
            will never achieve a greater mental age than three and
            a half) with the consent of her parents and stating
            that, subsequently, we would deliver reasons for our
            decision.</p>

            <p>[para14] At the outset of his judgment, Mr. Justice
            Wood said there were two substantial issues to be
            resolved, stating:</p>

            <p>"While there are a number of social, ethical and
            legal questions that must be addressed before the
            ultimate answer to this petition can be determined,
            there are really two substantial issues to be resolved.
            The first is raised by the question: who can legally
            consent to the sterilization of one who, through age
            and/or disability, is incapable of providing the
            required personal consent? The second concerns the
            standards to be met before such substituted consent can
            be given."</p>

            <p>[para15] Mr. Justice Wood rejected the submission by
            counsel for the petitioner that the parents "have the
            absolute right to decide what is best for their
            children" stating that the rights of parents "... must
            yield to the parens patriae jurisdiction of the court
            ..." to determine what would be in the best interests
            of the child but stating, also, that the exercise of
            such jurisdiction against the will of "wise and caring
            parents" was "an exceptional step" and should be taken
            only "where the well-being of the infant was clearly at
            issue or the need for such interference was clearly
            demonstrated." He concluded that the exercise of the
            parens patriae jurisdiction involved three questions:
            (1) the legal rights of "K", (2) the nature of the
            proposed surgery, (3) the social and policy questions
            which surround the sterilization of the mentally
            handicapped.</p>

            <p>[para16] I will summarize his views on each of these

            <p>Legal Rights of "K"</p>

            <p>[para17] He said that the mentally disabled,
            regardless of age, have (1) the right to personal
            security under s. 7 of the Charter of Rights, (2) the
            right to equal protection under the law (now guaranteed
            by s. 15 of the Charter), and (3) the right of a woman
            to reproduce. He asked if the fact that "K" would
            "probably never enjoy" the right to reproduce made the
            right any less important to her and concluded that it
            did not. Relying on the evidence of Dr. Carter, he
            stated that "K's" uterus was of "no more or less
            significance to her" than it was to any normal woman of
            child bearing age "who has made the conscious decision
            not to have any, or any more, children", and that while
            the right to reproduce may not be exercised "... it
            nonetheless remains as an important part of her
            identity as a woman" (her "gender identity").</p>

            <p>[para18] He went on to say:</p>

            <p>"Thus any utilitarian approach to the question of
            consent in this case, which assumes that the operation
            will be of less significance to K than to a normal
            woman, and that consent should therefore be more
            readily given, must of necessity be founded on the
            belief that the mentally handicapped in our society are
            not entitled to the same rights of either sexual
            identity or childbearing that those of us, who are not
            so disabled, enjoy. I do not accept such a proposition
            as having any place in our law."</p>

            <p>[para21] He commenced his discussion on this aspect
            of his judgment with a statement that "the history of
            the non-therapeutic sterilization of the mentally
            handicapped is chequered with evidence of much abuse."
            He stated that "generally speaking a parent's decision
            to give a substituted consent for the performance of a
            therapeutic medical or surgical procedure" on a child
            "would not be the subject of review" by a court in the
            exercise of its parens patriae jurisdiction and that
            probably a court would not interfere with a parent's
            substituted consent in the case of a non-therapeutic
            procedure where the benefits obviously far outweigh the
            risks. He then said: "But what of those cases where the
            risks and benefits are closely divided, or where the
            risks outweigh the benefits? In such cases, and I
            believe this to be one, the court, in my view, must
            exercise its inherent jurisdiction to review and
            regulate the decision of the parents in order to ensure
            that the best interests of the child are met with the
            decision which has been made.</p>

            <p>The best interests of K will be met by a decision
            which, inter alia, takes into account and preserves the
            full panoply of her legal rights. The surgery proposed
            in this case puts at risk important personal rights
            which she enjoys equally with all others in this
            community, notwithstanding either her age or her mental
            disability. The benefits to her of the non-therapeutic
            surgery which threatens those rights are at best
            anticipatory and perhaps non-existent. In such a case,
            the exclusive judgment of the parents, even loving,
            caring, exemplary parents such as K is privileged to
            have, cannot be presumed to be free from subjective
            considerations which may be at odds with the legal
            rights of the child."</p>

            <p>[para22] I infer that when he speaks of the cases
            where "the risks and benefits are closely divided, or
            where the risks outweigh the benefits" he does not mean
            the physical risks which may be incidental to the
            surgical procedure, but the risk of interference with
            what he terms her "important personal rights." In
            stating that this procedure would result in a
            non-therapeutic sterilization of "K" and that the
            benefits did not far outweigh the risks, the judge
            concluded that the court could review the decision of
            the parents to ensure that the parents' decision was in
            the best interests of the child, and that in reviewing
            the parents' decision, the court must consider three
            factors: (a) who should bear the onus of establishing
            that "K" will benefit from the proposed hysterectomy,
            (b) what standard of proof must be met, and (c) what
            factors must be considered by a court when reviewing
            such decisions.</p>

            <p>[para23] He concluded that a person seeking to give
            "substituted" consent to a non-therapeutic
            sterilization has the onus of demonstrating that the
            procedure is "in the best interests of the incompetent"
            because society "regards the right to security of the
            person to be of such fundamental importance to the
            well-being of all its members that the law must
            necessarily raise it as a presumption against anyone
            who would seek to give substituted authority for
            non-therapeutic medical treatment or surgery."</p>

            <p>[para24] Pointing out that our law recognized only
            two standards of proof - proof beyond a reasonable
            doubt in criminal matters and a preponderance of
            evidence in civil matters-Wood, J. opined that neither
            test was satisfactory in cases "where the imposition of
            involuntary measures for remedial, as opposed to
            punitive, purposes, clashes with the important personal
            rights described in s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and
            Freedoms" and concluded that the court should adopt a
            third or "middle" standard of proof in such cases,
            relying on the decision of the Supreme Court of the
            United States in Addington v. The State of Texas (1979)
            <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/441/418.html"
            target="_blank">441 U.S. 418</a>, which requires a
            parent not only to demonstrate that his decision is in
            the best interests of the child, but to demonstrate
            this conclusion "by clear and convincing evidence."</p>

            <p>I do, however, think that he erred in concluding
            that if the decision of the parents related to a
            non-therapeutic matter they had the onus of
            establishing to the satisfaction of the court that
            their decision was in the best interests of the child
            and that they only could discharge this onus by
            establishing this fact by "clear and convincing
            evidence." In setting this test, he rejected the views
            of Cartwright, J. in Smith v. Smith and Smedman, [1952]
            2 S.C.R. 312 at 331 that in a civil proceeding the
            tribunal must be "reasonably satisfied" of the proof of
            the fact in issue and whether it will be so satisfied
            "must depend on the totality of the circumstances on
            which its judgment is formed including the gravity of
            the consequences of the finding." This Court has
            referred to this judgment on other occasions, e.g. see
            Adolph v. Adolph (1964), 51 W.W.R. 42; Warnock v.
            Garrigan (1978), 8 B.C.L.R. 26. In Smith v. Smith and
            Smedman, Cartwright, J. said at page 331-2:</p>

            <p>"It is usual to say that civil cases may be proved
            by a preponderance of evidence or that a finding in
            such cases may be made upon the basis of a
            preponderance of probability and I do not propose to
            attempt a more precise statement of the rule. I wish,
            however, to emphasize that in every civil action before
            the tribunal can safely find the affirmative of an
            issue of fact required to be proved it must be
            reasonably satisfied, and that whether or not it will
            be so satisfied must depend upon the totality of the
            circumstances on which its judgment is formed including
            the gravity of the consequences of the finding."</p>

            <p>[para34] After hearing submissions from all counsel,
            we pointed out that members of this Court on previous
            occasions had expressed doubts about the power of the
            Court to grant a stay pending an appeal to the Supreme
            Court of Canada but stated that, even assuming that we
            had the power, we would not grant a stay because having
            concluded that it was in the best interests of the
            child to allow the parents to have the operation done
            we could not justify any further delay. We expressed
            the view that any further delay would be tantamount to
            dismissing the appeal.</p>

            <p>[para35] AIKINS J.A.: -- I have read the reasons for
            judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Craig and those
            prepared by Mr. Justice Anderson. I, like Mr. Justice
            Anderson, am in full agreement with Mr. Justice Craig's
            reasons for allowing the appeal. I agree generally with
            the reasons prepared by Mr. Justice Anderson.</p>

            <p>[para38] ANDERSON J.A.: -- I am in full agreement
            with the reasons for judgment of Craig J.A. but I wish
            to give additional reasons of my own. As the facts have
            been fully set out by Craig J.A. it is not necessary to
            repeat them here.</p>

            <p>[para73] I wish to emphasize that the rights of
            children under our constitution include the right to be
            protected against unnecessary pain and suffering and
            the right to forego other constitutional rights in
            order to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering.</p>

            (Ont. C.A.), Robins, J.A. stated at p. 327: "The
            doctrine [of informed consent] presupposes the
            patient's capacity to make a subjective treatment
            decision based on her understanding of the necessary
            medical facts provided by the doctor and on her
            assessment of her own personal circumstances."</p>

            <p>The Test for Determining How the Jurisdiction Should
            be Exercised. In Re Eve, LaForest, J. commented at p.
            295:</p>

            <p>"Though the scope or sphere of operation of the
            parens patriae jurisdiction may be unlimited, it by no
            means follows that the discretion to exercise it is
            unlimited. It must be exercised in accordance with its
            underlying principle. Simply put, the discretion is to
            do what is necessary for the protection of the person
            for whose benefit it is exercised ... The discretion is
            to be exercised for the benefit of that person, not for
            that of others. It is a discretion, too, that must at
            all times be exercised with great caution, a caution
            that must be redoubled as the seriousness of the matter
            increases."</p>

            <p>and again at p. 301 he emphasized that because of
            the importance of maintaining the physical integrity of
            a human being, the person advocating that the court
            should authorize a consent to medical treatment would
            have to justify that approach:</p>

            <p>"Since, barring emergency situations, a surgical
            procedure without consent ordinary constitutes battery,
            it would be obvious that the onus of proving the need
            for the procedure is on those who seek to have it
            performed. And that burden, though a civil one, must be
            commensurate with the seriousness of the measure
            proposed. In conducting these procedures, it is obvious
            that a court must proceed with extreme caution..."</p>

            <p>In considering s. 2 of the Charter one must keep in
            mind that the fundamental freedoms therein guaranteed
            have been somewhat more elaborately expressed than were
            the corresponding freedoms in the Canadian Bill of
            Rights. Both a textual comparison and a review of the
            evidence before the Special Joint Committee of the
            Senate and House of Commons on the Constitution,
            1981-82, confirm that the <a
            href="/library/ethics/UN-covenant/">International
            Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> was an
            important source of the terms chosen. Since Canada
            ratified that covenant in 1976, with the unanimous
            consent of the federal and provincial governments, the
            covenant constitutes an obligation upon Canada under
            international law, by art. 2 thereof, to implement its
            provisions within this country. Although our
            constitutional tradition is not that a ratified treaty
            is self-executing within our territory, but must be
            implemented by the domestic constitutional process
            (A.-G. Can. v. A.-G. Ont., [1937] 1 D.L.R. 673, [1937]
            A.C. 326, [1937] 1 W.W.R. 299 (Labour Conventions
            Case)), nevertheless, unless the domestic law is
            clearly to the contrary, it should be interpreted in
            conformity with our international obligations.</p>
