Dear Minister McLellan,

Thank you for introducing legislation to impose harsher penalties on those  
who abuse animals. Animal abuse is abhorrent, and must not be tolerated in a  
civilized society.

In addition to the questions I asked you in my letter of July 21, 1999, I  
would like to ask you one additional question:

4) Suppose someone were to take a newborn male puppy to the steps of the
  Parliament buildings in Ottawa; strap it down, force a blunt probe into the
  end of its penis, tear the adherent foreskin away from the glans, and
  amputate its foreskin.
  Could that person be charged with animal abuse for performing such an act?
  Would it make a difference whether or not the person used any kind of
  anaesthesia?

I look forward to reading your response to this question, in addition to my  
earlier questions. A copy of my prior letter is attached below, for your  
kind attention.

Sincerely yours,

Geoffrey T. Falk

>As far as I've been able to determine, there is no apparent law or

>While not all circumcisions are compelled on children for frivolous
>or punitive reasons, the possibility of that happening may also exist.

>Here are my questions:

>1) Is there a policy to regulate genital cutting of male minors,
>   or are there plans to enact such a policy? If not, why not?
>
>2) In terms of the  right to security of the person  as recognized

>   distinction that would make forcible circumcision of an infant
>   constitutional, and forcible circumcision of a 17-year-old boy
>   unconstitutional? If so, at what age is a distinction made?
>
>3) As far as I can tell, there is no legal distinction between
>   genital cutting of male minors as performed by a licensed
>   physician, an unlicensed third party (for example, a Jewish
>   mohel or a Muslim cleric), or by an untrained individual.
>   Is this interpretation correct?

>The Federal government enacted a separate law to protect all minor
>females against genital cutting customs (mild to severe).
