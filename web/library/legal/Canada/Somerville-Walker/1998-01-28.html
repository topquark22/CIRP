            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear Dr. Walker,</p>

            <p>Thank you for your letter of December 12, 1997. My
            delay in replying rises from the fact that I have been
            in Australia for the last month. As I am sure you will
            understand, the backlog of work is very heavy,
            consequently, I will only reply very briefly.</p>

            <p>All woundings are criminal assault unless they can
            be justified. The burden of proof of justification is
            on the person who causes the wounding. A therapeutic
            aim is the justification for almost all medical
            wounding and is an essential justification for those
            unable to consent to the wounding for themselves.
            Consequently, a physician would need to show that
            infant male circumcision was medically necessary before
            it would be justified. If there is equal doubt as to
            whether or not it is medically necessary (which seems
            to me to be the most favourable position that, at
            present, could be taken in favour of infant male
            circumcision), then the procedure must not be carried
            out.</p>

            <p>In other words, in situations of equal doubt, the
            person with the burden of proof (the physician) cannot
            proceed. In short, all woundings that are more than de
            minimis harms, which circumcision certainly is, are
            criminal assault unless they are justified and the only
            possible justification for non-religious infant male
            circumcision is medical justification. The issue which
            remains is whether the law will recognize profound
            religious belief on the part of a child's parents as a
            sufficient justification for a non-medical wounding.
            That question has not been addressed in the courts.</p>

            <p>You raise the issue of cosmetic surgery and whether
            this constitutes criminal assault. Cosmetic surgery can
            only be carried out provided two conditions are
            present. First, the intervention must not be contrary
            to public policy. (You should note that this is also
            true of therapeutic interventions, but there is a
            presumption that necessary therapeutic procedures
            carried out by properly qualified medical practitioners
            are not contrary to public policy). I have no doubt
            that adult male circumcision would not be considered
            contrary to public policy. In other words, it is not
            something that would, in itself, be prohibited. Second,
            a non-therapeutic intervention such as cosmetic surgery
            is only legally justified with the voluntary and
            informed consent of the person who undergoes the
            intervention. Infants cannot give such a consent,
            adults can. Whether "mature minors" can consent to
            non-therapeutic interventions (they can consent to
            therapeutic ones) is a debated question. If you wanted
            to read further about the legitimization of
            non-therapeutic medical procedures, you could see my
            1980 article <a
            href="/library/legal/somerville/">Medical Interventions
            and the Criminal Law: Lawful or Excusable Wounding</a>
            (McGill Law Journal), in which I considered the
            difficulties that we were facing, at the time, in
            legitimating the medical intervention that we undertook
            on live organ donors. Initially, taking, for example, a
            kidney from a live organ donor, was regarded as a
            criminal assault. We later justified this on the
            grounds that the person was a competent, consenting,
            adult and that the intervention itself, provided that
            the kidney was to be used to save the life of another
            person, was not contrary to public policy. It should be
            noted, however, that say, for instance, one wanted to
            remove a person's kidney simply for research purposes,
            this would not fall within the public policy
            legitimization (I am assuming here that there is no
            therapeutic reason for the person involved, to have his
            or her kidney removed).</p>

            <p>I believe that if you re-read the <a
            href="/news/ottawacitizen10-17-97/"
            target="_blank"><i>Ottawa Citizen</i> article</a>, you
            will find that the word "technically" is used in
            conjunction with the words criminal assault. It was not
            used in the title, but was used in the body of the
            article.</p>

            <p>Finally, you seem to think that interventions become
            ethical or unethical according to whether the person
            carrying them out believes they are or are not acting
            ethically. That is not correct. While following the
            dictates of one's conscience is necessary for good
            ethics, it is not sufficient. There are many people who
            believe that female genital mutilation is ethical and
            yet we Canadians decided very recently to prohibit this
            using our strongest political and policy tool, the
            criminal law.</p>

            <p>With kind regards.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>[signed]</p>
