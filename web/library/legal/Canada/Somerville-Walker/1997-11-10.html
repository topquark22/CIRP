      <p>Dr. C. Robin Walker<br />
       Chief, Division of Neonatology<br />
       Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario<br />
       401 Smyth Street<br />
       Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8L1</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. Walker,</p>

      <p>I have received a copy of your letter of November 5, 1997
      to Mr. Dennis Harrison.</p>

      <p>First, let me say that I thought your comments on infant
      circumcision, as reported in the press, were excellent. Some
      of those in your letter surprise me, however, in view of
      these press reports.</p>

      <p>Second, I would like to explain my use&mdash;with which
      you appear to disagree&mdash;of the words <i>criminal</i> and
      <i>unethical</i> in relation to infant male circumcision. If
      you read the <i>Ottawa Citizen</i> article, you will see that
      I said that infant male circumcision undertaken for
      non-medical reasons was <i>"technically criminal
      assault"</i>. This is correct. All wounding of one person by
      another person is <i>prima facie</i> criminal assault
      (indeed, aggravated criminal assault), but it can become
      justified&mdash;that is, not illegal, not a crime&mdash;on
      certain conditions. The most common and important situation
      in which wounding is not a criminal assault, is when it is
      indicated as medically required surgery and it is undertaken
      with the informed consent of the person on whom it is carried
      out or, if this person is incompetent, of their legal
      representative (in the case of children, the parents). The
      difficulty with infant male circumcision is that when it is
      <b>not</b> medically indicated&mdash;the Canadian Paediatric
      Society, for instance, has stated it is not medically
      indicated as a routine procedure&mdash;medical justification
      is not present and, although adults can consent to have a
      non- therapeutic intervention carried out on themselves
      provided the intervention is not considered to be contrary to
      public policy, in general, they may not consent to having
      such interventions carried out on their children. The
      exception to this is if the intervention is considered to be
      what the law calls <i>de minimis</i>, that is, a trifle of
      which the law will not take notice. Arguably, ear-piercing,
      especially as it is reversible, falls within this category.
      However, even the rabbis with whom I talked agreed that male
      infant circumcision is not <i>de minimis</i>. (For your
      information I am enclosing copies of correspondence with two
      Ministers of Justice <i>[<a
      href="/library/legal/Canada/Somerville-Campbell/">1</a>, <a
      href="/library/legal/Canada/Somerville-Blais/">2</a>]</i>
      that set out the above legal analysis in slightly more
      detail). What we are faced with here then, is the question of
      whether profound religious belief justifies infant male
      circumcision within the criminal law. There are examples of
      religious belief providing justifiable exceptions to the law
      e.g. Quakers who are pacifists being exempt from
      conscription. But even if such an exemption is allowed, it
      would not apply to justify parents consenting to circumcision
      of their child other than for religious belief.</p>

      <p>As to whether it is unethical for a physician to carry out
      male circumcision, that depends on a medical ethics analysis.
      I am attaching a copy of a <a
      href="/library/ethics/somerville1/">letter</a> which Dr.
      David Alwin and I wrote to <i>The New England Journal of
      Medicine</i>, which raises this issue. If, as Taddio <i>et
      al</i>. state in one of their articles, it is "barbaric" to
      carry out male infant circumcision without anaesthesia, and
      it seems a reasonably intrusive intervention in the form of a
      penile nerve block is required for adequate anaesthesia, is
      it ethical for physicians to be undertaking such a procedure
      for <b>non-medical</b> reasons? Moreover, is it ethical for
      physicians to permanently change the physical integrity of a
      child who cannot consent for himself, when this is not
      medically necessary? We also need to keep in mind that the
      physician has the burden of proof to show that a "wounding"
      is justified. Therefore, contrary to the statements in your
      letter that <i>"until there is general agreement throughout
      the medical profession that the procedure is unwarranted and
      indeed that the performance of the procedure is
      inappropriate"</i>, the converse is the case. Physicians
      should not do this procedure unless they can show it is
      ethical and legal to do so. Likewise, your statement
      <i>"[m]oreover, until such time as the law is amended,
      parents do in Canada continue to have the right to make
      choices on behalf of their children"</i>, is not correct as I
      have explained above. The present law would prohibit
      circumcision on a child unless the persons consenting to this
      and the physician carrying it out can show that it is
      justified. In this respect a judgment of the Supreme Court of
      Canada, in <a
      href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1995/1995rcs1-315/1995rcs1-315.html"
       target="_blank"><i>Re Sheena B</i></a>, is also of interest.
      The court distinguishes parents' rights to practice their
      religion with respect to themselves and with respect to their
      children. There can be limits imposed in the latter respect
      that would not apply to the parents' practice concerning
      themselves.</p>

      <p>As to the comparison between male and female circumcision,
      you are correct that in the great majority of cases, female
      genital mutilation is vastly more destructive and harmful
      than male circumcision. However, from a legal and medical
      ethics point of view, the same basic issues are raised.
      Indeed, the reason that I got into a discussion with Sharon
      Kirkey about infant male circumcision, was that she phoned me
      to ask about the ethics that governed an obstetrician who had
      delivered a child from an infibulated woman, who was
      requesting that the infibulation be reconstituted after the
      delivery. Apparently, under current Ontario guidelines, it is
      considered unethical for a physician to reconstruct the
      infibulation, even for a competent consenting adult woman.
      Indeed to do so may well fall under the recent amendment to
      the Criminal Code prohibiting <b>any</b> surgical
      interference with female genitalia, no matter how minor,
      except for medical reasons.</p>

      <p>Finally, I would point out that as I stated in <i>The New
      England Journal of Medicine</i> and as I was reported as
      saying in the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/news/ottawacitizen10-17-97/"
      target="_blank"><i>Ottawa Citizen</i> article</a>, we have
      not yet considered whether profound religious belief will by
      itself constitute a justification for carrying out infant
      male circumcision. The point is that we should face this
      question directly and not under the cover of a medical
      fa&ccedil;ade. You are obviously an expert with respect to
      whether male infant circumcision is medically required, and
      have far greater knowledge about this than I do, but I am
      surprised from the research that I have done recently on the
      medical literature on this topic, that you are as uncertain
      as you appear to be in your letter to Mr. Harrison as to
      whether or not routine infant male circumcision is medically
      indicated.</p>
