          <p><tt>The Honourable Pierre Blais<br />
           Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada<br />
           Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0H8</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Dear Minister,</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I am in receipt of a <a
          href="/library/legal/Canada/Campbell-Somerville/">letter</a>
          of December 15, 1992, from the former Minister of
          Justice, the Honourable A. Kim Campbell, regarding infant
          circumcision, a matter on which we have been in
          correspondence. With respect, this letter has not
          assisted me in finding a clear justification for male
          infant circumcision---in fact, it raises further
          difficulties. My comments in this letter are in response
          to statements in the Honourable Kim Campbell's
          letter.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Whether or not an act which "technically" offends
          the <a
          href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
          target="_blank">Criminal Code</a> will be prosecuted
          under it, depends on whether, first, the act in question
          falls within what we would regard as a social exception.
          An act that is considered to be contrary to public policy
          cannot be justified pursuant to its being regarded as a
          social exception and any act that involves more than de
          minimis harm is likely to offend public policy, unless it
          is otherwise justified, for instance, a therapeutic aim
          is involved and there is informed consent. In short,
          social exception and de minimis harm are linked
          concepts.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>The statement in the Minister's letter that
          "deliberately hitting someone is illegal but deliberately
          bumping into them on the bus is not illegal" can be
          queried. Usually, deliberately bumping into a person on
          the bus would prima facie be an assault (unintentionally
          doing so is almost certainly within a social exception).
          But whether or not such an assault would be prosecuted is
          a matter of whether the harm involved is so de minimis
          that it does not merit prosecution, which is often the
          case. Therefore, this example is not analogous to infant
          circumcision (and does not indicate whether or not this
          constitutes an offence, and if so, whether or not it
          should be prosecuted), if the latter involves more than
          de minimis harm.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>The Minister refers in her letter to my <a
          href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/somerville/">article</a>
          in the <i>McGill Law Journal</i> in which I suggest, in
          the conclusion, that some non-therapeutic interventions
          on competent adult persons, which in practice are not
          considered contrary to public policy (donations of organs
          for transplantation or cosmetic surgery), despite their
          involving more than de minimis harm, could be justified
          by regarding informed consent and therapeutic aim as
          alternative rather than cumulative justifications of them
          within the Criminal Code. Contrary to the way in which
          the Minister may, from her letter, have interpreted my
          proposal, this would mean that for those incompetent to
          consent for themselves, which necessarily includes all
          infants, a non-therapeutic intervention that involves
          more than de minimis harm would not fall within any
          exception justifying it within the Criminal Code. This,
          of course, is exactly the difficulty faced with respect
          to justification of male circumcision. In the vast
          majority of cases, this is not generally regarded as
          therapeutic, except possibly at a very tenuous level.
          Indeed, opponents of male circumcision regard it as the
          antithesis of therapy.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Further, with respect, I disagree that male
          circumcision involves only de minimis harm, as the
          Minister indicates in her letter. An analogous example
          may make this clear. let us suppose that there is a new
          group in Canada which decides that, shortly after birth,
          the right earlobe of all children born into the group
          will be removed in order to identify them as belonging to
          that group. I believe that this would be prohibited under
          our Criminal Code as it currently stands. It would
          involve more than de minimis harm and as such it would
          not fall within any social exception and would be
          regarded as contrary to public policy. It would be an
          assault with wounding which was not justified by any
          therapeutic aim, the only justification which would seem
          to be potentially relevant. And, yet, this procedure may
          well be less harmful to the children subjected to it than
          is male circumcision to the children subjected to that,
          which indicates that de minimis harm is not an
          appropriate justification of male circumcision.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>There is and needs to be a great deal of sympathy
          for the maintenance of tradition and for freedom of
          religious belief (and clearly male circumcision is very
          strongly connected with both of these concerns). But we
          need to be very careful about our justification of it
          and, concurrently, our condemnation of female
          circumcision (with which condemnation I strongly agree),
          if we are not to run the risk of acting in an inherently
          inconsistent manner and simply on the basis that what we
          have always done is acceptable (because we have always
          done this) and that customs and traditions which are
          strange to us (but which may [be] no more harmful or less
          harmful than those we accept) are unacceptable.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Over the years, because of my work in medicine,
          ethics and law, I have been approached on numerous
          occasions about the issue of male infant circumcision. I
          am finding it more and more difficult to justify this. In
          particular, the allegation that it constitutes child
          abuse needs to be taken very seriously, and I do not find
          it easy to explain why this is not the case. Further, in
          this respect we need to be aware of recent research that
          shows that pain caused to infants (and this is true of
          all those unable to describe verbally their pain) is
          grossly under-rated. Moreover, under the analysis of the
          law which I propose in my article, and to which the
          Minister refers in her letter, <span class="yellow">male
          circumcision would not be totally banned. Rather
          circumcision of those persons unable to consent for
          themselves (which would, of course, include all infants)
          would not be allowed under the Criminal Code as it
          presently stands.</span></tt></p>
