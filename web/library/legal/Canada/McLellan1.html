Dear Minister McLellan,

I am writing with some questions that I have concerning the practice
of male circumcision in Canada.

As far as I've been able to determine, there is no apparent law or
guideline that restricts a parent or guardian from compelling
circumcision upon their male child, from birth to 18 years. Most
circumcisions of minors lack a specific medical indication.

While not all circumcisions are compelled on children for frivolous
or punitive reasons, the possibility of that happening may also exist.

Here are my questions:

1) Is there a policy to regulate genital cutting of male minors,
   or are there plans to enact such a policy? If not, why not?

2) In terms of the  right to security of the person  as recognized
   in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is there any
   distinction that would make forcible circumcision of an infant
   constitutional, and forcible circumcision of a 17-year-old boy
   unconstitutional? If so, at what age is a distinction made?

3) As far as I can tell, there is no legal distinction between
   genital cutting of male minors as performed by a licensed
   physician, an unlicensed third party (for example, a Jewish
   mohel or a Muslim cleric), or by an untrained individual.
   Is this interpretation correct?

The Federal government enacted a separate law to protect all minor
females against genital cutting customs (mild to severe).

Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your
response.

                                Sincerely yours,

                                  [signed]

                                Geoffrey T. Falk, BSc., MA
