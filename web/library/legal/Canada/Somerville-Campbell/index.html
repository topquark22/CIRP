          <p class="sig"><tt>McGill<br />
           June 10, 1992</tt></p>

          <p><tt>The Honourable A. Kim Campbell<br />
           Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada<br />
           Ottawa, Ontario K1A OH8</tt></p>

          <p><tt>Dear Minister,</tt></p>

          <p><tt>I have been sent a copy of your letter, dated May
          6, 1992, to Dr. Tom Anderson concerning the legality of
          both male and female circumcision.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>This is a matter which has been brought to my
          attention on several occasions and with much greater
          frequency of late. I have, also, in the past, adopted the
          position taken in your letter--that male circumcision
          should be regarded as legal and female circumcision as
          illegal, in particular, under the Criminal Code--but, I
          have some difficulty in explaining this position and do
          not find that this difficulty is resolved by your letter.
          Your letter states that "there are no federal or
          provincial laws dealing expressly with the legality of
          male circumcision," and, at least implies that,
          therefore, this procedure is legal. But the same is true
          for female circumcision and, yet, as your letter, rightly
          states, this would be considered illegal under the <a
          href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
          target="_blank">Criminal Code</a>.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>May I suggest that any wounding, and clearly
          circumcision involves this, is "prima facie" illegal,
          unless it can be justified. Initially, a therapeutic aim
          was the sole justification for such an intervention. More
          recently, it has been argued an alternative justification
          is possible, in that, some non-therapeutic interventions
          (those that are not contrary to public policy) are legal
          with the informed consent of an adult (for the record, I
          have written on this elsewhere, see Somerville, "<a
          href="/library/legal/somerville/"><i>Medical
          Interventions and the Criminal Law: Lawful or Excusable
          Wounding?</i></a>" (1980) 26 McGill Law Journal, (1)
          82-96).</tt></p>

          <p><tt>In the case of a male infant such consent is not a
          possibility, and neither, in the vast majority of cases,
          could the intervention be considered therapeutic. This
          means that one would have to find other justification for
          the intervention. The only possibility, which comes to
          mind, would be that the harm involved is de minimis and,
          therefore, should not to be taken into account by the
          law. I am not sure, however that we can any longer claim
          this with regard to male circumcision. Possibly, an
          argument along the lines of respect for religious and
          cultural freedom of the parents provided that the
          intervention is, indeed, of minimal harm, could be
          considered. But again, I am uncertain that this would
          justify wounding that involves irreversible consequences,
          and the issue remains of whether only minimal harm is
          involved.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>There are also some forms of female circumcision,
          which would be no more harmful than male circumcision,
          and, possibly, less harmful. However, I agree with you
          that these, also, should be prohibited. But in this case,
          it makes it even more difficult to determine why we would
          continue to regard male circumcision as legal and allow
          it.</tt></p>

          <p><tt>As I have many inquiries on this matter and
          because I have also, been receiving a great deal of
          literature from groups who are opposed to male
          circumcision, I would be grateful for any help that your
          Department were able to provide me with, regarding this
          matter.</tt></p>

          <p class="sig"><tt>Yours sincerely,<br />
