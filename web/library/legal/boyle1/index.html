        <p><cite>Although a number of Australian jurisdictions have
        acted to outlaw female genital cutting, equal protection
        under the law has not yet been afforded to unconsenting
        minors who happen to be boys. In light of Marion's Case
        (Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB
        (1992) <a
        href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
         target="_blank">175 CLR 218</a>), it is now evident that
        parents cannot provide legal consent for an irreversible,
        non-therapeutic circumcision. Moreover, there are no
        medical indications for neonatal circumcision (Australasian
        Association of Paediatric Surgeons, <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aaps/">Guidelines
        for Circumcision</a> (1996)). Consequently, enforced or
        involuntary circumcision must now be considered as an
        assault causing grievous bodily harm (genital mutilation).
        Legal action is long overdue in Australia to protect the
        physical and sexual integrity of male minors.</cite></p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p class="text2">Genital cutting of females, called
        circumcision or female genital mutilation, has raised
        outcries of horror. Proscribed by statute in New South
        Wales and Victoria, it is also illegal under general laws
        in most other States and many other jurisdictions.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> Female
        genital mutilation constitutes a common law assault.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> Any doctor
        who performs female genital mutilation in Australia, even
        with parental consent, or the consent of the female
        herself, is liable to prosecution, either under the
        legislation that specifically prohibits it in certain
        jurisdictions, or under the general assault provisions in
        common law.</p>

        <p class="text2">Yet, to date, destructive genital cutting
        of males, called circumcision or male genital mutilation,
        has escaped concerted censure. Despite a continuing
        reduction over recent years, thousands of healthy
        Australian baby boys are circumcised annually. Medicare
        figures for 1997-1998 reveal almost 20,000 fee-for-service
        circumcisions on boys, excluding public patients and those
        outside the medical system.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> While rare in Scandinavia and
        Europe, circumcision also is common in North America.
        United Kingdom circumcision rates declined dramatically
        once it was no longer covered by the National Health
        Service. The United States rate has declined from 90 to 60
        per cent in recent years. In Australia, circumcision
        surgery is still imposed on approximately 10 to 15 per cent
        of healthy boys.</p>

        <p class="text2">The general rule in English criminal law,
        and reflected in other common law jurisdictions, is that
        any application of force, no matter how slight, is prima
        facie an assault. Consent serves as a defence to assaults
        that do not inflict actual bodily harm. Exceptions to the
        general prohibition on assaults causing bodily harm include
        medical treatment. Lord Templeman's remark in the House of
        Lords case of <cite>R v Brown</cite> (involving consensual
        sado-masochism) that ritual circumcision is lawful<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> is much
        cited by circumcision advocates. Those who rely on Lord
        Templeman do not take adequate account of the difference
        between the ratio decidendi of a case and an obiter dictum.
        <a href="http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/homepage.htm">The English
        Law Commission</a> did not cite Lord Templeman or any other
        case as authority. The legal effect of <cite>R v
        Brown</cite> and the English Law Commission's views has
        been analysed elsewhere.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">The Queensland Law Reform Commission,
        relying heavily on <cite><a
        href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
         target="_blank">Department of Health and Community
        Services v JWB and SMB</a></cite>,<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> noted:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;The circumcision procedure is invasive,
            irreversible and major. It involves the removal of an
            otherwise healthy organ part. It has serious attendant
            risks.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n7">7</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">According to the Queensland Law Reform
        Commission:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;The common law operating in Queensland appears
            to be that if a young person is unable, through lack of
            maturity or other disability, to give effective consent
            to a proposed procedure and if the nature of the
            proposed treatment is invasive, irreversible and major
            surgery and for non-therapeutic purposes, then court
            approval is required... The basis of this attitude is
            the respect ... [for] ... an individual's bodily
            integrity ... unless there are immediate health
            benefits to a particular child from circumcision, it is
            unlikely that the procedure itself could be considered
            as therapeutic.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n8">8</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Is infant circumcision advantageous?</h3>

        <p class="text2">A variety of claims as to lack of pain,
        minimal risk, absence of harm, no ill-effect on pleasure
        and/or function, and so-called benefits from routine
        circumcision are frequently made. However, the burden of
        proof of substantiating these claims lies on those who
        would pick up a knife to amputate normal, healthy and
        functional anatomy (&ldquo;he who avers, proves&rdquo;).
        The medical evidence is that the claims made by
        circumcision advocates are controverted by the facts.
        Rationalisations for male genital cutting include claims
        about hygiene, prevention of genital cancers, urinary tract
        infections (UTIs), and of AIDS. However, overwhelming
        epidemiological evidence exists to the contrary. In its
        letter of 16 February 1996, representatives of the American
        Cancer Society stated unambiguously that circumcision
        should not be recommended for preventing penile or cervical
        cancer:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;The American Cancer Society does not consider
            routine circumcision to be a valid or effective measure
            to prevent such cancers... Research suggesting a
            pattern in the circumcision status of partners of women
            with cervical cancer is methodologically flawed,
            outdated, and has not been taken seriously in the
            medical community for decades... Penile cancer is an
            extremely rare condition, affecting one in 200,000
            men... Perpetrating the mistaken belief that
            circumcision prevents cancer is
            inappropriate.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n9">9</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Furthermore, contrary to the claims of
        circumcision advocates, circumcision does not protect
        against sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS. In
        fact, the United States has both the highest rate of
        routine circumcision and AIDS in the developed world.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> Moreover,
        UTIs occur in only 1 to 2 per cent of boys, and are
        conservatively treated with antibiotics. Phimosis, unless
        it is the result of balanitis xerotica obliterans, an
        extremely rare condition, cannot be diagnosed prior to
        puberty, and then is easily treated using cortisone
        ointment and gentle stretching.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n11">11</a></sup></font> Circumcised men without the
        protection of a foreskin are at greater risk of many
        sexually transmitted diseases.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n12">12</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">Consequently, no national or international
        medical association in the modern industrialised world
        (including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the
        Australian Medical Association, the Australian College of
        Paediatrics, the Australasian Association of Paediatric
        Surgeons, the British Medical Association, or the Canadian
        Paediatric Society)<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n13">13</a></sup></font> endorses routine infant
        circumcision. In March 1999 the American Academy of
        Pediatrics concluded that &ldquo;the data are not
        sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
        circumcision&rdquo;.</p>

        <p class="text2">Nevertheless, the most recent American
        Academy of Pediatrics position statement on male genital
        mutilation failed to reflect the weight of the medical
        literature as to the harm of circumcision from
        complications and otherwise, including the damage to bodily
        and functional genital integrity.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> The statement also
        seriously misstated the thrust of articles such as that by
        &Oslash;ter,<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> and provided a misleading
        summary of purported benefits by inflating them. Its
        suggestion that EMLA cream is an acceptable and effective
        local anaesthetic for infant circumcision disregarded the
        manufacturer's contraindications that it not be used on
        genital skin or mucosa, as well as studies showing that
        EMLA provides only minimal pain relief.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></font>
        Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics statement
        provided no reasoned, or indeed any, argument for its
        assertion that &ldquo;it is legitimate for parents to take
        into account cultural, religious and ethnic
        traditions&rdquo;, and thus to subject an infant to this
        amputation. There is clear medical evidence of adverse
        effects from the pain, significant complications, and
        inevitable prejudice to genital function. There are no
        clearly demonstrable medical benefits.</p>

        <h3>Disadvantages of circumcision</h3>

        <p class="text2">During circumcision, the baby's sensitive
        foreskin is crushed audibly, and the raw flesh is cut with
        scissors. In all neonatal circumcisions, forceps or other
        probes are inserted into the delicate foreskin, scraping,
        tearing apart and destroying the normal erogenous tissues
        of the child's sex organ. This causes considerable pain and
        leaves the raw glans open to infections, with any resultant
        scar tissue on the glans further compromising sexual
        sensitivity. Tearing the normal protective adhesions
        between the glans and foreskin resembles ripping a
        fingernail from the quick. If a clamping method is used,
        the foreskin is crushed over a bell-shaped device, to
        enable amputation.</p>

        <p class="text2">Circumcision removes 50 per cent of penile
        skin and thousands of specialised nerve endings,
        fundamental to normal sexual response.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> The
        externalised glans and inner foreskin remnant become dried
        and skin-hardened (keratinised), further desensitising the
        penis, with progressive lifelong loss of sensation.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></font> Reduced
        sexual function and pleasure has been acknowledged for
        centuries, though circumcision proponents expediently deny
        this. Indeed, Maimonides wrote in the 12th century:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;The bodily injury caused to that organ is
            exactly that which is desired ... there is no doubt
            that circumcision weakens the power of sexual
            excitement.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n19">19</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Circumcision makes the achievement of
        orgasm more difficult, decreases its intensity, and impedes
        sexual satisfaction among circumcised men and their female
        partners, thereby reducing or constraining
        <cite>both</cite> male and female sexuality.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></font>
        Complications, including an estimated 229 deaths each year
        in the United States alone,<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n21">21</a></sup></font> range up to 55 per cent
        depending on the definition applied, and willingness to
        report complications fully and accurately (for example,
        meatal stenosis, urethral fistula, penile necrosis,
        accidental amputation of part or all of the glans, skin
        tags).<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n22">22</a></sup></font> Since genital integrity is
        always destroyed, and sexual function is always
        compromised, the true complication rate of circumcision is
        in reality 100 per cent.</p>

        <p class="text2">One Australian paediatrician stated that
        he had seen two infant deaths during circumcision.
        &ldquo;That's rare, but not to the parents of the little
        kid that died.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> In Texas, a five-year-old
        boy died following circumcision complications.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></font> In Miami a
        boy bled to death after circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> Yet another
        circumcision-related death recently occurred in
        Cleveland.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n26">26</a></sup></font> Sometimes, the entire penis
        is lost, and several boys have undergone gender
        reassignment (often unacceptable to the victim) resulting
        from this tragedy.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n27">27</a></sup></font> In Seattle, to save his
        life, one baby's <a
        href="http://www.infocirc.org/fourn.htm">penis was denuded,
        his scrotum completely removed, and his skin from his
        thighs up to his navel had to be excised</a> to stop
        gangrene spreading from his circumcision wound.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> A British
        man suffered &ldquo;appalling injuries&rdquo; to his penis
        from an operation to repair the defects from his
        circumcision. The case was settled with payment in excess
        of &pound;UK800,000.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n29">29</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">Circumcision causes behavioural and
        neurological changes, diminished self-esteem and body
        image, sexual deficits, and often lifelong
        circumcision-related stress.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n30">30</a></sup></font> Many men see themselves as
        deformed or harmed by male genital mutilation, causing
        enduring psychological damage.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> Many circumcised men suffer
        ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">Psychologically, circumcision may be
        perceived as aggression and castration, weakening the ego,
        disturbing sexual identification, and initiating
        regression, withdrawal and isolation. Some reported

        <h3>Involuntary circumcision violates human rights</h3>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case against
        circumcision of children was strengthened by Australia's
        1990 ratification of the <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">United
        Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. Ratified
        by every country in the world except the United States and
        Somalia, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
        Child safeguards the child's right to autonomy and bodily
        integrity - rights violated by neonatal male circumcision.
        Several Articles support the position that circumcision
        breaches fundamental human rights:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Article 19 provides that states shall take all
          appropriate measures &ldquo;to protect the child from all
          forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse,
          neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or
          exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care
          of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who
          has the care of the child&rdquo;.</li>

          <li>Article 24(3) urges &ldquo;abolishing traditional
          practices prejudicial to the health of
          children&rdquo;.</li>

          <li>Article 6(2) safeguards the survival and development
          of the child. Article 36 protects children against all
          forms of exploitation prejudicial to their welfare - a
          right violated when biotissue corporations use foreskins
          harvested from unconsenting defenceless infants - to
          produce profitable artificial skin products.<font
          size="2"><sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup></font></li>

          <li>Article 37(a) in part states:<br />
           &ldquo;No child shall be subjected to torture or other
          cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or
          punishment.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text2">The following human rights treaties
        applicable in Australia also prohibit male genital
        mutilation based on such critical rights as the right to
        bodily integrity, the right to freedom of religion, the
        right to the highest attainable standard of health, the
        right to protection against torture, and the right to equal
        protection:</p>

        <p class="text2">Official acknowledgment of circumcision as
        a human rights violation is growing. Germany awarded
        political asylum to a Turkish man based on his fear of
        enforced circumcision:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;There may be ... no doubt that a circumcision
            which has taken place against the will of the person
            affected shows ... a violation of his physical and
            psychological integrity which is of significance to
            asylum.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n41">41</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Two United Nations reports recognise
        sexual assault on males, including circumcision, as torture
        and a violation of human rights.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n42">42</a></sup></font></p>

        <h3>Discriminatory prohibition of female genital mutilation
        violates human rights</h3>

        <p class="text2">Countries which proscribe even the mildest
        forms of female circumcision - which may involve only a
        nick to the clitoris and/or excision of the female prepuce
        (Type 1) - but permit infant male circumcision - involving
        surgical amputation of the entire foreskin - are failing to
        provide equal protection of the right to bodily integrity
        for male minors. Laws against female genital mutilation,
        which do not simultaneously prohibit male genital
        mutilation, contravene principles of equal protection
        enshrined in human rights law. They directly conflict with
        Art 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
        states:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;All are equal before the law and are entitled
            without any discrimination to equal protection of the
            law. All are entitled to equal protection against any
            discrimination in violation of the Declaration and
            against any incitement to such discrimination.&rdquo;
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Likewise, these nations contravene Art 2
        of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art 2 of the
        Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Arts 1(3), and
        55(c) of the United Nations Charter. All United Nations
        members are bound by these and all Charter provisions.
        Therefore, a human rights violation occurs when males are
        not afforded protection from genital mutilation, a
        protection enjoyed by females. As in the United States,
        where litigation frequently challenges legislation that
        violates equal protection, Australian anti-discrimination
        legislation offers a potential weapon against male
        circumcision.</p>

        <p class="text2">One frequent rationalisation for
        legislation addressing only female genital mutilation is
        the supposedly dramatic contrast in severity between female
        genital mutilation and male genital mutilation. However,
        circumcision removes a considerable area of erogenous
        penile skin (an area corresponding to 64 to 90 sq cm in
        adult males),<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n43">43</a></sup></font> causing significant damage.
        Human rights principles discourage the creation of
        hierarchies of rights and the ignoring of abuses which are
        placed lower in those hierarchies. Human rights principles
        are absolute, not subject to balancing in the scales of
        international justice relative to other violations.
        Interpretations of human rights law which recognise female
        genital mutilation but not male genital mutilation as
        violations infringe on equal protection principles
        enshrined in international law.</p>

        <h3>Medical attitudes</h3>

        <p class="text2">Given the serious harm caused by
        circumcision and the lack of medical justification, doctors
        should have profound reservations about performing
        destructive surgery that manifestly offends the Hippocratic
        Oath (&ldquo;First Do No Harm&rdquo;). The Australasian
        Association of Paediatric Surgeons concluded that there are
        no medical indications for neonatal circumcision, and that
        enforced circumcision is an affront to bodily integrity.
        Likewise, the Australian College of Paediatrics stated that
        &ldquo;routine circumcision may contravene human rights ...
        because circumcision is performed on a minor and without
        proven medical benefit&rdquo;.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n44">44</a></sup></font> The New South Wales Health
        Commission concluded that there is &ldquo;no valid medical
        indication for circumcision in the neonatal
        period&rdquo;.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n45">45</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">The Nuffield Committee stated:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Gratuitous injury, that is injury that is not
            undertaken in order to avoid destruction, damage or
            degradation, remains unacceptable. This point is
            sometimes blurred by an assumption that it is the
            therapeutic context which licenses what would otherwise
            be injury. In fact it is more precisely the therapeutic
            intent rather than the therapeutic context that
            justifies action that otherwise would be seen as
            injury... Gratuitous and in particular malicious injury
            of human beings, and specifically human tissue, will
            always be unacceptable, especially when inflicted in a
            therapeutic context... Treatment given by those who are
            medical practitioners will be acceptable only if guided
            by a therapeutic intention.&rdquo;<font
            size="2"><sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Notwithstanding this, some Australian
        medical doctors continue to benefit financially from
        Medicare's continued reimbursement of non-therapeutic
        genital cutting. Some are demonstrably vehement about
        continuing mutilation, raising questions as to their
        psychological motives.</p>

        <p class="text2">Increasing numbers of medical personnel,
        however, have refused to participate in male genital
        mutilation, given its blatant violation of human rights.
        Some nurses have vowed not to participate, even if
        circumcision were somehow rendered painless, because it
        causes mutilation without the victim's informed
        consent.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n47">47</a></sup></font></p>

        <h3>Cultural blindness</h3>

        <p class="text2">Like others, judges base their decisions
        in part on society's almost unconscious biases and cultural
        prejudices. Historically, various horrors have been
        overlooked by Australian authorities, including the
        genocide of Tasmanian Aborigines, the more or less routine
        sterilisation of allegedly mentally defective adolescent
        girls, and the patronising policies of former governments
        resulting in the great problem of the &ldquo;<a
        href="http://law.gov.au/flc/reports/sterilisation.html">stolen
        generations</a>&rdquo;.</p>

        <p class="text2">Cultural blindness worldwide has played a
        strong role in condoning body mutilation practices. While
        viewed with horror by other cultures, any mutilation is
        seen by the perpetrating culture as benign at worst; often
        it is misperceived as of positive benefit. Examples include
        footbinding, placing growing children in vases to shape
        their bones, and genital mutilation of both sexes.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></font></p>

        <h3>Growing resistance</h3>

        <p>Organised opposition to circumcision has been increasing
        dramatically in recent years, especially with the founding
        of the United States-based National Organisation to Halt
        the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males (<a
        href="http://www.noharmm.org/"
        target="_blank">NOHARMM</a>). In 1993, an Australian branch
        of the National Organisation of Circumcision Information
        Resource Centres (<a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
        target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>) was formed with the aim of
        eradicating the continuing enforced circumcision of many
        unconsenting minors. Profession-specific organisations have
        been founded by physicians, nurses and lawyers, including
        <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
        target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, <a
        href="http://childrightsnurses.org/" target="_blank">Nurses for
        the Rights of the Child</a>, and the United States-based
        Attorneys for the Rights of the Child which are all
        lobbying aggressively against involuntary circumcision.
        Pursuant to its avowed mission to help bring an end to all
        enforced genital cutting, <a href="http://www.arclaw.org/"
        target="_blank">Attorneys for the Rights of the Child</a>
        are singling out hospitals and doctors who perform
        non-therapeutic circumcisions, demanding that they halt all
        non-medically indicated sexual surgeries on minors.</p>

        <h3>Legal actions</h3>

        <p>Every doctor has two legal duties: first, to act with
        reasonable care; and secondly, to obtain consent from the
        patient, except in a life-threatening medical emergency.
        Failure to obtain informed consent renders any bodily
        intrusion an assault. When circumcisions have resulted in
        litigation, the cases have been fought on the grounds of
        negligence or lack of informed consent.</p>

        <p class="text2">In a 1987 New South Wales Supreme Court
        decision, $A27,500 damages were awarded for psychological
        harm caused by a negligently performed circumcision. In
        dismissing the defendant's appeal against the amount of the
        award, McHugh JA stated:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;In a society where sexuality is the subject of
            one of its dominant discourses, the plaintiff's
            perception of himself as sexually deformed and
            inadequate would ultimately force him to retreat from
            most, if not all, forms of social
            intercourse.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n49">49</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">In December 1999, a Western Australian
        doctor agreed to pay $A360,000 plus legal costs for
        performing an unnecessary routine neonatal circumcision
        which caused permanent physical and sexual harm and
        resultant psychological trauma.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n50">50</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">Also, action has been based on lack of
        informed consent. In Alabama, a newborn was circumcised
        against his mother's wishes, resulting in a verdict of
        US$65,000, and a similar case in New York is currently the
        subject of litigation.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n51">51</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">The Australasian Association of Paediatric
        Surgeons has issued guidelines regarding consent.<font
        size="2"><sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></font> Parents
        should have explained to them inherent risks and possible
        complications, such as severe pain, meatal stenosis, penile
        necrosis, lifelong sexual dysfunction, brain damage, and
        even death. The Queensland Law Reform Commission has warned
        that parents should be informed of all arguments relating
        to circumcision several days before the destructive
        surgical amputation.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n53">53</a></sup></font> It is highly unlikely that
        medical personnel comply with even this minimal mandate.
        This has very grave implications, as once the foreskin with
        its thousands of erogenous nerve endings and exquisitely
        sensitive frenulum has been severed, it can never be
        replaced. The infant victim has no say in the matter, and
        is forced to live with the adverse physical, reduced
        sexual, and psychological/post-traumatic stress disorder
        consequences for the remainder of his life.</p>

        <p class="text2">Grave doubt exists whether parental
        consent to a routine circumcision has ever been truly
        informed. Medical doctors rarely provide full information
        of all complications which may follow circumcision, and
        some explicitly advocate non-therapeutic circumcision. The
        American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that
        information conveyed to parents include: the provision of
        information, with explanations in understandable language,
        concerning the nature of the condition, the nature of the
        proposed &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;, the possibility of
        success, the nature of the risks, and the potential
        benefits and risks of alternative treatment, including no
        treatment at all;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the assessment of parents' understanding of the
          information;</li>

          <li>the assessment of parents' capacity to make the
          appropriate decision; and</li>

          <li>the assessment that there is freedom of choice,
          without coercion or manipulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text2">Compliance requires that full information
        be provided and that no pressure be placed on parents to
        assent to a circumcision. Doctors have a duty of care to
        inform parents fully of all risks and potential harmful
        effects. Failing to tell parents about the erogenous
        function of the foreskin is a serious act of omission. The
        minimum that doctors must tell parents is listed in the
        document entitled <cite><a
        href="http://www.informedconsent.org/circumcision.html">Informed
        Consent for Medically Necessary
        Circumcision</a></cite>.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n54">54</a></sup></font> This document, drafted by
        Illinois medical practitioner Eileen Wayne, MD, not only
        outlines the erogenous function of the foreskin, but also
        draws attention to the extremely rare reasons for medically
        necessary circumcision (never applicable during infancy).
        It outlines the &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; advocated for
        medically unnecessary circumcision (most circumcisions are
        medically unnecessary); the anatomy and functions of the
        foreskin (including sexual pleasure, lubricating, and
        gliding action); circumcision procedures; curable foreskin
        conditions; risks of circumcision (both short-term and
        long-term); ethical and legal considerations of enforced
        circumcision on unconsenting minors; and, finally, signed
        permission forms. It is clear from this ethically conceived
        document that parents can <cite>never</cite> give legal
        consent for medically unnecessary circumcisions on
        children.</p>

        <p class="text2">Even in the absence of legislation
        specifically banning circumcision, those who assist in the
        circumcision of a child without the patient's own fully
        informed consent are liable to prosecution. According to
        Price:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Lawyers in common law jurisdictions (England,

            conspiracy to assault and battery, child abuse, and

        Newborn babies cannot express a view on whether they should
        be circumcised. Circumcising children removes their choice
        for all time. Notably, the <a

         target="_blank"><cite>Human Tissue Act</cite> 1983</a>
        (NSW) explicitly recognised the child's right to withhold
        consent for any proposed removal and transplantation of a
        child's tissue(s).<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n60">60</a></sup></font></p>

        <p class="text2">Unless a medical procedure is necessary to
        preserve life or health, it should be postponed until the
        child is sufficiently mature to make a decision for himself
        or herself. If the child is incapable, because of
        intellectual disability, of making an informed decision,
        then under <cite>Marion's Case</cite> (involuntary
        hysterectomy of an intellectually handicapped 14-year-old
        girl), the consent of the Family Court or court exercising

            provide <cite>informed permission</cite> for diagnosis
            and treatment of children with the assent of the child
            whenever appropriate.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n62">62</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">They also concluded:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Thus, &lsquo;proxy consent&rsquo; poses serious
            problems for pediatric health care providers. Such
            providers have legal and ethical duties to their child
            patients to render competent medical care based on what
            the patient needs, not what someone else
            expresses.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p class="text2">Reasons for concern about infant male
        circumcision under human rights principles include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the loss of highly erogenous sexual tissue which also
          serves important protective functions;</li>

          <li>the loss of bodily integrity;</li>

          <li>traumatic and often highly painful
          disfigurement;</li>

          <li>complications including death and the loss of the
          entire penis;<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> and</li>

          <li>the impermissibility of any mutilation of children's
          genitals performed with neither their consent nor medical
          justification.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text2">No national or international medical
        association in the modern industrialised world, or indeed
        anywhere in the world, endorses routine circumcision of
        healthy boys.</p>

        <p class="text2">Several human rights documents tacitly
        forbid enforced infant circumcision. Non-therapeutic
        circumcision of unconsenting minors amounts to culturally
        sanctioned physical and sexual abuse. No basis in
        international human rights law or domestic law justifies
        the discriminatory prohibition of only female genital
        mutilation.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Ritual male circumcision is non-therapeutic and
            is not warranted or justified by medical evidence. This
            form of mutilation should not be legally distinguished
            from female circumcision ... presently being prohibited
            throughout Australia and the Western world. As ritual
            male circumcision is non-therapeutic, may be against
            public policy, and clearly is not in the best interests
            of the child, a parent's consent may be vitiated,
            leaving persons involved in the procedure liable in
            negligence, notwithstanding parental religious
            beliefs.&rdquo;<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n65">65</a></sup></font>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Non-therapeutic, invasive and irreversible
        major surgery, especially sexual reduction surgery on
        unconsenting minors, is unethical. The standard of care for
        infrequent events such as infections is antibiotics, not
        amputation. Circumcision of healthy male minors is useless
        and traumatic, causing severe and lasting harm physically,
        sexually and often psychologically. As medical ethicist
        Margaret Somerville pointed out:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Moreover, neonatal circumcision is done without
            consent of the subject, removes healthy tissue with
            unique anatomical structure and function, and leads to
            differences in adult sexual behaviour... We need,
            therefore, to address the issue directly and end the
            persistent efforts to find a medical rationale for
            circumcision by removing the cloak of medicine from
            this procedure.<font size="2"><sup><a
            href="#n66">66</a></sup></font>&rdquo;
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text2">Enforced non-therapeutic genital cutting
        of unconsenting minors is overdue for recognition by the
        legal community as sexual mutilation.<font size="2"><sup><a
        href="#n67">67</a></sup></font> As we enter the 21st
        Century, appropriate legal action must be taken to
        safeguard the physical genital integrity of male
        children.</p>
