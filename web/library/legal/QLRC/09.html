<B>9.    CONCLUSION</B>

      The common law operating in Queensland appears to be that if the
      young person is unable, through lack of maturity or other
      disability, to give effective consent to a proposed procedure
      and if the nature of the proposed treatment is invasive, ir-
      reversible and major surgery and for non-therapeutic purposes,
      then court approval is required before such treatment can pro-
      ceed.  The court will not approve the treatment unless it is
      necessary and in the young person's best interests.<SUP>132</SUP>  The
      basis of this attitude is the respect which must be paid to an
      individual's bodily integrity.

      Application can be made to the Family Court for approval of such
      treatment for young people.  The extent of the Family Court's
      jurisdiction in this regard has not been fully explored.

      Types of treatment which are most likely within the Family
      Court's jurisdiction include sterilisation, the turning off of
      life support, transplantation of organs for the benefit of a
      sibling, and the like.  Others are less clear.  For example - an
      obstetrician seeking approval by the Court for a Caesarean
      section in cases where the young mother would not consent to the
      procedure, applications in relation to the performance of
      cardiac surgery on children where parental consent has been
      refused, and applications in relation to profoundly handicapped
      neonates.  The Family Court has recently given its approval for
      a 14 year old child to undergo gender reassignment by the
      construction of male sexual organs.<SUP>133</SUP>  At birth, the child
      had been diagnosed as a female child with masculinisation of the
      genitalia.  The child had undergone genital reconstruction to
      give her a feminine appearance but received inadequate hormone
      replacement treatment.  Recurrent masculinisation of the child's
      physical structures had occurred with a charge in mental
      behaviour and attitude.  The child wanted to undergo the
      reassignment procedure but in this case the Court held that the
      child was not mature enough to understand the nature and con-
      sequences of the procedure.  As the procedure would require
      invasive, irreversible and major surgery, the child's parents
      could not consent - and Family Court approval was required.

      <font color="navy">[CIRP Note:  For a discussion of the legal issues in such a case
      see: <A HREF="../lebit/">Lynn E. Lebit</A>, <I>Compelled Medical Procedures Involving
      Minors and Incompetents and Misapplication of the Substituted
      Judgment Doctrine</I>, 7 Journal of Law and Health 107 (1992).]</font>

      If any surgical procedure to be performed on a child, whether
      `therapeutic' or `non-therapeutic' is not in the particular
      child's best interests, it cannot proceed.  Further, if the
      procedure is performed in an unskilled manner the person
      performing the procedure may be criminally as well as civilly
      liable for the consequences, irrespective of the validity of the
      consent obtained prior to the procedure.

      Unless there are immediate health benefits to a particular child
      from circumcision, it is unlikely that the procedure itself
      could be considered as therapeutic.

      Whether the procedure is within the best interests of any
      particular child will depend upon the circumstances of the
      particular case.  For example, adherence to the religious and
      cultural beliefs and practices of the child's community could be
      seen as being within the child's best interests.  This view may
      vary according to he likelihood of the child wanting to continue
      to adhere to such beliefs and practices when of an age that he
      can decide for himself the type of life he wishes to lead.

      The circumcision procedure is invasive, irreversible and major.
      It involves the removal of an otherwise healthy organ part.  It
      has serious attendant risks.

      As a prophylactic measure, circumcision of neonates does not
      appear to be the least restrictive alternative.  For a number of
      the adverse health conditions which have been associated with
      non-circumcised penises, the least restrictive preventative
      measure would be education of children in genital hygiene and in
      responsible, safe sexual practices.  Circumcision as a
      prophylactic procedure may be appropriate for older males who
      have the capacity to consent to the procedure.

      On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the
      Queensland <I>Criminal Code</I>, routine circumcision of a male infant
      could be regarded as a criminal act.  Further, consent by
      parents to the procedure being performed may be invalid in light
      of the common law's restrictions on the ability of parents to
      consent to the non-therapeutic treatment of children.

      Although practices such as circumcision involve an infringement
      of the bodily integrity of the child, it is likely that the
      State will only intervene through criminal and child welfare
      laws when the harm of the infringement outweighs the benefit
      that the child would receive from acceptance within a cultural
      or religious group of which the child and the child's family are
      an integral part.

      Although male circumcision is not now generally encouraged for
      medical reasons in the light of modern medical and scientific
      knowledge,<SUP>134</SUP> there is an argument that it should not be made
      <U>unlawful</U> because the harm to the child involved may be
      outweighed by the benefits to the child of being accepted into
      this cultural or religious group.  Whether routine circumcision
      for non-religious reasons and non-cultural reasons is in the
      child's best interests may be unclear.  However, because of the
      fairly widespread community acceptance of the procedure it is
      unlikely, at this time, that a prohibition on routine neonatal
      male circumcision would be universally supported.  It is also
      unlikely at this time that a medical practitioner acting in good
      faith and with due care and skill would be prosecuted for
      assault for performing a circumcision on a male infant.

      It is less clear whether a child could sue the doctor for
      damages for assault under the civil law.<SUP>135</SUP>  The child's
      ability to sue would not be dependent upon the criminality of
      the doctor's actions.  It would however be dependent upon the
      absence of real consent.  It could be argued that because the
      circumcision of a particular child was not in that child's best
      interests, the parents could not have given real consent to it
      taking place.  It could also be argued that, without adequate
      information being provided to the parents prior to the procedure
      taking place on the nature and possible consequences of the
      procedure, consent by the parents was not `real' consent.

    135  The only lawsuit which to the Commission's knowledge, has
         been commenced on behalf of a male child against a doctor for
         performing a circumcision was begun by the mother, as
         guardian ad litem of Adam London, before the Superior Court
         of Marin County, then on appeal to the Court of Appeal in
         California.  A petition to have the California Supreme Court
         review the rulings of the lower Courts was summarily rejected
         by the Supreme Court.  See <A HREF="http://www.nocirc.org/legal/morris.html">Morris RW</A>. <I>The First Circumcision
