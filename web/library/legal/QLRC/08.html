<B>8.    REASONS AGAINST ROUTINE REMOVAL OF PREPUCE</B>

      Apart from the controversy concerning the possible health
      reasons for removal of the prepuce and the prophylactic
      advantages of routine removal, a number of fundamental arguments
      have been promoted against routine circumcision of male infants.
      Dr R G Birrell, a paediatrician, writing to the Australian
      Paediatric Journal notes that:<SUP>106</SUP>

<SMALL>
            The neonatal period provides the time for maximal risk of
            complication for this procedure.
</SMALL>

      He suggests that, if the procedure is to be done, delay until
      12-15 months of age seems the only reasonable approach.
      Although infection is then less of a hazard, the risks of
      complications still remain very significant.<SUP>107</SUP>  Another
      paediatrician, Dr E Durham-Smith, suggests elective circumcision
      in the second or third year of life.<SUP>108</SUP>

<SMALL>
            Anaesthesia is required at this time, and the risks of
            this must be weighed against the advantages of circum-
            cision.
</SMALL>

      He goes on to state that:<SUP>109</SUP>
<SMALL>
            Under the conditions pertaining in most neonatal
            nurseries, and especially the serious, albeit rare,
            complication of septicemia, routine circumcision in
            the neonatal period should not be performed; and in
            fact is undesirable at any time during the first year
            of life.
</SMALL>

      (a)   The prepuce has a function


      In babies, the prepuce protects the glans from urine and faeces
      and thus reduces the likelihood of infection.<SUP>110</SUP>


      (b)   Pain

      Neonatal circumcision is the only surgical operation routinely
      conducted without anaesthesia.  Even local anaesthesia may lead
      to complications - mainly haematomas and local skin necrosis and
      occasionally death.<SUP>111</SUP>  The United States Task Force on
      Circumcision notes:<SUP>112</SUP>

<SMALL>
            Even a small dose of lidocaine can result in blood
            levels high enough to produce measurable systemic
            responses in neonates.  Local anesthesia adds an
            element of risk ... Circumferential anesthesia may
            be hazardous.
</SMALL>

      (c)   Complications


      It has been suggested that complications will arise in
      approximately 15 per cent of cases.<SUP>113</SUP>


            *  Death

            The most serious complication is death.  Although it is
            rare for babies to die as a result of circumcision, there
            are a number of reports of death.  The Commission has been
            advised of a recent case in Queensland where an infant was
            being circumcised in a general practitioner's surgery.
            Because the child was exhibiting signs of discomfort, more
            than the recommended dose of local anaesthetic was
            applied.  As a result of the overdoes of anaesthetic, the
            baby suffered a seizure and a cardiac arrest.  The doctor
            did not have appropriate resuscitation equipment in his
            surgery.   The baby was rushed to hospital but died
            shortly after.<SUP>114</SUP>

            Gairdner referred to a United Kingdom mortality rate of
            1.8 per 10,000 circumcisions.<SUP>115</SUP>

            In a recent New York study, 500,000 circumcisions were
            completed without a death.<SUP>116</SUP>

            A Western Australian study of four desperately ill
            newborns in Australia with bacterial meningitis from
            infected circumcision sites reported that two of the
            babies recovered, one survived with cerebral palsy and one
            died.<SUP>117</SUP>


            *  Damage to shaft


            Excessive skin of the penile shaft may be removed,
            resulting in concealed penis or a denuded shaft.<SUP>118</SUP>


            *  Damage to urethra


            The urethra may be caught in a circumcision clamp.  This
            usually results in a fistula at the corona.  It may be
            difficult to close the fistula.  This may involve two
            separate procedures.<SUP>119</SUP>  The Commission has been advised
            of a recent case in Queensland where a child haemorrhaged
            after a circumcision  operation performed in a general
            practitioner's surgery.   The doctor stitched the wound
            and mistakenly stitched the urethra at the same time.  The
            child was admitted to hospital a few days later, not
            having urinated during that time, gravely ill with
            septicaemia.<SUP>120</SUP>


            *  Amputation


            The glans or even the penis may be amputated.  There are
            reports of gangrene of the penis, avulsion of the scrotum
            and removal of needed skin for hypospadias repair.<SUP>121</SUP>


            *  Unsightly appearance


            Asymmetrical or inadequate removal of the prepuce may
            result in an unsightly appearance - "the frilly lizard
            look".   This is frequently the basis for a request for
            recircumcision.<SUP>122</SUP>


            *  Urethral fistulas


            Bleeding may require a suture.  If the suture is
            misplaced, it may result in a urethral fistula at the
            corona.


            *  Haemorrhage


            Haemorrhage, which may go undetected when nappies are
            used, has been the cause of death.<SUP>123</SUP>


            *  Incision line


            May become infected.

            Hirst reports:<SUP>124</SUP>

<SMALL>
                  This is usually responsive to local treatment,
                  but there are reports of progression on to the
                  staphylococcal scalded syndrome, and in some cases,
                  septicaemia occasionally leading to death of the
                  infant.
</SMALL>

            *  Phimosis


            Phimosis can occur as a direct result of inadequate
            circumcision rather than as a primary indication for the
            procedure.  Hirst explains:<SUP>125</SUP>
<SMALL>
                  The re-approximated line between the skin and the
                  deep preputial layer heals by scarring and where
                  an inadequate removal/ of the prepuce has been
                  performed, contracture of the scar prevents
                  retraction of the residual prepuce and hence a
                  phimosis.  Recircumcision is then required.
</SMALL>

            *  Infection of meatus


            Hirst explains:<SUP>126</SUP>

<SMALL>
                  Meatus and meatal stenosis may occur ... the
                  intact foreskin protects the glans and meatus
                  from the noxious effects of ammoniacal dermatitis
                  [nappy rash].   In the absence of the prepuce,
                  `nappy rash' may affect the glans and particularly
                  the meatus, causing meatitis.  Healing produces
                  narrowing of the orifice and resultant meatal
                  stenosis.   Meatal stenosis may cause a diminished
                  or angulated stream, but rarely results in a
                  bladder outlet obstruction.  Meatal stenosis may
                  require a definitive meatomy.
</SMALL>

      One Australian paediatrician describes a personal series of 5
      proven cases of septicaemia in a 6 year period - 3 other cases
      of septicaemia in which the circumcision site was probably the
      portal entry of the bacterium, were also treated:<SUP>127</SUP>

<SMALL>
            In the 5 proven cases the organism cultured in the blood
            and on the infected site matched perfectly as to anabiotic
            sensitivities.

            Two of these proven cases were gravely ill, and one
            child survived peripheral circulatory failure, pneumonia,
            pyonephrosis and 2 sites of osteomyelitis.  From another
            babe 5 pathogens - proteus, strep. facealis, staph.
            aureus and 2 types of E. Coli were cultured from his
            circumcision site.  The proteus caused the septicaemia in
            this later case.  No deaths occurred in this series of
            cases, but required intensive care.
</SMALL>

      (d)   The cost


      Newborn circumcision is not paid by the National Health Service
      in Britain.  In 1948 it was classified as cosmetic surgery and
      the rate of circumcision dropped to .5%.

      In 1985 the Australian Federal Health Minister removed the
      rebate for circumcision from the Medical Benefits Schedule.<SUP>129</SUP>
      The Minister suggested that circumcision rates should be reduced
      by education and community discussion.  He expressed a fear of
      `back-yard' circumcisions with a greater risk of fatality,
      trauma and infection.<SUP>130</SUP>

      The financial cost of circumcision is difficult to calculate.
      In 1992/93 Medicare reimbursed patients $98,781 for
      circumcisions performed on infants less than 6 months of age.
      If the procedure is performed on a newborn prior to leaving the
      hospital after birth, there is unlikely to be a hospital bed
      charge.  Medicare will pay 85% of the scheduled fee and here is
      no gap paid. Private health funds are prohibited from paying the
      gap in these cases because newborns are not considered patients
      under the <I>Health Insurance Act 1973</I> (Cmth) unless in a neonatal
      intensive care unit.

      If the child is returned to hospital after birth for
      circumcision, there will be a bed charge.  Medicare will pay 75%
      of the scheduled fee and private funds may pick up the remaining
      25%.  For an infant under 6 months of age, the doctor's
      scheduled fee is $33.10 [significantly more for older children].
      The Australian Medical Association recommends that doctors
      charge $57 for performing a circumcision on an infant under 6
      months of age.

      If the procedure is performed on a public patient in a public
      hospital there will be no additional hospital fee.  If the
      procedure is performed as a private patient in a public hospital
      or on a private patient in a private hospital there will be
      additional charges which will vary from hospital to hospital.
      Queensland private hospitals charge up to $173 for bed fees or
      theatre fees MBF will pay up to $115 of hospital fees for
      members with top hospital cover.

      The real cost to the community per infant (under 6 months of age
      will be in the vicinity of $175 (hospital) + $57 (doctor's fee)
      per procedure.

            may reduce postoperative complications.
               (1)   Using a surgical marking pen to mark the location
                     of the coronal sulcus on the shaft skin
                     preoperatively;
               (2)   identifying the urethral meatus;
               (3)   Bluntly freeing the foreskin from the glans with
                     a flexible probe.
               (4)   Completely retracting the foreskin; and
               (5)   identifying the coronal sulcus.
            all before applying the clamp or Plastibell and before
            excising any foreskin.  Electrocautery should not be used
            in conjection with metal clamps.

               The foreskin protects the `glans' on top of the penis
               from the irritation of wet nappies and reduces the
               likelihood of infection.  A circumcised baby is more
               likely to develop problems because he lacks this
               protection.

            In a study of 200 cases at Adelaide Children's Hospital,
            complications arose in 31 cases or 15.5%  Complications
            included haemorrhaging (from mild to moderate), meatal
            ulcers, recircumcision - after being circumcised in the
            neonatal period for social reasons.  Of 19 recircum-
            cisions, 18 were simple circumcisions and in one a dorsal
            slit was followed by circumcision.   Complications in the
            recircumcisions involved infection, meatal stenosis and
            mild haemorrhaging.  Note, however, the mean age of
            patients in the survey was 2 years 4 months.  Russell T in
            <I>The Case for Circumcision</I>, Medical Observer, 1 October
            1993 at 60 observes that a child is exposed to less risk
            of complications if circumcised earlier.

            delivered to the Second International Homebirth
            Conference, 4-7 October 1992, Sydney, describes a case
            reported by Money J and Tucker P [Sexual Signatures.
            Little Brown and Company Boston Toronto 1975 pp. 91-98]:
               A young couple took their normal, identical twin boys
               to a physician to be circumcised when the boys were
               seven months old.  The physician in the operating
               theatre used an electric cauterizing needle to remove
               the foreskin of one twin.  When the baby's foreskin
               didn't give on the first try or on the second, the
               doctor increased the current.  On the third attempt the
               surge of heat from the electricity literally cooked the
               baby's penis.  Unable to heal, the penis dried up and
               in a few days sloughed off completely, like the stub of
               an umbilical cord.  At the age of twenty-one months the
               `little girl' was brought back to the John Hopkins
               Hospital for surgical feminization and removal of
               testes.  Her mother has reported that dolls and a doll
               carriage headed her Christmas list when she was five
               and that, quite unlike her brother, the girl was neat
               and dainty, experimented happily with styles of her
               long hair, and often tried to help in the kitchen.
               Finger pressure applied above the urethral opening
               ensured a downward urine stream.  Vaginoplasty and
               hormone replacement were planned at puberty but the
               girl was not ready to accept hospitalization.

            King LR. <I>Neonatal Circumcision in the United States in
            1982</I>. Journal of Urology, Vol 128 (1982) at 1135 notes
            that:
               The glans or even the penis itself may be amputated.
               Reanastomosis should be attempted using microsurgical
               techniques which have been successful. ... Cautery also
               has burned the penis completely when applied to
               circumcision clamps.  These complications can be
               terrible and usually are the result of use of a
               circumcision clamp by inexperienced operators.
               Freehand techniques are much preferred by the
               occasional operator ... Fortunately new microsurgical
               techniques allow construction of a missing penis from
               revascularized and reinnervated grafts.  These patients
               eventually can be outfitted with a penile prosthesis
               for erection, permitting intercourse.  However, the
               nerve endings of the glans cannot be replaced.
               Obviously boys who lose the penis in infancy should
               continue to be reared and reconstructed as girls.

                  to meatal ulceration, and often significant stenosis
                  when the healing is complete.

          129  This action had been advised by the National Health and
               Medical Research Council at its 95th Session in
               Adelaide, June 1983 (see Report of Session at p.130):
                  The Council recommended that the Director-General of
                  Health draw the attention of the Medical Benefits
                  Schedule Revision Committee to the Council's
                  statement on the subject of neonatal circumcision
                  made at its Ninety-fourth Session which states: <SMALL>
                        The Council having considered the opinion of the
                        Australian College of Paediatrics and the Health
                        Commission of N.S.W., was of the opinion that
                        there is no medical indication for undertaking
                        routine circumcision on newborn male infants, and
                        that hazards of the operation at this age
                        outweigh any possible advantages.</SMALL>
                  In this context the Council requested that the
                  Medical Benefits Schedule Revision Committee be
                  asked to consider whether routine neonatal
                  circumcision should be removed from the Medical
                  Benefits Schedule.
