<B>5.    THE PREPUCE</B>

      (a)   Function of Prepuce

      Dr Douglas Gairdner<SUP>49</SUP> has described how the prepuce and
      glans<SUP>50</SUP> develop from the same block of tissue before birth and
      are still in the course of developing at birth.  At birth, there
      is a common layer of squamous epithelium<SUP>51</SUP> between the glans
      and the deep surface of the prepuce, and this explains why 96%
      of male infants have a non-retractile prepuce.  The prepuce
      gradually becomes detached from the glans and retractable over
      it.  In 90% of boys this process is completed by the age of 5
      years.

      In the first two years of life the prepuce functions to protect
      the glans and especially the urinary opening (meatus), from the
      effects of `nappy rash' (ammoniacal dermatitis) and protects the
      glans from irritation and faecal material.  The prepuce is one
      of the most sensitive parts of the penis and is said to enhance
      sensation during sexual intercourse.<SUP>52</SUP>

      [<I>CIRP Note</I>: Subsequent to the publication of this QLRC Research
      Paper, pathologist JR Taylor and colleagues reported the results
      of his research into the nature of the prepuce.  They reported
      impressively innervated and vascularized areas suggestive of a
      sensory organ of the first magnitude.  The nature of these
      structures suggested that these areas play an important role in
      human sexual response.  Their findings were published in the
      <A href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">British Journal of Urology, Volume 77 No. 2, pp. 291-295</A>
      <A href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">(February 1996)</A>. In addition, see Christopher J. Cold and John
      R. Taylor: <I><A HREF="/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/">The Prepuce</A></I> British Journal of Urology, (January)1999,
      Suppl 1; 83: 34-35.]

      (b)   Removal of Prepuce

      With the removal of the prepuce the exposed glans develops
      dermal layers up to twelve times the skin thickness.  This has
      been described as the formation of a cornified layer - an
      additional outer covering of compressed, dead cells.  Due to
      this scarification process, circumcision may render the penis
      less sensitive.[53]

      British National Health Service discontinued payment for
      circumcision and the practiece diminished greatly.
