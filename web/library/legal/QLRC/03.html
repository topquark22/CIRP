<B>3.    THE PROCEDURE</B>

      Various methods have been used or promoted for circumcision or
      by procedures designed to bring about the same results.<SUP>36</SUP>

      (a)      Jewish Ritual Circumcision

      The circumcision which Abraham performed on himself and other
      male members of his household was the removal of the tip of the
      prepuce.  This procedure is referred to as <I>Milah</I> by Jews and was
      practised by Jews for approximately 2,000 years.


      During the Hellenic period and at least by AD 140 a second step
      to ritual circumcision (<I>Pariah</I>) became prevalent.  This involved the
      tearing of the remaining lining of the prepuce off the glans
      (the head of the penis to which the prepuce is normally attached
      during infancy) and, with a sharpened fingernail, removing all
      mucous tissue that comprises the inner lining of the prepuce.

      A final step in this circumcision procedure, the <I>Metzitzah</I>, was
      added to the rite during the Talmudic period (AD 500-625):<SUP>37</SUP>

            Now follows the exsuction of the wound in such a manner
            that the Mohel takes the circumcised member in his mouth
            and with two or three draughts sucks the blood out of
            the wounded part.  He then takes a mouthful of wine from
            a goblet and spurts it, in two or three intervals, on
            the wound.

      Not all Jews adopted this procedure.  Some modified it by
      including the use of a glass tube to avoid the spead of disease
      through mouth to genital contact.

      Recently, with the spread of HIV, the Rabbinate also approved
      placing cotton in the glass tube to prevent blood from entering
      the Mohel's mouth.

      Most Jewish baby boys in Australia are now circumcised by
      doctors using the same procedures as are described below for
      non-ritual circumcision, although a religious ceremony would
      normally also take place at the same time.


      (b)      Non-Ritual Circumcision


      This involves the surgical removal of the prepuce from the
      glans.  Because it is common for babies as young as 8 days old
      to be circumcised, it is not the usual practise to anaesthetise
      the child.

      Commonly an instrument is used not dissimilar in appearance from
      a pair of pliars.  The foreskin is removed and the ends are
      sutured.  In free-hand excision, clamps may be used.

      A more recent practice involves inserting a plastic ring with a
      grove on its periphery inside the prepuce.  A string is tied
      around the outside of the prepuce over the glans.   A plastic
      bell fits over the top of the prepuce.   The head of the device
      is broken off, removing the prepuce.  It is trimmed by the
      doctor.  The ring, which clamps the wound, falls off within a
      week.

      techniques are referred to above at pp 8-9.

      publication.  The Commission would prefer information to be
      provided by those experienced in Australian Jewish circumcision
      practices.
