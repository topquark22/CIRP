<B>10.   POSSIBLE REFORMS</B>

      It may be reasonable to require, either by law or by a
      professional Code of Practice, medical practitioners to inform
      parents of all arguments for and against circumcision before,
      and possibly at least a number of days before, undertaking the
      procedure.  A statutory consent form containing information on
      arguments for and against circumcision could be drafted.  The
      form should be regularly updated with new information.

      It might be reasonable to require that all circumcisions be
      performed by medical practitioners or other experienced and
      skilled people in circumstances which reduce to a minimum any
      adverse consequences.<SUP>136</SUP>

   Notes:

    136  For example, access to appropriate resuscitation equipment;
         knowledge of dangers to local anaesthetics, etc.
