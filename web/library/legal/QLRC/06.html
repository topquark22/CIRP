<B>6.    HEALTH REASONS FOR REMOVAL OF PREPUCE</B>

      (a)   Neonatal Circumcision

      There appear to be no universally accepted, unequivocal medical
      indications for neonatal circumcision.<SUP>54</SUP>

      The Australian Medical Association does not encourage routine
      neonatal circumcision.  The Association has written to the
      Commission stating:<SUP>55</SUP>
<SMALL>
            Circumcision of the newborn male is a practice which
            the Australian medical profession generally discourages,
            always recognising that there may be medical
            justification for it in conditions such as phimosis.
            While the AMA has no formal policy on this matter, it
            generally supports the relevant position adopted by the
            Australian College of Paediatrics.
</SMALL>
      The Australian College of Paediatrics policy statement reads:
<SMALL>
            1.    The Australian College of Paediatrics should
                  continue to discourage the practice of
                  circumcision as in the newborn male infant.

            2.    Educational material on the topic of circum-
                  cision should be available to parents before
                  the birth of their baby and also in maternity
                  hospitals.  This will facilitate informed
                  discussion with their medical attendant.

            3.    Some parents after considering medical, social
                  religious and family factors will opt for
                  circumcision of their male child.  It is then
                  the responsibility of the medical attendant to
                  recommend that this circumcision be performed
                  at an age and under medical circumstances that
                  reduce the hazards to a minimum.
</SMALL>
      The Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and
      Gyncaecologists also discourages routine male circumcision.  The
      College states:<SUP>56</SUP>
<SMALL>
            The suggested benefit does not outweigh the financial
            cost of the procedure on a community basis and the real
            cost of the occasional fatality in male infants directly
            arising from circumcision.
</SMALL>

      The Queensland Nurses Union does not have a specific policy on
      routine circumcision but would support the refusal of any of its
      members to participate in the procedure.<SUP>57</SUP>

      Neonatal circumcision should not be considered when the neonate
      is premature, has a neonatal illness, any congenital anomaly
      (most importantly hypospadious<SUP>58</SUP>) or has a bleeding disorder.
      The procedure should never be performed within the first 24
      hours of life.<SUP>59</SUP>

      Routine neonatal circumcision continues to be performed by a
      number of general medical practitioners and possibly specialists
      in Queensland.

      (b)   Non-neonatal Circumcision

      There are a number of conditions which may indicate a need for
      circumcision in older children or men.

      (i)   Phimosis<SUP>60</SUP>

            This is a medical condition in which the prepuce will not
            pull back over the glans of the penis because the `opening'
            is too tight.  This is not a problem for young boys.  When
            erections occur the preputial opening may split.  Healing
            then causes linear contraction and further narrowing of
            the circular orifice.  If very tight, it may restrict
            urine flow and cause ballooning of the preputial sac.  It
            may also lead to infection or balanoposthitis.<SUP>61</SUP>  This
            would be an indication for circumcision.

      (ii)  Paraphimosis

            This is an uncommon condition resulting in the inability
            of the phimosed prepuce to be pulled forward again.  The
            prepuce tends to became oedematous<SUP>63</SUP> and a tight
            constriction then develops at the coronal sulcus behind
            the glans, aggravating the condition.  This is more common
            in older men and rare in children.  Circumcision will be
            necessary in younger men but in the elderly a dorsal slit,
            under local aeaesthetic will suffice.  In one study,
            paraphimosis in boys was found to be usually caused by an
            overzealous parent forcibly retracting, in the bath, a
            still congenitally adherent foreskin in a child less than
            three years of age, on the misguided advice of a
            doctor.<SUP>64</SUP>

      (iii) Non-retractable Prepuce

            Adhesions normally exist between the prepuce and the glans
            from birth are are progressively broken down as erections
            occur.  By three or four years of age the prepuce is
            usually fully retractable.  Plugs of smegma<SUP>65</SUP> may be
            retained behind the prepuce and be mistaken for `pus' or
            may predispose to infection.

            Dr E P Arnold has observed:<SUP>66</SUP>
<SMALL>
                  Non-retractable prepuce is not usually an indication
                  for circumcision and can be managed conservatively
                  in the expectation that the adhesions will break
                  down as the child grows.   If infections become a
                  problem, the adhesions can be separated an hour
                  after applying a transcutaneous local anaesthetic
                  cream (e.g. EMCA). [sic, should be EMLA]  For two
                  weeks after this, daily saline baths, gently
                  withdrawing the prepuce for cleaning and then
                  applying vaseline to the glans before pulling the
                  prepuce forward again are useful manoeuvres to
                  prevent re-formation of adhesions.  Should they
                  recur or infections remain a problem, circumcision
                  should be advised.
</SMALL>
         Leitch observes:<SUP>67</SUP>
<SMALL>
                  A prepuce made fully retractable after the age
                  of 3 years by simple separation of adhesions with
                  a blunt probe, not necessarily under anaesthesia,
                  would assist hygiene, decrease balanitis and true
                  phimosis, and prevent the accumulation of smegma,
                  thus decreasing the risk of carcinoma of the
                  penis, possibly to an almost negligible level.
</SMALL>
         By 16 years of age only about one per cent of boys still have
         a non-retractable prepuce.<SUP>68</SUP>

      (iv)  Recurrent balanitis<SUP>69</SUP>

            This is a condition of inflammation of the glans penis,
            usually where phimosis is present.

      (v)   Complications of previous, inadequate neonatal
            circumcision.

   Notes:

     54  Hirst G. <I>Controversies surrounding circumcision</I> Patient
         Management. September 1984, 14.

     55  Letter to the Commission from the Assistant Secretary-General
         of the Australian Medical Association, 5 October 1993.

     56  Letter to Commission from the President of the Royal
         Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 12
         October 1993.

     57  The Australian Nursing Federation (of which the Queensland
         Nurses' Union is a branch) adopted the following policy in
         September 1992:

            1.    Nurses (including students of nursing) have a
                  right to refuse to participate in procedures
                  to which they hold a conscientious objection,
                  except that nurses in the course of their
                  employment should not refuse to carry out
                  urgent tasks which are life-saving measures.

            2.    In cases of conscientious objection, the
                  nurse should express a desire not to
                  participate and should be removed from the
                  procedure area as soon as possible without
                  any discriminatory action being taken.

         Definition:
            Conscientious Objection is a right to refuse to
            participate where the refusal is based on beliefs
            about that which is right or wrong to do, and
            where the belief of personal conscience is the
            dominant guide to the individual's decision.  Fear,
            personal convenience or preference are not
            sufficient basis for conscientious objection.

     58  A congenital defect of the wall of the male urethra so that
         instead of the normal external orifice there is an opening
         for a greater or lesser distance on the underside of the
         penis.

     59  It has also been suggested that it should not be performed
         within the first eight days of life - to allow clotting
         factors to develop.

     60  From the Greek word for "muzzled".

     61  Inflammation of the glans penis and prepuce.

         the foreskin in children</I>. British Medical Journal 1983,
         186-187.

     63  Excessive fluid in intercellular tissue spaces due to
         increased transudation of fluid from the capillaries.

     64  Leitch IOW. <I>Circumcision - A Continuing Enigma</I> Australian
         Paediatric Journal Vol 6 (1970): 59, at 64.  Leitch states:
               Surely this shows the need for proper education of
               those members of the medical profession most
               closely associated with these problems.

     65  An oily substance with a peculiar odor.  Secreted by small
         preputial glands on the raised posterior margin of the glans
         penis and on the neck of the penis.  A similar substance is
         secreted by glands around the clitoris and labia minora in
         females.
