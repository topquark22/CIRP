<B>7.    PROPHYLACTIC REASONS FOR REMOVAL OF PREPUCE</B>


      There are those who argue strongly in favour of routine
      circumcision.  For example, a Brisbane general practitioner,
      Dr T. Russell states:<SUP>70</SUP>

<SMALL>
            The evidence of the benefits of neonatal circumcision
            is now so strong that it may be unethical or even
            negligent not to recommend circumcision.
</SMALL>

      A United States medical practitioner, much relied upon by
      pro-routine circumcision lobbyists, Dr Edgar Schoen states:<SUP>71</SUP>

<SMALL>
            The benefits of routine circumcision of newborns as
            a preventive health benefit far exceed the risks of
            the procedure ...
</SMALL>

      A number of arguments have been promoted for routine male
      circumcision on the basis of preventive health.


      (a)   Hygiene


      It is important for uncircumcised males to retract and clean
      beneath the foreskin to avoid infections.  The need for regular
      cleaning is often used as an argument in favour of circumcision.
      Of course hygiene is widely regarded as a preventative health
      measure to a wide range of illnesses and disease.  Cleaning the
      uncircumcised penis has been likened to cleaning the intact
      labia of females - both of which could be regarded as a
      commonsense preventative health measure.<SUP>72</SUP>  Circumcision
      reduces the need for males to practice genital hygiene.


      But, as Dr Hirst states:<SUP>73</SUP>

<SMALL>
            One frequently hears the argument that `my father had
            to have it done in the Middle East in World War II' or
            my brother in Vietnam ... so let's prevent that risk'.
            Is is not facetious to suggest that removal of an organ,
            however small it might be, is the appropriate way to
            obviate a problem of cleanliness?
</SMALL>

      Obviously, if girls can be taught genital and menstrual hygiene,
      boys can be taught penile hygiene, although some may reject this
      analogy.  Dr Russell has written:<SUP>74</SUP>

<SMALL>
            What man, after a night of passion, is going to
            perform `penile hygiene' before rolling over and
            snoring the night away (with pathogenic organisms
            multiplying under the prepuce)?
</SMALL>

      Many groups which have traditionally practiced routine
      circumcision, such as Jews, Muslims, Australian Aborginals -
      originally lived in dry, arid conditions where facilities for
      personal hygiene were not optimal.  Circumcision may therefore
      have had appeal as a prophylactic measure against balanitis.


      (b)   Risk of Cancer


      There is some evidence that circumcision may reduce a man's risk
      of developing cancer of the penis.

      Carcinoma of the penis is exceptionally rare.  In countries
      where circumcision is not routinely performed, such as Denmark
      and Japan, the rates of penile cancer are similar to those found
      in countries like the United States where the majority of males
      have been circumcised.<SUP>75</SUP>  The incidence of cancer is much
      lower in the uncircumcised when associated with good hygiene.
      Dr J S Black notes:<SUP>76</SUP>

<SMALL>
            Studies have shown that in uncircumcised cultures with
            good hygiene the incidence of cancer of the penis is
            low, but in circumcised cultures with poor hygiene the
            incidence is high.  Clearly it is good hygiene, not the
            presence or absence of the foreskin that matters.
</SMALL>

      Dr M L Sorrells notes:<SUP>77</SUP>

<SMALL>
            All studies report almost total absence of hygiene in
            all victims of the cancer ... the relationship of
            circumcision to cancer of the penis seems real, but
            even minimal hygienic standards are probably just as
            effective in prevention.
</SMALL>

      Cancer of circumcised penises has been reported:

      Dr Schoen reports:<SUP>78</SUP>

<SMALL>
            There are 750 to 1000 cases of penile cancer annually,
            in the United States; however in the past twenty years
            only 3 cases of penile cancer have been reported in men
            who had been circumcised as newborns.  There have been
            six major studies of cancer of the penis in the United
            States since 1932, and none of the more than 1600
            patients studied had been circumcised in infancy.
</SMALL>

      Marshall determined the incidence of carcinoma of the penis in
      the United States to be 0.2 to 0.9 per 100,000 uncircumcised
      males.   Using this data, he estimated that between 111,000 and
      500,000 circumcisions needed to be performed to prevent one case
      of penile cancer.<SUP>79</SUP>  Hirst<SUP>80</SUP> refers to older United Kingdom
      figures suggesting that such a number of circumcisions might
      result in in more than 20 neonatal deaths "although recent
      papers quote lower mortality rates."

      Other studies have reported:<SUP>81</SUP>


      *  Of 150 patients with carcinoma of the penis treated at
         the University of Michigan Medical Center - all were
         uncircumcised.  One third died as a result of the
         disease.


      *  Five major reported series of cases between 1932 and
         1989 in which not one victim of penile cancer had been
         circumcised neonatally.<SUP>83</SUP>


      *  Fifteen cases of penile cancer arising in circumcision
         scars in Saudi Arabia - although as is the custom, all
         had been circumcised as teenagers.<SUP>84</SUP>


      *  In Australia there were 78 deaths from carcinoma of the
         penis between 1960 and 1966.  In the same period there
         were 2 reported deaths from circumcision.<SUP>85</SUP>


      There has been the suggestion of a link between lack of
      circumcision and the incidence of cancer of the prostrate.(sic)
      There is no evidence for this assertion.<SUP>86</SUP>

      It has been suggested that a lower-than-usual incidence of
      carcinoma of the cervix in Jewish women is due to the universal
      circumcised state of their sexual partners.  There is no
      scientific basis for this suggestion.

      It has been noted however, that Muslim women, whose husbands are
      circumcised in infancy, have a much higher rate of cervical
      cancer than Jewish women.  Parsees of India,  who do not
      circumcise, have a much lower rate of cervical cancer than their
      Muslim neighbors who do circumcise.<SUP>87</SUP>  Complete circumcision
      is found about as frequently in husbands of patients with cancer
      of the cervix as in husbands of controls.<SUP>88</SUP>

      The strongest predisposing factors in cervical cancer are a
      history of intercourse at an early age and multiple sexual
      partners, sexual hygiene, parity,<SUP>89</SUP> contraceptives, coitus
      interruptus, and frequent intercourse.<SUP>90</SUP>

      For each of these cancers, it appears that more factors are
      involved than circumcision and non-circumcision.  Personal
      hygiene seems to be the most consistently relevant factor.<SUP>91</SUP>
      The incidence of breast cancer in women and prostrate (sic)
      cancer in men are far more common in Australia than cancer of
      the penis, yet it is rare to hear learned arguments in favour of
      routine mastectomies for women and routine prostatectomies for
      men in order to prevent such cancer from developing.

      <I>[CIRP Note: Recent research has firmly established the role of
      both the Human Papiloma Virus and smoking in the aetiology of
      both cancer of the penis and cancer of the cervix.  Circumcision
      cannot prevent either HPV or smoking and so cannot prevent
      penile cancer. For a more recent discussion of this subject see:
      <A HREF="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">Cold CJ, Storms M, Van Howe RS.</A>  Carcinoma in situ of the penis
      is a 76-year-old circumcised man. J Fam Prac 1997; 44(4):
      407-410.]</I>


      (c)   Urinary tract infections


      Such infections are said to be more common in uncircumcised
      male babies.  The evidence for this is scientifically suspect as
      it all comes from hospital-based retrospective studies.<SUP>92</SUP>
      Bacterial infection of the glans and prepuce are relatively
      uncommon in the child where there is no known aetiological
      factor, whereas in adults it usually occurs as a result of
      phimosis or poor hygiene.<SUP>93</SUP>


      (d)   Sexually Transmitted Diseases


      Unless men are sexually active and in a risk group for
      contracting sexually transmitted diseases, circumcision will not
      offer protection against such diseases.  Boys, whether
      circumcised or uncircumcised, are at far less risk of
      contracting sexually transmitted diseases including the Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus prior to becoming sexually active or
      adopting a high-risk lifestyle.  Presumably, at that point,
      they would be old enough to consent on their own behalf to
      circumcision if they believed that would offer them some
      protection.

      The risk of transmitting or contracting certain sexually
      transmitted diseases including the HIV virus may be increased
      for men already in a risk group who have uncircumcised penises
      although other factors may be relevant.<SUP>94</SUP>

      In 1947 a Canadian study on the incidence of circumcision
      amongst soldiers with venereal disease found on that
      uncircumcised men were nine times more likely than circumcised
      men to have syphilis and almost three times more likely to have
      gonorrhoea.  It was observed however that cleanliness of the
      genitals was commonly neglected among the soldiers.  Further,
      tears and abrasions of the prepuce were often noticed on sick
      parade:

<SMALL>
            Small abrasions of the delicate coronal membrane must
            be very common during brothel intercourse.  Both
            provide a portal of entry for the spirochaete.<SUP>95</SUP>
</SMALL>

      In a 1983 Western Australia study of men attending a special
      treatment clinic it was estimated that uncircumcised men were
      twice as likely as circumcised men to have herpes genitalis or
      gonorrhoea, and five times as likely to develop candidiasis or
      syphilis.<SUP>96</SUP>

      No attempt was made in the study to measure the socioeconomic
      status of the subjects - it had previously been suggested that
      uncircumcised men tend to come from lower socioeconomic
      backgrounds and to have poorer personal hygiene and a greater
      chance of exposure to infection.<SUP>97</SUP>  Another possibility
      canvassed by the researchers is that circumcised and
      uncircumcised men have similar rates of disease but that
      uncircumcised men are more likely to develop and thus, to seek
      medical attention.  This was considered most likely to be so in
      the case of candidiasis.

      The authors concluded:<SUP>98</SUP>

<SMALL>
            The evidence at presence certainly does not warrant
            the recommendation of circumcision on the ground that
            it prevents Sexually Transmitted Diseases.  If these
            findings are confirmed in other studies, it would seem
            that attention should be directed to the improvement
            of personal hygiene among uncircumcised men.
</SMALL>

      The most recent available research findings on the relationship
      between lack of circumcision and HIV infection indicate that,
      for men involved in a high risk lifestyle, circumcision may
      offer some protection from HIV infection, although not all
      studies reveal such a link.<SUP>99</SUP>

      The protective effect of circumcision may be reduced when other
      factors are taken into account such as history of genital
      sores.<SUP>100</SUP>

      In a 1988 study in Nairobi of 340 men attending a sexually
      transmitted disease clinic uncircumcised heterosexual men were
      found to be 2.7 times more likely to have HIV infection than
      uncircumcised men.<SUP>101</SUP>  Genital ulcers may increase men's
      susceptibility to HIV, or they may increases the infectivity of
      women infected with HIV.  The researchers conclude that the
      intact prepuce may operate to increase the susceptibility to
      HIV.  One suggested explanation given by Nairobi researchers for the
      link between lack of circumcision and HIV infection is:<SUP>102</SUP>

<SMALL>
               The presence of an intact foreskin provides a warm,
               moist, environment that allows a longer time for
               viral survival and penetration.
</SMALL>

      Further, the cornified skin covering which develops on the
      circumcised penis may protect it from the microabrasions which
      facilitate HIV entry.<SUP>103</SUP>

      The prepuce may also be subject to trauma during
      intercourse.<SUP>104</SUP>

      Hirst reports:<SUP>105</SUP>

<SMALL>
            Symptomatic monilial balanitis, usually resulting
            from sexual contact, is a common problem seen almost
            exclusively in the uncircumcised, particularly in a
            population where oral contraceptives are in widespead
            use.  Treatment of both parties usually eradicates
            the infection, but occasionally circumcision is
            necessary to effect a cure.
</SMALL>
      <I>[CIRP Note: For a more recent discussion of the relationship
      between incidence of circumcision and the incidence of HIV see:

      infection with HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted diseases.
      Archives of Disease in Childhood (London) 1997; 77(3):194-195.]</I>


      (e) Psychological and Sociological


      There may be an argument that for a child to be uncircumcised in
      a family or country where most males have been circumcised will
      place the child in an uncomfortable and embarrassing position.
      This may be more so when the community within which he lives has
      a religious or strong cultural reason for circumcising the
      males.

      As the majority of boys in Australia are now uncircumcised, it
      is less likely than it was a few years ago, that a boy will be
      made to feel out-of-place amongst his peers for being
      uncircumcised.  This should also be the case within families
      when the majority of fathers are uncircumcised.  Presumably the
      old argument of fathers wanting their sons to look like them is
      less significant.

     81  Leitch IOW. <I>Circumcision - A Continuing Enigma</I> Australian
         Paediatric Journal Vol 6 (1970): 59, at 62, reports:
            Moslems are circumcised between the age of 4 and 12 years,
            and comparisons of the incidence in Moslems and Jews show
            a lower incidence in Jews, who are circumcised on the
            eight post-natal day.  However Jewish circumcision demands
            the removal of more prepuce than the Moslem ritual.

            Carcinoma of the penis in the Chinese accounts for 18.5
            percent of all carcinomata, compared with 2% in the U.S.A.
            ... There are wide geographic variations, and the disease
            is associated with a congenitally tight and long redundant
            foreskin.  The disease is rarely seen among the more
            well-to-do, whole level of personal hygiene is higher.
            Circumcision has been thought to provide complete
            protection from carcinoma of the penis, but recently two
            cases have been reported in Jews circumcised in infancy
            ... and five cases of carcinoma of the penis in non-Jews
            circumcised in infancy.

            Carcinoma of the penis seems to be associated with lack of
            circumcision which by no means affords absolute
            protection.  Also associated are a long redundant
            foreskin, and a congenitally adherent foreskin, while good
            personal hygiene appears to decrease the incidence.

            Our evidence leads us to believe that circumcision at any

            carcinoma of the penis if the neoplasm is not present at
            the time of circumcision and the prepuce is completely
            removed.  We do not agree with the concept that
            circumcision after the neonatal period is ineffective in
            preventing epicermoid neoplasms of the penis.   Many adult
            patients with phimosis, condyloma acuminata and
            leukoplatia have been circumcised at this medical center
            and none has reappeared with penile neoplasm.

     94  Many of the studies which are relied upon to substantiate the
         increased risk are not well-controlled and do not eliminate
         variables such as geographic location, hygiene, life-style,
         race, socioeconomic factors or access to medical care.  See

         The New England Journal of Medicine: 1308 who observes:
            From the early 1940s until the mid-1970s ... educated
            middle class parents almost always had their newborn sons
            circumcised to [to prevent cancer of the penis and
            cervical cancer in sexual partners, as well as to prevent
            phimosis and to promote genital cleanliness].  Those
            middle-class parents were willing to pay for the procedure
            (there were few insurance programs in the 1940s and
            1950s).  The infant sons of poor parents were usually
            uncircumcised because their parents were unaware of the
            benefits and could not afford the cost.
