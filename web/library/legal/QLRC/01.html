<B>1.   INTRODUCTION</B>

(a)  Terms of Reference

      This reference is part of a wider reference given to the
      Commission by the Attorney-General in its Fourth Programme of
      work.<SUP>1</SUP>   The full terms of the reference are set out in item 4
      of the Programme, namely:

      "Examine the rights relating to consent to medical procedures
      by:

      (a)   children

      (b)   intellectually disabled adults (including consent to
            sterilization.

      The Commission has divided the terms of reference into two major
      parts.  The first part concerns consent by young people to
      medical procedures.  The second part concerns consent to medical
      procedures on intellectually disabled adults.<SUP>2</SUP>

      The first part of the reference has been divided into distinct
      research projects to enable the Commission to deal with
      particular issues in detail and to avoid confusion between
      seemingly disparate matters.  The research projects currently
      being undertaken include:

      (i)   consent to medical examinations in child abuse cases;

      (ii)  female genital mutilation

      (iii) male circumcision

      (iv)  general legislation on consent to medical treatment
            of young people

      (v)   sterilisation of young people.

      (vi)  treatment of severely defective neonates.

      This Research Paper concerns item (iii) above.

(b)   Consultation


      In May and June 1993 advertisements were placed in the
      Courier-Mail calling for public submissions on Consent by Young
      People to Medical Treatment.  An Information Paper outlining a
      wide range of issues was available to assist anyone interested
      in making a written or oral submission.  Also a number of media
      interviews were given by a member of the Commission to elicit
      public interest in the matters being dealt with.

      Approximately 300 copies of the information paper have been
      distributed and, to date, approximately 160 oral and written
      submissions have been received.  24 of these submissions relate
      specifically to consent to circumcision of male infants.

      In addition, a number of individuals and organisations with a
      particular interest in male circumcision have been approached
      for information and opinions on relevant matters raised by the
      reference.  The assistance of those who have made submissions
      and others who provided information and comments to the
      Commission in the preparation of this paper is greatly
      appreciated.


(c)   The Need for Reform and the Commission's Approach

      From the Commission's research to date, it is apparent that
      there are two quite vocal sides of the debate on routine infant
      male circumcision.  One side advocates the practice, primarily
      on a preventative health basis or on religious grounds.  The
      other side opposes the practice, primarily on human rights and
      preservation of bodily integrity grounds.  Both sides rely on
      medical evidence and opinion to support their views.

      This Research Paper has been produced to assist the Commission
      in understanding the issues and arguments on the topic of
      routine infant male circumcision.  It is being circulated to
      individuals and organisations with an interest or expertise in
      the issues raised, to verify the accuracy and significance of
      the information contained in the Research Paper, and to seek
      suggestions as to the most appropriate approach to adopt.

      There will be wider community consultation on routine infant
      male circumcision and other matters to be dealt with during the
      course of this reference, and at a later date.

Notes:

      1  Fourth Programme dated September 1990.

      2. The latter part is being dealt with by the Commission in its
         forthcoming Report on Assisted and Substituted Decision-
         Making.
