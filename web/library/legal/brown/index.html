      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">Medical malpractice and professional
      liability are problems of major importance to practicing
      physicians today. Although the first malpractice case of
      record in the United States occurred in 1794, relatively few
      were filed in the interim prior to World War II. A marked
      increase in malpractice suits has been experienced in each
      decade since 1940,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and it is
      now anticipated that 20,000 such suits will be instituted
      this year. Breaking this down, it appears that one physician
      out of every five will be sued for malpractice during his
      professional career.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">After his February 1971 Health message,
      former President Nixon directed the Secretary of Health,
      Education and Welfare (Elliot Richardson) to create a
      Commission on Medical Malpractice "to undertake an intensive
      program of research and analysis in this area."<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> This Commission convened, formulated a
      research plan, and, on January 16, 1973, published a
      two-volume report entitled, <i>Report of the Secretary's
      Commission on Medical Malpractice</i>."<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Although their methods, conclusions,
      and analytical material have been subjected to criticism and
      are deemed controversial, they do present a large-scale
      effort to research a problem area that had not been subjected
      to in-depth analysis heretofore. Several interesting
      statistics can be gleaned from their report. Their study was
      done on 12,000 malpractice cases which were concluded during
      1970.<sup><a href="#n4">4 p1</a></sup> Less than 10% of those
      reached the trial stage, 29% of which resulted in payment to
      the plaintiff. The median payment was $2,000 and 3% of all
      claims were settled in excess of $100,000.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4 p7</a></sup> The claimants received a total of
      $80.3 million and another $10.4 million was expended on
      carrier legal fees and allocated cost. Only 2.3% of the
      claims filed were against pediatricians.<sup><a href="#n4">4
      p16</a></sup> This low rate was equaled by psychiatrists and
      bettered only by ophthamologists. Briefly, the Commission
      report stresses the magnitude of the problem and the present
      privileged position of the pediatrician. During 1974 and 1975
      an increasing number of suits have been entered against
      pediatricians and it is assumed the trend will continue.</p>

      <p class="text">The majority of malpractice suits are
      directed primarily against practitioners in the various
      surgical specialties. Often hospitals, offices, and staff are
      included as defendants, these being areas in which
      negligence, poor results, and inaccurate diagnosis are most
      apt to occur. Recent surveys show that orthopedic surgeons,
      plastic surgeons, general surgeons, and anesthesiologists are
      sued in that order of incidence.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> As of today pediatrics remains a
      low-risk specialty. But here again, the trend is changing.
      Our 1974 spot survey of American Academy of Pediatric members
      discloses that an impressive 15% of those who responded have
      been defendants in malpractice suits. When an infant or young
      child is seriously damaged by the negligence of another, the
      sympathy of judge and/or jury will be aroused and high awards
      can be anticipated.</p>

      <p class="text">There is a negative correlation between
      competence and the likelihood of being sued.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Statistics show that a competent
      specialist is as likely to be sued as a less competent
      general practitioner. For example, surgeons who take on the
      most difficult cases are more often the best surgeons. They
      are sued more and for more money than some of the people who
      do less complicated and more common cases.</p>

      <p class="text">Concurrent with the increase in the number of
      malpractice suits is an increase in the amount of damages
      plaintiffs are now receiving from such suits. Between 1967
      and 1971 throughout the country, there were 60 awards in
      excess of $200,000 each in medical malpractice suits. In 1968
      alone, there were 15 cases in California with judgments
      entered between $1 million and $1.4 million. It is difficult
      to establish appropriate statistics because of the fact that
      so many suits are settled before they come to trial and that
      judgments is many cases are not appealed. As a general rule
      only appellate and supreme court cases are reported, making
      information concerning them in printed form available for
      dissemination. New York, California, and Florida are states
      where the largest number of these suits have been filed,
      tried, and where the highest judgments have been
      recorded.<sup><a href="#n9">8</a></sup> In New York, courts
      heard 407 malpractice suits in 1968. Five years later they
      heard 773 - a 90% increase. In 1968, each of these successful
      plaintiffs in malpractice suits receive an average of $9,878;
      in 1973 this figure rose to $23,426. Furthermore, several
      awards exceeded $1,000,000 in cases where negligence was
      proved. One of these involved a child to whom a New York
      court recently awarded a total of $2,110,000 for brain damage
      suffered shortly after her birth in a Manhattan
      hospital.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">In 1975, two malpractice suits involving
      children were tried in Chicago resulting in awards of $1
      million in one, and $2,5 million in the other. Both involved
      severe brain damage from anoxia, one from alleged failure to
      perform a tracheotomy<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> and the
      other from an anesthetic agent.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Malpractice suits are not always capricious,
      conjured, or unfounded as many physicians want to believe.
      Patients do suffer unwarranted damages at the hands of the
      medical profession. Approximately 18% of medical malpractice
      incidents cause death, 19% leave permanent effects, 63%
      result in temporary effects, some of which are
      psychological.<sup><a href="#n4">4 p11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Although a vast majority of malpractice
      claims are now still successfully defended, the trend of
      recent court decisions favor the claimant. The generosity of
      court and juries in granting liberal awards to injured
      plaintiffs apparently stems from the prevalence of liability
      insurance. Judges and juries know or believe that the burden
      of paying a judgment for damages ordinarily will fall on the
      insurer and not upon the defendant doctor. Thus, the cost of
      judgment settlements will be pro-rated among all who practice
      medicine and carry insurance, via the premiums paid for this
      coverage. In the first week of July 1974, premiums from
      malpractice insurance rose 93.5% in New York, resulting in
      physicians there paying the highest average malpractice rates
      in the nation, a distinction previously held by the state of
      California.</p>

      <p class="text">The trend towards ever-increasing malpractice
      insurance premiums, for both physicians and hospitals, has
      continued in 1975, resulting in rebellion, work stoppages,
      and new legislative enactments.</p>

      <h4>TRENDS IN COURT</h4>

      <p class="text">Courts have recently relaxed many of the
      established procedures and rules heretofore governing
      malpractice trials, making it much less complicated for
      plaintiffs to recover. Some of such revisions are noted in
      the following instances:</p>

      <p class="text">(1) In order to overcome the difficulty
      plaintiffs encountered in obtaining expert witnesses for
      their trials, courts in some jurisdictions now permit the
      introduction of medical textbooks, publications, treatises,
      hospital bylaws, JCAH, and other accrediting and licensing
      bodies rules and regulations to establish deviation from
      standard medical practice. Previously such materials were not
      permissible as evidence as they were held to be "hearsay"
      evidence, due to the fact that their authors were not present
      in the courtroom to be questioned and cross-examined. The
      Illinois Supreme Court in the Darling Case<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> decision adopted in the majority of
      jurisdictions, has set this new doctrine.</p>

      <p class="text">(2) The statute of limitations in many states
      in now interpreted to begin, not with the date of injury as
      is customary in other personal injury accidents, but with the
      date of discovery of the injury by the plaintiff. Illinois
      adopted this "discovery rule," but also has added a
      limitation clause to the effect that "no action can be
      started later than 10 years after such treatment or
      operation."<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Furthermore,
      patients of pediatric age who have been harmed may institute
      suit on their own behalf for damage suffered by them, when
      they reach their majority and within the additional period of
      the statute of limitations. Pediatricians must consider their
      own state's statute of limitations in determining how long
      they must keep records of their pediatric patients.
      Individual state statutes can be amended at anytime your
      state legislators are in session--consequently a chart of
      statutes of limitations in all the various states could be
      obsolete before publication. It behooves the doctor to keep
      abreast of current statutory changes in his own state.</p>

      <p class="text">(3) Physicians from outside the local
      community may now testify about the standards of medical
      practice. Previously the courts had held that only local
      physicians could testify to the standard of care in their
      local community. As a result of this change, plaintiff's
      attorneys are now able to bring in a physician from a
      different jurisdiction to testify against the local
      physician. Attorneys claim this is resulting in a break
      through against the so-called "conspiracy of silence" with
      which physicians have been charged when they are reluctant to
      testify against each other.</p>

      <p class="text">(4) Some courts have become more liberal in
      recognizing situations in which negligence on the part of the
      physician may be inferred from the circumstances, thereby
      dispensing with the burden on the plaintiff to produce expert
      medical testimony to support his case. This involves the
      doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, which literally
      interpreted means "the thing speaks for itself." Previously
      this doctrine was applied primarily in foreign-body cases
      when forceps, scissors, hemostats, sponges, etc., were left
      within a body cavity of a patient at the time of surgery. The
      effect of the application of this doctrine is to say to the
      physician, "your tools were left in my belly; they were not
      there before the operation; it is up to you to prove you were
      not negligent." Alaska has enacted a statute to do away with
      the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>. Other states
      (notably Illinois<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> and
      California) attempt to expand the use of the doctrine and
      attempt to apply it in situations which were formerly
      inapplicable -- such as trauma or reactions from injections.
      Now all the plaintiff has to do is to prove that the
      defendant physician was in control of the procedure alleged
      to have caused the injury.</p>

      <h4>THEORIES OF LEGAL ACTIONS</h4>

      <p class="text">The majority of malpractice suits are tort
      actions of civil liability. A "tort" is defined as any
      wrongful act, damage, or injury done willfully, negligently,
      or in circumstances involving strict liability, but not
      involving breach of contract, for which a civil suit can be
      brought, and which makes the perpetrator of the act liable
      under law to pay damages to the injured party. Several torts,
      the most common of which is <i>negligence</i>, fit under the
      penumbra of medical professional liability. The majority of
      malpractice actions (85%) are based on allegations of
      negligence, where the plaintiff contends that the medical
      treatment he received did not conform to the standards
      imposed on the physician by law.</p>

      <p class="text">Other tort actions to which a pediatrician
      could be subjected would be <i>assault and battery</i> (for
      treating a patient without consent, except in an emergency
      situation); <i>fraud and deceit</i>; <i>false
      imprisonment</i> (attempt to hold the patient in the hospital
      until the bill is paid.); <i>libel and slander</i> (written
      or oral information published by a physician which could be
      damaging to the patient's reputation); <i>invasion of the
      right of privacy</i> (taking photographs of the patient
      without express permission); and <i>breach of confidential
      communications</i> (where the physician discloses information
      about a patient which he learned under the physician-patient
      privilege).</p>

      <p class="text">In order for tort actions of negligence to
      prevail, the plaintiff must establish in court that:<br />
       (1) The physician had a duty to the patient (existence of
      physician-patient relationship); (2) that there was a
      dereliction or breach of that duty; (3) that the dereliction
      of duty resulted in damage to the patient; and (4) that the
      patient was, in fact, damaged.</p>

      <p class="text">Actions of this type are often hard to prove
      in court, because medical testimony is ordinarily required to
      show that the acts or omissions by the accused physician were
      in fact negligent, and such testimony is often difficult to
      obtain.</p>

      <p class="text">Should the patient die of injuries sustained
      through alleged malpractice, and suit is brought by the next
      of kin for loss of the loved one, the local prevailing
      "wrongful death statute" would apply in determining the
      amount to be recovered as damages. Many wrongful death
      statutes prescribe a limit on the amount of damages that the
      next of kin can recover in the event the deceased has been
      killed by the negligence of another, though an automobile
      accident, a personal assault, or an act of malpractice. The
      patient who lived would be able to sue for astronomical
      limits. The next of kin would be held to the statutory limit,
      which might be $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, etc. depending upon
      the statute in effect at the time of the death of the child,
      not the subsequent time at which the suit is heard. The
      limitation "handicap" has caused litigants to turn to other
      types of suits where no limitation of liability would be
      encountered. Several legal ploys have been tried, namely:</p>

      <p class="text">(1) Action on <i>breach of contract</i>: For
      example, a physician performed a tonsillectomy on a young
      child and the operation resulted in death of the patient from
      hemorrhage. The legal theory here is that the physician
      entered into a contract with the parents to perform a
      successful operation on their child. Because the facts showed
      that the surgical procedure resulted in the death of the
      patient, it is contended that a contract had been breached
      and that the patient should recover. Few courts have agreed
      with this theory. However, suits are allowed on breach of
      contract, if the physician specifically promised to effect a
      cure. or guarantee a result. Such statements should be
      avoided.</p>

      <p class="text">Because a contractual relationship usually
      exists between the physician and his patient, the physician
      may be considered to agree impliedly to treat the patient in
      an appropriate manner. The courts usually consider a
      malpractice action as tortious in nature whether the duty
      grows out of a consensual relation or has its origin in
      contract:</p>

      <p>(2) <i>Breach of Warranty</i>: An increasing number of
      cases are being filed and tried on the theory of breach of
      implied warranty. Prior to the application of this doctrine
      in the Cutter Laboratory suit&dagger; about polio vaccine,
      implied warrant suits were concerned with defects in
      automobiles, bread, canned food products, etc. A $675,000
      judgment against Cutter Laboratory in favor of one child who
      received polio vaccine which had not been attenuated.
      Although negligence was not proven per se, the court held
      that an unwritten guarantee had been breached. Consequently,
      this theory has been often cited in suits relative to drugs,
      biologicals, and blood transfusions.</p>

      <p class="text">(3) The <i>doctrine of strict liability</i>
      has been recognized recently by the courts in many of the
      blood transfusion cases based on claims of the patient having
      become infected with hepatitis. The courts have held that,
      although hepatitis can not yet be positively identified in
      the blood donor, and that the infectious agent can not be
      efficaciously removed from the blood prior to transfusion,
      the involved hospital, blood bank, physician, etc. are
      strictly liable if the patient contracts hepatitis during the
      course of or because of a blood transfusion whether
      negligence was proved or not.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      In these cases, the courts have held that a blood transfusion
      is a sale rather than a service, and therefore, the doctrine
      of strict liability is applicable.</p>

      <p class="text">(4) Another recent change has been the
      <i>loss of charitable immunity</i>. Until recently, all
      tax-supported, religiously-based, and other eleemosynary
      institutions were accorded the privilege of charitable
      immunity which heretofore had been used in legal actions
      against them. Recent court actions have removed or restricted
      the immunity of nonprofit or government hospitals. It is
      anticipated that this trend will continue. In several states
      (New Jersey, Hawaii, Alaska, New York, Georgia) specific
      statutes deny governmental hospital immunity.</p>

      <p class="text">(5) It should be stressed that a pediatrician
      who violates a provision of a statute which mandates an act,
      such as reporting, or eye prophylaxis, may incur civil
      liability. A recent suit of this nature in California<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> resulted in an award of $600,000 to
      a battered child because a physician failed to report the
      original acts of abuse and the child became more seriously
      damaged from subsequent episodes.</p>

      <p class="text">(6) Pediatricians may be sued when acts of
      houseofficers under their direction result in damage to a
      patient. The author has been the target in such a suit when
      an intern and resident, under her jurisdiction failed to make
      a diagnosis of meningococcemia complicated by a
      Waterhouse-Friderichson Syndrome in a 9-year old girl who
      presented without an eruption.</p>

      <p class="text">(7) Recent court decisions involving the
      <i>doctrine of <a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/1976.html">informed consent</a></i>
      have placed an increasing burden on physicians. An analysis
      of such decisions reveal significant differences in the legal
      requirements of the various states. In view of these
      differences, the lack of statutory requirements, and in the
      absence of decisions at the appellate court level, it is
      impossible to formulate any guidelines which would now be
      applicable to all states; therefore, <i>stare decisis</i>
      (previous court decisions will be applied. In a leading case,
      <i>Grossjean vs. Spencer</i><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      (Iowa, 1966), the court stated: "It is the duty of a doctor
      to make a reasonable disclosure of the dangers within his
      knowledge, which are incident or possible, in the treatment
      he proposes to administer. This does not mean a doctor is
      under an obligation to describe in detail all of the possible
      consequences of treatment. To make a complete disclosure of
      all facts, diagnoses, and alternatives or possibilities which
      might alarm the patient, that it would, in fact, constitute
      bad medical practice."</p>

      <p class="text">As a general rule, parents must give their
      consent before therapy is administered to their minor
      children. Minors who are either married, pregnant, or
      emancipated, and who are in need of treatment may usually
      give valid consent for their own medical or surgical
      treatment. In the event of an emergency requiring immediate
      treatment to a minor not classified above, such minor may
      usually give his own consent. The criteria to apply for
      circumventing parental consent is the feasibility of
      obtaining such consent weighed against the necessity for
      urgent treatment of the child. The sole judge of such
      feasibility is the physician.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>
      <i>Documentation</i> as to the state of the emergency is <i>a
      must</i> for the doctor's records.</p>

      <p class="text">Recently courts have become more lenient in
      permitting children of mature years to give their own consent
      for treatment of non-emergency conditions even including
      plastic surgery such as nose bobbing, skin grafting, smallpox
      vaccination, and removal of disfiguring lesions, such as
      those of Von Recklinghausen's disease. Furthermore, in some
      states (Illinois for example) the legislature has enacted
      specific statutes providing for treatment of venereal disease
      and/or drug abuse. Notification to their parents is not
      required. Forty-nine states and the district of Columbia have
      statutes providing for treatment of venereal disease in
      minors, generally without parental consent.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19 p277</a></sup> Twenty-five of these states
      expressly provide that the consent of no other party is
      necessary when a minor seeks treatment for suspected venereal
      disease: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
      Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota,
      Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, North
      Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South
      Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Washington. Six other states and the
      District of Columbia simply provide that a minor has the
      capacity to consent to treatment for a venereal disease:
      Indian, Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and
      Virginia.</p>

      <p class="text">Statutes in six other states stipulate that
      physicians are relieved of liability for treating minors
      without parental consent: Colorado (limited to immunity for
      diagnostic examination), Nebraska, Massachusetts, Rhode
      Island (diagnostic examination of a minor is not an assault),
      Wyoming, and West Virginia. In the remaining 12 states,
      statutes provide for treatment of minors for venereal disease
      but require notification to parents or guardians. Hawaii
      requires the physician to inform the responsible adult if the
      patent does have disease; Iowa requires such notification
      only if it appears that the patient could infect other
      members of the family; Vermont requires such notice if the
      patient requires immediate hospitalization; Delaware,
      Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi
      and Tennessee leave notification to the discretion of the
      physician.</p>

      <p class="text">Wisconsin appears to have no statutory
      provision for treatment of a minor's venereal disease without
      parental consent. Furthermore, in Illinois and Mississippi,
      minors who are either married, pregnant, a parent, or who are
      referred by a physician, clergyman, or a planned parenthood
      agency are entitled to birth control services.</p>

      <p class="text">Other states have broaden the rights of
      minors to give effective consent for contraceptive
      services.<sup><a href="#n19">19 p279</a></sup> Eleven other
      states and the District of Columbia by their statutes allow
      minors to obtain contraceptives without consent of their
      parents or guardians. In eight of these 12 jurisdictions
      (Colorado, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Kentucky,
      Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) minors are
      given the right to purchase contraceptives without the
      consent of their parents. Florida has a statutory provision
      which allows a physician to provide nonsurgical
      contraceptives to any minor without parental approval if in
      his opinion, the minor may suffer probable health hazards
      without them. Maryland law states that a minor may apply to a
      physician for contraceptives, but the physician may, at his
      discretion, report such request to her parents or
      guardian.</p>

      <p class="text">An additional nine states (California,
      Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio,
      and West Virginia will only allow minors who are present or
      potential welfare recipients, parents or about to be married
      to obtain contraceptives from publicly sponsored family
      planning programs. In 1971, the California Supreme
      Court<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> held an abortion could
      be performed in that state to an unmarried "unemancipated
      minor" without parental consent. The court applied that
      section of the California Civil Code which permits minors to
      receive surgical treatment relating to pregnancy. This
      decision, plus that of the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Roe vs.
      Wade</i><sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> would subject a
      single mother to no more restrictions than an adult married
      woman in seeking abortion. Other states now agree with those
      interpretation, unless they have specific statutes to the
      contrary.</p>

      <p class="text">The above last-mentioned regulations
      demonstrate the legislative trend toward the freedom of
      minors to obtain medical assistance on their own volition.
      They also demonstrate the flexibility of the law when there
      is a specific goal such as eradication of venereal disease or
      drug abuse. They further stress the need of practicing
      pediatricians to be knowledgeable concerning the law of their
      own state. To prescribe contraceptives outside of the terms
      of the law could leave a physician liable to suit by the
      parents of the minor. The author is unaware of any such suits
      being prosecuted, and feels parents would be loathe to
      institute them inasmuch as they could be interpreted as
      providing open knowledge that the involved minor was in fact
      sexually active.</p>

      <h4>MEDICAL LIABILITY SUITS</h4>

      <p class="text">A nationwide study was recently carried out
      by St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> on a total of 5,096 malpractice
      cases. The allegations on which the majority of these suits
      were instituted are depicted in Table I. When the Medical
      Protective Company's national study of professional liability
      claims involving payment of damages levied against
      pediatricians<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> was reported it
      revealed that claims arose in seven significantly discernable
      groupings listed in Table II according to frequency.</p>

      <p class="text">The authors analysis of 105 recent medical
      liability cases<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> encountered
      in either legal or medical literature pertaining to patients
      of pediatric age is selective but supports the insurance
      studies above mentioned. It excludes cases which involve
      physicians other than pediatricians, and excludes incidents
      of a surgical nature unless the surgery <span
      class="yellow">(e.g., circumcision)</span> was performed by a
      pediatrician. Allegations ranked in order of frequency were:
      (1) Improper treatment, negligent treatment, or failure to
      treat - 29; (2) failure to diagnosis or to make a timely
      diagnosis - 21; (3) birth injury, anoxia, negligence in
      handling newborns - 18; (4) complications from drug
      treatments or errors in medication - 16; and (5) lack of
      consent - 7.</p>

      <p class="text">Death occurred in 16 (15.23%) of the above
      cases and blindness or brain damage in 29 other children. The
      cases involving failure to diagnose included phenylketonuria,
      erythroblastosis fetalis, retrolental fibroplasia, foreign
      bodies, congenital dislocation of the hip, appendicitis,
      meningitis, subdural hematomas, and diabetes. In all of these
      conditions, failure to diagnose or failure to diagnose
      promptly can result in permanent damage or death of the
      child. It is apparent that neonatologists are in a precarious
      situation because they are concerned with many conditions
      which involve anoxia and its horrible sequelae. Approximately
      22% of the cases involved newborn infants.</p>

      <p class="text">Alarm has been generated by the increasing
      number of medical liability suits filed recently by young
      adults who many years ago were blinded by retrolental
      fibroplasia before it was even known to the medical
      profession that excessive oxygen was the etiological factor.
      A New York case on this condition<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> was settled by a 21-year-old girl
      for $165,000 while the jury was deliberating the final
      damages they felt she should receive. The jury, when later
      polled, stated that hey would have come in with a verdict in
      her favor for $900,000. In support of the old adage that
      "nothing succeeds like success," and on the heels of the
      above successful settlement, a rash of suits on retrolental
      fibroplasia is being brought into courts today, especially on
      cases which occurred in the 1950's, when a maximum of $5,000
      coverage in malpractice insurance was considered completely
      adequate for a pediatrician. It is reported that such
      devastating lawsuits have already been filed in New York,
      Kentucky, and Iowa. Estimates indicate that as many as 5,000
      to 10,000 suits will be filed against pediatricians who
      apparently were responsible for the care of premature infants
      who developed retrolental fibroplasia. It must be stressed
      that the blind victims of this condition can be paraded
      before the judge and jury during the trial, resulting in
      sympathy for the plaintiff patient. One must realize that
      these cases are being brought into court even though the
      standard of care required <i>at the time the incident
      occurred</i> was met. They are also being brought against
      pediatricians in private practice, in small communities, as
      well as against pediatricians in academic settings who might
      well be expected to have more sophisticated equipment at
      hand. The Committee on the Fetus and the Newborn of the
      Academy has appointed a special task force to study the
      problem of retrolental fibroplasia. The author feels their
      research of the standard of care in vogue throughout the
      country during the 1950's could be beneficial in proving that
      the physician did not deviate from such standard, and
      therefore was not negligent.</p>

      <p class="text">Following the above trend, an upsurge of
      suits may be filed on behalf of victims suffering permanent
      damage from erythroblastosis fetalis, phenylketonuria, and
      other disabling diseases suffered by victims during their
      infancy. In order to prevail, plaintiffs in such suits must
      prove the pediatrician was negligent and did in fact deviate
      from the established standard of care required at the time
      the incident occurred was met.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">These belated suits so
      filed by the actual patient stress the fact to us that a
      minor upon reaching his majority may institute suit on his
      own behalf for harm done to him while he was an
      infant.</span> It may appear unfair to a pediatrician when he
      realizes he may be subject to a suit many years after the
      alleged incident occurred. The law has recognized that
      minors, because of their infancy, and incompetents are in
      need of protection. The law attempts to protect a child from
      an unfair settlement which someone else might have made on
      his behalf when he was an infant. Thus, the child, when he
      reaches his majority, usually 18 to 21 years of age may sue
      to rectify the inadequacy.</p>

      <p class="text">The drug-related suits included overdose,
      inappropriate drugs for the condition diagnosed by the
      pediatrician, failure to treat as required (silver nitrate
      eye prophylaxis), and several instances where tetanus
      resulted because the doctor failed to administer tetanus
      antitoxin after an injury, where the use of such prophylaxis
      was subsequently held to have been indicated. The recent
      Texas decision in the Reyes case<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> involving mass immunization with
      polio vaccine has alarmed pediatricians. Following an
      outbreak of polio in a Texas community, the Reyes infant
      received polio vaccine in a mass immunization effort. She
      subsequently contracted paralytic polio. Although the virus
      strain responsible for her attack of polio was different from
      the virus in the vaccine, identified as the "wild virus"
      responsible for the outbreak, the court held Wyeth
      Laboratories responsible, and awarded her $200,000 damages.
      The court held that manufacturers of vaccines were directly
      responsible for warning consumers in state polio
      immunizations campaigns that polio is a possible complication
      of polio immunization. The United States Supreme Court
      refused to review the case, so the Texas ruling stands. When
      the court holds that parents must be warned of <i>any</i>
      possible ill effects following <i>any</i> immunization, one
      naturally assumes that this would act as a deterrent to all
      efforts to maintain a high level of immunization of the
      children of this nation.</p>

      <h4>MONETARY DAMAGES</h4>

      <p class="text">In determining the amount of monetary damages
      which are to be awarded to the alleged victim of a negligent
      act, a number of factors are considered by the judge and/or
      jury. For instance, if a very young infant has been severely
      damaged from anoxia, and is in a vegetative state from which
      he will probably never emerge, he will require total care for
      the rest of his life. The anticipated life span can be
      calculated from actuarian tables with fair accuracy. Thus the
      total number of years during which custodial, medical, and
      other types of care will have to be provided, for an infant
      which will be over 70 years. These anticipated actual costs
      to the patient will be included in the measure of damages.
      They will include bills for hospital care, pediatricians,
      other and future physicians, nurses, laboratory tests,
      medications, special treatments, procedures etc. To these
      totals will be added the cost of day-to-day custodial care,
      and the loss of reasonable projected earnings the child will
      never realize because of his impaired physical and mental
      status. Some awards will also include a specific amount for
      the parents of the child for their "loss of the services and
      earnings" of the child.</p>

      <p class="text">When the above components of the award is
      computed, it is not unusual for the total amount to be
      several hundred thousand dollars. The legal custom today is
      to enter the courtroom with the amount of damages already set
      forth as part of the legal complaint filed. e. g. $5 million.
      Exclusion of this <i>ad damnum</i> clause is suggested by
      many lawyers who study the malpractice problem to avoid a
      suggested top figure.</p>

      <p class="text">It is unfortunate that the injured plaintiff
      receives only a small portion of the amount of damages
      awarded. Court costs, expenses, and the attorney,s contingent
      fee all absorb a large amount. The amount of the contingent
      fee may be established in advance by the attorney and the
      plaintiff and may exceed 40% of the award which will be
      recovered. Some state statutes may limit the amount of a fee
      which involves an infant, perhaps to 25%. Physicians propose
      that the contingent fee either be abolished or have limits
      set by law, comparable to awards utilized by workmen's
      compensation. Some legislation has been forthcoming in this
      area. Other recent legislation limits the amount a plaintiff
      may recover to $500,000 which statutory limitation will in
      all certainty be challenged in our courts as being
      unconstitutional.</p>

      <h4>"WHY MALPRACTICE SUITS"</h4>

      <p class="text">Many have conjectured as to why medical
      liability suits have increased so drastically in recent
      years. Some causes are levelled at physicians, to the effect
      that: (1) some will not admit to themselves that they have
      limitations either in training and experience; (2) they often
      take on more than they are qualified to do; (3) the
      physician-patient relationship has suffered due to excessive
      specialization; (4) they have permitted patients to lose
      confidence in and respect for the medical profession; (5)
      unwarranted poor rapport and communication with patients; (6)
      physicians fail to measure up to the doctors depicted in
      television shows; (7) physicians may press for payment of
      their bill and spur the patient to retaliate by some type of
      suit; and (8) careless remarks made by one physician against
      another, etc.</p>

      <p class="text">Some malpractice suits have led to beneficial
      changes in medical techniques either in the doctor's office
      or hospital setting. These would include many time-taking
      chores that heretofore have seemed inconsequential or
      trivial, for instance, better records, appropriate labeling
      of gas tanks, proper labeling of medicine, double or triple
      sponge and instrument counts, etc.</p>

      <p class="text">On the other hand, the threat of medical
      liability suits has resulted in physician practicing
      defensive medicine.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Doctors
      now have a tendency to overutilize diagnostic tests and
      procedures in some cases and to omit diagnostic procedures or
      new methods of therapy in others because of their hazard
      potential. Defensive medicine tests which are commonly used
      by pediatricians include the following: Routine skull X-rays
      on any child who bumps his head; medical consultations when
      not really indicated; routine battery of blood chemistry
      tests; routine exhaustive hematological tests; thyroid
      studies; electroencephalograms and spinal punctures routinely
      on first febrile seizure, etc. Conversely, the threat of
      malpractice suit may discourage the physician from performing
      procedures which might be necessary to help a patient.</p>

      <h4>PROGRESS TOWARD SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM</h4>

      <p class="text">The marked increase in medical liability
      insurance premiums has spurred action at many levels. Both
      national and state legislation is being considered or being
      enacted. The goal is to allow physicians to carry adequate
      medical liability insurance at reasonable prices. Some of the
      proposed enactments attempt to limit the amount of damages
      which a patient may recover for his alleged "malpractice"
      injuries (which enacted limits will undoubtedly be tested in
      court as to their constitutionality). The various medical and
      surgical specialty organizations, such as the American
      Academy of Pediatrics are studying the problem as it relates
      to their own members and are coming up with recommendations.
      An ad hoc committee on medical liability appointed by the
      Council on Pediatric Practice is processing a brochure on the
      subject for distribution to the members of the Academy. This
      follows a spot survey of the membership concerning their
      experience with malpractice problems. Doctors are using
      "self-help" tactics such as work stoppage, 24-hour
      moratoriums, etc., as pressure devices against insurance
      companies. The medical profession as a whole is taking steps
      toward recertification of physicians in order to determine
      their current competence to practice medicine. Those who are
      found to be incompetent will either be forced to withdraw
      from the practice of medicine or be extremely limited in what
      they are permitted to do. Purging of the medical profession,
      compelling it to adhere to the highest possible standards, is
      inevitable. Policing will come from outside the medical
      profession if physicians do not act promptly on
      self-discipline.</p>

      <h4>PROPHYLAXIS</h4>

      <p class="text">If a physicians commits willful or gross
      negligence, which results injury to a patient entrusted to
      his care, he, like anyone else, should be liable for the harm
      he inflicts.</p>

      <p class="text">Many suits are brought arising out of
      misunderstandings between the doctor and patient or,
      parenthetically, because of lack of communication between
      them. Information should be proffered, explanations should be
      made, but guarantees of a cure or perfect result should never
      be made. Such guarantees are interpreted by a court of law as
      a definite contract between the patient and his doctor on
      which the patient may sue his physician for breach of
      contract.</p>

      <p class="text">Be sure you obtain an informed consent prior
      to institution of therapy, and ideally from both parent or
      guardian and the child especially if the latter displays
      maturity of thought and judgment.</p>

      <p class="text">Exercise at least the same standard of care,
      skill and judgment as displayed by others in your
      specialty.</p>

      <p class="text">Pursue established methods of therapy; depart
      form such at your own peril; conduct research or experimental
      procedures only with informed consent of both parent or child
      (where the patient is 7 years of age or older).</p>

      <p class="text">Be sure the prescriptions you write are
      legible (preferably typewritten or printed); retain a copy
      for your records whenever possible. Mystique leads to
      mistakes!</p>

      <p class="text">Always order the customary and necessary
      laboratory tests, biopsies, and X-rays pertinent to the
      particular disease you are suspecting or treating; and once
      you order them obtain the results and study them. Enter date,
      time, and <i>personally sign or initial reports when read by
      you</i>.</p>

      <p class="text">Do not ignore a family's request for
      consultation. The public is aware that they have a right to
      request another physician's opinion. Consultations are of
      prime importance in cases involving newborn infants, in
      clinical conditions which are obscure, in patients who suffer
      from diseases or conditions with medical-legal or criminal
      implications, where there is a serious medical or surgical
      risk, where the diagnosis is not understood, if there is
      doubt concerning the best method of treatment, and if you
      sense belligerence as a reaction to your own findings and
      recommendations.</p>

      <p class="text">Complete and accurate records must be kept in
      both office and hospital. They should contain documentation
      of facts pertaining to the particular patient and his
      treatment. Good records constitute one aspect of defense in a
      malpractice suit. <span class="yellow">Records should be kept
      for at least 28 years on pediatric patients which will allow
      the statute of limitations to run after majority is reached.
      A 28-year period in which records should be kept is necessary
      in states like Illinois where the minor may institute suit
      upon reaching his majority (18 years) plus an additional
      ten-year period in which he "discovers" the harm done to him
      when he was an infant.</span> Records may be reduced to
      microfilm to facilitate storage, and the cost of microfilming
      will be added to the "cost of patient care."</p>

      <p class="text">Remember that some adults are habitual
      litigants or are more "suit-prone" than others. These include
      alcoholics, "doctor-shoppers," and emotionally disturbed
      patients, who should either be avoided or handled with
      special care.</p>

      <p class="text">Continuing medical education is now a basic
      requirement. Physicians must keep abreast of new developments
      in their own field or in any other field which may be
      relative.</p>

      <p class="text">Read the medical legal cases encountered in
      newspapers, medical journals, and "throwaway" journals. These
      will apprise you of recent decisions, new trends, damages
      awarded, etc.</p>

      <p class="text">Purchase adequate amount of medical liability
      insurance. Talk with your attorney about malpractice
      problems. As in law, as in medicine, as in mending, "a stitch
      in time saves nine."</p>

      <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>

      <p class="text">The issue of medical malpractice has reached
      crisis proportions in the United States today. Such is a
      consequence of the burgeoning number of suits, the exorbitant
      damages awarded, and the excessive premiums or inavailability
      of medical liability insurance. <span
      class="yellow">Pediatrics has until recently been a low risk
      specialty, but now suits are being brought against
      pediatricians with increasing frequency, especially against
      neonatologists.</span> Medical liability suits are brought on
      many different legal theories. Broad attempts are being made
      to resolve the problem. Pediatricians and others can and
      should take prophylactic steps to ward off such suits.</p>
