      conviction for sado-masochistic practices (sections 20 and 47
      of the Offences Against the Persons Act&nbsp;1861)</p>

      <p class="text1"><strong><i>Article 8 of the
      Convention</i></strong></p>

      <p class="text1">Common ground before Court: criminal
      proceedings against applicants constituted "interference by a
      public authority" with right to respect for private life,
      carried out "in accordance with the law" and in pursuance of
      legitimate aim ("protection of health or morals"). Only
      issue: whether interference "necessary in a democratic
      society".</p>

      <p class="text1">"<i>Necessary in a democratic
      society</i>"</p>

      <p class="text1">State unquestionably entitled to regulate
      through criminal law the infliction of physical harm -
      determination of tolerable level of harm where victim
      consents&nbsp;primarily a matter for State concerned.</p>

      <p class="text1">Court not persuaded that applicants'
      behaviour belonged to private morality and was excluded from
      State's intervention - evident from facts that activities
      involved significant degree of injury and wounding - State
      authorities were entitled to consider not only actual but
      also potential harm inherent in activities.</p>

      <p class="text1">No evidence to support allegation of
      authorities' bias against homosexuals - majority in House of
      Lords based decision on extreme nature of practices.</p>

      <p class="text1">Accordingly, reasons given by national
      authorities for interference are relevant and sufficient.</p>

      <p class="text1">Given degree of organisation, limited number
      of charges selected for prosecution, and reduced sentences
      imposed on appeal - interference not disproportionate.</p>

      <p class="text1">National authorities entitled to consider
      interference "necessary in a democratic society" for
      protection of health.</p>

      1996 and 20 January 1997,</p>

      <p class="text1">Delivers the following judgment, which was
      adopted on the last-mentioned date:</p>

      <p><strong><i class="boldtype">PROCEDURE</i></strong></p>

      <p class="text1">1. The case was referred to the Court by the
      European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") on 11
      December 1995, within the three-month period laid down by
      Article 32&nbsp;'&nbsp;1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It
      originated in applications (nos. 21627/93, 21826/93 and
      21974/93) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
      Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25
      on 14 December 1992 by three British nationals, Mr Colin
      Laskey, Mr Roland Jaggard and Mr&nbsp;Anthony Brown.</p>

      <p class="text1">The Commission's request referred to
      Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United
      Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court
      (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a
      decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a
      breach by the respondent State of its obligations under
      Article 8 of the Convention.</p>

      <p class="text1">2. In response to the enquiry made in
      accordance with Rule&nbsp;33&nbsp;'&nbsp;3&nbsp;(d) of Rules
      of Court A, the late Mr Laskey's father and the two other
      applicants stated that they wished to take part in the
      proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent
      them (Rule&nbsp;30).</p>

      <p class="text1">3. The Chamber to be constituted included
      <i>ex officio</i> Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of
      British nationality (Article&nbsp;43 of the Convention), and
      Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court
      (Rule&nbsp;21&nbsp;'&nbsp;4&nbsp;(b)). On 8 February 1996, in
      the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr
      R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members,
      namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr
      M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr P. Kuris and Mr E.
      Levits (Article 43&nbsp;<i>in fine</i> of the Convention and
      Rule 21&nbsp;'&nbsp;5).</p>

      <p class="text1">4. As President of the Chamber
      (Rule&nbsp;21&nbsp;'&nbsp;6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through
      the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom
      Government, the applicants' lawyers and the Delegate of the
      Commission on the organisation of the proceedings
      (Rules&nbsp;37&nbsp;'&nbsp;1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders
      made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's
      and the applicants' memorials on 2 and 15 July 1996
      respectively.</p>

      <p class="text1">5. On&nbsp;17 July 1996, the President
      granted leave to <a
      href="http://www.rightsinternational.org/"
      target="_blank"><i>Rights International</i></a>, a New
      York-based non-governmental Human Rights organisation, to
      submit written comments on specific aspects of the case (Rule
      37 ' 2). The comments were received on 16 August 1996.</p>

      <p class="text1">6. In accordance with the President's
      decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human
      Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 October 1996. The Court
      had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.</p>

      <p class="text1">There appeared before the Court:</p>

      <p class="text1">(a) <i>for the Government</i></p>

      <p class="text1">Mr I. Christie, Assistant Legal Adviser,
      Foreign and Commonwealth Office, <i>Agent</i>,</p>

      <p class="text1">Mr D. Jonas,</p>

      <p class="text1">Mr A. Hamilton,</p>

      <p class="text1">Mr I. Geffen, <i>Solicitors</i>,</p>

      <p class="text1">Mr J. Wadham, <i>Adviser</i>.</p>

      <p class="text1">The Court heard addresses by Mr Ress, Lord
      Lester of Herne Hill, Ms Worrall and Mr Pannick.</p>

      <p><strong><i class="boldtype">AS TO THE
      FACTS</i></strong></p>

      <p><strong><span class="bodytype">I. <i>The circumstances of
      the case</i></span></strong></p>

      <p class="text1">7. Mr Laskey, Mr Jaggard and Mr Brown, all
      British citizens, were born in 1943, 1947 and 1935
      respectively. Mr Laskey died on 14 May 1996.</p>

      <p class="text1">8. In 1987 in the course of routine
      investigations into other matters, the police came into
      possession of a number of video films which were made during
      sado-masochistic encounters involving the applicants and as
      many as 44 other homosexual men. As a result the applicants,
      with several other men, were charged with a series of
      offences, including assault and wounding, relating to
      sado-masochistic activities that had taken place over a
      ten-year period. One of the charges involved a defendant who
      was not yet 21 years old - the age of consent to male
      homosexual practices at the time. Although the instances of
      assault were very numerous, the prosecution limited the
      counts to a small number of exemplary charges.</p>

      <p class="text1">The acts consisted in the main of
      maltreatment of the genitalia (with, for example, hot wax,
      sandpaper, fish hooks and needles) and ritualistic beatings
      either with the assailant's bare hands or a variety of
      implements, including stinging nettles, spiked belts and a
      cat-o'-nine tails. There were instances of branding and
      infliction of injuries which resulted in the flow of blood
      and which left scarring.</p>

      <p class="text1">These activities were consensual and were
      conducted in private for no apparent purpose other than the
      achievement of sexual gratification. The infliction of pain
      was subject to certain rules including the provision of a
      code word to be used by any "victim" to stop an "assault",
      and did not lead to any instances of infection, permanent
      injury or the need for medical attention.</p>

      <p class="text1">9. The activities took place at a number of
      locations, including rooms equipped as torture chambers.
      Video cameras were used to record events and the tapes copied
      and distributed amongst members of the group. The prosecution
      was largely based on the contents of those video tapes. There
      was no suggestion that the tapes had been sold or used other
      than by members of the group.</p>

      <p class="text1">10. The applicants pleaded guilty to the
      assault charges after the trial judge ruled that they could
      not rely on the consent of the "victims" as an answer to the
      prosecution case.</p>

      <p class="text1">11. On 19&nbsp;December 1990, the defendants
      were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. On
      passing sentence, the trial judge commented: "the unlawful
      conduct now before the court would be dealt with equally in
      the prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out
      by them. The homosexuality of the defendants is only the
      background against which the case must be viewed."</p>

      <p class="text1">Mr Laskey was sentenced to imprisonment for
      four years and six months. This included a sentence of four
      years' imprisonment for aiding and abetting keeping a
      disorderly house (see paragraph 31 below) and a consecutive
      term of six months' imprisonment for possession of an
      indecent photograph of a child. Under section 47 of the
      Offences Against the Person Act 1861 ("the 1861 Act" - see
      paragraph 27 below), Mr&nbsp;Laskey also received concurrent
      sentences of twelve months' imprisonment in respect of
      various counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and
      aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily
      harm.</p>

      <p class="text1">12. Mr Jaggard was sentenced to imprisonment
      for three years. He received two years' imprisonment for
      aiding and abetting unlawful wounding - contrary to section
      20 of the 1861 Act (see paragraph 25 below) -, and a further
      twelve months' imprisonment for assault occasioning actual
      bodily harm, aiding and abetting the same offence, and
      unlawful wounding.</p>

      <p class="text1">13. Mr Brown was sentenced to imprisonment
      for two years and nine months. He received twelve months'
      imprisonment for aiding and abetting assault occasioning
      actual bodily harm, a further nine months' imprisonment for
      assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and a further twelve
      months' imprisonment for further assaults occasioning actual
      bodily harm.</p>

      <p class="text1">14. The applicants appealed against
      conviction and sentence.</p>

      <p class="text1">15. On 19 February 1992, the Court of
      Appeal, Criminal Division, dismissed the appeals against
      conviction. Since, however, the Court found that the
      applicants did not appreciate that their actions in
      inflicting injuries were criminal, reduced sentences were
      imposed.</p>

      <p class="text1">16. Mr Laskey's sentence was thus reduced to
      18 months' imprisonment as regards the charge of aiding and
      abetting keeping a disorderly house. This sentence was to run
      concurrently with another three months' sentence in respect
      of the various counts of assault and consecutively with six
      months' imprisonment for the possession of an indecent
      photograph of a child, totalling two years' imprisonment.</p>

      <p class="text1">17. Mr Jaggard's and Mr Brown's sentences
      were reduced to six months' and three months' imprisonment
      respectively.</p>

      <p class="text1">18. The applicants appealed to the House of
      Lords on the following certified point of law of public
      importance:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">"Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning
        him actual bodily harm in the course of a sado-masochistic
        encounter, does the prosecution have to prove lack of
        consent on the part of B before they can establish A's
        guilt under section 20 or section&nbsp;47 of the 1861
        Act?"</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">19. On 11 March 1993, the appeal, known as
      the case of <a href="/library/legal/rvbrown1993/"><i>R. v.
      Brown</i></a> ([1993] 2 All England Law Reports 75), was
      dismissed by a majority of the House of Lords, two of the
      five law lords dissenting.</p>

      <p class="text1">20. Lord Templeman, in the majority, held
      after reviewing the case-law that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">"... the authorities dealing with the
        intentional infliction of bodily harm do not establish that
        consent is a defence to a charge under the Act of 1861.
        They establish that consent is a defence to the infliction
        of bodily harm in the course of some lawful activities. The
        question is whether the defence should be extended to the
        infliction of bodily harm in the course of sado-masochistic
        encounters ...</p>

        <p class="text1">Counsel for the appellants argued that
        consent should provide a defence ... because it was said
        every person has a right to deal with his own body as he
        chooses. I do not consider that this slogan provides a
        sufficient guide to the policy decision which must now be
        taken. It is an offence for a person to abuse his own body
        and mind by taking drugs. Although the law is often broken,
        the criminal law restrains a practice which is regarded as
        dangerous and injurious to individuals and which if allowed
        and extended is harmful to society generally. In any event
        the appellants in this case did not mutilate their own
        bodies. They inflicted harm on willing victims ...</p>

        <p class="text1">In principle there is a difference between
        violence which is incidental and violence which is
        inflicted for the indulgence of cruelty. The violence of
        sado-masochistic encounters involves the indulgence of
        cruelty by sadists and the degradation of victims. Such
        violence is injurious to the participants and unpredictably
        dangerous. I am not prepared to invent a defence of consent
        for sado-masochistic encounters which breed and glorify
        cruelty ...</p>

        <p class="text1">Society is entitled and bound to protect
        itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from
        the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is
        uncivilised."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">21. Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle found
      that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">"In my view the line falls properly to be
        drawn between assault at common law and the offence of
        assault occasioning actual bodily harm created by section
        47 of the 1861 Act, with the result that consent of the
        victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter
        offence ... unless the circumstances fall within one of the
        well known exceptions such as organised sporting contests
        or games, parental chastisement or reasonable surgery ...
        the infliction of actual or more serious bodily harm is an
        unlawful activity to which consent is no answer.</p>

        <p class="text1">... Notwithstanding the views which I have
        come to, I think it right to say something about the
        submissions that consent to the activity of the appellants
        would not be injurious to the public interest.</p>

        <p class="text1">Considerable emphasis was placed by the
        appellants on the well-ordered and secret manner in which
        their activities were conducted and upon the fact that
        these activities had resulted in no injuries which required
        medical attention. There was, it was said, no question of
        proselytising by the appellants. This latter submission
        sits ill with the following passage in the judgment of the
        Lord Chief Justice:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bodytype">'They [Laskey and Cadman]
            recruited new participants: they jointly organised
            proceedings at the house where much of this activity
            took place; where much of the pain inflicting equipment
            was stored.</span></li>

            <li>
              <p class="text1">Cadman was a voyeur rather than a
              sado-masochist, but both he and Laskey through their
              operations at the Horwich premises were responsible
              in part for the corruption of a youth "K" who is now
              it seems settled into a normal heterosexual
              relationship.'</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <p>Be that as it may, in considering the public interest it
        would be wrong to look only at the activities of the
        appellants alone, there being no suggestion that they and
        their associates are the only practitioners of homosexual
        sado-masochism in England and Wales. This House must
        therefore consider the possibility that these activities
        are practised by others and by others who are not so
        controlled or responsible as the appellants are claiming to
        be. Without going into details of all the rather curious
        activities in which the appellants engaged it would appear
        to be good luck rather than good judgment which has
        prevented serious injury from occurring. Wounds can easily
        become septic if not properly treated, the free flow of
        blood from a person who is H.I.V. positive or who has Aids
        can infect another and an inflicter who is carried away by
        sexual excitement or by drink or drugs could very easily
        inflict pain and injury beyond the level to which the
        receiver had consented. Your Lordships have no information
        as to whether such situations have occurred in relation to
        other sado-masochistic practitioners. It was no doubt these
        dangers which caused Lady Mallalieu to restrict her
        propositions in relation to the public interest to the
        actual rather than the potential result of the activity. In
        my view such a restriction is quite unjustified. When
        considering the public interest potential for harm is just
        as relevant as actual harm. As Mathew J. said in
        Coney&nbsp;8 Queen's Bench 534, 547:</p>

        Lordships."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">22. Lord Mustill and Lord Slynn of Hadley
      dissented. The first considered that the case should not be
      treated as falling within the criminal law of violence but
      rather within the criminal law of private sexual relations.
      He gave weight to the arguments of the appellants concerning
      Article 8 of the Convention, finding that the decisions of
      the European authorities clearly favoured the right of the
      appellants to conduct their private life undisturbed by the
      criminal law. He considered after an examination of the
      relevant case-law that it was appropriate for the House of
      Lords to tackle afresh the question whether public interest
      required penalising the infliction of this degree of harm in
      private on a consenting recipient, where the purpose was not
      profit but gratification of sexual desire. He found no
      convincing argument on grounds of health (alleged risk of
      infections or spread of AIDS), the alleged risk of the
      activities getting out of hand or any possible risk of
      corruption of youth which might require the offences under
      the 1861 Act to be interpreted as applying to this
      conduct.</p>

      <p class="text1">23. Lord Slynn of Hadley found that as the
      law stood adults were able to consent to acts done in private
      which did not result in serious bodily harm. He agreed that
      it was in the end a matter of policy in an area where social
      and moral factors were extremely important and where
      attitudes could change. It was however for the legislature to
      decide whether such conduct should be brought within the
      criminal law and not for the courts in the interests of
      "paternalism" to introduce into existing statutory crimes
      relating to offences against the person concepts which did
      not properly fit there.</p>

      <p class="text1">24. The proceedings were given widespread
      press coverage. All the applicants lost their jobs and Mr
      Jaggard required extensive psychiatric treatment.</p>

      <p class="text1">32. Mr Laskey, Mr Jaggard and Mr Brown
      applied to the Commission on 14 December 1992. They relied on
      Articles 7 and 8 of the Convention, complaining that their
      convictions were the result of an unforeseeable application
      of a provision of the criminal law which, in any event,
      amounted to an unlawful and unjustifiable interference with
      their right to respect for their private life.</p>

      <p class="text1">33. On 18 January 1995, the Commission
      declared the applications (nos. 21627/93, 21826/93 and
      21974/93) admissible as to the complaint under Article 8 of
      the Convention. In its report of 26 October 1995
      (Article&nbsp;31), it expressed the opinion, by eleven votes
      to seven, that there had been no violation of that
      provision.</p>

      <p class="text1">The full text of the Commission's opinion
      and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is
      reproduced as an annex to this judgment[<a id="bk3"
      href="#fn3" name="bk3">fn3</a>] .</p>

      <p><strong><i class="boldtype">FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE
      COURT</i></strong></p>

      <p class="text1">34. At the hearing, the Government invited
      the Court to agree with the majority of the Commission that
      there had been no breach of the Convention in this case.</p>

      <p class="text1">The applicants, for their part, asked the
      Court to consider the position of each individual applicant
      upon the basis of the agreed facts and the charges which were
      pertinent to them and to find a violation of their right to
      respect for their private lives through the expression of
      their sexual personality, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the
      Convention.</p>

      <p><strong><i class="boldtype">AS TO THE LAW</i></strong></p>

      <p><strong><i class="bodytype"><b>ALLEGED VIOLATION OF
      ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION</b></i></strong></p>

      <p class="text1">35. The applicants contended that their
      prosecution and convictions for assault and wounding in the
      course of consensual sado-masochistic activities between
      adults was in breach of Article&nbsp;8 of the Convention,
      which provides:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">"1. Everyone has the right to respect for
        his private and family life, his home and his
        correspondence.</p>

        <p class="text1">2. There shall be no interference by a
        public authority with the exercise of this right except
        such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a
        democratic society in the interests of national security,
        public safety or the economic well-being of the country,
        for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection
        of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
        and freedoms of others."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">It was common ground among those appearing
      before the Court that the criminal proceedings against the
      applicants which resulted in their conviction constituted an
      "interference by a public authority" with the applicants'
      right to respect for their private life. It was similarly
      undisputed that the interference had been "in accordance with
      the law". Furthermore, the Commission and the applicants
      accepted the Government's assertion that the interference
      pursued the legitimate aim of the "protection of health or
      morals", within the meaning of the second paragraph of
      Article 8.</p>

      <p class="text1">36. The Court observes that not every sexual
      activity carried out behind closed doors necessarily falls
      within the scope of Article 8. In the present case, the
      applicants were involved in consensual sado-masochistic
      activities for purposes of sexual gratification. There can be
      no doubt that sexual orientation and activity concern an
      intimate aspect of private life (see, <i>mutatis
      mutandis</i>, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of
      22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, '&nbsp;52). However,
      a considerable number of people were involved in the
      activities in question which included, <i>inter alia</i>, the
      recruitment of new "members", the provision of several
      specially-equipped "chambers", and the shooting of many
      video-tapes which were distributed among the "members" (see
      paragraphs 8 and 9 above). It may thus be open to question
      whether the sexual activities of the applicants fell entirely
      within the notion of "private life" in the particular
      circumstances of the case.</p>

      <p class="text1">However, since this point has not been
      disputed by those appearing before it, the Court sees no
      reason to examine it of its own motion in the present case.
      Assuming, therefore, that the prosecution and conviction of
      the applicants amounted to an interference with their private
      life, the question arises whether such an interference was
      "necessary in a democratic society" within the meaning of the
      second paragraph of Article 8.</p>

      <p class="text1">"<strong><i>Necessary in a democratic
      society</i>"</strong></p>

      <p class="text1">37. The applicants maintained that the
      interference at issue could not be regarded as "necessary in
      a democratic society". This submission was contested by the
      Government and by a majority of the Commission.</p>

      <p class="text1">38. In support of their submission, the
      applicants alleged that all those involved in the
      sado-masochistic encounters were willing adult participants;
      that participation in the acts complained of was carefully
      restricted and controlled and was limited to persons with
      like-minded sado-masochistic proclivities; that the acts were
      not witnessed by the public at large and that there was no
      danger or likelihood that they would ever be so witnessed;
      that no serious or permanent injury had been sustained, no
      infection had been caused to the wounds, and that no medical
      treatment had been required. Furthermore, no complaint was
      ever made to the police - who learnt about the applicants'
      activities by chance (see paragraph&nbsp;8 above).</p>

      <p class="text1">The potential for severe injury or for moral
      corruption was regarded by the applicants as a matter of
      speculation. To the extent that issues of public morality had
      arisen - with reference to Mr&nbsp;Laskey's conviction for
      keeping a disorderly house and for the possession of an
      indecent photograph of a child (see paragraph 11 above) -
      these had been dealt with under the relevant sexual offences
      provisions and appropriately punished. In any event, such
      issues fell outside the scope of the case as presented before
      the Court.</p>

      <p class="text1">39. The applicants submitted that their case
      should be viewed as one involving matters of sexual
      expression, rather than violence. With due regard to this
      consideration, the line beyond which consent is no defence to
      physical injury should only be drawn at the level of
      intentional or reckless causing of serious disabling
      injury.</p>

      <p class="text1">40. For the Government, the State was
      entitled to punish acts of violence, such as those for which
      the applicants were convicted, that could not be considered
      of a trifling or transient nature, irrespective of the
      consent of the victim. In fact, in the present case, some of
      these acts could well be compared to "genital torture" and a
      Contracting State could not be said to have an obligation to
      tolerate acts of torture because they are committed in the
      context of a consenting sexual relationship. The State was
      moreover entitled to prohibit activities because of their
      potential danger.</p>

      <p class="text1">The Government further contended that the
      criminal law should seek to deter certain forms of behaviour
      on public health grounds but also for broader moral reasons.
      In this respect, acts of torture - such as those at issue in
      the present case - may be banned also on the ground that they
      undermine the respect which human beings should confer upon
      each other. In any event, the whole issue of the role of
      consent in the criminal law is of great complexity and the
      Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation
      to consider all the public policy options.</p>

      <p class="text1">41. The Commission noted that the injuries
      that were or could be caused by the applicants' activities
      were of a significant nature and degree, and that the conduct
      in question was, on any view, of an extreme character. The
      State authorities therefore acted within their margin of
      appreciation in order to protect its citizens from real risk
      of serious physical harm or injury.</p>

      <p class="text1">42. According to the Court's established
      case-law, the notion of necessity implies that the
      interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in
      particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim
      pursued; in determining whether an interference is "necessary
      in a democratic society", the Court will take into account
      that a margin of appreciation is left to the national
      authorities (see, <i>inter alia</i>, the Olsson v. Sweden
      (no. 1) judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp.
      31-32, ' 67), whose decision remains subject to review by the
      Court for conformity with the requirements of the
      Convention.</p>

      <p class="text1">The scope of this margin of appreciation is
      not identical in each case but will vary according to the
      context. Relevant factors include the nature of the
      Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual
      and the nature of the activities concerned (see the Buckley
      v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 September 1996,
      <i>Reports of Judgments and Decisions</i> 1996-IV,
      pp.1291-1292, ' 74).</p>

      <p class="text1">43. The Court considers that one of the
      roles which the State is unquestionably entitled to undertake
      is to seek to regulate, through the operation of the criminal
      law, activities which involve the infliction of physical
      harm. This is so whether the activities in question occur in
      the course of sexual conduct or otherwise.</p>

      <p class="text1">44. The determination of the level of harm
      that should be tolerated by the law in situations where the
      victim consents is in the first instance a matter for the
      State concerned since what is at stake is related, on the one
      hand, to public health considerations and to the general
      deterrent effect of the criminal law, and, on the other, to
      the personal autonomy of the individual.</p>

      <p class="text1">45. The applicants have contended that, in
      the circumstances of the case, the behaviour in question
      formed part of private morality which is not the State's
      business to regulate. In their submission the matters for
      which they were prosecuted and convicted concerned only
      private sexual behaviour.</p>

      <p class="text1">The Court is not persuaded by this
      submission. It is evident from the facts established by the
      national courts that the applicants' sado-masochistic
      activities involved a significant degree of injury or
      wounding which could not be characterised as trifling or
      transient. This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the
      present case from those applications which have previously
      been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual
      behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was
      present (see the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment cited
      above, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26&nbsp;October
      1988, Series A no.&nbsp;142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus
      judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259).</p>

      <p class="text1">46. Nor does the Court accept the
      applicants' submission that no prosecution should have been
      brought against them since their injuries were not severe and
      since no medical treatment had been required.</p>

      <p class="text1">In deciding whether or not to prosecute, the
      State authorities were entitled to have regard not only to
      the actual seriousness of the harm caused - which as noted
      above was considered to be significant - but also, as stated
      by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (see paragraph 21 above), to
      the potential for harm inherent in the acts in question. In
      this respect it is recalled that the activities were
      considered by Lord Templeman to be "unpredictably dangerous"
      (see paragraph 20 above).</p>

      <p class="text1">47. The applicants have further submitted
      that they were singled out partly because of the authorities'
      bias against homosexuals. They referred to the recent
      judgment in the Wilson case (see paragraph 30 above), where,
      in their view, similar behaviour in the context of a
      heterosexual couple was not considered to deserve criminal
      punishment.</p>

      <p class="text1">The Court finds no evidence in support of
      the applicants' allegations in either the conduct of the
      proceedings against them or the judgment of the House of
      Lords. In this respect it recalls the remark of the trial
      judge when passing sentence that "the unlawful conduct now
      before the court would be dealt with equally in the
      prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out by
      them" (see paragraph 11 above).</p>

      <p class="text1">Moreover, it is clear from the judgment of
      the House of Lords that the opinions of the majority were
      based on the extreme nature of the practices involved and not
      the sexual proclivities of the applicants (see paragraphs 21
      and 21 above).</p>

      <p class="text1">In any event, like the Court of Appeal, the
      Court does not consider that the facts in the Wilson case
      were at all comparable in seriousness to those in the present
      case (see paragraph 30 above).</p>

      <p class="text1">48. Accordingly, the Court considers that
      the reasons given by the national authorities for the
      measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and
      sufficient for the purposes of
      Article&nbsp;8&nbsp;'&nbsp;2.</p>

      <p class="text1">49. It remains to be ascertained whether
      these measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim or
      aims pursued.</p>

      <p class="text1">The Court notes that the charges of assault
      were numerous and referred to illegal activities which had
      taken place over more than ten years. However, only a few
      charges were selected for inclusion in the prosecution case.
      It further notes that, in recognition of the fact that the
      applicants did not appreciate their actions to be criminal,
      reduced sentences were imposed on appeal (see paragraphs
      15-17 above). In these circumstances, bearing in mind the
      degree of organisation involved in the offences, the measures
      taken against the applicants cannot be regarded as
      disproportionate.</p>

      <p class="text1">50. In sum, the Court finds that the
      national authorities were entitled to consider that the
      prosecution and conviction of the applicants were necessary
      in a democratic society for the protection of health within
      the meaning of Article 8 ' 2 of the Convention.</p>

      <p class="text1">51. In view of this conclusion the Court,
      like the Commission, does not find it necessary to determine
      whether the interference with the applicants' right to
      respect for private life could also be justified on the
      ground of the protection of morals. This finding, however,
      should not be understood as calling into question the
      prerogative of the State on moral grounds to seek to deter
      acts of the kind in question.</p>

      <p class="text1">In accordance with Article 51 ' 2 of the
      Convention and Rule&nbsp;53&nbsp;' 2 of Rules of Court A, the
      concurring opinion of Mr Pettiti is annexed to this
      judgment.</p>

      <p><strong><i class="bodytype">CONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE
      PETTITI</i></strong></p>

      <p class="text1">(provisional translation)</p>

      <p class="text1">I concurred with all my colleagues in
      finding that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the
      Convention. However, my reasoning differs from theirs in some
      respects.</p>

      <p class="text1">Firstly, the Court implicitly accepted that
      Article 8 was applicable since it assumed there had been an
      interference, and the application referred to State
      interference under Article 8 - "the institution of criminal
      proceedings infringed that Article".</p>

      <p class="text1">In my view, that Article was not even
      applicable in the instant case. The concept of private life
      cannot be stretched indefinitely.</p>

      <p class="text1">Not every aspect of private life
      automatically qualifies for protection under the Convention.
      The fact that the behaviour concerned takes place on private
      premises does not suffice to ensure complete immunity and
      impunity. Not everything that happens behind closed doors is
      necessarily acceptable. It is already the case in criminal
      law that the "rape" of a spouse where there is doubt whether
      consent was given may lead to prosecution. Other types of
      behaviour may give rise to civil proceedings (internal
      telephone-tapping for example). Sexual acts and abuse, even
      when not criminal, give rise to liability.</p>

      <p class="text1">The case could have been looked at
      differently, both in domestic law and subsequently under the
      Convention. Can one consider that adolescents taking part in
      sado-masochistic activities have given their free and
      informed consent where their elders have used various means
      of enticement, including financial reward?</p>

      <p class="text1">In domestic law, sado-masochistic activities
      could be made the subject of a specific criminal offence
      without that being contrary to Article&nbsp;8 of the European
      Convention on Human Rights.</p>

      <p class="text1">It seems to me that the wording used by the
      Court in paragraph&nbsp;42 is too vague. The margin of
      appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing
      with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above
      all so as to afford better protection to others;
      consequently, a reference to the M|ller and Others v.
      Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the
      reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment (cf.
      Olivier De Schutter's commentary on that judgment in <i>Revue
      trimestrielle des Droits de l'Homme</i>, Bruxelles 1997, pp.
      64-93).</p>

      <p class="text1">It seemed to me necessary to expand
      paragraph 43 by noting "to regulate and punish practices of
      sexual abuse that are demeaning even if they do not involve
      the infliction of physical harm".</p>

      <p class="text1">The dangers of unrestrained permissiveness,
      which can lead to debauchery, paedophilia or the torture of
      others, were highlighted at the Stockholm World Conference
      (cf. paragraph 11 of the judgment). The protection of private
      life means the protection of a person's intimacy and dignity,
      not the protection of his baseness or the promotion of
      criminal immoralism.</p>
