      <p><b>Editorial Comment:</b></p>

      <p>This <a href="/library/legal/conundrum/">lengthy legal
      document</a> illustrates the danger surgeons accept when
      operating for a nonmedical indication in minors. <span
      class="yellow">The authors carefully make the argument that
      circumcision, in the absence of a medical indication, may be
      unwise and may actually be illegal.</span> The continued
      widespread practice of circumcision hangs in the legal
      balance of valid permission from the parents to perform the
      procedure in their incompetent (in the eyes of the law)
      children. Valid permission requires that parents be provided
      with and fully comprehend the potential risks and
      complications, and appreciate the consequences of their
      decision.</p>

      <p>The authors further indicate that "<span
      class="yellow">Regardless of the motivations and desires of
      the physicians and parents, the only interventions for which
      parents may grant their permission are those conferring
      benefits that clearly outweigh the short and long-term costs
      for the infant patient.</span>" It is the impression of the
      authors that "Physicians today routinely fail to provide
      informed consent adequate to support the amputation of a
      highly sensitive and functional part of the body in a
      helpless infant."</p>

      <p>If circumcision becomes less commonly performed in North
      America, the legal system may no longer be able to ignore
      <span class="yellow">the conflict between the practice of
      circumcision and the legal and ethical duties of medical
      specialists.</span> This document is worth a read by all of
      us who perform newborn circumcision. I suspect that it will
      be used to support the argument of those who would favor
      outlawing routine circumcision.</p>
