        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both male
        and female circumcision are medically unnecessary
        procedures that can cause children to experience physical
        and psychological harm. State legislatures enacted FGM
        statutes to protect female minors from circumcision
        complications, but never extended the same protection to
        male children. This Comment does not suggest that female
        circumcision is less important than male circumcision or
        that it is not a serous, human rights problem. However,
        here in the United States male minors face circumcision on
        a wider scale, yet they are not legally protected from this
        painful, medically unnecessary procedure. Law criminalizing
        female circumcision are a step in the right direction
        toward protecting child welfare. However all children are
        at risk of being circumcised and yet currently only half
        are protected under these laws.</p>

        <p class="justified">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State laws
        violate the constitutional guarantee that similarly
        situated males and females be treated equally before the
        law. Notwithstanding a state government's good intentions,
        and its legal prorogative to protect young girls from an
        injurious procedure, the state court must extend the same
        legal protections to boys at risk for a similar procedure.
        Striking down unconstitutional FGM statutes and replacing
        them with gender neutral, generally applicable laws will
        protect all children from harm and further the state's
        legitimate interest in protecting child welfare without
        discriminating on the basis of gender.</p>
