Sir,<P>
Having read the supplement on circumcision [1] we feel that two 
points may be worthy of interest. The first concerns the theological 
theories for circumcision and the scarcity of any discussion 
concerning a more practical reason for initiating the procedure. It 
was noted in the desert conflicts of the Second World War, and 
more recently in the Gulf War, that soldiers appeared to suffer from 
an increased risk of posthitis. As much as religious doctrine is 
often underpinned by sensible practical reasoning and circumcision 
appears to have been initially practised by races from desert or 
arid regions, could the origin of circumcision have been to protect 
against this uncomfortable condition?

[CIRP note: The belief that circumcision benefits men who live in the desert is believed to be a medical myth.  CIRP is unaware of any medical evidence to support the  above claim of Drs. Green and Hunter-Campbell that posthitis is more prevalent in the desert.<BR>
 The part below is more important.  Drs. Green and Hunter-Campbell are warning that the British malpractice insurance companies may not defend doctors who perform non-therapeutic circumcisions and who are sued as a result of the circumcision.]</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The second issue concerns the indications for circumcision and 
legal issues. It may interest surgeons to know that a senior medico-
legal advisor recently stated that defence organizations would be 
less likely to support a surgeon who was operating in the UK for 
non-clinical reasons. Circumcision for purely religious reasons was 
included in this category.
