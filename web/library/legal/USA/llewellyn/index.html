<h2>Legal Remedies for Penile Torts</h2>

<p><b>By David J. Llewellyn, Attorney at Law*</b></p>
</center>

<p>It is an unfortunate fact in the United States that many
physicians treat the foreskin of the penis as though it were a
useless appendage, and therefore routinely remove it. It is equally
tragic that so many pediatricians do not how to care for an intact
child's penis properly. Many parents do not understand that when
their child's penis has been damaged they have legal recourse.</p>

<p class="text2">In February, 1992, James Thomas Brown was born at
Jackson Hospital and Clinic in Montgomery, Alabama. His mother knew
the value of his foreskin, and, when asked if she wanted her baby
circumcised if it were a boy, she said no. She never signed a
consent for circumcision. Unfortunately, the day after his birth,
little J.T. was taken from his mother by a nurse, strapped to a
Circumstraint board, and was circumcised. This tragedy occurred
because the nurse made an error and told the operating physician
that permission had been obtained. J.T.'s mother brought suit on
his behalf in the Circuit Court of Montgomery, Alabama, against
Jackson Hospital and the Clinic and the pediatrician who performed
the circumcision. Hugh V. Smith, Jr., of Montgomery, and myself
represented J.T. The case was tried before a jury in July,
1995.</p>

<p class="text2">At the trial the defendants claimed they had not
been negligent and also claimed J.T. had not been damaged. However,
cross-examination established that the foreskin performs several
valuable functions including protecting the glans of the penis from
burns and other damage. J.T.'s lawyers also submitted evidence that
the foreskin performs an important function in sexual intercourse
and provides significant pleasure to the adult male. J.T.'s expert
witness, Marilyn Milos, director of NOCIRC and Dr. James L. Snyder,
of Clifton Forge, Virginia, offered testimony in regard to the
important functions of the foreskin, the loss sustained be a child
who has been circumcised, including loss the loss of sensitivity to
the glans penis itself, the extreme pain suffered by a child
undergoing circumcision, and the cost of surgical foreskin
restoration. J.T.'s mother testified regarding the pain J.T.
exhibited for several weeks after his circumcision. The jury found
Jackson Hospital and Clinic liable for $10,000 in past damages and
$55,000 in future damages for total damages of $65,000.</p>

<p class="text2">Wrongful circumcision of infants is,
unfortunately, not as rare an occurrence as many parents would
believe. Because circumcision has become so routine in American
hospitals, incidents like the one involving J.T. Brown happen quite
often. However, when they do, physicians are often able to
discourage parents from pursuing their child's legal rights with
specious excuses such as "he would have to have it done later
anyway," or "everybody else has it done, so you should have too,"
or "we didn't do any damage." Many lawyers have probably been
discouraged from taking such cases either because they are
themselves ignorant of the foreskin's <a
href="/library/anatomy/">function</a> or because they do not believe
that such a case has much value.</p>

<p class="text2">Another tort, or civil wrong, that is often
committed by doctors involves the forcible retraction of the infant
foreskin. Although it has been established for over 25 years in the
medical literature that the natural connections between the
foreskin and the glans of the penis which exists at birth dissolve
slowly over time, many physicians still ignorantly believe that
these synechia, or what are often incorrectly called "adhesions,"
must be broken early in life. They, therefore, without consulting
the parents, forcibly retract the foreskin and tear the connecting
synechia. This causes the child extreme pain and may result in the
formation of scar tissue, which can cause future problems. Parents
should be aware that this ignorance extends even to pediatricians
who treat lawyer's children. My wife had to pull our oldest son out
of the hands of our first pediatrician and leave his office in
tears because he was insistent upon forcibly retracting our son's
naturally connected foreskin. Without his intervention our son's
foreskin slowly retracted over the years and was fully retractable
by the age of eight. His younger brother's foreskin was still not
entirely retractable at the age of ten. However, this is entirely
<a href="/library/normal/">normal</a>.</p>

<p class="text2">Generally the law does not permit a physician to
carry out a non-emergency invasive or damaging procedure on a child
without the parent's permission. If an infant's foreskin is
forcibly retracted, resulting in tearing and pain, and the parents
have not given their permission for the procedure, the law of most
states provides that the parents may bring a suit on behalf of the
child for assault and battery against the physician. Parents should
be aware of these facts and should consult competent counsel if
their child has been forced to suffer unnecessary pain without
their permission.</p>

<p class="text2">Parents should also be aware that numerous
children have been damaged by circumcision. One of the most common
complications of circumcision is removing the skin of the shaft of
the penis itself. This can result in many different complications
including retraction of the penis into the base of the abdomen,
curving of the penis or painful erections. The penis can be damaged
further by cutting off part of the glans. Parents should be aware
that while circumcision, in and of itself, causes damage and
permanent loss, a negligently performed circumcision, even if done
with permission, <span class="yellow">allows their child to recover
damages.</span> Because many states have enacted short statutes of
limitation and/or repose, which significantly shortens the time
within which persons may bring lawsuits for personal injuries,
parents who believe their child has been damaged by negligently
performed circumcision should consult with an independent physician
and legal counsel without delay.</p>

<p class="text2">Unfortunately there are a few even more tragic
cases each year that result in the total loss of the penis during
circumcision or the death of the child from complications. If any
of these events occur, parents should immediately contact legal
counsel.</p>

<p class="text2">Some parents find out the facts about the risks
and disadvantages of circumcision only after they have had their
baby boy circumcised. Sometimes they have agreed to circumcision
because the physician has given them false information regarding
the purported benefits of the procedure. Sometimes they have not
been fully informed of the risks of the procedure and of its
consequences by the physician beforehand. If they have been
deceived, the law in most states allows them to bring an action for
fraud. If they have not been fully informed, the law of some states
allows them to bring an action for failure to obtain informed
consent. Parents with concerns in this regard should consult with a
lawyer.</p>

<p class="text2">In short, parents whose children have been damaged
through wrongful circumcision, forcible retraction, or negligently
performed circumcision have legal rights which they can enforce on
behalf of their child. No parent should fail to do so because such
failure only encourages physicians to continue committing "penile
torts." The safety of America's male infants is at stake unless
parents call negligent doctors, hospitals and clinics to
account.</p>
