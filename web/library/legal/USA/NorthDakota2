The following is a list of pretrial questions, etc., Zenas Baer has served
on the State of ND. I post them so others may learn how we are proceding
and learn from our mistakes and makes suggestions as we go along. This is
certainly not going to be the only court fight, so we all need to learn how
to do the best possible so eventually someone will win  the legal approach.
