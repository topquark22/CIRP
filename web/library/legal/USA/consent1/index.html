      <h2>Can Informed Consent be Obtained?</h2>

      <h3>by Robert Van Howe, MD</h3>
    </div>

    <p>In February 1995 the American Academy of Pediatrics
    Committee on Bioethics released a statement on 'Informed
    Consent, Parental Permission, an Assent in Pediatric
    Practice.'<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately, this committee's
    re-analysis and redefining of these concepts put them at odds
    with the Academy's position on neonatal circumcision. The
    concept of informed consent does not now apply, because only a
    competent person can give consent (informed or otherwise), and
    an infant clearly is not competent. For the same reason patient
    assent does not apply. Finally, the concept of informed
    parental permission cannot apply because informed parental
    permission, according to the Committee on Bioethics, allows for
    medical interventions only in situations of clear and immediate
    medical necessity, such as disease, trauma, or deformity.
    Routine neonatal circumcision satisfies none of these
    requirements. If none of these categories are appropriate for
    routine neonatal circumcision, can a parent legally give
    permission for this procedure to be performed upon their son
    before he attains the age of reason? The committee suggests
    that in non-essential treatments, which could be deferred
    without substantial risk, that the physician and family wait
    until the child's consent could be obtained.</p>

    <p>In <i>Re Phillip B.</i> The California Court of Appeal ruled
    that parental autonomy is not absolute. In <i>Little v
    Little</i> a 14 year old mentally incompetent but otherwise
    perfectly healthy, daughter applied (through a guardian ad
    litem ) for an order authorising her mother to consent to the
    removal of a kidney from the her body, for the purpose of
    transplanting the kidney into her brother who was suffering
    from endstage renal disease.</p>

    <p>A Texas Court of Appeal said no. 'Significantly, however,
    for our purposes, this power of parents ... to consent to
    surgical intrusions upon the person of the minor ... is limited
    to the power to consent to medical 'treatment.' Black's Law
    Dictionary defines medical treatment as 'a broad term covering
    all steps taken to effect a cure of any injury or disease: the
    word including examination and diagnosis as well as application
    of remedies.' To date, all courts have held that surgical
    removal of any normal healthy, non-diseased, uninjured part of
    the body is not 'treatment.'</p>

    <p>In a similar transplantation case, a Louisiana Court of
    Appeal ruled that surgery could not take place and the Court
    owed 'protection to a minor's right to be free in his person
    from bodily intrusion to the extent of the loss of an organ
    unless such loss be in the best interest of the minor.'
    Likewise, the ruling in Wisconsin v Yoder subjects parental
    duty and right to limitations 'if it appears that parental
    decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or
    have potential for significant social burdens.'</p>

    <p>Following in kind, <i>Kate's School v Department of
    Health</i> limited a parents' right to prescribe their
    treatment of choice for their mentally retarded children.</p>

    <p>In <i>Valerie N. v Valerie N.</i> The California Supreme
    Court found that the parents as 'conservators, were not
    entitled to have conservatee, who was unable to consent to
    sterilization, sterilized inasmuch as there was neither
    evidence of necessity ... nor sufficient evidence that less
    intrusive means ... were not presently available to
    conservatee.' The Court further held '... as to those medical
    procedures permitted after court authorization the Legislature
    has required a judicial determination that the condition of the
    conservatee 'require the recommended course of medical
    treatment.' The Court also found it is necessary to 'preserve
    the right ... to be free of intrusive medical and surgical
    procedures.'</p>

    <p>In <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html"
    target="_blank"><i>Prince v Massachusetts</i></a>, The United
    States Supreme Court ruled that 'parents may be free to become
    martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free ... to
    make martyrs of their children before that have reached the age
    of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for
    themselves.'</p>

    <p>With these legal precedents in place and parents unable give
    assent or permission under the Committee on Bioethics
    guidelines, can a physician ethically or legally perform a
    'prophylactic' circumcision on a newborn? The Committee states
    that pediatric health care providers 'have legal and ethical
    duties to their child patients to render competent medical care
    based on what the patient needs, not what someone else
    expresses. Although impasses regarding the interests of minors
    and the expressed wishes of their parents or guardians are
    rare, the pediatrician's responsibilities to his or her patient
    exist independent of parental desires or proxy consent. Based
    on the current case law, <a
    href="http://www.noharmm.org/bonner.htm"
    target="_blank">Charles A. Bonner, J.D.</a> a specialist in
    medical malpractice concludes, 'Once it is shown that a child
    has been subject to an injury to his sexual organ without ...
    medical necessity, a case may be made for enforcement of
    existing state laws prohibiting assault and battery, conspiracy
    to assault and batter, child abuse, and sexual abuse.'</p>
