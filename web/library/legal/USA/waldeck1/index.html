        <h3>USING MALE CIRCUMCISION TO UNDERSTAND<br />
         SOCIAL NORMS AS MULTIPLIERS</h3>

        <p><i>Sarah E. Waldeck</i>*</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">A recent explosion of law and norms
      scholarship has been aimed at understanding how social norms
      regulate human behavior.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Like
      the law, social norms establish what constitutes appropriate
      conduct and carry the threat of punishment, either sanction
      by members of the community or the self-imposed guilt that
      comes from knowing one has behaved wrongly or
      inappropriately. Indeed, some norms control behavior so
      effectively that the distinction between what is law and what
      is convention almost ceases to exist: people comply with
      whatever the rule might be, without giving much thought to
      its source. To illustrate the point, when circumcision rates
      in the United States were more than 70 percent, nearly 10
      percent of parents thought the procedure was required by law,
      much like it mandates the installation of silver nitrate
      drops into a newborn's eyes shortly after birth.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">To date, much of the law and norms
      scholarship has been developed by theorists whose primary
      affiliation is with the law and economics movement. At least
      part of the appeal of social norm theory lies in its ability
      to explain how apparently irrational behavior is, in
      actuality, the product of rational, utilitarian
      decisionmaking. In the simplest of terms, these scholars
      envision the benefit (or cost) of complying with the
      predominant social norm as one of the many factors figuring
      into the analysis that an individual conducts before deciding
      to engage in a particular behavior. For instance, when a
      person decides whether to recycle, she not only weighs the
      inconvenience against the environmental effects, she also
      considers the norm-based benefits of recycling, such as the
      avoidance of the guilt that might result from not recycling
      or <span class="page">[page 456]</span> the social capital
      that is gained by appearing to be the sort of person who
      recycles.</p>

      <p class="text2">This Article argues that social norms are
      more than just discrete factors in the behavioral
      cost-benefit analysis. Instead, norms are more accurately
      described as a variable that colors every aspect of the
      analysis, thereby encouraging an individual to either
      exaggerate or diminish the significance of other factors that
      figure into the behavioral calculus. To be sure, deviance
      from, or compliance with, a norm may have its own cost or
      benefit that factors into the analysis-whether it be guilt,
      esteem, or the capital that might hinge on whether one sends
      the optimal social signal. But this Article argues that an
      equally important function of norms is to affect the way
      individuals understand information, so that from the outset
      the behavioral outcome is weighted in favor of the
      predominant social norm.</p>

      <p class="text2">This observation enriches social norm theory
      in several ways. First, it shows that despite the attention
      that the academy has given to social norms in recent years,
      legal scholars continue to undervalue the role that norms
      play in shaping and controlling human behavior. Second, it
      addresses a criticism often leveled at social norms
      scholarship: that a utilitarian theory of decisionmaking is
      too neat to explain human behavior, which is complicated and
      often appears to be anything but rational. This Article
      argues that social norms are messy because they both create
      discrete, norm-based costs and benefits, and act as
      multipliers that distort our perception of the other,
      non-norm-based costs and benefits associated with a
      particular behavioral choice. Finally, recognition of the
      dual nature of social norms enhances our understanding of how
      the law can effectively change norms. Some legal scholars
      have already suggested that careful measures that gradually
      erode a norm are usually more effective than laws aimed at
      immediate, wholesale change. This Article suggests that the
      most careful measures will undo the distortion caused by the
      predominant norm, so that an individual begins to appreciate
      the true costs and benefits associated with a particular
      decision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The law and norms movement has often been
      criticized for producing "too much scholarship that is
      abstract and methodological rather than devoted to
      understanding particular problems of law and social
      behavior"<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and for failing to
      rely heavily on empirical data to produce <span
      class="page">[page 457]</span> "situation-specific insights
      that can assist policymakers dealing with relevant
      problems."<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> In contrast, this
      Article examines the dual nature of social norms and the
      implications for policy makers by closely examining the
      social phenomena of routine neonatal circumcision- the
      surgical procedure performed during early infancy, in a
      hospital or doctor's office, for non-religious purposes.</p>

      <p class="text2">At first blush, neonatal circumcision may
      seem a strange explanatory vehicle. Some readers are likely
      to have strong sentiments about the appropriateness or
      inappropriateness of the procedure, while others may find the
      subject threatening, either because of their own circumcision
      status or that of their sexual partner, or because they once
      decided whether to circumcise a son. Still other readers have
      probably never paused to think about routine circumcision,
      because most American cultural groups consider the
      circumcised penis "natural."</p>

      <p class="text2">But the practice of male circumcision is a
      quintessential social norm, as a brief cross-cultural
      comparison helps demonstrate. In Sweden, for example, routine
      circumcision is non-existent and widely perceived as an
      assault on the child, with the Swedish Parliament recently
      voting to strictly regulate the conditions under which
      religious circumcisions may be performed.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> South Korea, on the other hand, has a
      routine circumcision rate of about 90 percent, higher than
      any other country. Most of the reasons South Korean parents
      give for circumcising their sons are familiar to American
      parents, including fear that uncircumcised boys will be the
      object of ridicule, ease of penile hygiene, and medical
      benefits. But South Korean boys are circumcised (with
      anesthesia) during late elementary school, primarily because
      both parents and children see circumcision as a rite of
      passage into adulthood.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> If the
      thought of having a ten year-old circumcised makes you wince,
      South Koreans have the same response to our practice, with a
      significant percentage believing that a newborn is
      ill-equipped to handle the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> As two prominent sociologists have
      commented, sensitivity to social norms is best illustrated by
      matters that involve sexuality, as "it is unlikely that one
      can conjure up any image that will not correspond to what in
      some other culture is an established norm, or at least an
      occurrence to be <span class="page">[page 458]</span> taken
      in stride."<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> As such, routine
      neonatal circumcision is the ideal vehicle for exploring and
      enhancing the ideas that currently dominate the social norms
      literature.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Article proceeds in three parts. Part I
      begins by discussing how current social norm theory adopts an
      essentially utilitarian view of human decisionmaking and
      conceives of norm-based considerations as a discrete factor
      in the behavioral calculus. Part I then argues that social
      norms are better understood as not only stand-alone factors
      in the cost-benefit analysis, but also as variables that
      distort a decisionmaker's understanding of every element in
      the behavioral calculus. Part II turns to the concrete
      example of routine neonatal circumcision. It provides a brief
      history of routine circumcision in the United States and
      shows how social norm theory helps explain why the procedure
      became standard practice. Part II next turns to the current
      debate on circumcision and discusses why parents continue to
      circumcise even though the procedure is no longer medically
      recommended. Here discrete norm-based considerations continue
      to have explanatory value, but do not satisfactorily account
      for parental behavior. Part II then demonstrates the
      usefulness of perceiving a social norm as a multiplier that
      affects every aspect of the cost-benefit analysis, thereby
      allowing the decisionmaker to either exaggerate or diminish
      the significance of other factors that figure into the
      behavioral calculus. Finally, Part III builds on the work of
      other norm theorists to suggest that narrow legal
      interventions that undo the distorting effect of social norms
      may be the most effective strategy for changing a pervasive
      norm. Part III then illustrates how this strategy would work
      in practice by examining empirical evidence to determine
      which legal measures would be most likely to tip the norm in
      favor of noncircumcision.</p>

        Cost-Benefit Analysis</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The current thrust of the law and norms
      movement is best illustrated by the work of three theorists:
      Robert Cooter, Richard McAdams, and Eric Posner. Robert
      Cooter's conception of social norms is related to expected
      utility theory, which predicts that because an individual
      wishes to maximize her utility, she will choose the option
      with the greatest <span class="page">[page 459]</span>
      expected net benefit.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The
      problem for expected utility theory, however, is that some
      choices do not appear to maximize utility. Tipping is a
      frequently used example. If a person is at a restaurant to
      which she never expects to return, she should not tip the
      waiter, at least not in rational economic terms. The tip will
      add to the cost of the meal that has already been consumed
      and will not help guarantee good service in the future. Yet
      most people tip regardless of whether they plan to
      return.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Cooter argues that in
      scenarios such as this, the existence of a norm changes the
      individual's cost-benefit calculus.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Specifically, Cooter posits that norms
      develop when there is "[u]nanimous endorsement" of behavior
      that "will convince some members of the community to
      internalize the obligation, and to inculcate it in the
      young."<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Because of
      internalization, the individual who does not comply with the
      norm experiences guilt or shame. In other words, the
      individual herself imposes a cost for non-compliance. If the
      guilt or shame is great enough, the individual maximizes
      utility by complying with the norm, whether it be tipping or
      some other behavior. Richard McAdams's vision of norms is
      also related to utility theory, but he sees norms functioning
      primarily as sources of external sanction. According to
      McAdams's esteem theory, norms are created and reinforced
      because people react to, and desire, the esteem of others. He
      argues that norms arise when (1) prior to the development of
      any widespread convention, a consensus exists about the
      desirability of a particular behavior; (2) there is some risk
      that others will detect whether a particular individual
      engages in the behavior; and (3) the consensus and risk of
      detection is well-known by the relevant population.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Assume, for example, that after a series of
      well-publicized studies on automobile safety, a widespread
      consensus develops that children under twelve are safer in
      the backseat. This prescription poses a variety of practical
      problems: carpooling is more difficult; parents with multiple
      children will have to buy larger, more expensive vehicles;
      unpleasant confrontations are likely with the child who
      insists on sitting in the front. <span class="page">[page
      460]</span> In the face of these and other costs, parents may
      not put children in the back if the only perceived benefit is
      increased safety during the highly unlikely event of an
      accident.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> According to esteem
      theory, however, the desire for esteem creates an additional
      benefit-the approval of those who see the parent placing
      children in the backseat. As McAdams writes, "[i]f the
      consensus is that [engaging or not engaging in a particular
      behavior deserves esteem, a norm will arise if the esteem
      benefits exceed, for most people, the costs of engaging [or
      not engaging in the behavior]."<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Like Cooter, then, McAdams perceives
      human decisionmaking as essentially utilitarian, with
      individuals conducting a series of cost-benefit analyses. The
      esteem derived from engaging or not engaging in a particular
      behavior can be the decisive factor in determining how an
      individual will act. If enough people sufficiently value the
      esteem that comes with a particular action or inaction, a
      norm will arise.</p>

      <p class="text2">Once the norm is established, compliance
      with the norm may not be a means of gaining esteem; rather,
      compliance is necessary to avoid a loss of esteem.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> To again use the automobile safety
      example, imagine that a significant percentage of parents put
      children under twelve in the back. Now the parent who
      complies with the norm does not gain esteem, because she is
      simply "doing what parents do." But the parent who does not
      comply with the norm will lose esteem, because she is not
      doing what parents do. Moreover, the cost of non-compliance
      increases as overall compliance with the norm increases. As
      McAdams explains,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"[b]ecause esteem is relative, the intensity of
        disesteem directed at those who engage in a disapproved
        behavior is partly a function of the total number of people
        who are thought to engage in that behavior . . . . Thus,
        because individuals value esteem relatively, the more a
        behavior negatively distinguishes them from others, the
        more costly it is."<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">This feedback process can have the effect of
      "tipping," so that once a particular threshold is reached,
      the esteem cost is strong enough that it deters most
      deviance.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>
      <span class="page">[page 461]</span> 

      <p class="text2">Like Cooter, McAdams views norms as
      obligations.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Indeed, McAdams
      reconciles his theory with Cooter's in a way that will prove
      important for this Article. McAdams argues that if
      internalization occurs, it is most likely to occur with
      abstract norms, like "be a good neighbor" or "be a good
      citizen." The esteem-based norm is more concrete, in that it
      defines what behavior violates the abstract norm, like "not
      mowing your lawn" or "not voting."<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> In the automobile safety example,
      the internalized abstract norm is "be a good parent," while
      the esteem-based prescriptive norm is "put children in the
      backseat." Thus, esteem-based norms can generate internal as
      well as external sanctions because the individual will feel
      guilty about violating the prescription for being a good
      parent, a good neighbor, or whatever the abstract norm might
      be.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The third relevant theory is Eric Posner's
      "signaling model." For Posner, social norms are thinner than
      for Cooter and some other social norm theorists. A norm "is
      not an exogenous force, it is not internalized; it is a term
      for behavioral regularities that emerge as people interact
      with each other in pursuit of their everyday
      interests."<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> Stripped to its
      bare essentials, signaling theory posits that norms develop
      as individuals try to signal that they are of a "good
      type"-i.e., that they are the sort of people with whom others
      should cooperate.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> The desired
      cooperation varies depending on context. A bond trader may
      supply a client with sought-after sports tickets to signal
      that he is worthy of continued business; a prospective job
      candidate may dress carefully for an interview to signal that
      she will be a good employee.</p>

      <p class="text2">Signaling theory applies to social matters
      as well. As Posner describes, "[s]ome people pay for
      elaborate and time-consuming hairstyling, invest in contact
      lenses rather than glasses, pierce ears and other body parts,
      tattoo or scar or brand themselves."<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> Regardless of the context, the
      behavior that Posner categorizes as "signaling" is observable
      and connected to appearances. It is also arbitrary, in that
      people attach significance to the behavior (for example,
      dressing nicely) only because of prior beliefs about the sort
      of people who engage in the particular behavior. Finally,
      signaling behavior is costly, in terms of time, actual
      dollars, or physical discomfort.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> Similar to McAdams, <span
      class="page">[page 462]</span> Posner argues that individuals
      incur these costs as a means of establishing or preserving
      their reputations.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">To recap, for these social norm theorists,
      human decisionmaking is essentially utilitarian. While each
      theorist envisions norms generating a different kind of cost
      or benefit, each sees norms operating as a discrete factor in
      the behavioral calculus. Consider recycling, an example
      thatis often used in the norms literature. As others have
      pointed out,<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> in the absence
      of a pro-recycling norm, the decision to recycle is a
      puzzling one. Recycling is inconvenient, because it requires
      the rinsing of items that would otherwise simply be
      discarded, the sorting and separation of different kinds of
      trash, and in some jurisdictions, regular trips to a
      recycling collection point. Moreover, the environmental
      impact of a single individual's recycling effort is
      negligible; whether a single Coke can goes into the trash or
      the recycle bin is of virtually no environmental consequence.
      In other words, an individual weighing only the inconvenience
      against the environmental impact would almost certainly
      choose not to recycle. But according to these theorists,
      individuals weigh the inconvenience of recycling against more
      than just the environmental benefit. They also take
      norm-based considerations into account, such as the guilt
      that may result from failing to be the sort of citizen who
      recycles, or the possibility of being thought less of when
      non-recycling becomes apparent to the neighbors. Thus these
      norm-based considerations function as discrete factors in the
      behavior cost-benefit analysis.</p>

        <p><i>B. Norms as Multipliers</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The utilitarian explanation of human
      decisionmaking has been broadly challenged by social
      scientists<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> and criticized in
      some of the legal literature.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>
      The central objection is that when decisions are complex, we
      lack the time and resources to gather all the relevant data,
      as well as the cognitive capacity to determine all the
      positive and negative consequences of a particular course of
      action. So alternative theories of decisionmaking abound. To
      name only a few, researchers have hypothesized that humans
      "satisfice" by looking for the action that <span
      class="page">[page 463]</span> meets specific minimum
      requirements and is thus "good enough" (as opposed to the
      best available alternative); that decisionmaking is
      essentially "a sequential narrowing-down process, similar to
      the logic employed in the popular game Twenty Questions";
      that we often use simple moral precepts as the sole basis for
      a decision; and that we frequently use heuristics, or mental
      shortcuts, to make decisions. In light of the overwhelming
      evidence of how frequently we fail to engage in classic
      cost-benefit analyses, even many of the scholars whose work
      assumes that we have "the logic of a supercomputer, boundless
      knowledge, and all eternity to make a decision" will concede
      that humans often fail to maximize utility.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">However, even if one rejects some of the
      classic assumptions of law and economics, the work that has
      been done on law and norms is nonetheless important. While we
      are often either incapable of, or uninterested in, choosing
      the course of action that maximizes utility, we do sometimes
      try&mdash;however imperfectly&mdash;to find the best
      alternative. And the central point of law and norms
      scholarship is that norms are an important part of this
      endeavor. But norms are even more important than the current
      legal scholarship acknowledges, because they do not just
      impose costs and benefits for us to consider. Norms also act
      as multipliers that affect how we perceive the other
      information that is relevant to a particular decision.</p>

      <p class="text2">For instance, consider again the example of
      recycling. Assume that a person knows that many of her
      neighbors recycle and that the local government has gone to
      some effort to encourage its citizens to recycle; in other
      words, assume the person is aware of the norm favoring
      recycling. Also assume that the person is interested in
      making the best decision, and believes (rightly or wrongly)
      that the decision whether to recycle is relatively
      straightforward, with only a few relevant variables: the
      environmental impact of recycling (<i>ei</i>), the external
      esteem that recycling garners (<i>ee</i>), the personal
      satisfaction that comes from perceiving one's self as a good
      citizen (<i>ps</i>), and recycling's inconvenience
      (<i>i</i>). As the person becomes cognizant of the norm, she
      may begin to exaggerate the environmental impact of her own
      recycling, perhaps on the theory that if individual effort
      has negligible effect, few of her neighbors would choose to
      recycle. At the same time, she might discount the
      inconvenience of recycling, again on the theory that if
      everyone is doing it, the demands of recycling cannot be all
      that onerous. To illustrate with an equation (where boldface
      indicates a <span class="page">[page 464]</span> norm with an
      exaggerating effect, and regular typeface indicates a norm
      with a discounting effect), the person chooses to recycle
      because:</p>

      <p class="formula">((<b>norm *</b> <i>ei</i>) + <i>ee</i> +
      <i>ps</i>) &gt; (norm * <i>i</i>)</p>

      <p class="text2">If norms function as external variables that
      affect the way decisionmakers understand information, then
      the behavioral outcome will always be weighted in favor of
      the predominant social norm, regardless of what other factors
      enter into the behavior calculus. In other words, the norm
      carries more force than other considerations in the
      cost-benefit analysis, because the norm both imposes its own
      set of costs and benefits and colors a decisionmaker's
      perception of other relevant factors.</p>

      <p class="text2">To further complicate matters, even for a
      single decision, the distorting norm will not have a constant
      value. Consider another example, the decision to place a two
      year-old in a car seat. Assume that the parent is expecting
      an infant and that the two year old is both old enough and
      large enough that the car seat is no longer required by law.
      Some benefits of placing the two year-old in the car seat are
      fairly obvious: safety (<i>s</i>), as well as the norm-based
      personal satisfaction (<i>ps</i>) that comes from "doing what
      good parents do" and the external esteem (<i>ee</i>) of being
      perceived as the sort of parent who straps in a toddler. Some
      costs are relatively apparent as well: the expense of buying
      a new car seat for the infant (<i>cs</i>), the hassle of
      having to repeatedly buckle and unbuckle the two year-old
      (<i>b</i>), and perhaps the investment in an automobile that
      is large enough to accommodate two car seats (<i>a</i>). Some
      of these costs weigh more heavily against the
      pro-car-seat-norm than others. As such, the norm would have
      the strongest diminishing effect on what the parent perceives
      as the greatest cost&mdash;perhaps the investment in a new
      vehicle. In contrast, if the parent perceived the cost of the
      additional car seat as negligible, the norm would have little
      or no discounting effect. Similarly, if a consideration
      weighed only slightly against the relevant norm&mdash;perhaps
      the buckling and unbuckling in our hypothetical&mdash;the
      multiplier effect would likely discount that factor less than
      one that strongly weighed against the norm. To again
      illustrate with an equation, a person may choose to use a car
      seat for the two-year-old because:</p>

      <p class="formula">((<b>norm *</b> <i>s</i>) + <i>ps</i> +
      <i>ee</i>) &gt; ((NORM * <i>a</i>) + (norm * <i>b</i>) +
      <i>cs</i>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Moreover, the existence of the norm might
      even lead a person to exaggerate the personal guilt or loss
      of external esteem that might result from failure to comply
      with the norm. Indeed, social scientists have discovered that
      we often make incorrect empirical guesses about what other
      people do. For example, most college students drink
      moderately <span class="page">[page 465]</span> at most, but
      incorrectly assume that most of their fellow students are far
      more intemperate. This sort of misperception causes
      individuals, who often fear embarrassment, "to suppress
      attitudes and behaviors that are incorrectly thought to be
      non-conforming and instead to engage in the behaviors that
      are incorrectly thought to be normative."<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> In other words, the decisionmaker
      misapprehends the actual consequences of compliance or
      noncompliance with what they perceive to be the norm. To
      return to the recycling example (and to assume a simple case
      where the existence of a norm has the same multiplier effect
      on all the factors weighing in favor of recycling), in this
      scenario:</p>

      <p class="formula">(<b>norm</b> (<i>ei</i> + <i>ee</i> +
      <i>ps</i>)) &gt; (norm + <i>i</i>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus, the existence of a norm not only
      creates discrete costs and benefits, it also influences a
      person's perception of each and every factor in the
      behavioral calculus, including the costs and benefits of norm
      compliance. Indeed, the existence of the norm might even lead
      the decisionmaker to imagine nonexistent costs and benefits.
      For example, because so many two year-olds are in car seats,
      a parent might assume that failure to use a car seat risks
      legal sanction, even if no such law actually exists.</p>

      <p class="text2">The multiplier effect of norms is similar to
      a number of phenomena that cognitive scientists collectively
      refer to as "confirmation bias," or our tendency to seek
      information and ask questions that will corroborate rather
      than falsify our theories, and to interpret evidence in ways
      that support our beliefs or hypotheses. As social scientists
      have explained,</p>

      <blockquote>
        There is considerable evidence that people tend to
        interpret subsequent evidence so as to maintain their
        initial beliefs. The biased assimilation processes
        underlying this effect may include a propensity to remember
        the strengths of confirming evidence but the weaknesses of
        disconfirming evidence, to judge confirming evidence as
        relevant and reliable but disconfirming evidence as
        irrelevant and unreliable, and to accept confirming
        evidence at face value while scrutinizing disconfirming
        evidence hypercritically.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The way in which raw data is interpreted,
      then, appears to depend largely upon the predilections of the
      interpreter.</p>
      <span class="page">[page 466]</span> 

      <p class="text2">For example, Charles Lord, Mark Lepper, and
      Lee Ross have demonstrated that individuals with strong
      opinions on complex social issues do not evenhandedly
      evaluate relevant empirical evidence.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> Lord and his fellow researchers
      presented two studies to proponents and opponents of capital
      punishment. One study seemed to prove the deterrent effect of
      the death penalty, while the other seemed to disprove it. The
      studies typically elicited "entirely opposite evaluations"
      depending on a person's initial beliefs about capital
      punishment.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> In general, the
      participants in Lord's experiments accepted evidence that
      confirmed their initial beliefs, while subjecting
      contradictory evidence to critical evaluation. As Lord and
      his colleagues explained,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Willingness to interpret new evidence in
        the light of past knowledge and experience is essential for
        any organism to make sense of, and respond adaptively to,
        its environment. [Our subjects'] sin lay in their readiness
        to use evidence already processed in a biased manner to
        bolster the very theory or belief that initially
        "justified" the processing bias. In so doing, subjects
        exposed themselves to the familiar risk of making their
        hypotheses unfalsifiable-a serious risk in a domain where
        it is clear that at least one party in a dispute holds a
        false hypothesis-and allowing themselves to be encouraged
        by patterns of data that they ought to have found
        troubling.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      The results of Lord's experiment were reminiscent of an
      earlier study in which Princeton and Dartmouth football fans
      were shown tapes of the same game, but provided dramatically
      different post-game summaries.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup><br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text2">Because the participants in Lord's study
      were exposed to a common set of mixed data-some supporting
      the deterrent effect of capital punishment and some not-it is
      difficult to quantify, as a normative matter, exactly how
      much the data should have affected attitudes.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> Instead, the most we can say is that
      some change would have been appropriate. But Craig Anderson,
      working with Lepper and Ross, has documented that we actually
      persist in our beliefs in ways that are normatively
      indefensible.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> In one
      experiment, subjects were led to believe that either a
      positive or negative relationship existed between a
      firefighter trainee's preference for risk and his ultimate
      success on the <span class="page">[page 467]</span> job.
      Subjects were then told that the studies were fictitious and
      had no probative value. Nonetheless, assessments of the
      relationship between risk preference and ultimate success as
      a firefighter continued to reflect the subjects' initial
      belief, even though they were aware that the belief was based
      on faulty data. As the researchers summarized, "People often
      cling to their beliefs to a considerably greater extent than
      is logically . . . warranted. . . . [I]nitial beliefs may
      persevere in the face of a subsequent invalidation of the
      evidence on which they are based, even when the initial
      evidence is itself [weak]."<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In all of these studies, of course, the
      subjects were committed to an initial belief or hypothesis.
      When an individual is deciding whether to follow a norm, they
      are by definition not yet "committed" to a particular choice.
      But when we are aware of a norm, we are often inclined to
      think that it reflects the preferable course of action, even
      if we have not yet decided to follow the norm. This is not
      the same as suggesting that norms act as heuristics, as is
      sometimes argued.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> Here the
      norm does not serve as a mental shortcut that eliminates the
      need for further analysis. But the norm does, to borrow the
      language of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, act as a sort
      of anchor.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> As countless
      experiments have shown, when asked to answer questions,
      "people may spontaneously anchor on information that readily
      comes to mind and adjust their responses in directions that
      seem appropriate."<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup> Usually,
      however, the adjustment away from the anchor is insufficient,
      so that the final answer is biased toward the anchor. Social
      scientists have developed several explanations for why the
      adjustment is inadequate;<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> one
      is that, at least when the anchor is not known to be wrong,
      the individual generates evidence that is disproportionately
      consistent with the anchor.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup>
      Similarly, a norm may act as the "anchor" from which we
      evaluate subsequently-provided information.</p>

      <p class="text2">In sum, because we are often inclined to
      assume that a particular behavior is preferable simply
      because so many of our peers do it, norms <span
      class="page">[page 468]</span> provide a reference point
      which predisposes us to exaggerate variables that support the
      norm and to downplay those that contradict the norm. Of
      course, when a norm maximizes utility or otherwise reflects
      the best course of action, its multiplier effect is useful
      because it helps lead us to the preferable alternative. But
      when the norm is suboptimal, its multiplier effect can be
      quite damaging, because the norm prevents an evenhanded
      assessment of the relevant information.</p>

      <p class="text2">As will be discussed in greater detail
      later,<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> the way that norms
      affect our understanding of information bears directly on the
      work of legal policymakers who craft rules and incentives
      aimed at achieving a particular result. But before discussing
      how policymakers might try to counterbalance the bolstering
      caused by a norm, the Article turns to a concrete
      illustration of how norms function as multipliers: the
      parental decision to routinely circumcise male infants.</p>

      <p class="text2">The next section of this Article, Part II,
      begins with an historical account of how routine circumcision
      became the predominant practice in the United States. This
      section then examines the empirical evidence on why parents
      continue to opt for a procedure that is no longer medically
      recommended. The discussion shows that discrete norm-based
      considerations have explanatory value, but do not entirely
      account for parental behavior. Instead, decisionmaking about
      routine circumcision is more satisfactorily explained when
      norms are understood both as discrete factors and as
      multipliers that allow parents to exaggerate the benefits of
      circumcision and downplay the disadvantages. In particular,
      the next Part shows that if norms are considered only as
      discrete factors, human decisionmaking often appears to be
      primarily about seeking conformity, when in fact the
      cognitive process is far richer. After circumcision has
      illustrated the theory, the Article then provides a
      situation-specific discussion of how legal policymakers might
      respond to the role of norms as multipliers.</p>

      <p class="text2">Like many social norms, circumcision is
      properly described as highly path dependent. In its most
      stripped-down form, path dependency means that "history
      matters."<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> Events that (with
      hindsight) should have been insignificant lead to a cascade
      of activity, which in turn "lock in" <span class="page">[page
      469]</span> an inefficient practice.<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup> The story of the QWERTY keyboard is
      frequently invoked to illustrate the concept.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> In the early days of typewriters,
      inventors struggled to prevent them from jamming. The QWERTY
      keyboard (on which we all type today) was designed to
      minimize this problem. In 1888, a stenographer who was
      apparently the Michael Jordan of typing won a series of
      contests around the country, beating less-talented
      challengers who happened to use different keyboards. After
      the stenographer's successes, everyone began choosing
      typewriters with QWERTY keyboards. In 1936, an inventor
      patented a DSK keyboard, which allowed for greater speed and
      easier learning. By then, however, QWERTY was so entrenched
      that the more efficient DSK never became popular. Even today,
      we continue to type on an inefficient keyboard designed to
      solve a long-obsolete mechanical difficulty. The QWERTY story
      is hotly debated in the economics literature-whether DSK
      really was superior to QWERTY and whether the costs of
      switching from QWERTY to DSK outweighed any marginal
      benefit.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> But the QWERTY
      story, if accurate, illustrates how an event as insignificant
      as a typing contest might lock in a particular practice.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">Because male circumcision dates back to at
      least 2400 B.C.,<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup> perhaps it
      is a bit foolhardy to try to identify the watershed incident.
      But if we ask the narrow question of how the United States
      stepped onto the path of routine neonatal circumcision, the
      critical event was in 1870, when a five year-old boy from
      Milwaukee met Lewis Sayre, a preeminent orthopedic
      surgeon.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> The boy was so
      bowlegged that he could barely walk or stand. After a
      physical examination, Sayre was puzzled about <span
      class="page">[page 470]</span> the source of the condition.
      He did, however, notice that the boy was suffering from
      genital irritation. Sayre speculated that the irritation
      might be causing the bowleggedness. (This was not as absurd
      then as it sounds today. At the time, doctors believed that
      each organ had "its own spheres of neural influence,
      governing different aspects of body and mind," and that "each
      was wired, however indirectly, to every other."<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup> The theory was akin to acupuncture,
      e.g., squeeze hard between the thumb and index finger to cure
      a headache.) So Sayre circumcised the boy, using chloroform
      as an anesthetic.</p>

      <p class="text2">Incredibly&mdash;here is the QWERTY
      moment&mdash;the boy's knees straightened out within a few
      weeks of the circumcision. Then Sayre circumcised another
      partially paralyzed boy, who also recovered. Sayre soon
      concluded that genital irritation was the cause of many
      orthopedic diseases. He eventually associated the foreskin
      with an even wider array of disorders, including epilepsy,
      hernia, and mental diseases. Sayre then began to promote
      circumcision in hundreds of articles and presentations. As a
      sort of Michael Jordan of nineteenth-century medicine, he had
      the ideal bully pulpit.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> In
      1866, Sayre was named vice president of the new American
      Medical Association; he was elected president in 1880. Sayre
      wrote <i>Lectures on Orthopedic Surgery and Disease of the
      Joints</i> in 1876, which had at least twelve editions and
      was "the bible for a generation of surgeons."<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> Indeed, the <i>British Medical
      Journal</i> described him as having "moved a great mass of
      painful, tedious and almost incurable complaints into the
      region of curable and easily managed affections."<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup> Thus, when Sayre said that
      circumcision could cure serious diseases, people
      listened.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the 1880s, doctors began to promote
      circumcision as a prophylactic measure, instead of as a
      response to specific disorders. Because the foreskin was
      believed to be associated with so many diseases, doctors
      advocated circumcision "as a precautionary measure, even
      though no symptoms have as yet presented themselves."<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> Once circumcision was perceived as
      sound preventive medicine, physicians promoted the procedure
      as most ideally performed on infants, who would then benefit
      <span class="page">[page 471]</span> from a lifetime of
      circumcision's protective effects. Significantly, doctors
      also believed that infants did not experience pain. As such,
      they believed that anesthesia, which was a particularly
      tricky business in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
      centuries, was unnecessary.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The belief that circumcision was medically
      beneficial coincided with other developments that helped
      popularize the procedure. First, in the late 1800s, the
      number of hospitals dramatically increased and the rate of
      post-surgical complications sharply decreased.<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> This made circumcision a more
      convenient and less risky option than it otherwise would have
      been. At the same time, at least for the upper and middle
      classes, childbirth was evolving from "a domestic event
      managed by midwives . . . into a medical event handled by
      physicians."<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> Eventually,
      circumcision became a marker of class, indicating that one's
      family was wealthy or sophisticated enough to deliver in a
      hospital.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> Moreover, as
      researchers began to identify the bacteria that caused
      diseases, the human body was portrayed as a reservoir of
      dangerous microbial agents. The penis was seen as an
      especially virulent source of contamination. In particular,
      the uncircumcised penis was perceived as dirtier than the
      circumcised penis because of secretions that collect under
      the foreskin.<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> Thus
      circumcision was thought to make the penis cleaner and,
      therefore, the boy healthier. Finally, circumcision was
      fueled by a Victorian fear of masturbation, a sin which was
      believed to cause insanity, epilepsy, and myriad other
      diseases.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> Many believed that
      uncircumcised males were more likely to masturbate because
      they had to retract the foreskin to clean under it. Indeed,
      the 1898 edition of All About Baby (the nineteenth century's
      Dr. Spock) advised mothers that circumcision was "advisable
      in most cases . . . [to prevent] the vile habit of
      masturbation."<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>
      <span class="page">[page 472]</span> 

      <p class="text2">Over time, the medical profession came to
      understand that circumcision neither prevented masturbation
      nor provided the panoply of benefits that Sayre and others
      had presumed it would. But doctors continued to promote
      circumcision, primarily on the ground that it constituted
      good penile hygiene, and reduced the risk of sexually
      transmitted diseases and penile cancer. As the decades
      passed, circumcision rates continued to climb. While no
      precise statistics are available, estimates are that by 1900,
      25 percent of males were circumcised; by 1912, 35 percent; by
      1920, 50 percent; by 1935, 55 percent; and by 1970, upwards
      of 85 percent.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></p>

        <p><i>B. A Social Norm Account of the Decision to
        Circumcise Prior to the 1970s</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Even with this short historical account, we
      can see how social norms theory helps account for the
      trajectory of historical events. The combination of McAdams's
      and Cooter's work is particularly important; Posner's less
      so, because signaling theory accounts for arbitrary
      behavior,<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> and at this
      juncture circumcision had a medical rationale.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recall Cooter's notion of internalized
      norms, with guilt acting as an internal sanction that raises
      the cost of particular actions or inactions. As in the
      automobile safety hypothetical, the operative norm for
      circumcision is the inverse of the Biblical Commandment:
      i.e., be a good parent. This norm is deeply internalized, and
      failure to comply usually generates great guilt.<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> As Sayre and the medical
      establishment endorsed routine circumcision as a prophylactic
      measure, the procedure became a concrete prescription for
      being a good parent and a means of gaining esteem.
      Eventually, as routine circumcision steadily became standard
      practice, circumcision became so widespread that it ceased to
      be a means of gaining esteem. Instead, circumcision became
      necessary to avoid a loss of esteem. One commentator
      describes how circumcision started in the upper echelon of
      society, but was eventually perceived by <span
      class="page">[page 473]</span> poor and immigrant populations
      as a means of avoiding class stigma.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> As McAdams would predict, increasing
      circumcision rates had a feedback effect: as more and more
      infants were circumcised, the esteem-based incentive
      continued to grow, because noncircumcision was seen as ever
      more deviant.</p>

      <p class="text2">The esteem-based analysis, however, is more
      complex than the original theory suggests. As the history
      tells us, circumcision became a mark of modernity and
      sophistication, an indication of cleanliness and sound moral
      character. But these esteem gains were almost certainly
      experienced by the child who was circumcised, not by the
      parental decisionmaker. Even today parents do not usually
      speak about their child's genitalia, and this reticence was
      probably even more pronounced during the historical period
      when Victorian values were predominant. Moreover, not too
      many of a parent's peers would have had the opportunity to
      observe whether the child was circumcised. Thus, any esteem
      gain by the parents themselves was necessarily small. In
      contrast, the esteem-based benefits experienced by the child
      may have lasted a lifetime, from early experiences of
      communal undress to later sexual encounters.</p>

      <p class="text2">Indeed, circumcision shows how esteem-based
      norms can dictate behavior in ways that are more multi-tiered
      than McAdams and Cooter originally delineated. The primary
      esteem gains, or external incentives, belong to the child.
      Yet the internal sanction-guilt associated with failing to be
      a good parent-belongs to the parent. In other words, the
      internal sanction compels the parent to seek esteem for the
      child. Of course, it is conceivable that at least some
      parents recognize that they may gain reputational benefits by
      seeking esteem for their child: for example, they might
      enable their child to befriend a person with whom association
      would give tangential esteem to the parents; or they might
      help their child marry someone who would enhance the family's
      reputation and supply grandchildren of particularly good
      stock. But any cost-benefit analysis that took into account
      these downstream parental reputational benefits would be
      exceedingly complex, and considerable social science evidence
      has shown that when confronted with complexity, individuals
      become unwilling or incapable of conducting the calculus
      necessary to reveal the utility-maximizing option.<sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup> More likely, the guilt associated
      with failing to be a good parent is enough to compel parents
      to seek esteem for their children. Indeed, this internal
      sanction mechanism may be why we give parents broad
      discretion to determine <span class="page">[page 474]</span>
      what is in the best interests of their children,<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup> and why, for the most part, we
      interfere with parental authority only at the margins. If
      parental behavior actually jeopardizes the health or safety
      of the child, there is ample indication that the "be a good
      parent" norm is not serving as an adequate brake on parental
      desires and norms that conflict with the one favoring
      parenting.</p>

      <p class="text2">To summarize, existing social norm theory
      enriches our understanding of how routine circumcision became
      the predominant practice in the United States. Note, however,
      that social norm theory is not necessary to make the
      historical decision to circumcise appear rational; until the
      early 1970s, the decision to circumcise was probably a
      relatively easy one, regardless of any discreet, norm-based
      concerns. Circumcision was believed to confer significant
      medical benefits, the risk of complications was low, and
      infants were not believed to feel pain. Most, if not all, the
      factors in the cost-benefit analysis indicated that
      circumcision was the optimal choice. While the emergence of a
      social norm favoring circumcision may have caused parents to
      exaggerate the health benefits or minimize the risk of
      complications, we cannot say that the existence of a norm
      distorted parental decisionmaking; most likely, parents made
      the choice that they would have even in the absence of a
      social norm multiplier that affected how parents processed
      the information they received about circumcision. However,
      when we consider the modern-day decision to circumcise,
      social norm theory, and particularly the role of norms as
      multipliers, becomes critical.</p>

      <center>
        <p><i>C. The Decision to Circumcise Post-1970</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Numerous studies have attempted to quantify
      how modern-day parents make decisions about circumcision.
      Parents rarely give a single reason for their decisionmaking
      and, as we might expect, often cite medical reasons. Indeed,
      the circumcision rate has always been tied, at least to a
      small extent, to the current medical recommendation. In 1971,
      when circumcision rates were above 85 percent, the American
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a statement that
      recommended against routine neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> The AAP reiterated this conclusion
      in 1975 and 1983. Nationwide circumcision rates gradually
      fell to around 70 percent and then leveled off. In 1989, in
      the wake of new information about urinary tract infection and
      sexually transmitted <span class="page">[page 475]</span>
      diseases, the AAP revised its statement to take a neutral
      stance on circumcision, stating that the procedure had
      potential medical benefits as well as disadvantages and
      risks.<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup> Rates again rose above
      80 percent. After the AAP reviewed the evidence again in 1999
      and announced that circumcision was not medically warranted,
      the nationwide rate dropped to around 65 percent, where it
      has more or less remained.<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>
      However, circumcision rates currently vary greatly by region:
      in the Midwest, 81 percent of newborns are circumcised; 67
      percent in the Northeast; 64 percent in the South; and only
      37 percent in the West.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As the next section indicates, without
      taking social norms into account, in 2003 the decision to
      routinely circumcise is difficult to explain: current medical
      data reveal either that the effects of circumcision are
      marginal enough that it is not particularly effective in
      preventing disease, or that the potential benefits of the
      procedure are related to diseases that are too uncommon to
      warrant widespread prophylactic measures. In addition, we
      know now that circumcision causes infants to experience
      significant pain and carries a non-negligible risk of
      complications. Because of the plethora of relevant medical
      information, the text of the next section addresses only the
      most important research, while the citations provide a more
      complete picture. Readers who are uninterested in current
      medical understanding may wish to proceed directly to Part
      II.D, which returns to issues of social norm theory.</p>

      <center>
        <p>1. The Medical Considerations</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">In 1999, a Task Force established by the AAP
      concluded that the "data are not sufficient to recommend
      routine neonatal circumcision."<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> At that time, approximately 1.2
      million American infants-85 percent of male newborns-were
      circumcised annually, at a cost of between $150 and $270
      million.<sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup> Of course, the AAP's
      Task Force on Circumcision is as vulnerable to special
      interest capture as any other deliberative body, and strong
      sentiments exist on both sides of the circumcision <span
      class="page">[page 476]</span> issue.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> The AAP's position, however, echoes
      that of other Western pediatric associations. Of particular
      interest are Britain, Canada, and Australia, which all at one
      time had circumcision rates comparable to those in the United
      States.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> None of the medical
      associations in these countries now endorse routine neonatal
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup> despite the
      recognition that the procedure has potential medical
      benefits. But as the following discussion reveals, these
      benefits are associated with diseases that are too rare to
      warrant prophylactic circumcision of all newborn males, or
      alternatively, with diseases for which the effect of
      circumcision is so marginal that it cannot be considered an
      effective means of prevention.<sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup> Moreover, over the last thirty
      years, the medical profession has recognized that newborns
      experience pain, and thus, that circumcision has significant
      costs.</p>

        <p><i>a. The Medical Disadvantages</i></p>
        <i>1. Pain</i>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is not the innocuous procedure
      that many believe, especially given that most circumcisions
      continue to be performed without any anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> At the risk of stating the obvious,
      circumcision is extremely invasive and intensely painful.
      Although the procedure varies depending on which surgical
      instruments are used, typically the doctor grasps the
      foreskin with clamps, tears it away from the glans, slits the
      foreskin and pulls it through the clamp, tightens the clamp
      to hold the foreskin in place, and then cuts off the
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup> Circumcision is
      painful enough that when it is performed after infancy,
      general anesthesia is the standard of care.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> In part, this is because no local
      anesthetic can completely block the pain of circumcision. In
      addition, the most effective local anesthesia involves
      multiple injections into the penis, which are thought to be
      too painful for the fully-aware patient to tolerate.<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup> That circumcision hurts probably
      does not come as a surprise-at least not if the grimaces,
      winces, and other contorted facial expressions that usually
      accompany discussion of the procedure indicate how we
      perceive it.</p>

      <p class="text2">Yet most of us are remarkably cavalier about
      the prospect of infants experiencing the pain of
      circumcision. One common misperception is that infants are
      not yet sufficiently developed to feel pain. But newborns
      have both the anatomical and functional components necessary
      for the perception of painful stimuli.<sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup> Indeed, the data on whether infants
      experience pain is so compelling that "current knowledge
      suggests that humane considerations should apply as
      forcefully to the care of neonates and young, nonverbal
      infants as they do to children and adults in similar painful
      and stressful situations."<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup> In
      other words, as a means of assessing what circumcision feels
      like to an infant, it is not anthropomorphic to ask, what
      would circumcision feel like to me?</p>
      <span class="page">[page 478]</span> 

      <p class="text2">Every marker suggests that circumcision is
      extraordinarily painful for the infant. Unanesthetized
      newborns cry vigorously and in some cases become mildly
      cyanotic because of prolonged crying.<sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup> Indeed, the infant's cry acts as a
      graded signal during circumcision, increasing "in intensity
      along dimensions that reflect the degree of discomfort felt
      by the infant."<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup> Crying is
      most frequent and high-pitched during the parts of the
      procedure that we might expect to hurt the most: when the
      foreskin is grasped with a clamp and torn away from the
      glans, when the foreskin is slit, and when the foreskin is
      pulled through a clamp and cut off.<sup><a
      href="#n88">88</a></sup> During circumcision infants also
      demonstrate other stress-related physiological reactions,
      including dramatic changes in blood pressure, heart and
      respiratory rates, and in transcutaneous oxygen and plasma
      cortisol levels.<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> The deep
      sleep that many infants fall into after circumcision is
      another indicator of infant discomfort; it is not normal rest
      but instead a non-rapid-eye-movement sleep that is a hallmark
      of infant pain or stress.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup>
      Finally, for at least twenty-two hours after circumcision, 90
      percent of infants have altered behavioral states, including
      disruptions in sleep/wake cycles, irritability, lethargy, and
      disruption of feeding patterns.<sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Of course, pain is a subjective experience.
      Because infants are nonverbal, it is impossible to assess
      their subjective response to circumcision, or to determine
      whether the pain experienced by infants is similar to the
      pain experienced by children and adults. However, at a
      minimum, the data shows that circumcision "clearly
      constitutes a physiologic and perhaps even a psychological
      form of stress in premature and full-term neonates."<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The issue of infant pain is often dismissed
      on the ground that it cannot be remembered. And certainly
      this would seem a significant difference between pain in
      adults and older children and pain in neonates. While adults
      and children cannot remember the sensation of pain itself,
      they can recall the experience associated with pain.<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup> Circumcision <span
      class="page">[page 479]</span> may seem less cruel if the
      infant is unable to remember it. However, research is
      beginning to suggest that painful experiences during infancy
      do have lasting effects, even if the experiences cannot be
      the subject of conscious recall. For example, one study
      looked at vaccination response in four- to six-month-old male
      babies. Infants were divided into three groups: those who
      were uncircumcised; those who had been circumcised with EMLA,
      a topical anesthetic which blocks some but not all
      circumcision pain; and those whohad been circumcised without
      any anesthesia. Researchers found a "significant linear trend
      on all outcome measures, showing increasing pain scores from
      uncircumcised infants, to those circumcised with EMLA, to
      those [circumcised without anesthesia]."<sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup> In other words, the more pain an
      infant experienced during circumcision, the stronger his pain
      response during subsequent vaccination. These results were
      consistent with studies outside the context of circumcision
      that show repeatedly exposing infants to painful stimuli may
      induce hypersensitivity, and that this can be prevented
      through the use of effective anesthetic.<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup> Authors of the study on vaccination
      response postulated that the pain of circumcision may alter
      an infant's central neural processing of painful stimuli, and
      thereby induce long-lasting changes in infant pain
      behavior.<sup><a href="#n96">96</a></sup> They also
      speculated that since post-traumatic stress disorder is one
      of the consequences of unanesthetized surgery on adults, "the
      greater vaccination response in the infants circumcised
      without anesthesia may represent an infant analogue of a
      post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by [the traumatic
      and painful event [of vaccination]."<sup><a
      href="#n97">97</a></sup> This speculation would comport with
      the evidence that the structures that are necessary for
      memory are well-developed and functioning during the newborn
      period, and that infants do have the capacity to store
      information and experiences.<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup>
      In sum, the science suggests that, even for infants, the pain
      of circumcision should not be dismissed on the ground that
      its effects are limited to the few minutes during which the
      procedure is being performed.</p>

      <center>
        <i>2. Risk of Complications</i>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">As with any surgical procedure, circumcision
      carries the risk of complications. Studies report
      complication rates ranging from 0.19 percent to 0.60
      percent.<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup> The most recent
      study, which examined a large and diverse patient sample in
      Washington, found a complication rate of approximately 0.20
      percent, or one complication per every 476
      circumcisions.<sup><a href="#n100">100</a></sup> The most
      common problem is bleeding during and after
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n101">101</a></sup> which can
      typically be controlled by the use of hemostatic agents,
      cautery, stitches, or even mere gentle pressure.<sup><a
      href="#n102">102</a></sup> Infection is the second most
      common complication, and is usually limited to local redness
      and secretion of pus. Very rarely, a widespread systemic
      infection develops, or the infection kills some of the penile
      tissue.<sup><a href="#n103">103</a></sup> There is also a
      risk of surgical error, even when the procedure is done by
      experienced physicians.<sup><a href="#n104">104</a></sup>
      Errors include removing too much skin, so that part of the
      penile shaft is stripped bare until skin grows back or a
      graft is performed, or so that the glans retracts and becomes
      hidden in the suprapubic fat.<sup><a
      href="#n105">105</a></sup> Other surgical errors include
      lacerations to the penis and, extraordinarily rarely,
      amputation of the penis. But while this kind of accident is a
      headline grabber,<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup> surgical
      error-particularly grave surgical error-is rare.<sup><a
      href="#n107">107</a></sup> As one editorial in the <i>New
      England</i> <span class="page">[page 481]</span> <i>Journal
      of Medicine</i> summarized, "in experienced hands, infant
      circumcision involves a very low but not completely
      negligible risk."<sup><a href="#n108">108</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <p><i>b. Potential Health Benefits</i></p>

        <p><i>1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">As previously stated, circumcision continues
      to be associated with some potential health benefits, the
      most immediate of which is a decreased risk of urinary tract
      infection, as the foreskin can harbor bacteria that cause the
      disease. While males of all ages are susceptible to
      UTI,<sup><a href="#n109">109</a></sup> the risk is greatest
      during the first year of life.<sup><a
      href="#n110">110</a></sup> All studies demonstrate an
      association between noncircumcision and increased risk of
      UTI, although the magnitude of risk varies from study to
      study.<sup><a href="#n111">111</a></sup> The AAP estimates
      that noncircumcision means a four- to ten-fold increase in
      risk during the first year of life.<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup> However, the actual incidence of
      UTI is low, even for uncircumcised boys. According to the
      <span class="page">[page 482]</span> AAP, at most
      approximately one percent (1 out of 100) of uncircumcised
      males contract UTI during their first year.<sup><a
      href="#n113">113</a></sup> Since publication of the Task
      Force's report, a new study reports that among uncircumcised
      boys, the actual incidence of UTI is 2.15 percent.<sup><a
      href="#n114">114</a></sup> But even if this new statistic is
      correct, less than 3 out of every 100 uncircumcised males
      will contract UTI, and most who do can be easily treated with
      antibiotics. For some infants, however, the infection will be
      serious enough to warrant a hospital admission. Some
      researchers have also worried that early UTI might lead to
      renal scarring and speculate that this may affect kidney
      function over the long-term,<sup><a
      href="#n115">115</a></sup> but the clinical significance of
      renal scars has not yet been demonstrated.<sup><a
      href="#n116">116</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <p><i>2. Penile Cancer</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision also has a quantitative effect
      on the risk of penile cancer, a serious disease with a
      three-year mortality rate of 20 to 25 percent and whose
      treatment sometimes includes penile amputation.<sup><a
      href="#n117">117</a></sup> In its early stages the disease
      resembles skin cancer, with lesions appearing on the outer
      surface of the penis. Circumcised males, who have one-third
      to one-half less penile skin than uncircumcised males, have
      less surface area on which the cancer can develop.<sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">But while penile cancer is serious, it is
      also exceedingly rare, even for uncircumcised men. The AAP's
      Task Force reports that in the United States, one out of
      100,000 men contract cancer of the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup> However, the Task Force has been
      criticized for conflating the data on <span
      class="page">[page 483]</span> circumcised and uncircumcised
      males, thereby understating the risk.<sup><a
      href="#n120">120</a></sup> In fact, most cases of penile
      cancer occur in uncircumcised males, who have an incidence
      rate of 2.2 per 100,000.<sup><a href="#n121">121</a></sup>
      One study has estimated that if all American men were
      uncircumcised, the annual number of penile cancers would
      increase from roughly 1,000 to more than 3,000,<sup><a
      href="#n122">122</a></sup> while another study reports that
      the risk estimate for developing penile cancer in males who
      are not circumcised neonatally is 3.2 times that of men
      circumcised at birth.<sup><a href="#n123">123</a></sup> In
      addition, some research suggests that circumcision is
      particularly effective in preventing invasive penile cancer,
      the most serious form of the disease.<sup><a
      href="#n124">124</a></sup> However, by anyone's measure,
      penile cancer is a rare medical occurrence.<sup><a
      href="#n125">125</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <p><i>3. HIV</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">While some studies have challenged the link
      between noncircumcision and HIV,<sup><a
      href="#n126">126</a></sup> as the Task Force states, "there
      is a substantial body of evidence that links noncircumcision
      in men with risk for HIV infection."<sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup> Most of this data comes from
      Sub-Saharan Africa, and suggests that circumcision has a
      significant protective effect against <span
      class="page">[page 484]</span> acquisition of HIV.<sup><a
      href="#n128">128</a></sup> A number of these studies have
      severe methodological limitations, such as the failure to
      adjust for factors (like sexual behavior) that strongly
      correlate with HIV risk and subject pools that are limited to
      high-risk populations.<sup><a href="#n129">129</a></sup>
      Nonetheless, some researchers consider the link between HIV
      and circumcision status so strong, and the situation in
      Africa so desperate, that they have called on public health
      authorities to initiate mass circumcision as a prophylactic
      measure.<sup><a href="#n130">130</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are several hypotheses for why the
      presence of a foreskin may increase susceptibility to HIV.
      One possibility is that the foreskin contains a greater
      number of cells that are especially sensitive to the HIV
      virus.<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> Another is that the
      foreskin increases the risk of sexually transmitted diseases
      that involve ulcers and open sores, which in turn facilitate
      HIV transmission.<sup><a href="#n132">132</a></sup> A third
      possibility is that the thick layer of cells that develop on
      the glans of the circumcised penis protect against
      HIV.<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup> Finally, the warm
      microclimate under the foreskin may permit viruses to survive
      longer, thereby increasing exposure.<sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The connection between HIV and circumcision
      has not been heavily studied in the United States. Of the two
      studies conducted in sexually transmitted disease clinics in
      the United States, one found that noncircumcision is a risk
      factor for HIV,<sup><a href="#n135">135</a></sup> while the
      other did not.<sup><a href="#n136">136</a></sup> The only
      random population study conducted in the United States <span
      class="page">[page 485]</span> found no correlation between
      circumcision status and the rate of HIV.<sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup> What is undoubtedly true is that
      behavioral factors are "far more important risk factors in
      the acquisition of HIV infection than circumcision
      status."<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup> The United States
      itself illustrates this point: it has both the highest rate
      of circumcision and the highest rate of HIV infection in the
      Western world.</p>

      <center>
        <p><i>4. Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The data are decidedly mixed over whether
      circumcision prevents other STDs. A discussion of just a few
      studies illustrates the point. One Australian study, for
      instance, reports a four- to five-fold increase in the rates
      of syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes among uncircumcised
      men.<sup><a href="#n139">139</a></sup> A large study of men
      who visited a Seattle STD clinic also found higher rates of
      syphilis and gonorrhea among uncircumcised men. But
      circumcision status appeared to have no effect on the rates
      of herpes and chlamydia. Uncircumcised men also had
      significantly lower incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV),
      which causes genital warts.<sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup>
      In contrast, a recent study of men from Brazil, Colombia,
      Thailand, the Phillippines, and Spain found an association
      between noncircumcision and increased risk for HPV.<sup><a
      href="#n141">141</a></sup> Finally and confoundingly, a
      random population study in the United States found that
      circumcised men were slightly more likely to suffer from both
      bacterial and viral STDs.<sup><a href="#n142">142</a></sup>
      As the AAP's Task Force summarized, the "[e]vidence regarding
      the relationship of circumcision to STD in general is complex
      and conflicting."<sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">If circumcision makes a difference, it is
      probably for reasons that are similar to why noncircumcision
      is a risk factor for HIV: the moist environment under the
      foreskin and the susceptibility of particular cells in the
      foreskin. In addition, the foreskin may be prone to small
      abrasions during intercourse, which would facilitate
      transmission of STDs. Importantly, as with HIV, behavioral
      factors are far more <span class="page">[page 486]</span>
      significant than circumcision status in determining whether a
      person contracts an STD. Again, the United States has both
      the highest rate of circumcision and the highest rate of STDs
      in the Western world.</p>

      <center>
        <p><i>5. Cervical Cancer</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The argument that circumcision affects
      cervical cancer has floated in and out of the medical
      literature for years, but most studies attempting to document
      the connection have been disregarded because of profound
      methodological flaws, such as women inaccurately reporting
      the circumcision status of their husbands. Indeed, the AAP's
      1999 policy statement does not even mention cervical cancer
      prevention as a potential medical benefit. However, in April
      2002, the New England Journal of Medicine published a report
      suggesting that the female partners of circumcised males are
      less likely to get cervical cancer than the partners of
      uncircumcised males.<sup><a href="#n144">144</a></sup>
      Specifically, researchers pooled data from Spain, Colombia,
      Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines, and concluded that
      women whose male partners had six or more sexual partners and
      were circumcised had a lower risk of cervical cancer than
      women whose male partners had six or more sexual partners and
      were uncircumcised.<sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> In
      addition, circumcised males in the study had a lower
      incidence of the sexually-transmitted disease HPV. Because
      exposure to certain strains of HPV is a significant risk
      factor for cervical cancer, researchers hypothesized that
      circumcision protects against the cancer by reducing the
      incidence of HPV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n146">146</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As an editorial that accompanied the study
      explains, it does have some shortcomings. First, many risk
      factors for HPV are more common among uncircumcised men than
      circumcised men, such as poor genital hygiene and a history
      of multiple sexual partners. Because these variables are
      difficult to control for, they may help explain the higher
      incidence of HPV in uncircumcised males.<sup><a
      href="#n147">147</a></sup> In other words, because behavioral
      factors are so important, it is still not certain whether
      circumcision makes a quantitative difference in the rate of
      cervical cancer. In addition, progression from infection with
      a cancer-causing strain of HPV to invasive cervical cancer
      may take several decades. Therefore, at least some of the
      females in the study may have become infected by a different
      male partner, whose circumcision status is <span
      class="page">[page 487]</span> unknown. This sort of
      misclassification would either attenuate or exaggerate the
      association between noncircumcision and risk of cervical
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n148">148</a></sup> Finally, the study
      conflicts with some conducted in the United States which
      found that uncircumcised males have either the same or lesser
      incidence of HPV than circumcised males.<sup><a
      href="#n149">149</a></sup> Nonetheless, if the results of
      this most recent study are replicated elsewhere and become
      well-accepted, the medical utility of circumcision might be
      greatly enhanced.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, the issue of distributional
      fairness has gone largely undiscussed in the reporting of the
      recent findings about cervical cancer: who would receive the
      benefits of circumcision and who would bear the risks. The
      notion of shared risk is embedded in most public health
      initiatives, particularlythose that involve children. Think,
      for example, of inoculations, to which circumcision is often
      compared. Under a universal vaccination policy, each child
      bears the risk of a complication, just as each child gains
      immunity to disease. If cervical cancer becomes the "medical
      argument for circumcision,"<sup><a href="#n150">150</a></sup>
      however, the non-negligible risks and considerable pain are
      borne by males, while the medical benefit is reaped by
      females. Circumcision would be a unique prophylactic
      intervention, one in which the health of one population was
      put at risk for the benefit of another population.</p>

      <p class="text2">From a legal prospective, the broad parental
      discretion to consent on behalf of the child is sharply
      curtailed when a medical procedure does not benefit the child
      but may aid third parties. The issue arises most frequently
      in the context of organ transplants.<sup><a
      href="#n151">151</a></sup> Whether the court uses a
      substituted judgment or best interest standard,<sup><a
      href="#n152">152</a></sup> the overarching focus <span
      class="page">[page 488]</span> is on what course of action
      will give the child the greatest net benefit.<sup><a
      href="#n153">153</a></sup> In answering this question, courts
      examine the relationship between the donor and donee, the
      effect of the procedure on the donor, the urgency of the
      donee's need, and the probability that the procedure will be
      successful.<sup><a href="#n154">154</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Evaluated by these criteria, circumcision
      could not be performed or recommended as a prophylactic
      measure to prevent cervical cancer. First, the beneficiary's
      need is far from urgent; many years will elapse before the
      boy is sexually active. No analogy can be drawn to the cancer
      patient who needs a bone marrow transplant,<sup><a
      href="#n155">155</a></sup> or the kidney patient who is kept
      alive by dialysis.<sup><a href="#n156">156</a></sup> Second,
      the case law emphasizes the necessity of a close, existing
      relationship between the child and person who will benefit
      from the surgery.<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup> Here
      there is not yet a relationship between the boy and the woman
      who would benefit from circumcision. Moreover, even the most
      recent study suggests that circumcision offers a protective
      benefit only to the female partners of men who have six or
      more sexual partners or engage in other behavior that puts
      them at high risk for HPV; the boy may end up not fitting
      this profile. For that matter, the boy may be homosexual and
      never have female partners. Without knowledge about what sort
      of man the boy will become, preventive circumcision is highly
      speculative.</p>

      <p class="text2">These considerations lead to the conclusion
      that if circumcision is done to prevent cervical cancer, it
      should be postponed until the boy is old enough to voice his
      own opinion on the matter. But while some cultures may
      believe that routine circumcision is more humane if done
      during adolescence,<sup><a href="#n158">158</a></sup> this is
      certainly not the American view: many <span
      class="page">[page 489]</span> parents say they circumcise
      during infancy to avoid the possibility that it will need to
      be done later.<sup><a href="#n159">159</a></sup> Thus, we can
      easily imagine a court assuming that any relationship between
      a male and his sexual partner will be close, and that if the
      procedure is going to be done at all, it has to be done
      during infancy. But even given these assumptions,
      circumcision would not pass muster under the usual standards
      for evaluating medical procedures that are performed for the
      benefit of third parties.</p>

      <p class="text2">When altruistic surgeries are performed on
      minors, the beneficiary is usually desperate and helpless. No
      alternative treatments are available, and without the aid of
      the minor, death is a near certainty.<sup><a
      href="#n160">160</a></sup> In contrast, women are capable of
      protecting themselves from cervical cancer that is connected
      to HPV. Not only can they practice safe sex, even more
      critically (and perhaps more realistically), they can receive
      simple annual Pap tests. Cervical cancer is easily cured if
      detected early, and for this reason, "[d]octors often say it
      is a disease that no woman should die of."<sup><a
      href="#n161">161</a></sup> If prevention of cervical cancer
      becomes the medical rationale for circumcision, voiceless
      infants are subjected to a procedure for the benefit of adult
      women, who are fully equipped to take control of their own
      bodies and sexual well-being.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some readers may think that it is
      inappropriate to compare circumcision to surgeries that are
      performed for the benefit of third parties; all we are
      talking about are foreskins, not kidneys or bone marrow. But
      our exasperated "it's only circumcision" merely reflects the
      social norm, which in turn shapes how we perceive the loss of
      the foreskin.<sup><a href="#n162">162</a></sup> To truly
      assess the fairness of removing healthy tissue from infants
      for the benefit of adult women, we need a thought experiment.
      Temporarily dispense with scientific disbelief and pretend
      that a new study concludes that amputating a male infant's
      little toe would decrease cervical cancer rates in particular
      populations. Many physicians and the popular press start
      touting toe amputation as effective preventive medicine.
      Would you choose to cut off your newborn son's little toe?
      Or, if it is difficult to imagine yourself with an infant
      son, would you think this recommendation represented
      appropriate public health policy?</p>

      <p class="text2">My guess is that the answer to both
      questions is no, even though the little toe is not more
      useful than the foreskin, and even if you think that <span
      class="page">[page 490]</span> the absence of a little toe
      might make the boy a more desirable sexual partner. You may
      be unwilling to subject infants to the pain of amputation;
      you may think that "normal" means having a little toe; you
      may believe it bizarre to amputate something that is likely
      to cause the boy little trouble beyond the occasional stub;
      you may be convinced that there are better ways to combat
      cervical cancer; you may just generally feel possessive about
      your son's body parts. That we do not have similar reactions
      when it comes to cutting off the foreskin for the benefit of
      adult women is a testament to how deeply embedded the norm of
      circumcision really is.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of course, the analogy between the foreskin
      and the little toe is not strictly accurate, because toe
      amputation (like kidney transplants or bone marrow
      extractions) holds no possibility of potential health
      benefits for the child. Circumcision, in contrast, has
      potential health benefits.<sup><a href="#n163">163</a></sup>
      But it would be inappropriate to allow these potential
      benefits to cloud the issue of distributional fairness,
      because the medical establishment has already told us that
      the potential benefits are not enough to merit routine
      neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some would argue that the analogy between
      the foreskin and little toe is inapt for another reason:
      that, in fact, the foreskin has a sexual function that makes
      it far more useful than the little toe. In adult males, the
      foreskin comprises one third to one half of the penile skin
      and acts as platform for nerve and nerve endings, making it
      as sensitive or more sensitive than other parts of the penis.
      Except when the penis is erect, the foreskin protects the
      glans by hanging over it. Without the protection of the
      foreskin, the glans of a circumcised male becomes keratinized
      and develops layers of protective cells that act like a
      callous.<sup><a href="#n164">164</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">But while the physical characteristics of
      the foreskin are well-understood, whether the loss of the
      foreskin affects sexual performance or sexual satisfaction is
      fiercely debated. Unfortunately, but perhaps predictably, the
      evidence is mixed and mostly anecdotal.<sup><a
      href="#n165">165</a></sup> The two <span class="page">[page
      491]</span> studies that surveyed men who were circumcised
      later in life report conflicting results. In one study of 15
      men, circumcision resulted in no statistically significant
      changes in male sexual function.<sup><a
      href="#n166">166</a></sup> In another study of forty-three
      men, participants reported a statistically significant
      reduction in erectile function as well as decreased penile
      sensitivity.<sup><a href="#n167">167</a></sup> In this same
      study, however, men were more satisfied with their penis
      after circumcision, based in large part on its new
      appearance.<sup><a href="#n168">168</a></sup> This suggests a
      point made in a large study of American sexual practices: the
      perception of sexual experience depends not only on the
      physical characteristics of the individuals involved, but
      also on the larger cultural and social context.<sup><a
      href="#n169">169</a></sup> Still, perhaps our thought
      experiment should be modified to include the possibility that
      amputation of the little toe negatively affects sexual
      function. (Remember that you are suspending scientific
      disbelief.) With this modification the reader is now probably
      even more reluctant to cut off a newborn's toe because the
      sacrifice required of the infant simply seems too great,
      especially when adult women have a means of safeguarding
      their own interests.</p>

      <p class="text2">In sum, more research needs to be done
      before prevention of cervical cancer can be added to the list
      of circumcision's potential health benefits. But because of
      the issue of distributional fairness, as well as the
      dubiousness of the parent's ability to consent to
      circumcision when its purpose is to benefit adult women, we
      should view with caution any argument that promotes the
      prevention of cervical cancer as a justification for routine
      circumcision.</p>

        <p><i>D. Social Norms As A Discrete Factor in the
        Modern-Day<br />
         Decision to Circumcise</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">If routine circumcision is not medically
      recommended, is painful, and carries the risk of
      complications, why do more than 65 percent of American
      parents choose to do it? While there is no simple answer to
      this question, the existing social science research shows
      that the procedure is highly path dependent: in large part,
      parents circumcise because their parents did it and because
      their peers are doing it. Indeed, surveys of parental
      decisionmaking reveal that the single most prominent factor
      is usually what researchers term "social concerns," that is,
      the desire for the boy to look like his peers or his
      father.<sup><a href="#n170">170</a></sup> With regard to the
      former, parents worry that a boy whose penis is different
      from others will be ridiculed by his schoolmates, or that his
      sex life will be negatively affected in later years.<sup><a
      href="#n171">171</a></sup> In other words, parents perceive
      that the presence or absence of a foreskin is a basis for
      what McAdams describes as esteem-based sanctions. And there
      is room here for Posner's signaling theory as well. With no
      medical reason for the procedure, the circumcision decision
      is wholly arbitrary and an opportunity to signal a "good
      type."</p>

      <p class="text2">The empirical data suggests that parents are
      correct in perceiving that circumcision status has
      esteem-based and reputational consequences. While evidence of
      locker room teasing is only anecdotal,<sup><a
      href="#n172">172</a></sup> in cultures where circumcision is
      the norm, researchers have found distinct differences in the
      sexual practices of circumcised and uncircumcised men. The
      largest study of American sexual practices reported that
      circumcised men engaged in each activity examined-various
      forms of oral <span class="page">[page 493]</span> and anal
      sex and masturbation-more frequently than uncircumcised
      men.<sup><a href="#n173">173</a></sup> When respondents were
      asked to rate their preference for a variety of sexual
      practices, circumcised men expressed a greater preference for
      almost every form of sexual behavior. The difference was most
      pronounced for oral sex, with "circumcised men significantly
      more likely to prefer [receiving] fellatio than uncircumcised
      men."<sup><a href="#n174">174</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">What is particularly fascinating, and most
      significant for social norm theory, is that the differences
      in practices and preferences were apparent in white
      respondents, but not in Blacks and Hispanics. Among
      respondents, whites were considerably more likely to be
      circumcised (81 percent, as compared to 65 percent of blacks
      and 54 percent of Hispanics).<sup><a
      href="#n175">175</a></sup> In reflecting on their findings,
      the researchers commented:</p>

      <blockquote>
        While we do not wish to push speculation too far,
        differences in the association between circumcision status
        and sexual practice across ethnic groups suggest that
        cultural, rather than physiological, forces may be
        responsible. In particular, [our] results may reflect
        attitudes regarding the cultural acceptability of the
        uncircumcised penis . . . . Among whites, . . .
        uncircumcised men are relatively uncommon. A consequence of
        this may be that a certain stigma is attached to the
        uncircumcised penis in the white population. If the
        uncircumcised penis assumes somewhat negative cultural
        associations among whites, this may lead uncircumcised
        white men to engage in a somewhat less-elaborated set of
        sexual practices. [In particular, such acts that involve
        direct stimulation of the uncircumcised penis should hold
        the least appeal.]<sup><a href="#n176">176</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Other studies also suggest that among groups
      where circumcision is the norm, there is a stigma associated
      with the foreskin. When American college women were shown
      pictures of the circumcised and uncircumcised penis, 87
      percent said that they preferred circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n177">177</a></sup> And in a study of 43 men who were
      circumcised later in life, "there was a statistically
      significant improvement in how men thought the penis looked
      to them and to their partners."<sup><a
      href="#n178">178</a></sup> Men also reported that they were
      more likely to receive oral sex and that their partners were
      more likely to initiate sexual activity, although these
      changes were not statistically significant.<sup><a
      href="#n179">179</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">*494 Of course, most parents will be unaware
      of this research. But there is plenty of cultural evidence
      that, at least among whites, noncircumcision isconsidered
      deviant. For instance, in a <i>Seinfeld</i> episode, Jerry
      asks Elaine whether she has ever seen an uncircumcised penis.
      Her response is an emphatic "you wouldn't recognize it if you
      saw it!" In <i>Sex and the City</i>, Charlotte is surprised
      to discover that a man is uncircumcised; by the end of the
      episode, he has undergone elective circumcision to escape
      negative reactions from women. Moreover, in at least some
      social groups, a parent's peers probably also convey that a
      stigma is associated with noncircumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n180">180</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The other social concern commonly expressed
      by parents-that a boy look like his father-is not as easily
      explained under social norm theory. Certainly the father (who
      would presumably participate in the circumcision decision)
      would not be the source of the esteem-based sanction.
      Moreover, only very immediate family would be in a position
      to know whether the son's circumcision status matched the
      father's. Thus an esteem-based model does not explain the
      importance parents place on this factor. Neither does a
      signaling model, since by their very nature signals must be
      observable.<sup><a href="#n181">181</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Robert Cooter's internalization model may
      have more explanatory value, albeit in a very nuanced way. So
      far this Article has contemplated that the deeply
      internalized norm is "be a good parent." But another deeply
      internalized norm may be at work as well, one that involves
      conceptions of masculinity. The comments of some circumcised
      fathers illustrate the point: "Even if it hurts, he has to go
      through it . . . . One day he'll thank me" and "[i]t's part
      of being a man in a man's world . . . . My father was
      circumcised, I am, and my son will be."<sup><a
      href="#n182">182</a></sup> Indeed, circumcision may be an
      example of what Timothy Beneke has coined "compulsive
      masculinity," or the "need to relate to, and at times create,
      stress or distress as a means of . . . proving
      manhood."<sup><a href="#n183">183</a></sup> American culture
      is replete with examples of the belief that enduring physical
      pain or psychological distress is what defines a man. For
      <span class="page">[page 495]</span> instance, sports, which
      often involve physical pain and intense pressure, have long
      been a vehicle for proving masculinity,<sup><a
      href="#n184">184</a></sup> while television commercials for
      the armed forces imply that they will turn boys into men.
      Indeed, most cultures equate manhood with the successful
      endurance of distress, and many have rituals that formalize
      this means of proving masculinity. Beneke cites the
      adolescent circumcision rites in some East African tribes as
      one example;<sup><a href="#n185">185</a></sup> perhaps the
      South Korean practice discussed in this Article's
      Introduction qualifies as well. While Americans may not
      consciously perceive of neonatal circumcision as a rite of
      passage, on some level parents may believe that it is
      appropriate to expose male infants to distress, because these
      babies are beginning their journey towards manhood. If this
      is so, then the compulsive masculinity norm would intersect
      nicely with the good parenting norm, because good parents
      prepare their sons for manhood.</p>

      <p class="text2">Cooter's model, however, is about more than
      mere internalization. His thesis is that failure to conform
      with the norm generates a self-imposed sanction in the form
      of guilt or shame.<sup><a href="#n186">186</a></sup> Why
      would a son looking different than his father generate an
      internal sanction? One possibility is that parents are again
      stepping into the child's shoes and anticipating that he will
      feel shame in looking different from his father, whom the
      parents probably assume will be a role model. But the
      genitalia of a child and an adult are very different
      regardless of circumcision status, and by the time the child
      really could resemble his father, he will probably be old
      enough to understand why his parents made a different
      decision than his grandparents. Thus a more plausible
      possibility is that parents believe that "teaching your son
      to be a man" is something that good parents do, and that they
      experience guilt when they fail to expose him to what they
      consider an important aspect of masculinity. Moreover, making
      a different choice for one's son requires a father to admit
      that what was done to him was, in hindsight, not the best
      choice.<sup><a href="#n187">187</a></sup> Given how closely
      the penis is connected to conceptions of manhood, this might
      be quite a significant concession on the part of the father,
      and one many may not allow themselves to make.</p>

        <p><i>E. Social Norms as Multipliers in the Modern Day
        Decision To Circumcise</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Assume that the decision whether to
      circumcise usually involves the following considerations:
      pain (<i>p</i>), the risk of complications (<i>rc</i>), the
      possibility that loss of the foreskin may diminish sexual
      pleasure (<i>ds</i>), medical benefits (<i>mb</i>), esteem
      among peers (<i>ep</i>), esteem among sexual partners
      (<i>es</i>), and the advantages of the son resembling the
      father (<i>sf</i>). If norm-based considerations are merely
      discrete factors in the behavioral calculus, in 2003 a
      majority of parents must reason that:</p>

      <p class="formula">(<i>p</i> + <i>rc</i> + <i>ds</i>) &lt;
      (<i>mb</i> + <i>ep</i> + <i>es</i> + <i>sf</i>)<sup><a
      href="#n188">188</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This explanation of parental decisionmaking,
      however, is ultimately unsatisfactory.</p>

      <p class="text2">Most newborns&mdash;male or female&mdash;are
      treated with extraordinary tenderness. They are protected
      from light, touched only gently, and swaddled in soft
      clothing. Almost all the benefits of circumcision are
      norm-based. Such considerations would have to achieve an
      exalted status to overcome the parental instinct to protect
      an infant from sources of stress and discomfort.</p>

      <p class="text2">A more compelling account of parental
      decisionmaking is that the prevalence of the procircumcision
      norm causes parents to discount the considerations that weigh
      against circumcision, and exaggerate the evidence supporting
      the procedure. For instance, Caucasian parents in the Midwest
      are likely to know only circumcised males, many of whom are
      healthy, and probably all of whom consider themselves no
      worse for the trauma. These parents will also see that their
      peers continue to circumcise their sons, which provides
      another basis for discounting the disadvantages of the
      procedure and exaggerating its potential health benefits.</p>

      <p class="text2">As discussed in Part I.B, norms affect how
      the decisionmaker perceives the relevant factors in the
      cost-benefit analysis. There are countless ways this
      phenomena could manifest itself with regard to circumcision,
      but we might imagine that a typical parent would be most
      troubled about causing pain, and most attracted to the idea
      that circumcision has medical benefits. In this instance, we
      would expect the parental analysis to look like this (where
      boldface indicates an exaggerating effect, and regular
      typeface indicates a discounting effect):</p>
      <span class="page">[page 497]</span> 

      <p class="formula">((norm * <i>p</i>) + <i>rc</i> +
      <i>ds</i>) &lt; ((<b>norm</b> * <i>mb</i>) + <i>ep</i> +
      <i>es</i> + <i>sf</i>)</p>

      <p class="text2">We might also expect something more
      complicated, where the discounting and bolstering effects of
      a norm vary, depending on the strength or weakness of a
      relevant consideration, and whether it counsels for or
      against following the norm:</p>

      <p class="formula">((NORM * <i>p</i>) + (norm * <i>rc</i>) +
      <i>ds</i>) &lt; ((<b>NORM</b> * <i>mb</i>) + (<b>norm</b> *
      <i>ep</i>) + <i>es</i> + <i>sf</i>)</p>

      <p class="text1">The permutations are many, but the central
      point is that norms will impose their own set of costs and
      benefits, and color the decisionmaker's perception of the
      other relevant considerations.</p>

      <p class="text2">This hypothesis is supported by the work of
      researchers who have studied informed consent in the context
      of routine circumcision. Virtually all of these studies
      reveal that providing information about the advantages and
      disadvantages of the procedure does not lead to lower
      circumcision rates.<sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup> Of
      course, one possibility is that the discrete, norm-based
      considerations are so powerful that they make all other
      factors irrelevant. Another possibility is that some parents
      do not even attempt to engage in a careful analysis before
      deciding to circumcise. For these parents, the norm favoring
      circumcision acts as an heuristic, and the parents simply pay
      no attention to information about the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n190">190</a></sup> But other parents who described
      themselves as always assuming that they would circumcise did
      actively express an interest in learning more about the
      procedure before it was performed on their son. And the
      evidence suggests that they were unable or unwilling to fully
      process information that ran counter to the prevalent norm.
      For instance, in a study where physicians provided mothers
      with verbal counseling, researchers were able to assess
      parental reactions to information that suggested the
      disadvantages of circumcision outweighed its benefits. As the
      study's authors described:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Several mothers were visibly uncomfortable having to listen
        to the 5-10 minute presentation of all the information. On
        several occasions they seemed to express guilt about their
        decision and resentment toward the physician for creating
        doubt about their previously <span class="page">[page
        498]</span> established beliefs regarding circumcision. One
        mother even informed the pediatrician that the process of
        being told about all the medical complications and risks of
        the procedure was so adversive that she had decided not to
        bring her child to his pediatric clinic for subsequent
        well-child visits.<sup><a href="#n191">191</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Having to be part of a conversation about
      circumcision made it more difficult for parents to bolster
      the decision to circumcise; most were anxious to discount, or
      perhaps entirely ignore, the costs that would lead them to
      opt against circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">If we accept for the sake of argument that
      most parents care deeply about doing what is best for their
      child, a version of parental decisionmaking that includes
      cognitive restructuring in the direction of a norm rings much
      more true than one that has parents removing part of the
      penis simply for the sake of conformity, or to comport with
      notions of masculinity. Indeed, when social norms are seen as
      multipliers, it is easier to explain how circumcision
      reconciles with the deeply internalized norm of good
      parenting, as usual conceptions of acting in a child's best
      interest do not include having him undergo a surgery that has
      associated risks and is not medically warranted.</p>

      <p class="text2">Moreover, given gender stereotypes, parents
      may be able to conveniently ignore the pain of circumcision.
      Here norms of masculinity are again relevant, and these norms
      cause parents to discount the pain that is experienced by the
      male infant. Numerous social scientists have demonstrated
      that parents perceive their infants through gender-tinted
      glasses.<sup><a href="#n192">192</a></sup> Adults not only
      describe babies in ways that invoke traditional gender
      stereotypes, they also are likely to choose different toys
      depending on the child's perceived sex, to talk more to
      infants they believe are girls, and to roughhouse more with
      infants they believe are boys. In general, parental behavior
      towards infants "reflects their stereotyped beliefs about
      girls and boys, namely, that girls are delicate . . . while
      boys are strong and sturdy."<sup><a
      href="#n193">193</a></sup> Of particular relevance is the
      data on how mothers interact with infant sons and daughters.
      Mothers hold their daughters more closely than sons, touch
      them more frequently, and cuddle them more often.
      Significantly, "[m]others are highly sensitive to a
      daughter's expressions of pain or discomfort, often mirroring
      the baby's expression themselves for a moment, while they
      <span class="page">[page 499]</span> tend to ignore such
      expressions in a son."<sup><a href="#n194">194</a></sup>
      Perhaps parents are able to minimize the pain of circumcision
      because they already have the gender-based perception that
      their son will, to use the colloquial expression, "take it
      like a man." Indeed, in early personality tests intended to
      distinguish between males and females, subjects were awarded
      masculinity points for agreeing-and femininity points for
      denying-that they could "stand as much pain as others
      can."<sup><a href="#n195">195</a></sup> While explicit
      references to pain have disappeared from contemporary
      measures of masculinity and femininity, personality measures
      continue to consider toughness a marker of
      masculinity.<sup><a href="#n196">196</a></sup> It may be that
      when parents decide whether to circumcise, they are
      influenced by a preconceived notion of masculinity, and are
      therefore able to discount the pain and trauma that
      circumcision causes the infant. If this is so, then two norms
      are coloring the perceptions of the parental decisionmaker:
      the norm favoring circumcision and a norm about masculinity.
      These norms should have the strongest discounting effect on
      the most persuasive reason not to circumcise and the greatest
      exaggerating effect on the least persuasive reason to
      circumcise.</p>

      <p class="text2">Assume that a legislator or other policy
      maker wanted to change the procircumcision norm. An
      individual who announced this goal might be motivated by a
      variety of considerations, although fairness to the infant
      and Kaldor-Hicks inefficiency<sup><a
      href="#n197">197</a></sup> would probably top the list. On
      the latter point, a number of cost-utility and
      cost-effectiveness studies have concluded that circumcision
      is inefficient, although most are of limited value because
      they focus on only one or two potential benefits of
      circumcision and do not adequately consider the potential
      disadvantages.<sup><a href="#n198">198</a></sup> The most
      comprehensive cost utility analysis, which used <span
      class="page">[page 500]</span> decision tree modeling and
      Markov simulation to evaluate the effect of circumcision
      across an eighty-five year life expectancy,<sup><a
      href="#n188">199</a></sup> concluded that the "advantages and
      disadvantages cancel each other. Cost and health factors
      should be removed from the decision, and personal factors
      (e.g., cultural or religious) should be considered of primary
      importance when the doctor and the parents discuss the
      issue."<sup><a href="#n200">200</a></sup> From a societal
      standpoint, however, the best preventive medicine encompasses
      measures that, to put it colloquially, provide some bang for
      our buck. This is the primary reason why Britain and most
      Canadian provinces have dropped routine circumcision from
      their public insurance plans.<sup><a
      href="#n201">201</a></sup> Given limited healthcare funding,
      these governments concluded that the resources spent on
      circumcision could be put to better use. While the American
      system of privatized healthcare partially obviates these
      sorts of systemic medical allocations, fully one-third of all
      American births are covered by Medicaid.<sup><a
      href="#n202">202</a></sup> Moreover, even when the birth is
      covered by private insurance, the overarching point remains
      the same: healthcare dollars could yield greater benefit if
      they were spent elsewhere.</p>

      <p class="text2">But regardless of how persuasive the
      argument for change, our would-be norm manager faces what
      Lawrence Lessig describes as a collective action
      problem.<sup><a href="#n203">203</a></sup> At present,
      circumcision is consistent with notions of good parenting.
      Stubbornly and circularly, this association is likely to
      persist as long as most parents continue to circumcise,
      because conceptions <span class="page">[page 501]</span> of
      good parenting are informed and influenced by what
      significant numbers of parents choose to do.<sup><a
      href="#n204">204</a></sup> Moreover, the parent who might be
      inclined towards noncircumcision (and could therefore begin
      to help challenge the social meaning of circumcision) has
      little incentive to not circumcise, because of the
      esteem-based or reputational consequences within that
      parent's group, and because the norm colors their assessment
      of other factors.<sup><a href="#n205">205</a></sup> Thus, for
      the norm to change, parents have to act collectively. That
      is, enough of them have to simultaneously choose
      noncircumcision to make the stigma associated with the
      foreskin disappear, and to transform noncircumcision into the
      choice associated with good parenting. Once the number of
      noncircumcisions reaches this critical mass, even individuals
      who might prefer routine circumcision will be unlikely to
      circumcise because they will be the ones fearing negative
      reputational consequences.<sup><a
      href="#n206">206</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Dan Kahan has suggested that in the face of
      such collective action problems, incremental legal measures
      are ultimately more effective than broad, sweeping
      reforms.<sup><a href="#n207">207</a></sup> Kahan illustrates
      his argument by pointing to the gradual transformation of
      public attitudes towards smoking. As recently as 1960,
      smoking was considered glamorous and sophisticated. Then,
      beginning with the release of the Surgeon General's Report in
      1964, the law slowly began to chip away the pro-smoking norm.
      Over a period of decades, Congress required warning labels,
      banned television advertisements, and federal, state, and
      local governments gradually restricted public smoking. By the
      1990s, legal decisionmakers were holding the tobacco industry
      accountable for its effect on public health, and smoking was
      viewed as a disgusting habit that bystanders need not
      tolerate.<sup><a href="#n208">208</a></sup> In contrast,
      consider Prohibition, which was designed to immediately end
      the consumption of alcohol. Prohibition was widely ignored
      and ultimately repealed, and drinking continues to be
      acceptable today. If a law condemns behavior more than the
      average individual does, it is likely to engender backlash
      and resistance. If, however, the legal intervention "gently
      nudges" towards the desired <span class="page">[page
      502]</span> attitude, "it might well initiate a process that
      culminates in the near eradication of the contested norm and
      the associated types of behavior."<sup><a
      href="#n209">209</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">When norms are understood as multipliers, it
      becomes evident that the most effective gentle nudges will
      counteract the distorting effect that the norm has on the
      other factors in the behavioral calculus. In other words, in
      order to change behavior, it is not necessary to condemn or
      even appear to directly attack the behavior that results from
      the predominant norm. Instead, it is sufficient to make it
      harder for a decisionmaker to discount the costs of a
      particular decision, or to exaggerate the benefits.</p>

      <p class="text2">The remainder of this Article applies the
      lessons of social norms as multipliers, and examines three
      incremental legal interventions whose collective weight may
      help change the social meaning of noncircumcision, so that
      the esteem-based and reputational consequences become
      positive, or at least neutral, and so that the norm ceases to
      diminishor exaggerate the other considerations in the
      behavioral calculus. Specifically, the Article discusses the
      possibility of legislation that (1) requires parents to pay
      out-of-pocket for routine circumcisions; (2) imposes a civil
      fine on doctors who circumcise without the use of effective
      pain control; and (3) strengthens the informed consent
      process. The Article reviews the empirical data supporting
      the effectiveness of each of these reforms and concludes that
      measures addressing payment and pain have some promise. The
      Article is, however, more skeptical about the effectiveness
      of a measure aimed at the informed consent process, even
      though this is a common recommendation among medical
      professionals and increasing information is a general
      strategy favored by social norm theorists.</p>

      <center>
        <p><i>A. Legal Scholarship on Circumcision</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Most legal writers examining routine
      neonatal circumcision have advocated broad reforms of the
      legal landscape which, if adopted, would almost instantly
      eradicate the procedure. For example, some authors have
      analyzed the legal and ethical requirements for informed
      consent when medical treatment is given to a child and
      concluded that parents lack the legal authority to consent to
      routine circumcisions.<sup><a href="#n210">210</a></sup>
      Others <span class="page">[page 503]</span> have suggested
      that circumcision violates human rights,<sup><a
      href="#n211">211</a></sup> or is properly construed as child
      abuse.<sup><a href="#n212">212</a></sup> Still others have
      suggested that outlawing female circumcision but permitting
      male circumcision violates the Equal Protection
      Clause.<sup><a href="#n213">213</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">While these authors are to be commended for
      taking a fresh look at such a deeply-embedded norm, their
      legal prescriptions are radically out of step with popular
      sentiment. There is a tremendous societal investment in
      routine circumcision, and many of us have a personal stake as
      well. Indeed, probably most readers of this Article, not to
      mention most members of the legal community and government,
      are either circumcised, have a partner who is circumcised,
      or-perhaps most critically-have chosen to circumcise their
      own sons. We are not ready to suddenly accept the analogy
      between circumcision and child abuse, or male circumcision
      and female circumcision. In sum, most of the existing legal
      arguments about routine circumcision are simply too ambitious
      (and therefore too unrealistic) to offer the prospect of real
      change.</p>

      <p class="text2">The litigated cases on routine male
      circumcision support this conclusion. In <i>London v.
      Glasser</i>,<sup><a href="#n214">214</a></sup> which was
      filed against the doctor by the infant's guardian ad litem, a
      central argument was that the infant's parents lacked the
      legal authority to consent to circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n215">215</a></sup> In an unpublished opinion, the
      California Court of Appeals held that parents have the
      authority to consent to any medical procedure, regardless of
      its purpose.<sup><a href="#n216">216</a></sup> The California
      Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari without comment.
      In <i>Fishbeck v. State of North Dakota</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n217">217</a></sup> a mother <span class="page">[page
      504]</span> whose infant had been circumcised without her
      consent (but with the father's) alleged that North Dakota
      violated the Equal Protection Clause when it, as the court
      wryly described, made "so-called 'female circumcision,'
      perhaps better described as female genital mutilation, a
      crime."<sup><a href="#n218">218</a></sup> The Eighth Circuit
      dismissed the case for lack of standing, on the questionable
      reasoning that it was "completely speculative" whether the
      mother may someday have another son whom the father would
      also want circumcised.<sup><a href="#n219">219</a></sup>
      Indeed, courts have been reluctant to provide a remedy for
      routine circumcision even when neither parent has consented
      to the procedure.<sup><a href="#n220">220</a></sup> As one
      commentator has described, "The thrust of these . . . cases
      is that circumcision is a harmless and, in fact, a generally
      helpful operation that should not be placed under excessive
      legal regulation."<sup><a href="#n221">221</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Cases such as these illustrate an additional
      advantage of incremental reform that is aimed at
      counteracting the distorting effect of social norm
      multipliers. Small, carefully targeted measures are not only
      less likely to engender resistance and backlash, they are
      also more likely to become law. The more sweeping the reform,
      the harder it becomes to convince a legislature or court that
      it should swim against the prevailing norm. Thus, narrow
      measures are not only more likely to be effective in changing
      a contested norm, they are also more likely to be adopted in
      the first instance.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">The decision to remove routine circumcision
      from public health insurance is frequently cited as one of
      the primary reasons why Britain and Canada have experienced
      precipitous declines in circumcision rates. <span
      class="page">[page 505]</span> At the end of World War II, an
      estimated 20 percent of British boys were routinely
      circumcised, with rates as high as 67 percent among
      upperclass boys in particular geographic areas.<sup><a
      href="#n222">222</a></sup> Today statistics are no longer
      kept, but the incidence is widely reported as negligible. In
      Canada, roughly 48 percent of boys were routinely circumcised
      in the 1970s, with rates in some provinces as high as 60
      percent.<sup><a href="#n223">223</a></sup> Today the
      circumcision rate in Canada is less than 17 percent,<sup><a
      href="#n224">224</a></sup> with differences still existing
      between the provinces. The declines in the provinces with the
      highest rates during the 1970s are particularly striking:
      Ontario has gone from approximately 59.8 percent to 19.6
      percent, and British Columbia has gone from 60 percent to 6
      percent. Individual provinces in Canada began delisting
      circumcision in the 1980s, while Britain discontinued
      coverage under its National Health Service in 1949.<sup><a
      href="#n225">225</a></sup> In contrast, in the United States,
      routine neonatal circumcision continues to be covered by most
      Medicaid programs and private insurance plans.<sup><a
      href="#n226">226</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Do the empirical data support the notion
      that delisting can have a real effect on circumcision rates?
      Yes, although a close look at the Canadian experience
      suggests that the actual effects of discontinuing coverage
      are more ambiguous than often described. First, Manitoba and
      the Northwest Territories still reimburse for the procedure.
      These two areas not only have dramatically different
      circumcision rates,<sup><a href="#n227">227</a></sup> but
      neither is the area in which circumcision is the most
      prevalent. Saskatchewan, which delisted in 1996, has a rate
      of almost 28 percent-slightly higher than the rate in
      Manitoba and much higher than the rate in the Northwest
      Territories. This suggests that, as in the United States, the
      decision to circumcise is heavily influenced by tradition and
      a mix of cultural factors.<sup><a href="#n228">228</a></sup>
      Second, in some provinces delisting occurred after
      circumcision had already fallen out of public <span
      class="page">[page 506]</span> favor, so that any subsequent
      reduction in rates cannot fairly be described as delisting
      helping to turn the tide of public opinion.<sup><a
      href="#n229">229</a></sup> In these provinces, the most
      influential factor may have been periodic statements by the
      Canadian Paedatric Society that circumcision is not medically
      indicated.<sup><a href="#n230">230</a></sup> In some other
      provinces, however, the largest year-to-year decrease did
      occur within a year or two of delisting. But circumcision
      rates in these provinces had already been slowly declining,
      at a rate of approximately one or two percent each year. To
      further complicate the matter, the delisting in these
      provinces occurred around 1996, when the Canadian Paediatric
      Society again made a statement against routine
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup> It is
      therefore unclear whether the Society's statement or the
      discontinuance of insurance was primarily responsible for the
      decrease.</p>

      <p class="text2">In at least one province, however, delisting
      is the only obvious explanation for the largest decreases in
      circumcisions from one fiscal year to the next. In New
      Brunswick, in the eighteen months following discontinuance,
      the rate dropped from 24.6 percent to 18 percent, roughly
      where it remains today. While the 6.6 percentage point
      decrease seems modest, it appeared at a time when (contrary
      to the rest of Canada) the circumcision rate was slowly
      increasing in the province.<sup><a
      href="#n232">232</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In sum, no accurate categorical assertions
      can be made about the effect of discontinuing public
      insurance in Canada. If one had to generalize, all that can
      be said is that in some provinces delisting, in combination
      with statements from the Canadian Paedatric Society, as well
      as cultural and social considerations that cannot be gleaned
      from <span class="page">[page 507]</span> dry statistics,
      helped accelerate a decline in the number of routine
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the Canadian experience suggests
      that discontinuing insurance coverage of routine neonatal
      circumcision will not be a panacea, delisting may be an
      incremental measure worth pursuing. First, it is an
      affirmative statement that routine circumcision is not
      medically indicated. Second, if parents have to pay for
      circumcisions out-of-pocket, it may be more difficult for
      them to exaggerate the procedure's medical benefits.<sup><a
      href="#n233">233</a></sup> Third, parents might anticipate
      that given the lack of insurance coverage, fewer people will
      be likely to circumcise their sons, and that therefore an
      uncircumcised boy is less likely to be viewed as "different."
      Finally, and importantly for those who worry about the
      unanticipated consequences of tinkering with norms, nothing
      suggests that discontinuing coverage might create a backlash
      that ultimately reinforces the norm of routine circumcision.
      In other words, the Canadian experience does not indicate
      that delisting might do for circumcision what Prohibition did
      for the consumption of alcohol, <i>i.e.</i>, make the norm
      even stronger than it was prior to legal intervention.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is far simpler, however, to end coverage
      in Canada and Britain, where the vast majority of the
      population has public insurance. In the United States, most
      infants are covered by private insurance, not by Medicaid. If
      Medicaid delisted routine neonatal circumcision while private
      insurance companies continued to cover it, there would likely
      be no decrease&mdash;and perhaps even an increase&mdash;in
      the number of circumcisions. Data from Oregon, where Medicaid
      does not cover routine neonatal circumcision, shows that
      parents are likely to pay for the procedure out-of-pocket
      after being denied coverage.<sup><a
      href="#n234">234</a></sup> Of course, Oregon's poorer parents
      are behaving as social norm theory would <span
      class="page">[page 508]</span> predict. Depending on the
      degree of stigma that parents anticipate their sons will
      experience from noncircumcision, or the extent to which the
      norm distorts other factors in the calculus, parents may find
      great utility in paying for the procedure themselves.
      Moreover, if infants who fall under Medicaid are the only
      boys without coverage, noncircumcision may cause a particular
      loss of esteem because the presence of a foreskin will be
      associated with poverty. Indeed, circumcision may become even
      more attractive because it provides an opportunity to signal
      that the boy is not from the "sort" of family that needs
      public assistance. Thus, for delisting to be an effective
      nudge, private health insurance will have to stop covering
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p class="text2">The law regularly defines risks that, as a
      matter of public policy, either must be, or cannot be,
      covered by insurers. In the healthcare context, we are
      accustomed to laws that mandate coverage, such as statutes
      that provide 48-hour hospital stays following childbirth. But
      in other areas, the law often dictates that insurers cannot
      cover certain risks. For example, some states prohibit
      insurers from covering punitive damages<sup><a
      href="#n235">235</a></sup> and intentional torts.<sup><a
      href="#n236">236</a></sup> A legislature could similarly
      decree that parents who choose to circumcise must bear the
      costs themselves.</p>

      <p class="text2">The difficulty revolves around which
      legislature would pass such a law, and how many insurance
      plans the law would reach. The labyrinth of the McCarran-
      Ferguson Act,<sup><a href="#n237">237</a></sup> ERISA, and
      state laws regulating the business of insurance practically
      guarantees that no single law will apply to all insurers.
      Obviously, a constitutionally valid federal law could preempt
      conflicting state laws and have universal application. But
      the McCarron-Ferguson Act, which provides that federal laws
      that indirectly affect insurance do not preempt state laws
      that regulate insurance, reflects the legislative
      determination that states are the most appropriate regulators
      of insurance.<sup><a href="#n238">238</a></sup> So while the
      Act does not bar Congress from passing laws that relate to
      the business of insurance, it is unlikely that Congress
      actually would do so.<sup><a href="#n239">239</a></sup>
      Furthermore, regardless of McCarran-Ferguson, it is far more
      likely that laws prohibiting <span class="page">[page
      509]</span> coverage of routine circumcision would be passed
      on the state level. To the extent that federal laws are
      supposed to reflect a national consensus, none exists about
      circumcision. As previously discussed, circumcision rates
      vary dramatically from region to region, with the Midwest as
      high as 81 percent and parts of the West as low as 37
      percent.<sup><a href="#n240">240</a></sup> Moreover, while
      there is an anticircumcision lobby, it is not well-funded or
      high-profile enough to exert real influence at the national
      level.</p>

      <p class="text2">This means that laws prohibiting coverage of
      routine circumcision would have to be passed on a
      state-by-state basis. But a state could not reach all the
      insurers within its borders. A substantial portion of the
      population receives medical insurance through employee
      benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. While ERISA does not
      dictate the substance of medical plans like it dictates the
      substance of pension plans, many experts agree that ERISA
      exempts self-funded plans from state insurance
      regulation.<sup><a href="#n241">241</a></sup> It has been
      estimated that within the average state, 50 percent of
      employees receive health insurance from self-funded plans
      that are covered by ERISA.<sup><a href="#n242">242</a></sup>
      Thus, a substantial number of people would be unaffected by a
      state law that makes circumcision uninsurable.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is unclear what effect such a law would
      have on insurers who cannot be regulated by the state. In a
      survey of insurers that covered circumcision, insurers
      explained that they covered circumcision because their
      customers expected it.<sup><a href="#n243">243</a></sup> Some
      may see a chance to drop circumcision coverage without
      suffering any penalty in the marketplace, while others might
      perceive an opportunity to gain competitive advantage by
      covering services that some other plans cannot.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the piecemeal nature of any state
      law, however, measures aimed at eliminating coverage of
      routine circumcisions are still worth pursuing. The very
      existence of the law may help influence attitudes about the
      procedure's efficacy and appropriateness, even among those
      whose insurers continue to offer coverage. The Northwest
      Territories, which still reimburses for routine circumcision,
      experienced significant declines in rates during the 1990s.
      An official from the Ministry of Health commented, "I can't
      account for a reason, other than general <span
      class="page">[page 510]</span> public sentiment turning
      increasingly negative over that decade towards the
      procedure."<sup><a href="#n244">244</a></sup> One possibility
      is that the delisting in other areas of Canada helped to
      slowly erode any favorable attitudes toward circumcision that
      existed in the Northwest Territories.</p>

      <p class="text2">Indeed, other empirical data suggests that
      even extraordinarily narrow measures may cause dynamic shifts
      in a contested norm. For example, China practiced footbinding
      for centuries, even after the harmful effects of the
      tradition were well-known. Then local missionaries
      established an antifootbinding society in 1874, where
      families pledged that they would not bind their daughters'
      feet, or allow their sons to marry a woman whose feet had
      been bound. This local convention "created sufficient density
      to make it self-sustaining," and footbinding essentially
      disappeared throughout China by 1919.<sup><a
      href="#n245">245</a></sup> Even a law with limited
      application may have a similar effect in the United
      States.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, a state law prohibiting
      circumcision coverage may stand a real chance of passage in
      some states. In light of the crushing budget deficits faced
      by many states, at least some will be interested in trimming
      their Medicaid budgets.<sup><a href="#n246">246</a></sup> For
      example, after concluding that it could save almost $700,000
      in the biannual budget, North Carolina recently voted to
      remove circumcision from the list of services covered under
      Medicaid.<sup><a href="#n247">247</a></sup> In the wake of
      complaints that "poor Tarheels would become the butt of
      locker jokes," the legislature reversed itself and restored
      coverage.<sup><a href="#n248">248</a></sup> Moreover, in a
      survey of Medicaid programs, many state administrators
      explained that their programs covered circumcisions to help
      ensure that parents of poorer children had the same choices
      as other parents.<sup><a href="#n249">249</a></sup> One way
      to address the concerns expressed by the state administrators
      and by the State of North Carolina is to pass a law applying
      to private insurers at the same time the procedure is being
      delisted from Medicaid. This law, in turn, might begin to
      erode the norm favoring circumcision.</p>

        <p><i>C. Requiring Pain Control</i></p>

        <p>1. The Rationale for the Intervention</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Based on the "considerable evidence that
      newborns who are circumcised without analgesia experience
      pain and physiologic stress,"<sup><a
      href="#n250">250</a></sup> the AAP recommends the use of
      analgesia.<sup><a href="#n251">251</a></sup> However, an
      astonishingly large percentage of infants are still
      circumcised without effective pain control. The most
      comprehensive survey of circumcision practices shows that in
      1998, the rate of anesthetic use varied by region: in the
      Northeast, 28 percent of doctors reported that they used some
      form of analgesia; in the South, 37 percent; in the Midwest,
      45 percent; and in the West, 67 percent.<sup><a
      href="#n252">252</a></sup> Distressingly, this survey
      probably overestimated the amount of pain relief actually
      provided. While most doctors reported using a dorsal penile
      nerve block (local injections that are effective in blunting,
      although not entirely eliminating, circumcision pain), others
      reported using EMLA topical cream, which does not relieve
      pain during the most invasive parts of the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n253">253</a></sup> Still others reported using
      acetaminophen and oral sucrose, which are ineffective in
      controlling operative pain and "cannot be recommended as the
      sole method of analgesia."<sup><a href="#n254">254</a></sup>
      Because the survey was conducted one year before the AAP's
      recommendation, more physicians may now use anesthesia.
      However, the literature published since the AAP
      recommendation does not suggest that there has been a
      significant increase in the use of effective
      anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n255">255</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">When asked to explain why they do not use
      anesthesia, physicians indicate a disturbing failure to stay
      abreast of the medical data and latest <span
      class="page">[page 512]</span> surgical techniques.<sup><a
      href="#n256">256</a></sup> In the 1998 survey, 54 percent of
      doctors who did not use anesthesia expressed concern about
      adverse side effects.<sup><a href="#n257">257</a></sup> In
      fact, one local injection technique has no reported
      complications, and the other technique has bruising as its
      most frequent complication.<sup><a href="#n258">258</a></sup>
      Equally astonishing, 44 percent of doctors stated that the
      procedure does not warrant anesthesia, a belief contradicted
      by the reams of evidence documenting that infants experience
      intense pain during circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n259">259</a></sup> Eighteen percent of doctors said
      they were unfamiliar with the technique necessary to
      administer local injections. Indeed, the lack of familiarity
      with technique is commonly cited in other surveys as well. In
      one 1990 study, residents described themselves as very
      willing to learn anesthesia techniques for circumcision, but
      only 32 percent had heard relevant lectures in medical school
      or during residency, and only 35 percent were familiar with
      studies describing the effectiveness of local
      anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n260">260</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">While these statistics hardly inspire
      confidence in the medical profession, perhaps they are what
      we should have predicted. The literature is replete with
      examples of widespread under-treatment of pain, particularly
      in areas of palliative and long-term chronic care.<sup><a
      href="#n261">261</a></sup> The problem may be particularly
      acute with infant care, however, as evidenced by the fact
      that circumcision is the only painful <i>surgery</i>
      routinely done without anesthetic. Indeed, doctors have few
      external incentives to stay abreast of the literature on pain
      and circumcision. Infants cannot advocate for themselves, nor
      can they choose physicians who will use effective pain
      control. The parents who are supposed to protect the infant's
      interest have an incentive to engage in cognitive <span
      class="page">[page 513]</span> dissonance because the
      knowledge that circumcision is painful may cause them to
      question deeply-internalized beliefs about circumcision and
      good parenting. Doctors are also unlikely to face external
      sanctions from their peers because anesthesia is not yet the
      standard of care.<sup><a href="#n262">262</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One way to break through the inertia is to
      impose a civil fine on doctors who circumcise without using
      dorsal penile nerve block or subcutaneous ring block, the two
      forms of local anesthesia that have proven most effective in
      blocking pain during all parts of the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n263">263</a></sup> Such a measure would provide an
      economic incentive to learn and practice appropriate
      anesthetic techniques, particularly if the fine were high
      enough that an unanesthetized circumcision would cost the
      physician more than she would be paid for performing it. In
      the wake of such legislation, some doctors might conclude
      that circumcising is not worth the potential trouble and
      cease performing the procedure altogether.<sup><a
      href="#n264">264</a></sup> But doctors who regularly perform
      circumcisions and depend on them for income would likely
      learn and apply the necessary techniques.</p>

      <p class="text2">A law that would provide an incentive to use
      effective pain control has much merit in its own right, but
      would it be an effective means of influencing attitudes
      towards routine circumcision? Unlike in the previous section,
      there is no empirical evidence to guide us. Sweden is the
      only country that mandates the use of anesthesia. The law was
      just passed in 2001 and is likely to have little effect on
      public opinion about routine circumcision, which is
      overwhelmingly negative.<sup><a href="#n265">265</a></sup>
      Social norm theory, however, predicts that there is reason to
      think that a measure requiring anesthesia would dampen the
      procircumcision norm in the United States.</p>

      <p class="text2">Law has an expressive function; that is, it
      both expresses social values and encourages norms to move in
      particular directions.<sup><a href="#n266">266</a></sup> For
      example, Cass Sunstein has argued that antilittering and
      pooper-scooper laws <span class="page">[page 514]</span> have
      expressive effect. These laws express the sentiment that not
      cleaning up after yourself or your dog demonstrates
      disrespect for others.<sup><a href="#n267">267</a></sup> Even
      in situations where there is no possibility of formal
      sanction, people are likely to comply with the law because
      they have internalized its message, or because they fear that
      they will be frowned on (or actively berated) by fellow
      citizens. Hence, the law expresses a normative judgment and
      helps align behavior with that judgement.</p>

      <p class="text2">What is the expressive function of a law
      that requires the use of anesthetic during circumcision?
      Quite simply, it says that circumcision hurts and that it is
      no longer appropriate to turn a blind eye and deaf ear toward
      the infant's pain. To further emphasize this point, rather
      than allow any exceptions, the law could provide that if
      anesthesia were contra-indicated in a particular infant,
      routine circumcision ( i.e., one that was not medically
      necessary) could not be performed. Certainly such a law would
      have an effect on doctors beyond the obvious economic one
      associated with the civil fine. It would help inculcate the
      attitude that good doctors use anesthesia, and it would raise
      the specter of professional opprobrium for failing to
      practice medicine as the law requires. But it is also likely
      to have an effect on the choices of parents by making it
      harder to rationalize circumcision as a "little snip" and to
      discount what is experienced by the infant.</p>

      <p class="text2">A couple of commentators have speculated
      that anesthesia makes the procircumcision choice easier for
      parents because the parents perceive anesthesia as
      eliminating the amount of pain experienced by the
      infant.<sup><a href="#n268">268</a></sup> (To the extent that
      such a perception exists, it is wrong-headed; remember that
      in adults and older children, the pain from the anesthetic
      injections alone is thought to be too much for a fully-aware
      patient to tolerate.)<sup><a href="#n269">269</a></sup> But
      some anecdotal evidence suggests that parents react more
      negatively to anesthetic than to the circumcision
      itself,<sup><a href="#n270">270</a></sup> perhaps because
      they are not as culturally desensitized to the prospect of
      penile injections. In any event, a law requiring anesthesia
      may force parents to grapple with the reality that
      circumcision is an actual surgery with costs that should not
      be discounted.</p>

      <center>
        <p>2. Implications for Ritual Circumcisions</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">One obvious question is whether this law
      should extend to ritual circumcisions. A law that required
      anesthesia to be used in all circumcisions <span
      class="page">[page 515]</span> is likely to pass muster under
      the federal constitution, although some state constitutions
      may offer religious ritual more protection from governmental
      regulation.<sup><a href="#n271">271</a></sup> In
      <i>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of
      Oregon v. Smith</i>,<sup><a href="#n272">272</a></sup> the
      Supreme Court held that the Free Exercise Clause permits a
      law that burdens religion as long as the law is neutral,
      generally applicable, and is not passed to ban behavior
      solely because of its religious motivation.<sup><a
      href="#n273">273</a></sup> Since <i>Smith</i>, the courts
      have upheld a variety of laws which are alleged to burden the
      exercise of religion: laws prohibiting the use of
      drugs,<sup><a href="#n274">274</a></sup> laws restricting or
      prohibiting vending,<sup><a href="#n275">275</a></sup> and
      laws requiring individuals to obtain or reveal their social
      security numbers,<sup><a href="#n276">276</a></sup> to name
      only a few.<sup><a href="#n277">277</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Under a straightforward <i>Smith</i>
      analysis, a law that required anesthesia would be neutral and
      generally applicable, as it would apply to both routine and
      ritual circumcisions. Furthermore, in light of the formidable
      evidence that circumcision is painful and traumatic for
      neonates, the legislature would rightly be perceived as
      acting to protect infant well-being rather than seeking to
      interfere with religious practices. Indeed, the primary
      effect of the law would be to regulate routine circumcisions.
      <span class="page">[page 516]</span> The vast majority of
      circumcisions are routine, and a significant percentage of
      these routine circumcisions are done without
      anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n278">278</a></sup> Thus, in terms
      of actual numbers, the law would affect far more routine
      circumcisions than ritual circumcisions. Hence there could be
      no allegation that ritual circumcisions were targeted or
      treated differently than other circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n279">279</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The <i>Smith</i> analysis, however, becomes
      more complicated if the "hybrid claim" that it mentions in
      dicta actually exists. To find that neutral laws of general
      applicability do not violate the Free Exercise Clause,
      Justice Scalia had to grapple with cases where the Court did
      in fact hold that the First Amendment prohibits the
      application of a facially neutral law to religiously
      motivated activity.<sup><a href="#n280">280</a></sup> Scalia
      reconciled these cases with <i>Smith</i> by finding that
      they, unlike <i>Smith</i> (which presented the question
      whether it was constitutional for a State to ban the use of
      sacramental peyote), involved the Free Exercise Clause "in
      conjunction with other constitutional protections."<sup><a
      href="#n281">281</a></sup> Scalia's discussion suggests that
      it was appropriate to apply strict scrutiny to these hybrid
      cases.<sup><a href="#n282">282</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the wake of <i>Smith</i>, the circuit
      courts have struggled to determine the proper scope of
      so-called hybrid claims. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit has
      refused to recognize hybrid claims until the Supreme Court
      further clarifies the issue.<sup><a
      href="#n283">283</a></sup> And in his concurrence in
      <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye</i>, Justice Souter
      commented:</p>

      <blockquote>
        [T]he distinction <i>Smith</i> draws strikes me as
        ultimately untenable. If a hybrid claim is simply one in
        which another constitutional right is <span
        class="page">[page 517]</span> implicated, then the hybrid
        exception would probably be so vast as to swallow the
        <i>Smith</i> rule, and, indeed, the hybrid exception would
        cover the situation exemplified by <i>Smith</i>, since free
        speech and associational rights are certainly implicated in
        the peyote[-smoking] ritual. But if a hybrid claim is one
        in which a litigant would actually obtain an exemption from
        a formally neutral, generally applicable law under another
        constitutional provision, then there would have been no
        reason for the Court in what <i>Smith</i> calls the hybrid
        cases to have mentioned the Free Exercise Clause at
        all.<sup><a href="#n284">284</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The Supreme Court had a recent opportunity
      to consider the contours of hybrid claims when it reviewed
      the Sixth Circuit's ruling in <i>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract
      Society of New York, Inc. v. Village of Stratton</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n285">285</a></sup> In that case, a group of Jehovah's
      Witnesses argued that an ordinance regulating the conduct of
      solicitors and canvassers infringed on a host of
      constitutional rights, including free exercise of religion
      and freedom of speech. After finding that the ordinance was
      valid, the Sixth Circuit stated, "[W]e reject plaintiffs'
      assertion . . . that laws challenged by hybrid rights claims
      are subject to strict scrutiny . . . . [W]e do not believe
      the Court held [in <i>Smith</i>], nor has it ever held, that
      a different level of scrutiny applies to laws that
      potentially affect hybrid rights."<sup><a
      href="#n286">286</a></sup> In overruling the Sixth Circuit,
      however, the Supreme Court simply stated that it did not need
      to resolve the appropriate standard of review because "the
      breadth of speech affected by the ordinance . . . make[s] it
      clear that the Court of Appeals erred in upholding
      it."<sup><a href="#n287">287</a></sup> To date then, the
      viability and scope of hybrid claims remains unclear.</p>

      <p class="text2">In those circuits that have recognized
      hybrid claims, courts have been discriminating about what
      kind of constitutional allegations are worthy of the hybrid
      label. To illustrate, in many cases the plaintiff has alleged
      that a particular law or policy infringes on both the free
      exercise of religion and the right of parents to control
      their child's upbringing. For example, parents have raised
      constitutional challenges to an AIDS awareness
      assembly,<sup><a href="#n288">288</a></sup> school suspension
      policies,<sup><a href="#n289">289</a></sup> the refusal to
      allow a father (who was not an attorney) to represent his son
      in court,<sup><a href="#n290">290</a></sup> among
      others.<sup><a href="#n291">291</a></sup> The universal
      approach in these cases, perhaps to <span class="page">[page
      518]</span> address Justice Souter's concern that every claim
      is an amalgam of constitutional rights, is to distinguish the
      interest at stake from the sort advanced in <i>Wisconsin v.
      Yoder</i>, where compulsory schooling of Amish children was
      perceived to threaten an entire way of life.<sup><a
      href="#n292">292</a></sup> In other words, merely implicating
      another constitutional right in addition to the Free Exercise
      Clause is not enough to warrant strict scrutiny.</p>

      <p class="text2">But these cases suggest that if the
      ancillary constitutional claim were powerful enough, the
      courts would have applied strict scrutiny in assessing the
      claim. Moreover, the interest that Jews and Muslims have in
      ritual circumcision might be powerful enough to raise a
      <i>Yoder</i>-like claim, or one that is analogous to
      <i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n293">293</a></sup> which struck down a law
      prohibiting parochial schools. Indeed, one judge has used
      circumcision as a vehicle for expressing doubt about whether
      <i>Smith</i> means that any facially neutral law stands,
      despite an obligation to violate it.<sup><a
      href="#n294">294</a></sup> As a thought experiment, Judge
      Kleinfeld proposed a law, passed without religious animus,
      that prohibits circumcision because the pain exceeds the
      medical benefits. The judge commented that the law "would
      make it impossible for Jews and Muslims to practice one of
      their most sacred religious obligations" and would be
      unconstitutional because it would abridge both the right to
      rear one children's in one's religion and the free exercise
      of religion.<sup><a href="#n295">295</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is central to the practice of
      Judaism and important in the Muslim tradition as well. For
      Jews, circumcision represents the covenant between God and
      Abraham and Abraham's descendants.<sup><a
      href="#n296">296</a></sup> In the Jewish tradition, it is the
      obligation of every father to have his son
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n297">297</a></sup> There is
      little debate within Judaism about the necessity of
      circumcision under Jewish law, although some have argued that
      certain Jewish texts and traditions can be used to challenge
      the practice.<sup><a href="#n298">298</a></sup> Within the
      Muslim tradition, there are six schools of law, all <span
      class="page">[page 519]</span> of which differ in how they
      apply the sources of Muslim law. One school considers
      circumcision obligatory, while the others consider it highly
      recommended. At a minimum, circumcision is considered a
      symbol of being Muslim.<sup><a href="#n299">299</a></sup> In
      sum, Judge Kleinfeld was correct when he wrote that a law
      prohibiting circumcision would raise constitutional issues
      similar in magnitude to those found in <i>Yoder</i> and
      <i>Pierce</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, a law that requires the use of
      anesthetic is quantitatively different than a measure that
      bans circumcision altogether. Indeed, a law that required
      anesthetic would likely be found constitutional, even if it
      were subjected to strict scrutiny as a hybrid claim. First,
      in light of the weighty evidence that infants feel intense
      pain during circumcision, and that the pain may have lasting
      repercussions, the state has a compelling interest in
      requiring the use of anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="#n300">300</a></sup> Furthermore, the constitutional
      right to control the upbringing of one's children does not
      extend to matters that harm the child's physical or mental
      health.<sup><a href="#n301">301</a></sup> Indeed, in
      <i>Smith</i>, Scalia specifically mentions compulsory
      vaccination laws in a list of measures for which it would be
      absurd to constitutionally require religious
      exceptions.<sup><a href="#n302">302</a></sup> A law which
      required anesthesia for all circumcisions would be wholly
      consistent with the state's role as <i>parens patriae</i>,
      where it is empowered to act to protect the health and safety
      of children.</p>

      <p class="text2">A measure mandating anesthesia is also
      narrowly tailored. Unlike under a law which prohibits
      circumcision, Jews and Muslims still would <span
      class="page">[page 520]</span> be free to practice their
      religious traditions. Indeed, some parents already request
      its use in ritual circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n303">303</a></sup> Moreover, as the Jewish rite
      illustrates, ritual circumcisions have changed as medical
      knowledge has evolved. For example, today the procedure is
      performed in sterile conditions, often with equipment that is
      similar or identical to what is used by doctors. As another
      example, Jewish law requires what is called the staunching of
      the blood. Prior to the middle of the nineteenth century, a
      mohel used his mouth to suction blood from the penis; this
      was the recognized method of disinfection at the time.<sup><a
      href="#n304">304</a></sup> As medicine began to understand
      how bacteria and viruses were transmitted from one person to
      another, most Jews abandoned this aspect of the ritual. Today
      this part of the ceremony is almost always performed with a
      swab or through a glass tube, with suction supplied by a
      rubber attachment.<sup><a href="#n305">305</a></sup> A law
      requiring anesthesia would simply compel those who request
      and perform ritual circumcisions to stay abreast of modern
      medical understanding.</p>

      <p class="text2">Undoubtedly, such a measure would create a
      practice issue for those who perform ritual circumcisions.
      The requirement should be relatively straightforward for
      anyone who is already trained as a doctor or nurse, as are
      the vast majority of mohels in the Reform Jewish
      community.<sup><a href="#n306">306</a></sup> The measure
      would be far more onerous for those mohels and barbers (the
      term for individuals who perform Muslim circumcisions) who
      have learned their trade through apprenticeship, as is, for
      example, the tradition in the Orthodox Jewish community.
      Presumably, the state could establish training and licensing
      procedures for these individuals, so that they could continue
      to practice their profession. Ultimately, however, the
      primary concern should not be the ease of those who perform
      circumcisions, but the well-being of the infants on whom
      circumcisions are performed. Moreover, despite the burden
      that mandatory anesthesia would place on some mohels and
      barbers, a law that requires anesthesia still arguably
      demonstrates great deference for religious practice. Even
      with anesthesia, circumcision ( not to mention local
      injections into the penis) will hurt. In other words, even
      after passage of a law requiring anesthesia, the state will
      permit infants to be subjected to a procedure that is painful
      and carries the risks of <span class="page">[page 521]</span>
      complications, and whose only certain value is symbolic, all
      out of deference to parental wishes and religious
      concerns.</p>

      <p class="text2">But although a law that applied to both
      routine and ritual circumcisions would be constitutional,
      such a comprehensive measure is not necessarily the best
      approach for dampening the social norm favoring circumcision.
      Remember that the strategy is to use incremental reforms
      because more dramatic efforts may generate resistance and are
      harder to sell politically.<sup><a href="#n307">307</a></sup>
      Most Muslims and Jews will probably react strongly and
      negatively to any measure that regulates ritual circumcision.
      Given the perpetual state of siege in which its members often
      find themselves, any threat perceived by the Muslim community
      would likely be magnified post-September 11. &gt;From the
      Jewish perspective, attempts to regulate circumcision may
      invoke a history of persecution. As early as 168 B.C.,
      persecutors of the Jews sought to ban circumcision. This
      effort was repeated during the Spanish Inquisition, the
      Nazis, and the Soviet government.<sup><a
      href="#n308">308</a></sup> As one Jewish commentator has
      written, "All Jewish people . . . carry this history in our
      collective memory, and any challenge to circumcision evokes
      it, whether consciously or unconsciously."<sup><a
      href="#n309">309</a></sup> To illustrate, the Swedish law
      requiring anesthesia applies to ritual circumcision, and the
      outcry from the Jewish community has been fierce.<sup><a
      href="#n310">310</a></sup> Under the law, mohels (who must be
      approved by the Swedish Board of Health) are only allowed to
      perform circumcisions during the first two months of life and
      in hospitals or under similar conditions. The child must
      receive pain relief, which must be administered by a doctor
      or qualified nurse. After the first two months of life,
      circumcisions can only be performed by a medical
      doctor.<sup><a href="#n311">311</a></sup> Because so many
      Swedish doctors and nurses are opposed to circumcision, the
      Jewish community is worried that the anesthesia requirement
      will effectively end ritual circumcisions in Sweden.<sup><a
      href="#n312">312</a></sup> Of course, the Swedish law, which
      includes punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine
      of an individual amount, is of a greater magnitude than
      anything contemplated in this Article. Nonetheless, the
      opposition the measure encountered probably illustrates what
      would occur if any comprehensive anesthesia measure were
      proposed in the United States.</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to the negative response that it
      would likely engender, a measure applying to ritual
      circumcisions would be markedly out-of-step <span
      class="page">[page 522]</span> with the current state of the
      law. Some states expressly exempt those who perform ritual
      circumcisions from medical licensing requirements.<sup><a
      href="#n313">313</a></sup> In the absence of an express
      exemption, at least one court has found that ritual
      circumcision does not constitute the practice of
      medicine.<sup><a href="#n314">314</a></sup> In sum, both the
      prevailing state of the law and the expected response from
      Jewish and Muslim communities make any comprehensive measure
      a far too sweeping reform.</p>

      <p class="text2">It may seem inconsistent to simultaneously
      write that unanesthetized circumcision is extraordinarily
      painful and that parents with certain religious beliefs
      should be free to subject their children to it. But because
      the law has an expressive function, parents who engage in
      ritual circumcisions will not be wholly immune to the effect
      of the law. If unanesthetized circumcision is widely
      perceived as cruel (and hence inconsistent with good
      parenting), more Jewish and Muslim parents are likely to
      insist on anesthesia, particularly if they can do so without
      violating their religious obligations. Only members of
      extremely closeted religious communities are immune from the
      normative judgments of society as a whole. Indeed, this point
      may make Jewish and Muslim communities particularly leery of
      any law addressing circumcision, even one that does not apply
      to ritual circumcisions. If the societal norm tips in favor
      of noncircumcision, and especially if circumcision eventually
      comes to be seen as the equivalent of chopping off a
      newborn's toe, the norm cascade that was initiated by
      incremental reforms might threaten the continued viability of
      the religious ritual, and engender social opprobrium for
      those who continue to practice it. On the other hand, at
      least within the Jewish tradition, circumcision was never
      intended to be mainstream; instead, it was embraced as a
      means of distinguishing oneself from members of other
      faiths.<sup><a href="#n315">315</a></sup> One can argue that
      when circumcision ceases to be a secular practice, Jews and
      Muslims will be practicing circumcision as the rite was
      originally intended-as a unique tenet of their faith.</p>
      <span class="page">[page 523]</span> 

      <center>
        <p><i>D. Strengthening Informed Consent</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Social norm theorists often recommend the
      provision of information as a means of changing public
      opinion and helping to tip a norm,<sup><a
      href="#n316">316</a></sup> perhaps because the government is
      less likely to be accused of playing Big Brother if it simply
      supplies neutral information and allows people to draw their
      own conclusions. At first blush, strengthening informed
      consent seems like an attractive strategy, both because
      parents may have greater difficulty distorting the costs and
      benefits of circumcision, and because the empirical evidence
      suggests there is ample room for more information about
      circumcision. Studies have shown that many parents do not
      discuss circumcision with their doctor until they arrive at
      the hospital in labor or shortly thereafter (hardly a good
      time for informed decisionmaking!).<sup><a
      href="#n317">317</a></sup> The counseling that does occur is
      usually underinclusive, with physicians providing only a
      fraction of the information necessary for an informed
      decision.<sup><a href="#n318">318</a></sup> For this reason,
      most medical professionals who have studied circumcision
      recommend a beefed-up informed consent process as one means
      of changing parental attitudes.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some state legislatures have determined that
      for certain medical treatments, physicians should not have
      sole authority to determine what to disclose. Thus they have
      passed statutes requiring that physicians reveal specific
      information about risks, benefits, and other relevant
      concerns. Many of these statutes are connected to child
      bearing. For example, states mandate that midwives disclose
      particular information about their background and the scope
      of services they can offer,<sup><a href="#n319">319</a></sup>
      and that pregnant women be provided with specific information
      about HIV <span class="page">[page 524]</span>
      testing,<sup><a href="#n320">320</a></sup> drugs that may be
      furnished during labor and delivery,<sup><a
      href="#n321">321</a></sup> and postpartum depression.<sup><a
      href="#n322">322</a></sup> Theoretically a state could pass a
      similar statute requiring thorough disclosure of the risks
      and potential benefits of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although more information may seem like a
      sound strategy for counteracting the distorting effects of a
      procircumcision norm, the evidence suggests that such a
      statute would have little effect on parental decisionmaking.
      As a general matter, many commentators agree that the
      informed consent process does little to ensure that an
      individual understands a procedure and genuinely consents to
      it. They argue that this level of consent and comprehension
      only occurs when the physician understands the values and
      priorities of the patient and engages in careful discussion
      about the full range of options-behavior that is impossible
      to legislate.<sup><a href="#n323">323</a></sup> But even more
      important, and as mentioned previously, the empirical
      evidence shows that when parents are given medical
      information about circumcision, it has a negligible
      effect.<sup><a href="#n324">324</a></sup> For example,
      numerous studies have shown no differences in circumcision
      rates between parents who received either unbiased written
      information or unbiased written oral counseling.<sup><a
      href="#n325">325</a></sup> The only study that has
      demonstrated that information can reduce circumcision rates
      was arguably very Big-Brother-like; it had parents view
      videotapes that contained graphic illustrations of various
      steps of the procedure.<sup><a href="#n326">326</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Why does the provision of medical
      information have so little effect? Most researchers speculate
      that a strengthened informed consent process makes little
      difference because the decision to circumcise is <span
      class="page">[page 525]</span> ultimately made for social,
      not medical reasons.<sup><a href="#n327">327</a></sup> The
      timing of the information was also an issue. In each study
      the informed consent process took place late in the pregnancy
      or after birth, while many parents reported that they made
      the circumcision decision early in the pregnancy or before
      conception.<sup><a href="#n328">328</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Obviously, each of these issues is a real
      barrier for those who wish to require strengthened and
      effective informed consent. While physicians may be
      best-suited to discuss the medical aspects of circumcision,
      they will not always be appropriate candidates for addressing
      social concerns. It is also difficult to imagine a
      non-Orwellian statute that could direct them to do so.
      Furthermore, a physician is unlikely to talk to women about
      circumcision before they are pregnant, and even counseling
      early in the pregnancy would be awkward (both because the
      gender of the child will be unknown and because of the risk
      that the pregnancy may end spontaneously).</p>

      <p class="text2">Given the complications of informed consent,
      increased information is probably best provided through a
      widespread public information campaign that addresses both
      medical and social considerations. Examples of such parental
      information campaigns are common: the danger of alcohol
      during pregnancy, the importance of reading to young
      children, and the necessity of putting kids in the backseat,
      to return to an example from the beginning of this Article.
      In this regard, perhaps any effort at norm management would
      benefit most from the active participation of a so-called
      norm entrepreneur, someone who has the personal charisma or
      political clout to strongly influence attitudes about
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n329">329</a></sup> For instance,
      in California, which has the lowest circumcision rate of any
      state, the possession of a foreskin is sometimes described as
      "chic." <sup><a href="#n330">330</a></sup> Perhaps
      noncircumcision needs a Surgeon General who could do for it
      what C. Everett Koop did for smoking. Even better would be an
      American baby with the notoriety of Princes William and
      Harry, who were not circumcised even though their father had
      been.<sup><a href="#n331">331</a></sup> Indeed, what better
      way to counteract the effect of norms <span
      class="page">[page 526]</span> as multipliers than to have
      parents thinking the American equivalent of, "If
      noncircumcision is good enough for the future King of
      England, it's good enough for my son."</p>

        <p class="heading1">IV. C<span
        class="sc1">ONCLUSION</span></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">This Article has argued that social norms
      are more than just discrete factors that figure into the
      behavioral cost-benefit analysis. Instead, norms are more
      accurately described as variables that affect our perception
      of every other factor in the analysis, thereby encouraging an
      individual to either exaggerate or discount the significance
      of other considerations. While deviance from or compliance
      with a norm may have its own costs or benefits, an equally
      important effect of norms is to influence the way individuals
      understand information, so that from the outset the
      behavioral outcome is weighted in favor of the predominant
      social norm.</p>

      <p class="text2">Norms therefore play an even larger role in
      shaping and controlling behavior than most legal scholars
      have envisioned. As the discussion of routine neonatal
      circumcision suggests, norms are most effectively
      re-engineered by measures that counter the way the norm
      distorts our perception of other factors in the behavioral
      calculus. The challenge that remains for the legal academy is
      to engage in the empirical research necessary to predict how
      to best change specific norms, so that the information can be
      utilized by policymakers who desire reform. At the very
      least, such empirical work will further inform the theories
      that legal scholars offer to explain human behavior.</p>

      circumcision is on an Egyptian tomb built sometime around
      2400 B.C. One wall of the tomb shows temple priests cutting
      the penises of two adolescents. In the first picture, "an
      assistant stands behind one of the youths, gripping his arms
      and pulling them back while the priest operates with a stone
      knife. 'Hold him and do not allow him to faint' reads the
      inscription." In the second picture, "the boy being
      circumcised urges the priest-surgeon to 'thoroughly rub off
      what is there.' The circumcising priest replies, 'I will
      cause it to heal."' <i>Id.</i> at 2.<br />

      circumcision was misguided, he was responsible for some
      significant medical successes. For example, when he was
      resident physician of New York City, his quarantining of a
      ship may have saved the City from a cholera epidemic. He also
      championed proper sewage disposal, inspection of tenement
      houses, and compulsory smallpox vaccination. <i>Id.</i> at

      rejected any comparisons between male and female circumcision
      on the ground that only the latter is aimed at subordinating
      women and controlling their sexuality. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Jane
      E. Larson, <i>"Imagine Her Satisfaction": The Transformative
      Task of Feminist Tort Work</i>, 33 W<span
      class="sc2">ASHBURN</span> L.J. 33, 56, 60 n.12 (1993). I
      would agree that comparisons between the two practices should
      rarely be made, in part because of the differing political
      climates in which they occur. But while we no longer
      circumcise to prevent boys from masturbating, at one time the
      practice was directly aimed at curbing male sexuality.
      Particularly disturbing is that at least a few respected
      physicians advocated circumcising young boys without
      anesthesia, so that they would associate the pain of the
      procedure with masturbation. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Athol Johnson,

      have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be

      extent that routine neonatal circumcision is path dependent,
      our current practices can be traced to outmoded beliefs about
      male sexuality. Hence, there exists a rarely-acknowledged

      phimosis (a condition where the foreskin cannot be retracted)
      or balanitis (infection of the foreskin). Because
      circumcision removes the foreskin, it eliminates the
      possibility that the male will contract either of these
      conditions. However, while the true frequency of the
      conditions is unknown, they are believed to be rare. 1999

      will have to be circumcised later in life if one of these
      conditions develop, a range of treatment options exist, and
      most are as simple as antibiotics or steroid creams. While no
      precise statistics are available, post-infancy circumcisions
      in the United States are reported to be exceedingly rare, and

      other hypotheses about why circumcision lowers the risk of
      penile cancer. One possibility is that cancer is associated
      with chronic irritations of the penis that circumcision may
      prevent, such as phimosis. Hung-Fu Tseng et al., <i>Risk
      Factors for Penile Cancer: Results of a Population-Based
      Case-Control Study in Los Angeles County (United States)</i>,

      class="sc2">ONTROL</span> 267, 270 (2001). Another
      possibility is that the presence of a foreskin increases a
      male's probability of contracting the human papilloma virus
      (HPV), which has been associated with a heightened risk of
      penile cancer. See Schoen, <i>supra</i> <a href="#n117">note
      117</a>, at 307. However, researchers disagree about whether
      uncircumcised men are more susceptible to HPV than
      circumcised men. See <i>infra</i> notes 116-28 and

      factor for penile cancer, it is not the only one. Others
      include cigarette smoking, certain sexual behavior, previous
      genital trauma, and low levels of physical activity. Tseng et
      al., <i>supra</i> <a href="#n118">note 118</a>, at 276. Poor
      penile hygiene may be the most significant risk factor, as
      evidenced by the significant variations in cancer rates
      between countries where the vast majority of men are
      uncircumcised. For example, in Denmark the rate is 0.82 per

      test, the court places itself in the child's shoes, and
      decides whether the minor would consent to the procedure if
      he was capable of doing so. Under the best interest test, a
      court determines whether the procedure is in the best
      interest of the child from an objective standpoint. Usually
      these two tests represent distinctions without any real
      differences, especially since when most courts apply the
      substituted judgment test to cases involving minors, they ask
      the objective question whether a reasonable person in the
      child's circumstances would choose to consent to the

      Master &amp; Johnson tested the glans of circumcised and

      (reporting a variety of sexual dysfunction among circumcised

      historical instances where a decrease in sensitivity was
      billed as one of the advantages of circumcision. For example,
      the twelfth-century physician and rabbi Moses Maimonides
      argued that circumcision had the advantage of curbing a
      male's sexual appetite. See O'Hara &amp; O'Hara,
      <i>supra</i>, at 79. As routine circumcision became standard
      medical practice, many physicians argued that it had the
      advantage of making intercourse less pleasurable and thereby
      discouraged adultery, while others advocated circumcision as
      a means of guarding against premature ejaculation. Gollaher,
      <i>supra</i> <a href="#n50">note 50</a>, at 105. Only one
      study has comprehensively examined the preferences of women
      who have had intercourse with both circumcised and
      uncircumcised males. It reported a clear preference for
      intercourse with uncircumcised males. O'Hara &amp; O'Hara,
      <i>supra</i>, at 81. The authors hypothesized that removal of
      penile skin, and the resulting loss of fine-touch receptors,
      changes male positioning and thrusting patterns during
      intercourse in ways that reduce the amount of vaginal
      secretions and decrease stimulation of the clitoris.

      commonly list penile hygiene and concerns about cleanliness
      as reasons for circumcision. See sources cited <i>supra</i>.
      These responses also reflect social convention, as

      circumcised boys in groups where noncircumcision is the norm.
      But presumably they too would experience the effects of
      deviance. Indeed, a colleague of mine tells of a friend who
      was traveling abroad. His sexual encounter with a
      Scandinavian woman took an unexpected turn when she blurted
      out, "But part of it is missing!"<br />

      interesting parallel with female circumcision. While the
      Western world properly conceives of female circumcision as
      mutilation, circumcised women are often strong advocates of
      the practice and are responsible for arranging for their
      daughter's circumcision. See generally Doriane Lambelet

      (1991), Lawler and his colleagues examined a wider range of
      potential benefits, including urinary tract infection, penile
      cancer, and miscellaneous penile problems for which
      circumcision may be a treatment. They concluded that
      "circumcision seems to be within the range of
      cost-effectiveness generally considered worthy of
      implementation." <i>Id.</i> at 593. They also counseled that
      "there is no medical indication for or against circumcision"
      and that the "decision regarding circumcision may most
      reasonably be made on nonmedical factors such as parent
      preference or religious convictions." <i>Id.</i> at 587.
      However, analysis of the risks or costs was limited to death
      from circumcision and other surgical complications, thereby
      rendering this study under-inclusive as well. For example,
      pain has been long been recognized as a significant
      disadvantage of circumcision. See <i>supra</i> notes 80-98
      and accompanying text. In addition, Lawler and his colleagues
      have been criticized for discounting the costs of
      circumcision but not the quality-adjusted life expectancy,
      which resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios that were
      substantially lower than if discounting had been applied
      evenhandedly. Michael D. Hagen, <i>Fiscal Factors, Fimbrial

      protection issue assume that legal policy and decisionmakers
      would rather outlaw male circumcision than permit female
      circumcision. See, e.g., Shea Lita Bond, Comment, <a
      href="/library/legal/bond/"><i>State Laws Criminalizing
      Female Circumcision: A Violation of the Equal Protection
      Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</i></a>, 32 J. M<span
      class="sc2">ARSHALL</span> L. R<span class="sc2">EV</span>.
      353 (1999). But given the strength of the male circumcision
      norm, this is a dubious assumption. It seems more likely that
      if a legislature were forced to choose, it would repeal the
      laws banning female circumcision and assume that the practice
      could be persecuted under child abuse laws. If a prosecutor
      tried to pursue male circumcision under these same laws,
      however, the norm favoring male circumcision would probably
      prevent her from obtaining a conviction. For a careful
      discussion of the Equal Protection issue, see Dena S. Davis,

      Before a court can extend the coverage of a statute so that
      it comports with the Equal Protection Clause, the court must
      be convinced that the legislature would have expanded the
      legislation rather than strike the legislation in its
      entirety. <i>See</i> Heckler v. Mathews, <a href=""

      (Powell, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)). As
      previously discussed, <i>see supra</i> <a href="#n213">note
      213</a>, it is not at all clear that a legislature would
      prefer expansion to repeal. The most Fishbeck could have

      struck down the law and counseled the North Dakota
      legislature about reconsideration and repassage. See Guido

      rate of 31.2% in 1971. When insurance coverage was
      discontinued in 1987, the province had a rate of 5.3%. In the
      five years following a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/cps1975/">1975
      statement</a> by the Canadian Paedatric Society, rates in

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="n231"
      name="n231"></a> 231. In Saskatchewan, for instance, coverage
      for routine circumcision was discontinued in 1996, the most
      recent year that the Canadian Paedatric Society
      comprehensively evaluated the procedure and recommended
      against it. In the two years following that recommendation
      and delisting, Saskatchewan's circumcision rates decreased
      7.2%, from 37.2% to 30%. Today the rate is 27.6%. As another
      example, routine circumcision was delisted in Nova Scotia in
      1997. In the following year, the rate decreased by 8.6%. But
      the effect of delisting in Nova Scotia is particularly
      difficult to evaluate, since prior to discontinuance the rate
      was only 11.1%. Therefore circumcision had already fallen out
      of public favor in Nova Scotia, even prior to delisting and
      the 1996 statement by the Canadian Paedatric Society. <i>See

      have experienced a decrease in rates attributable to
      delisting, but the unavailability of data for certain years
      in the 1990s makes it difficult to quantify the exact
      association. One study reports in the first month after
      delisting showed no change in circumcision rates, but that
      says little about what happened over time. Ruth E. Walton et

      performing circumcisions would not be the purpose of this
      legislation, it might be a consequence that would further
      dampen the pro-circumcision norm. If circumcisions became
      harder to obtain, the rates might decrease and thereby dilute
      the esteem-based sanctions.<br />

      by people with more skill. However, with the exception of one
      study showing that the clamp used by some mohels may be less
      painful than the clamp used by doctors, this claim has never
      been subjected to empirical testing. And there is no evidence
      that circumcision by a mohel is anywhere close to pain-free.

      religious exemption, there is no violation of the
      Establishment Clause. See <i>Id.</i> at 890 ("It may be
      fairly said that leaving accommodation to the political

      practices that are not widely engaged in; but that

      preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto
      itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all
      laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.").

      attitudes about circumcision and found a significant

      information. Slightly more than 15.4% of study participants
      were unhappy about their decision, and more than 40% did not
      feel they had been provided enough information.
      Interestingly, 27% of parents who had chosen noncircumcision
      were unhappy, while only 14% of the parents who had chosen
      circumcision were unhappy. The researchers speculated that
      cognitive dissonance was at least partly responsible for the
      higher satisfaction rates among parents who had circumcised,
      because these individuals did not have the option of
      reversing their decision.<br />
