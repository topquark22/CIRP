I disagree with Denice Everham (letters, 15 Dec.), who says we need to
completely outlaw the spanking and hitting of children.

The last thing this country needs is more legislation.  What we really need
is to recognize children as human beings and uphold the laws that already
exist.  Clearly, spanking and hitting are unlawful.  They constitute assault
and battery, as well as child abuse.

Once children are recognized as human beings with an equal right to
protection of the law, and once the courts start doing their job of upholding
the law, such socially sanctioned, yet blatantly abusive practices as
spanking, hitting, circumcision, , etc., will come to a screeching halt.
