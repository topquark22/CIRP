      <h2>Court strikes down religion immunity</h2>
      <b>Justices say law that limits regulations wrongly alters
      scope of First Amendment</b> 

      <p>By Frank A. Aukofer<br />
      of the Journal Sentinel staff<br />
      June 26, 1997<br />
      </p>

      <p>Washington - Saying that Congress wrongfully tried to
      redefine the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom,
      the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the Religious
      Freedom Restoration Act.</p>

      <p>The decision produced an outcry from religious
      organizations and national lawmakers of varying political
      ideologies, who vowed to take whatever action was necessary
      to reverse the decision.</p>

      <p>Backers of the 1993 religious freedom law warned that
      Wednesday's high court ruling likely would affect a range of
      disputes where First Amendment rights to free exercise of
      religion run afoul of government rules, ranging from
      Christians' right to communion wine in dry counties to
      religious objections to autopsies by Orthodox Jews and
      Hmong.</p>

      <p>They also argued strenuously that the 1993 law was needed
      to protect minority religions, and cited as an example an
      Amish group in Wisconsin that escaped fines for refusing to
      post bright orange safety triangles, which they object to as
      too worldly, on their horse-drawn buggies.</p>

      <p>There are hundreds of lawsuits under the 1993 act that
      claim exceptions to state and local zoning, building, school,
      prison, employment, highway safety, building and
      anti-discrimination laws. Wednesday's Supreme Court decision
      eliminates such defenses.</p>

      <p>The 6-3 ruling came in a Texas case (<i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/95-2074.html">City of
      Boerne vs. Flores</a></i>), in which a Catholic archbishop
      relied on the 1993 law to challenge a city's denial of a
      building permit to enlarge a church.</p>

      <p>But the Supreme Court said that although Congress had the
      power to enforce a constitutional right, it could not change
      the right itself.</p>

      <p>Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said,
      in effect, that Congress had built a shotgun to swat a
      fly.</p>

      <p>He wrote that the 1993 law, known as RFRA, was so out of
      proportion to its stated purpose as a remedy that it could
      not be considered responsive to, or designed to prevent,
      unconstitutional behavior.</p>

      <p>"It appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in
      constitutional protections," he wrote.</p>

      <p>Kennedy wrote that numerous state laws, such as the zoning
      regulations in the case, imposed heavy burdens on a large
      class of citizens.</p>

      <p>"When the exercise of religion has been burdened in an
      incidental way by a law of general application," he wrote,
      "it does not follow that the persons affected have been
      burdened any more than other citizens, let alone burdened
      because of their religious beliefs."</p>

      <p>The decision focused on the enforcement clause of the <a
      href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment14/"
      target="_blank">14th Amendment</a> to the Constitution,
      which gives Congress the power to pass laws to force states
      to protect constitutional rights. An example is the Voting
      Rights Act of 1965.</p>

      <p>But the court said that such enforcement legislation had
      to be narrowly tailored to deal with the wrong involved.</p>

      <p>"RFRA is not so confined," Kennedy wrote. "Sweeping
      coverage ensures its intrusion at every level of government,
      displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost
      every description and regardless of subject matter.</p>

      <p>"RFRA's restrictions apply to every agency and official of
      the federal, state and local governments... RFRA applies to
      all federal and state law, statutory or otherwise, whether
      adopted before or after its enactment.</p>

      <p>"RFRA has no termination date or termination mechanism.
      Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual
      who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise
      of religion."</p>

      <p><b>Response to Oregon Case</b></p>

      <p>The 1993 law was Congress' response to a 5-4 decision
      (<i><a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/494/872.html"
      target="_blank">Oregon vs. Smith</a></i>) by the Supreme
      Court in 1990.</p>

      <p>In that case, the high court held that Oregon could deny
      unemployment benefits to members of an American Indian
      religion who lost their jobs because they used an illegal
      hallucinogenic drug, peyote, in the practice of their
      faith.</p>

      <p>The court ruled then that individuals had an obligation to
      comply with valid laws that were applied generally to the
      population. Wednesday's decision restores the 1990
      ruling.</p>

      <p>The case started in Boerne, Texas, a city about 28 miles
      northwest of San Antonio, where Archbishop Patrick F. Flores
      wanted to enlarge St. Peter Catholic Church. It had been
      built in 1923 and seated about 230 people - too small for its
      growing congregation.</p>

      <p>But the city declared the area a historic district, and
      city officials denied the request for a building permit.
      Flores cited RFRA in appealing to the courts.</p>

      <p>In declaring the law unconstitutional, the Supreme Court
      noted that RFRA was not a response to religious bigotry.
      Instead, Kennedy wrote, it was aimed at "laws of general
      applicability which place incidental burdens on
      religion."</p>

      <p>Justice John Paul Stevens, in a concurring opinion, said
      RFRA violated the <a
      href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/"
       target="_blank">First Amendment</a>. He said it amounted to
      an establishment of religion because it gave preferred
      treatment to religion.</p>

      <p>"If the historic landmark on the hill in Boerne happened
      to be a museum or an art gallery owned by an atheist, it
      would not be eligible for an exemption from the city
      ordinances that forbid an enlargement of the structure," he
      wrote.</p>

      <p>The law, Stevens said, had provided the church with "a
      legal weapon that no atheist or agnostic can obtain."</p>

      <p>Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter filed
      dissenting opinions, in which they were joined by Justice
      Stephen Breyer.</p>

      <p>O'Connor said she believed that the 1990 peyote case was
      wrongly decided and had harmed religious liberty.</p>

      <p>As an example, she noted that a lower court, relying on
      that decision, had overruled objections by Hmong natives who
      objected on religious grounds to an autopsy of their son's
      body.</p>

      <p>The peyote decision, O'Connor said, should be re-examined
      and replaced by a rule that would require the government to
      justify its actions based upon a "compelling state interest"
      and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.</p>
