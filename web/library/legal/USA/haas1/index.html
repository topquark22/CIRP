      <p class="text1">I. I<span
      class="sc1">NTRODUCTION</span><br />
       Between 1.7 and 4% of the world population is born with
      intersex conditions, having primary and secondary sexual
      characteristics that are neither clearly male nor
      female.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The current recommended
      treatment for an infant born with an intersex condition is
      genital reconstruction surgery to render the child as clearly
      sexed either male or female.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      Every day in the United States, five children are subjected
      to genital reconstruction surgery that may leave them with
      permanent physical and emotional scars.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Despite efforts by intersexed people
      to educate the medical community about their rejection of
      infant genital reconstruction surgery, the American medical
      community has not yet accepted the fact that differences in
      genital size and shape do not necessarily require surgical
      correction.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="page">[page 42]</span> Genital
      reconstruction surgery may involve removing part or all of
      the penis and scrotum or clitoris and labia of a child,
      remodeling a penis or creating a vaginal opening.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> While the initial surgery is typically
      performed in the first month of a child's life, genital
      reconstruction surgery is not only performed on
      infants.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Older children may be
      subjected to multiple operations to construct "functional"
      vaginas, to repair "damaged" penises, and to remove internal
      sex organs.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Personal accounts
      written by intersexed adults indicate that some children have
      been subjected to unwanted surgery throughout their childhood
      and teenage years without a truthful explanation of their
      condition.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Genital reconstruction is rarely medically
      necessary.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Physicians perform
      the surgeries so that intersexed children will not be
      psychologically harmed when they realize that they are
      different from their peers.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      Physicians remove external signs that children are
      intersexed, believing that this will prevent the child and
      the child's family from questioning the child's
      gender.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> However, intersexed
      children may very well feel more confused about their gender
      if they are raised without any explanation about their
      intersex condition or input into their future treatment
      options.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The medical
      community's current practice focuses solely on genital
      appearance, discounting the fact that chromosomes also affect
      individuals' gender identities and personalities.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Operating on children out of a belief that
      it is crucial for children to have genitals that conform to
      male/female norms ignores the fact that even the best
      reconstruction surgery is never perfect.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Genital reconstruction surgery may
      result <span class="page">[page 43]</span> in scarred
      genitals, an inability to achieve orgasm, or an inability to
      reproduce naturally or through artificial
      insemination.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> The
      community-held belief that an individual's ability to engage
      in intercourse is essential, even without orgasm or
      reproductive capability, seems to govern the decision to
      perform genital surgery on many otherwise healthy, intersexed
      children.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the intersex community's rejection
      of genital reconstruction surgery, no U.S. court has examined
      the legality of performing these operations without the
      individual child's consent.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      By contrast, Colombian courts have heard three such cases and
      have created a new standard for evaluating a parent's right
      to consent to genital reconstruction surgery for their minor
      children.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> In response to the
      Colombian rulings and pressure from intersex activists, the
      American Bar Association recently proposed a resolution
      recommending that physicians adopt the heightened informed
      consent procedures required by the Colombian Constitutional
      Court decisions.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This Article questions whether genital
      reconstruction surgery is necessary in the Twenty-first
      Century. Part II discusses the history and current preferred
      "treatment" for intersex conditions. Part III explains the
      groundbreaking Colombian Appellate Court decisions
      prohibiting parental consent for genital reconstruction on
      children over the age of five, and establishing a heightened
      informed consent doctrine for younger children. Part IV
      analyzes the protection that current U.S. law could provide
      to intersexed children. Part V explores how international law
      may influence decisions regarding the treatment of intersexed
      children.</p>

      class="sc1">ENITALS</span><br />
       The term "intersex" is used to describe a variety of
      conditions in which a fetus develops differently than a
      typical XX female or XY male.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      Some intersexed children are born with "normal" male or
      female external genitals that do not correspond to their
      hormones.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Others are born
      with a noticeable combination of male and female external
      features, and still others have visually male or female
      external characteristics that correspond to their chromosomes
      but do not correspond <span class="page">[page 44]</span> to
      their internal gonads.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
      Individuals who are considered intersexed may also be born
      with matching male chromosomes, gonads, and genitals but
      suffer childhood disease or accident that results in full or
      partial loss of their penis.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup>
      The loss of a penis may lead physicians to recommend that a
      boy be sexually reassigned as female.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> Although the conditions differ, the
      commonality of intersexed people is that their gonads,
      chromosomes, and external genitalia do not coincide to form a
      typical male or female.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> The
      current American medical treatment of intersexuals is to
      alter the individual's internal and external gonads to sex
      them as either clearly male or clearly female.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Medical "treatment" of intersexuals has only
      been practiced in the United States since the 1930s.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> During that period, the medical
      community determined that intersexed people were truly male
      or female but had not fully developed in the womb.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> Hormone treatments and surgical
      interventions were meant to complete the formation of an
      intersexed adult into a "normal" man or woman.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> By the 1950s, physicians were able
      to identify most intersex conditions at birth and began
      operating immediately on intersexed children to eliminate any
      physical differences.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Prior to the treatment of intersexuality in
      the United States, intersexed Americans were treated as
      either male or female according to their dominant physical
      characteristics.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> This strict
      male/female delineation is not used in all countries though.
      Other cultures have treated intersexuals differently, either
      as a third sex, neither male nor female, or as natural sexual
      variations of the male or female sex.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup> Alternatively, some societies still
      accept intersexed people without clearly defining their sex
      at birth.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">For instance, within small communities in
      the Dominican Republic and Papua New Guinea, there is a
      hereditary intersex condition known as 5-alpha reductase
      deficiency that occurs with a relatively high
      frequency.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> This condition
      causes male children to be born with very small or
      unrecognizable penises.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup>
      During puberty, the children's male hormones cause their
      penises to grow and other secondary male <span
      class="page">[page 45]</span> sexual characteristics to
      develop.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> Most of these
      children are raised as girls and begin living as men when
      they reach puberty.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> These
      communities have accepted these intersexuals without genital
      reconstruction surgery.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> In
      the United States, however, a child with the same condition
      would likely be surgically altered at birth, raised as a girl
      and treated with hormones to prevent the onset of male
      physical development.<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Genital reconstruction surgery became
      standard practice in the United States through the efforts of
      John Money, a John Hopkins University professor.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> Money introduced the theory that
      children are not born with a gender identity, but rather form
      an understanding of gender through their social
      upbringing.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> He based this
      theory on early research done with intersexed children who
      were surgically altered at birth and raised as either male or
      female.<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup> Money's research
      found that children who were born with exactly the same
      genetic makeup and physical appearance fared equally well
      when raised as either females or males. He concluded that
      chromosomes did not make any difference in gender
      differentiation, and that children could be successfully
      reared as either sex irrespective of their anatomy or
      chromosomal make-up.<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> Money
      attempted to prove his theory by demonstrating that a
      "normal" male child could be successfully raised as a female
      with Bruce Reimer.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1972, Money made public his experimental
      sex reassignment surgery on a twenty-two-month-old male child
      named Bruce Reimer who had been accidentally castrated during
      a routine circumcision.<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> The
      doctor who examined Reimer shortly after the accident
      believed that he would be unable to live a normal sexual life
      as an adolescent and would grow up feeling incomplete and
      physically defective.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> Money's
      solution was to perform a sex change operation on baby Bruce
      and to have his parents raise him as a girl named Brenda.
      During Brenda's childhood, Money removed all of "his"
      internal reproductive organs. As Brenda approached puberty
      "she" was given female hormones to trigger breast development
      and other female secondary characteristics.<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup> By removing Brenda's gonads, Money
      destroyed Brenda's reproductive capability. However, Money
      believed that by changing Brenda's sex, he would make it
      possible for her to engage in intercourse and marry.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="page">[page 46]</span> Early
      reports of Money's experiment claimed that the operation was
      successful and that Brenda was a happy, healthy girl.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> Money's research was published
      throughout the world, convincing doctors that gender was a
      societal construct, and therefore intersexed children could
      be raised unconditionally as either male or female.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup> He believed that the only way to
      ensure that both the family and the child would accept the
      child's gender was if the child's genitals looked clearly
      male or female. Based on this theory, babies born with
      ambiguous genitals or small penises and baby boys who were
      accidentally castrated were surgically altered and raised as
      females.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> Similarly, children
      born with mixed genitalia, gonads, and chromosomes were
      surgically altered to fit the definition of a "normal" male
      or female.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> Following U.S.
      lead, other countries also began to practice routine genital
      reconstruction surgery on intersexed infants.<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the widespread use of genital
      reconstruction surgery, there is no research showing that
      intersexuals benefit psychologically from the surgery
      performed on them as infants and toddlers.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> No follow-up studies were ever done
      on adult intersexuals who underwent genital reconstruction
      surgery as children.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> In the
      late 1980s, researchers attempting to disprove Money's gender
      identity theory began searching for Brenda, the subject of
      Money's highly publicized research.<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> The boy who was raised as a girl was
      now living as a man and had changed his name to David.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> In 1997, Milton Diamond and Keith
      Sigmundson published an article rebutting the results of
      Money's famous gender research.<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> The publicity caused by Diamond and
      Sigmundson's article led to a biography of Reimer by John
      Colapinto. When Colapinto interviewed Reimer in 1997, Reimer
      admitted that he had always been certain that he was not a
      girl, despite being deceived by his doctor and his
      family.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Reimer suffered emotional duress at all
      stages of his development, despite the corrective surgery
      that was meant to make him "normal." In his biography of
      Reimer, Colapinto describes the painful experiences that
      Reimer suffered throughout his childhood and teenage
      years.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> During her childhood,
      Brenda did not fit in with her peers and felt isolated and
      confused.<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> As early as
      kindergarten, other children <span class="page">[page
      47]</span> teased Brenda about her masculinity and failure to
      adopt "girl's play."<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> Although
      her kindergarten teacher was not initially told of her sex
      change, the teacher reported realizing that Brenda was very
      different from other girls.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to her failure to fit in
      socially, Brenda was constantly reminded that she was
      different by her parents and Dr. Money. During her visits to
      John Hopkins, Money would often force her to engage in sexual
      role-play with her twin brother in order to enforce that she
      was a girl and he was a boy.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup>
      Her genitals were scarred and painful as a child and she
      hated to look at them.<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> She
      became suspicious that something terrible had been done to
      her, primarily due to the frequent doctor's visits with John
      Money. During these visits, Dr. Money and his associates
      questioned Brenda about her genitals and her gender
      identity.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup> Rather than
      enforcing her gender identity, the medical intervention
      compounded the trauma caused by her medical condition.</p>

      <p class="text2">One particularly traumatic procedure
      inflicted on intersexed children was not discussed in the
      biography of David Reimer. Intersexed children who have
      artificially created vaginas must undergo vaginal dilation
      procedures throughout their early childhood.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> In order to ensure that the newly
      created vaginal opening does not close up, the child's
      parents must insert an object into the child's vagina on a
      daily basis.<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> This procedure
      has sexual implications that may be emotionally traumatic for
      many children.</p>

      <p class="text2">As a teenager, Reimer rejected his assigned
      sex and refused to take his female hormones. He reported
      engaging in typically male behavior throughout his teens. He
      dressed as a male, chose a trade school for mechanics, and
      even began urinating standing up.<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup> When Reimer's parents finally told
      him that he was born male, he immediately chose to adopt a
      male identity and changed his name to David.<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> He had a penis constructed and
      implanted, and underwent breast reduction surgery to rid
      himself of the breasts developed through estrogen
      therapy.<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup> There is no
      procedure that can replace the gonads that were removed as
      part of Reimer's sex reassignment surgery. There is also no
      cure for the deception that he experienced upon learning that
      his parents and doctors had lied to him about many aspects of
      his life.<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup> The trauma of
      learning about his condition caused David to attempt suicide
      on several occasions.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">David is now married and has adopted his
      wife's children.<sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup> His story
      reads as a happy ending to many people. However, David could
      have avoided the gender <span class="page">[page 48]</span>
      dysphoria, loss of reproductive capability, and many years of
      therapy that resulted from genital reconstruction surgery.
      These experiences are not atypical in the intersexed
      community. According to many intersexed activists, the
      comfort of being raised in a clear gender role does not
      outweigh the pain of deception or the physical side effects
      associated with the surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the emotional and physical scars
      that people like David Reimer face from genital
      reconstruction surgery, the majority of American physicians
      continue to encourage early childhood surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> In some cases, physicians have
      insisted on performing genital reconstruction surgery on
      teenagers without their consent.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1993, an intersexed activist named Cheryl
      Chase began a support and advocacy group for intersexed
      adults called the Intersex Society of North America
      ("ISNA").<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup> Chase was born with
      a large clitoris, which was removed when she was an
      infant.<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup> When she was eight
      years old, her internal gonads were removed without her
      knowledge or consent.<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup> Because
      of the surgery, she is no longer capable of having her own
      children or obtaining orgasm.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup>
      Today, Chase and other advocates are vocal about their hope
      for a moratorium on the invasive treatment of intersexed
      children.<sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">ISNA members have contributed significantly
      to the debate over genital reconstruction surgery by
      providing personal insight into the effects of surgery on
      intersexed adults. As of the late 1990s, more than 400
      intersexed individuals from around the world contacted ISNA
      and recounted stories similar to Ms. Chase's.<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup> According to ISNA, sex change
      operations and genital normalizing surgeries should not be
      performed on children until the child has the ability to
      consent personally to the operation.<sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">At this point, there is insufficient proof
      that intersexed adults who are not operated on fair any worse
      than intersexed adults who have had genital reconstruction
      surgery as children.<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup> The only
      research that has been done on intersexed adults who have not
      been surgically altered also comes from John Money. In the
      1940s, prior to his well-known study on Reimer, Money
      interviewed many intersexed adults about their gender
      identity and upbringing.<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup> To

       Public authorities, the medical community and the citizens
      in general must make room for these people who have been
      silenced until now.<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> In 1995,
      Colombia's highest court, the Constitutional Court, addressed
      the legality of performing gender reconstruction surgery on
      children.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup> The Constitutional
      Court has issued three decisions on the constitutionality of
      genital reconstruction surgery, and, as of the publication
      date of this Article, it is the only court in the world to
      have rendered an opinion on this issue.<sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup> The first case that the court
      considered was brought by a teenage boy who had been raised
      as a girl under circumstances very much like David
      Reimer's.<sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup> Several years after
      this first case, the court decided two other cases involving
      children born with intersex conditions.<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup> These three cases have limited
      parents' rights to choose genital reconstruction surgery for
      their children in Colombia.</p>

      <p class="text2">The first case, Sentencia No. T-477/95
      [hereinafter Gonzalez, involved a male infant who was
      accidentally castrated during circumcision and was
      subsequently subjected to a sex change operation.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup> His physicians performed the sex
      change operation so that his genitals would conform to
      societal norms and he would be capable of sexual intercourse
      as an adult.<sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup> As a teenager,
      Gonzalez learned of the operation and sued the doctors and
      hospital that allowed the operation to be performed without
      his consent.<sup><a href="#n96">96</a></sup> The Colombian
      Constitutional Court heard Gonzalez's appeal and found that
      this operation violated the boy's fundamental right to human
      dignity and gender identity.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup>
      The court based its decisions on the Colombian Constitution
      and the international covenant on human rights guaranteed
      <span class="page">[page 50]</span> by the Inter-American
      Court of Human Rights.<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup> The
      court ruled that doctors could not alter the gender of a
      patient, regardless of the patient's age, without the
      patient's own informed consent.<sup><a
      href="#n99">99</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Several years after Gonzalez, the parents of
      two children born with intersex conditions brought their
      cases to court seeking the authority to consent to surgery on
      behalf of their minor children.<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> In both cases, the children's
      physicians had recommended genital reconstruction surgery,
      but refused to perform the surgery without each child's
      consent.<sup><a href="#n101">101</a></sup> For the first time
      in the world, a court addressed the issue of whether parents
      should be allowed to consent to genital reconstruction
      surgery on their intersexed children. Although these cases
      were not identical to Gonzalez, the hospital feared that if
      it performed genital reconstruction surgery on any child
      without the child's consent, it could be held liable under
      Gonzalez.<sup><a href="#n102">102</a></sup> The Colombian
      Constitutional Court heard both cases on appeal.<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Sentencia No. SU-337/99 [hereinafter
      Ramos, the Colombian Constitutional Court considered the case
      of an eight-year-old intersexed child raised as a girl and
      diagnosed with male pseudo-hermaphroditism.<sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup> Ramos was born with XY (male)
      chromosomes but due to her inability to process male
      hormones, her external genitalia did not fully
      develop.<sup><a href="#n105">105</a></sup> Ramos had a small
      penis (three centimeters), folds of skin that did not contain
      testicles, male gonads, and a urinal opening at the base of
      her perineum.<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">According to the documents received at the
      trial court level, Ramos' doctors were not aware that she was
      intersexed until she was three years old.<sup><a
      href="#n107">107</a></sup> Until that point, Ramos' mother
      had raised her as a girl without questioning whether she
      might not have female chromosomes. When Ramos' pediatrician
      became aware that the child was intersexed, the doctor
      recommended that she receive genital reconstruction surgery
      to remove her small penis and gonads and to construct a
      vagina.<sup><a href="#n108">108</a></sup> The doctor
      recommended the sex change operation because although Ramos
      had a small penis, it would never grow to the size of a
      typical penis, and it would never function properly.<sup><a
      href="#n109">109</a></sup> Additionally, Ramos had been
      raised as a girl thus far, had a female name, wore feminine
      clothing, and identified with the social role of Colombian
      women.<sup><a href="#n110">110</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Ramos' mother brought this action to force
      the hospital to accept her consent on behalf of Ramos so that
      the doctors could proceed with the surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n111">111</a></sup> Ramos' mother alleged that if the
      hospital waited to perform surgery until Ramos could <span
      class="page">[page 51]</span> consent for herself, the child
      would be psychologically harmed because she would grow up
      without a clear gender identity.<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">However despite being raised female, the
      trial court found that Ramos' gender was ambiguous because
      "in some aspects she behaves like a woman and in some aspects
      like a man."<sup><a href="#n113">113</a></sup> It also
      concluded that every person should have the right to develop
      his or her own gender identity as a part of the development
      of his or her personality.<sup><a href="#n114">114</a></sup> The
      trial court stated that nobody could determine what the
      gender identity of this child would be except for the child
      herself, denying Ramos' mother the right to consent to
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n115">115</a></sup> Ramos' mother
      appealed the case to the Constitutional Court.</p>

      <p class="text2">By the time the case was heard on appeal,
      Ramos was eight years old.<sup><a href="#n116">116</a></sup>
      After considering medical information and briefs from experts
      around the world, the Constitutional Court upheld the trial
      court's decision denying Ramos' mother the right to consent
      to genital reconstruction surgery for her child.<sup><a
      href="#n117">117</a></sup> In its decision, the court referred
      extensively to the Colombian Constitution, as well as
      international laws and norms.<sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="page">[page 52]</span> The
      court considered the gravity of the procedure and the
      negative effects it could have on the child if she were to
      reject her assigned sex, and found that substitute judgment
      should not be allowed. The Constitutional Court quoted the
      trial court's opinion, noting that it would be wrong for
      anyone to consent to a sex change operation other than the
      child herself.<sup><a href="#n119">119</a></sup> In reaching
      its conclusion, the court discussed the lack of evidence of
      any psychological harm to children that are not operated on,
      and the existence of actual evidence of psychological harm to
      children that have had such operations.<sup><a
      href="#n120">120</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The Ramos decision did not seem to rely on
      the individual facts of the case, but rather on the
      overreaching harm of the surgery as compared to the unproven
      benefits. However in its next case, the Constitutional Court
      seems to have made its decision based on the individual facts
      of the case, primarily that the surgery had already been
      performed with no major problems.<sup><a
      href="#n121">121</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the Constitutional Court's next decision,
      Sentencia No. T-551/99 [hereinafter Cruz,<sup><a
      href="#n122">122</a></sup> the court relied heavily on the
      information provided in Ramos.<sup><a
      href="#n123">123</a></sup> However, the decision in Cruz was
      substantially weaker than both of the previous decisions,
      limiting its prior holdings to children over the age of
      five.<sup><a href="#n124">124</a></sup> Cruz was born with XX
      (female) chromosomes and male external genitalia.<sup><a
      href="#n125">125</a></sup> Her parents were seeking to have
      her clitoris/penis removed or reduced in size so that she
      would look more female.<sup><a href="#n126">126</a></sup> At
      the age of two, Cruz was already aware that her genitals were
      different from those of her family members.<sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup> However since Cruz was much
      younger then Ramos, the trial court did not rely on facts
      regarding Cruz's own gender identity. After hearing the case,
      the trial court held that Cruz's parents could consent to
      genital reconstruction surgery on her behalf if their consent
      was "informed."<sup><a href="#n128">128</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Cruz was only three years old when the case
      was brought to the attention of the Constitutional Court and
      had already undergone genital reconstruction surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup> The Constitutional Court decided
      to hear the case in order to set a standard for the lower
      courts to follow in the future.<sup><a
      href="#n130">130</a></sup> The court found that Cruz's
      parents did not really understand the implications of the
      operation on their child's life. Believing that their child
      would be "normalized" by the procedure, the parents were
      given the impression that surgery was their only
      option.<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> Since the parents
      were not properly <span class="page">[page 53]</span>
      informed about the procedure or provided alternative options,
      the court held that Cruz's rights had been violated despite
      her young age.<sup><a href="#n132">132</a></sup> Although it
      was too late to make any changes in the decision that was
      already made for Cruz, the court ordered that an
      interdisciplinary team be put together to support the child
      and her family in the future.<sup><a
      href="#n133">133</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In this decision, the court could have
      followed its reasoning in Ramos to ban parental consent to
      genital reconstruction surgeries on all children.</p>

      <p class="text2"><sup><a href="#n134">134</a></sup> However,
      instead of following its own precedent, the court decided
      that parents should be allowed to consent to surgery on
      children under age five.<sup><a href="#n135">135</a></sup>
      The court explained that Cruz was too young to have formed a
      gender identity.<sup><a href="#n136">136</a></sup> By
      prohibiting parental consent for the surgery, the court
      stated that it would be intruding into the realm of family
      privacy.<sup><a href="#n137">137</a></sup> The court also
      stated that prohibiting this surgery altogether would be like
      a social experiment in which children were the
      subjects.<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup> Had it decided to
      prohibit the surgery on young children, the intersexed
      children following this case would be the first children in
      the country to be prohibited from obtaining sex
      assignment/reconstruction surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n139">139</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">While deciding not to make room for the
      intersexed, the court made clear that it did not intend to
      leave the decision whether to operate at the full discretion
      of the parents either. It reasoned that parents might be
      fearful of intersex conditions and discriminate against their
      children, consenting to operations not truly in the child's
      best interest.<sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup> Finally, the
      court concluded that the medical community should establish a
      protocol allowing parents to consent to genital
      reconstruction surgery only after they establish that it is
      truly in their child's best interest, creating a new form of
      "qualified and persistent, informed consent."<sup><a
      href="#n141">141</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The court in Cruz gave Colombian parents the
      right to substitute judgment for infants and young children
      who have already achieved consciousness of their bodies;
      however, parents can only give consent after fully
      understanding the consequences of the surgery for their
      child. In Cruz, the court clarified that its decision to
      withhold parental consent in Ramos was based on the fact that
      Ramos was eight years old when her case was decided.<sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup> Cruz narrowed the individual
      consent doctrine to apply to children over the age of five,
      holding that intersexed children over the age of five must
      give their informed consent before undergoing genital
      reconstruction surgery.<sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Cruz, the court determined that in order
      for parental consent to genital reconstruction surgery to be
      valid for children under the age of five, three criteria must
      be met: (i) detailed information must be provided, and the
      parent must be informed of the pros and cons that have
      sparked the current debate; (ii) the consent must be in
      writing, to formalize the decision and to ensure its
      seriousness; and (iii) <span class="page">[page 54]</span>
      the authorization must be given in stages.<sup><a
      href="#n144">144</a></sup> This last qualification is
      intended to permit the parents the time to bond with their
      child the way that he or she is, and not to make a
      prejudicial decision based on shock at the baby's
      appearance.<sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> The court
      stated that it would be up to the medical community and the
      legislature to determine the specific details for the consent
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n146">146</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Doctors generally recommend surgery for
      intersexed children at birth.<sup><a
      href="#n147">147</a></sup> Ramos' mother was forced to wait
      until Ramos was eight years old only because the trial court
      originally denied permission for her to give consent for the
      operation.<sup><a href="#n148">148</a></sup> However
      important the investigation and dicta was in Ramos, most
      intersexed children will not benefit from it. Most often,
      surgery will be performed when the child is still an infant
      and only the heightened informed consent will be directly
      applicable to them.<sup><a href="#n149">149</a></sup> By
      limiting the holding of Ramos in Cruz to children over the
      age of five, the court diminished the significance of
      Ramos.</p>

      <p class="text2">All three of the Colombian Court's decisions
      could have fundamentally altered the individual rights of
      intersexed children in Colombia. Instead, they have only
      given the parents of intersexed children the right to more
      information before they consent to genital reconstruction
      surgery. Perhaps some parents will obtain enough information
      to decide to decline these operations. However, in the end,
      it is still the parent and not the child who will be able to
      determine what gender the child will be, whether the child
      will be able to reproduce, and who the child will be allowed
      to marry. Given the opportunity to make a huge difference in
      the lives of intersexed people around the world, the
      Colombian Court's decision did not adequately protect this
      "marginalized and forgotten minority."<sup><a
      href="#n150">150</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the Colombian Court's reticence
      about banning infant genital reconstruction surgery,
      Colombian law still provides far more protection for intersex
      children then current American law. The Colombian Court's
      decisions have increased the world's awareness of the
      problems with genital reconstruction surgery and reopened the
      medical debate regarding genital reconstruction surgery in
      the United States.</p>

       The United States does not currently provide any procedural
      protection for intersexed children. In the United States,
      doctors are not required to receive the consent of intersexed
      children before performing genital reconstruction
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n151">151</a></sup> Neither are
      parents routinely given sufficient information to make an
      informed decision on their child's behalf.<sup><a
      href="#n152">152</a></sup> Currently, the United States lacks
      even the <span class="page">[page 55]</span> standard for
      informed consent instituted after the Colombian Court's final
      decision in Cruz.<sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Thus far, there has been no legal challenge
      brought on behalf of intersexed children in the United
      States. Intersexed adults who have inquired about suing their
      doctors for performing genital reconstruction surgery that
      altered their gender have met resistance.<sup><a
      href="#n154">154</a></sup> Intersexed adults have been told
      that because the doctors followed standard medical practice
      when they performed the surgery, the doctors are not liable
      for medical malpractice.<sup><a
      href="#n155">155</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Unlike the Colombian Constitution, the U.S.
      Constitution does not have specific provisions protecting a
      child's right to bodily integrity. However, the Constitution
      has been interpreted to protect privacy rights, including the
      right to marry and reproduce, and the right to bodily
      integrity generally.<sup><a href="#n156">156</a></sup> Common
      law also provides some protection for children when there is
      no "informed" consent, or when a parent's consent or lack of
      consent to medical treatment is found to be contrary to the
      child's best interest.<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup> In
      addition to case law supporting the need for informed consent
      and the best interest of the child, there are recent federal
      and state statutes protecting female children from genital
      mutilation.<sup><a href="#n158">158</a></sup> Thus, while no
      intersexed Americans have successfully sued a physician or
      hospital for conducting early genital reconstructive surgery,
      they may have grounds to sue based on female genital
      mutilation laws, the constitutional right to privacy and lack
      of informed consent by their parents.</p>

       The U.S. Constitution protects individuals from overreaching
      government powerthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, which
      states "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
      abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
      United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of
      life, liberty, or property, without due process of law
      ..."<sup><a href="#n159">159</a></sup> The U.S. Supreme Court
      has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment as protecting
      individuals from government action that <span
      class="page">[page 56]</span> infringes upon certain
      "fundamental rights" considered "implicit in the concept of
      ordered liberty."<sup><a href="#n160">160</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The Supreme Court has found that the right
      to bodily autonomy, the right to choose whether or not to
      reproduce, the right to marry, and the right to make
      decisions about how to raise children are all fundamental
      privacy rights.<sup><a href="#n161">161</a></sup> The
      government may not violate a person's liberty by infringing
      any of these rights without first proving in a court of law
      that there is a compelling state interest that must be
      served, and that the method that the government is using is
      narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental
      interest.<sup><a href="#n162">162</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Historically, children have not been
      accorded the same constitutional rights as adults. A child's
      parents and the government are allowed to restrict some
      rights that would be held fundamental for an adult.<sup><a
      href="#n163">163</a></sup> The Supreme Court has also
      recognized a fundamental right to family privacy, according
      parents a high degree of respect regarding decisions they
      make about their child's upbringing.<sup><a
      href="#n164">164</a></sup> This includes the choices parents
      make regarding their children's medical care.<sup><a
      href="#n165">165</a></sup> Despite the Fourteenth Amendment
      right to family privacy, the parents' rights must be weighed
      against the children's rights to be protected against harm.
      The doctrine of parens patriae articulates the government's
      interest in protecting the rights of vulnerable individuals
      from harm.<sup><a href="#n166">166</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The doctrine of parens patriae allows the
      government to interfere with parents' choices about how to
      raise their children when the children may be harmed because
      of the parents' actions or inactions.<sup><a
      href="#n167">167</a></sup> Generally, the government
      interferes with <span class="page">[page 57]</span> parental
      decisions under laws prohibiting parental abuse or
      neglect.<sup><a href="#n168">168</a></sup> In the case of
      intersexed children, the government may have reason to
      override the parents' decision to perform surgery if the
      surgery would harm the child.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit
      an individual from violating another individual's fundamental
      rights. Thus, a child cannot generally sue a hospital or a
      physician for an infringement of his or her constitutional
      rights. For there to be a constitutional violation, there
      must be state action.<sup><a href="#n169">169</a></sup> If
      genital reconstruction surgery is performed at a state
      hospital, then there is state action allowing the child to
      sue the hospital directly. If the surgery is conducted at a
      private hospital, there may not be state action. In that
      case, in order to implicate the Fourteenth Amendment, an
      intersexed child who is about to be subjected to genital
      reconstruction surgery must seek an injunction against the
      hospital prior to the surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n170">170</a></sup> If a judge orders the surgery to
      progress, there is state action, and the child may claim a
      constitutional violation.<sup><a href="#n171">171</a></sup>
      If the child successfully claims that the surgery violates a
      fundamental right, then in order for the court to order the
      surgery over the objection of the child or his or her court
      appointed representative, the proponents must prove, by clear
      and convincing evidence, that the surgery is in the child's
      best interest.<sup><a href="#n172">172</a></sup> This
      standard is high, and in order to prevail, the proponent of
      the surgery must establish that there are no less restrictive
      means to accomplish the same result.<sup><a
      href="#n173">173</a></sup> Since there are no studies proving
      that genital reconstruction surgery psychologically benefits
      children, and there are testimonial accounts that genital
      reconstruction surgery causes psychological and physical
      trauma, it is unlikely that the court would find that there
      was clear and convincing evidence of best interest.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="page">[page 58]</span> 1.
      Bodily Integrity: If It Works, Don't Fix It<br />
       Included in the Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy is the
      right to bodily autonomy, which protects individuals from
      intrusion by the government into their health care
      decisions.<sup><a href="#n174">174</a></sup> This right
      includes the right to choose to forego medical treatment,
      even if foregoing treatment may result in death.<sup><a
      href="#n175">175</a></sup> For the most part, children are
      not accorded the right to choose medical treatment or to
      choose to forego medical treatment without parental consent,
      despite the fact that it has been found to be a fundamental
      right.<sup><a href="#n176">176</a></sup> The reason that
      parents are allowed to consent for children is that a child
      may not be able to understand fully the consequences of their
      own consent because of their age or inexperience.<sup><a
      href="#n177">177</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are several exceptions to the rule
      requiring parental consent to treatment. The first exception
      accepted by several states by statute is the "mature minor"
      exception.<sup><a href="#n178">178</a></sup> Minors who are
      considered mature enough to make their own medical decisions
      need not obtain parental consent to medical treatment, and
      may object to medical treatment that their parents choose for
      them.<sup><a href="#n179">179</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Many states have also provided exceptions to
      parental consent requirements for children seeking treatment
      for drug addiction, mental health treatment, and testing and
      treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.<sup><a
      href="#n180">180</a></sup> The logic behind these exceptions
      is that these treatments are very personal, and if required
      to seek parental consent, many children would forego
      treatment. If children could not be treated for HIV, drug
      addiction, or mental illness, they would likely place
      themselves and others in danger.<sup><a
      href="#n181">181</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">These exceptions take into account the fact
      that parents do not always act in their child's best
      interest, and a child may suffer abuse or psychological harm
      if required to seek parental consent to certain treatments.
      The right to choose whether or not to undergo genital
      reconstruction surgery should be an exception to the general
      rule allowing parental consent to treatment of minors.
      Genital reconstruction surgery is a personal choice that
      children should be allowed to make on their own in certain
      circumstances, or, at a minimum, in conjunction with their
      parents. It is difficult for many children to learn about
      their intersexuality. However, it is also hard for children
      to learn to cope with pregnancy, drug addiction, mental
      illness, or their HIV positive status. In contrast to
      intersex conditions, all of the above medical conditions are
      free of parental consent requirements under certain
      circumstances.</p>

      <p class="text2">Genital reconstruction surgery is arguably
      the ultimate infringement of an individual's bodily autonomy.
      Genital reconstruction surgery can cause a child significant
      psychological and physical harm.<sup><a
      href="#n182">182</a></sup> For these reasons, parents should
      not be allowed to make the decision to alter surgically their
      child's genitals without <span class="page">[page 59]</span>
      the child's consent absent clear and convincing evidence that
      it is in the child's best interest. If the state participates
      by allowing the procedure to be performed at a state hospital
      or by ordering the procedure over the child's objection, then
      there may be a constitutional violation of the child's right
      to bodily autonomy under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

      <p class="text1">2. Reproduction: Gonads Cannot Be
      Replaced<br />
       The right to choose whether or not to reproduce is a
      fundamental right and, accordingly, certain restrictions are
      placed on the government's right to interfere with decisions
      bearing on reproduction.<sup><a href="#n183">183</a></sup>
      For example, all minors regardless of age have the right to
      seek an abortion without undue burden from the state, though
      the state may act to ensure that a woman's decision is
      informed.<sup><a href="#n184">184</a></sup> Therefore, even
      when state law requires minors to receive parental consent
      before seeking an abortion, minors are permitted a judicial
      bypass, allowing them the right to prove to a court that they
      are mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion
      without parental consent.<sup><a href="#n185">185</a></sup>
      Children may also have the right to seek contraception,
      treatment for pregnancy, and childbirth without parental
      consent.<sup><a href="#n186">186</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Because reproduction is a fundamental right,
      parents are limited in their ability to consent to
      sterilization procedures for their children. Generally,
      sterilization is raised in the context of a parent who wants
      to sterilize a handicapped child to protect the child from
      the harm of a dangerous pregnancy. If there is an objection
      made by the child or an advocate for the child, then a court
      cannot order the procedure against the child's objections
      without affording the child due process.<sup><a
      href="#n187">187</a></sup> The child must be appointed an
      independent guardian ad litem, and receive a fair trial at
      which the court must determine by clear and convincing
      evidence that the operation to remove the child's gonads will
      be in the child's best interest.<sup><a
      href="#n188">188</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As with all people, some intersexed adults
      do not have the ability to reproduce even without genital
      reconstruction surgery.<sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup>
      Others will retain their full <span class="page">[page
      60]</span> reproductive capacity even after the surgery is
      performed.<sup><a href="#n190">190</a></sup> However, some
      intersexuals have the ability to reproduce either naturally
      or artificially and are denied that right by the removal of
      their gonads and other reproductive organs. For those
      children whose gonads are removed to complete their physical
      transformation, their fundamental right to reproduce has been
      violated. For example, a child born with male chromosomes and
      sexed at birth as female will have her gonads removed, thus,
      effectively sterilizing her.</p>

      <p class="text2">Based on the lack of evidence of the
      effectiveness of genital reconstruction surgery, it would be
      difficult for a court to determine that this procedure is
      clearly in the child's best interest. If there are pros and
      cons to performing the surgery, the court must decide in a
      manner that will not violate the child's fundamental right to
      reproduce.<sup><a href="#n191">191</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">3. Marriage: Determining Gender Determines
      Sexuality<br />
       Genital reconstruction surgery may inhibit or completely
      interfere with a child's fundamental right to marry. In the
      United States, there are currently no states in which it is
      legal to marry someone of the same sex.<sup><a
      href="#n192">192</a></sup> In 1993, several gay couples
      challenged the prohibition against same-sex marriages under
      the Hawaii Constitution.<sup><a href="#n193">193</a></sup>
      The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and
      allowed the first gay couples to marry legally.<sup><a
      href="#n194">194</a></sup> In reaction to the ruling, the
      Hawaii state legislature immediately amended their own
      constitution to prohibit same-sex marriages.<sup><a
      href="#n195">195</a></sup> The federal government reacted to
      the first gay marriages by passing the Defense of Marriage
      Act, which allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex
      marriages that are legally valid in another state.<sup><a
      href="#n196">196</a></sup> Given that 3% of the world
      population does not fit into a clearly defined sex and still
      engage in marriage and child birth, it would be wise to
      re-think this prohibition.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, given the laws as they currently
      stand, genital reconstruction surgically defines an
      intersexed person as male or female, thus, prohibiting them
      from marriage to a person of their "same" gender.
      Intersexuals are in a unique position before they undergo
      genital reconstruction surgery because they can petition the
      court to change their legal gender from female to male or
      male to female without having to undergo a sex change
      operation. They must prove that they are intersexed, <span
      class="page">[page 61]</span> that they have unclear
      genitals, and that they identify as the opposite sex, and
      their birth certificate may be altered.<sup><a
      href="#n197">197</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Once an intersexed person has undergone
      genital reconstruction surgery making his or her genitals
      clearly male or female, he or she cannot then choose to
      change his or her birth certificate without having a second
      round of surgeries performed.<sup><a
      href="#n198">198</a></sup> For example, if a child born with
      male chromosomes or mixed chromosomes is surgically assigned
      a female gender at birth, that individual would be prohibited
      from marrying a female later in life without first undergoing
      another sex change operation.<sup><a
      href="#n199">199</a></sup> In this case, if the initial
      gender reconstruction surgery had not been performed, this
      person would be considered a male, not a homosexual female,
      and thus would have a fundamental right to marry.</p>

      <p class="text2">By choosing a gender for the child and
      performing reconstruction surgery at birth, the doctors may
      be infringing on an individual's ability to marry as an
      adult. The imposition of additional surgery to change their
      assigned sex would add such high financial and emotional
      costs on the individual that it may prohibit some, otherwise
      qualified, intersexuals from marrying.</p>

       Physicians must receive informed consent from all patients
      before they treat them for any medical condition.<sup><a
      href="#n200">200</a></sup> If physicians fail to obtain
      informed consent from their patients, they may be liable for
      medical malpractice.<sup><a href="#n201">201</a></sup> Under
      the informed consent doctrine, a patient may even choose to
      refuse life saving treatment after weighing their treatment
      options.<sup><a href="#n202">202</a></sup> The informed
      consent doctrine originated in the tort doctrine of battery,
      which includes intentionally touching a person in a way that
      they find harmful or offensive.<sup><a
      href="#n203">203</a></sup> The surgical removal of part or
      all of a child's genitals must only be done after receiving
      informed consent or it may be considered battery.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="page">[page 62]</span> Absent a
      recognized exception allowing children to consent to their
      own medical treatment, parents will generally be allowed to
      give or withhold consent for medical treatment on behalf of
      their children. In the United States, genital reconstruction
      surgery is not currently a procedure that children are
      allowed to consent or object to without their parents'
      participation. For informed consent to be valid, the parents
      must be informed of the nature and consequence of their
      child's medical condition, as well as the various treatment
      options available.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Colombian standard of informed consent
      ensures that doctors provide parents with all of the known
      information about intersex conditions over a prolonged period
      of time. Doctors must provide surgical and non-surgical
      options for treatment, and refer parents to support
      organizations for intersexed individuals.<sup><a
      href="#n204">204</a></sup> This model ensures that parents
      are not deceived about their child's prognosis, and that they
      understand that genital reconstruction surgery is not the
      only solution for their child.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the United States, parents of intersexed
      children are not given enough information to make a truly
      informed decision about their child's treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n205">205</a></sup> Some parents are not told that
      their child is intersexed, but instead that their child is a
      girl or boy with "unfinished" genitals that the doctor will
      repair with surgery.<sup><a href="#n206">206</a></sup>
      Physicians may also tell the parents that their baby will
      have "normal" genitals after surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n207">207</a></sup> Surgery may make the child's
      genitals look more clearly male or female, but it will also
      leave scarring and possibly diminish sexual functions.<sup><a
      href="#n208">208</a></sup> Generally, more than one surgery
      is needed to alter completely the genital appearance, and the
      average number of surgeries is three or more.<sup><a
      href="#n209">209</a></sup> Surgery and check-ups will continue
      through the child's early years and may be extremely
      stressful for the child and his or her parents.<sup><a
      href="#n210">210</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Additionally, parents must understand that
      while surgery will make intersexed children look more similar
      to their peers, it will not change their chromosomes. Even
      with hormone therapy, many intersexed youth will endure
      gender dysphoria.<sup><a href="#n211">211</a></sup> They may
      feel confused about their gender despite having genitals that
      look clearly male or female. Intersexed adults may decide
      that their assigned gender is not their gender of choice.
      This might promp the desire for additional, more complicated
      surgeries to perform a complete sex change operation.<sup><a
      href="#n212">212</a></sup> Most of these facts are not
      presented to the parents of intersexed children at the time
      that they approve genital reconstruction surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n213">213</a></sup> If parents are encouraged to
      consent to surgery without being told of the risks and side
      effects, their consent is not truly informed.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are several exceptions to the rule for
      informed consent. The first exception is when there is a
      medical emergency and a person's life or health is in
      immediate danger, the doctors may proceed with a procedure if
      they have not <span class="page">[page 63]</span> received
      instructions to the contrary.<sup><a
      href="#n214">214</a></sup> Most intersexed infants are not in
      any immediate danger that would exempt a physician from
      receiving informed consent to operate.<sup><a
      href="#n215">215</a></sup> Even when intersexed infants have
      medical conditions that require surgical intervention on an
      emergency basis, the emergency aid can be given without
      removing any part of the child's body that is not immediately
      harming the child.<sup><a href="#n216">216</a></sup>
      Physicians have relied upon the emergency doctrine to perform
      full sex change operations on children.<sup><a
      href="#n217">217</a></sup> The argument is that if a parent
      were to learn that their child was intersexed, they might
      raise their child without a clear gender identity thus
      causing the child psychological harm.<sup><a
      href="#n218">218</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Additionally, under the guise of an
      emergency situation, parents are placed under unnecessary
      time pressure to decide whether or not to consent to surgery.
      They are encouraged to make a decision about surgery in the
      first few weeks of their newborn's life. During the first few
      weeks after giving birth, parents may be stressed and anxious
      about their newborn's condition. They should be given more
      time to become accustomed to their child's body before
      doctors recommend surgery that is not medically necessary.
      This pressure forces parents to make decisions without
      seeking outside information to determine if there is a true
      medical necessity for the surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n219">219</a></sup> In some cases, children have been
      operated on even after their parents explicitly refused to
      give consent.<sup><a href="#n220">220</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The emergency doctrine was not meant to
      prevent hypothetical psychological harm to the patient or
      their parents, but to prevent death or serious impairment to
      a patient in an emergency situation.<sup><a
      href="#n221">221</a></sup> Physicians should not surgically
      remove or alter any part of an intersexed child's genitals
      without informed consent absent a true medical emergency.</p>

      <p class="text2">A doctor may also be exempt from explaining
      the exact nature of the illness or treatment if it would be
      unsafe for the patient because it would cause them extreme
      physical or mental duress that would deteriorate their
      condition.<sup><a href="#n222">222</a></sup> This exception
      has also been used by physicians to lie to parents or
      disguise the truth so that they will raise their child
      without any doubts as to the child's gender.<sup><a
      href="#n223">223</a></sup> Reportedly, <span
      class="page">[page 64]</span> doctors do not explain intersex
      conditions to parents because they do not want to shock
      them.<sup><a href="#n224">224</a></sup> Parents are
      frequently told that their child must be operated on in order
      to repair a minor birth defect. Doctors do not always tell
      the parents the chromosomal make-up of their child, or
      explain the ramifications of gender reassignment.<sup><a
      href="#n225">225</a></sup> Although the parents may feel
      distressed upon learning of the child's condition, the
      parents' distress is not enough to exempt doctors from fully
      explaining the whole condition and the treatment
      options.<sup><a href="#n226">226</a></sup> The emergency
      exception applies to the patient's condition, not to the
      parents' reaction to the patient's condition.</p>

      <p class="text2">Additionally, if parents do not understand
      that their child was born intersexed, they will not be in a
      position to understand the issues their child may later
      develop and his or her potential for gender dysphoria. If the
      exceptions to informed consent were extended to prevent
      harmful parental reactions to differences in their child,
      doctors would have free reign to repair all congenital
      abnormalities at the parent's cost without informing the
      parent of the abnormality or obtaining their consent for the
      surgery. The exceptions to the informed consent doctrine were
      clearly not meant to extend this far.</p>

       Intersex children may also have a claim for medical
      malpractice based on violation of the law prohibiting female
      genital mutilation.<sup><a href="#n227">227</a></sup> In
      1996, Congress passed the Criminalization of Female Genital
      Mutilation Act.<sup><a href="#n228">228</a></sup> Five states
      have also individually criminalized female genital
      mutilation.<sup><a href="#n229">229</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The process of removing or altering the
      genitalia of intersexed children is a form of genital
      mutilation as defined by the statute.<sup><a
      href="#n230">230</a></sup> The law prohibits anyone from
      authorizing or performing an operation on a female child to
      remove all or part of her genitals for other than health
      reasons.<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup> The statute
      explicitly covers ritual circumcisions, even if the child
      herself believes in the religious or cultural significance of
      the procedure.<sup><a href="#n232">232</a></sup> In section
      116(c), the law specifically states that no account shall be
      taken of the effect of any belief that has led the person or
      their family to demand the operation.<sup><a
      href="#n233">233</a></sup> This Act holds the physician liable
      even if the family believed that the operation would be in
      the child's best interest and it was standard practice in
      their ethnic or religious community.<sup><a
      href="#n234">234</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">According to the Act, the only way that
      genital operations can be legally performed on female
      children in the United States is if the doctor can show that
      under section 116(b)(1), it is necessary for the health of
      the person on whom it is <span class="page">[page 65]</span>
      performed.<sup><a href="#n235">235</a></sup> As the Colombian
      Constitutional Court found through its extensive
      international research, there is no evidence that most
      surgery performed on intersexed children is done for other
      than psychological reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n236">236</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">When an intersexed child is operated on to
      normalize his or her genitals, it is also part of a cultural
      tradition. Parents want their child to look like other
      children in Western countries, or as close to "normal" as
      possible.<sup><a href="#n237">237</a></sup> In some Native
      American cultures, India, the Dominican Republic, and Papua
      New Guinea, intersexed people are accepted in society and
      occupy a specific cultural and social position.<sup><a
      href="#n238">238</a></sup> In those cultures it would not be
      considered beneficial to the child to alter the child's
      genitals.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the United States, intersexed children
      are operated on in order to make them look like other
      children who are not intersexed. Although some medical
      conditions might endanger intersexed children and therefore
      make the operations beneficial, this is not usually the
      case.<sup><a href="#n239">239</a></sup> Most doctors who
      agree with genital operations for intersexed children claim
      that the surgery is necessary to protect their mental
      health.<sup><a href="#n240">240</a></sup> However, no studies
      have been done that support the question of whether or not
      genital reconstruction and hormones actually protect the
      mental health of the patient any better then counseling and
      education.<sup><a href="#n241">241</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">More than 400 intersexed people
      internationally have contacted ISNA in support of its
      opposition to genital reconstruction surgery on
      children.<sup><a href="#n242">242</a></sup> The
      Constitutional Court of Colombia noted that doctors could not
      find any intersexed people willing to speak in support of
      such surgery on children.<sup><a
      href="#n243">243</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The congressional findings on the practice
      of female genital mutilation in the United States are
      particularly relevant to the issue of genital surgery on
      intersexed children. In particular, Congress found that
      female genital mutilation harms women both physically and
      psychologically.<sup><a href="#n244">244</a></sup> They found
      that the practice violates both federal and state
      constitutional and statutory laws.<sup><a
      href="#n245">245</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="page">[page 66]</span> The
      damaging physical and psychological effects of genital
      reconstruction surgery are identical to the effects of ritual
      female circumcision. In both cases, the surgery may result in
      pain, scarring, and the inability to achieve orgasm.<sup><a
      href="#n246">246</a></sup> Congressional findings that
      females should not be subjected to the loss of any part of
      their genitalia for cultural reasons is directly applicable
      to intersexed children.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Act indicates that parents do not have
      the right to give consent to nonessential genital surgery and
      doctors do not have the right to perform such surgery even if
      it will make the children assimilate with their ethnic and
      religious community.<sup><a href="#n247">247</a></sup> The
      statute only applies to female children.<sup><a
      href="#n248">248</a></sup> If taken as such, the statute may
      violate equal protection.<sup><a href="#n2240">249</a></sup>
      However, the Act does not define "female" by genetic make-up
      or external characteristics. Arguably, most intersexed
      children fall under one definition of "female" or another.
      Thus, intersexed children who have their clitoris reduced or
      other genital parts removed seem to have a strong claim of
      assault under the Female Genital Mutilation Act.</p>

       The United States should consider international standards
      for the treatment of children when considering the legality
      of genital reconstruction surgery. One of the main standards
      by which to judge the international consensus on children's
      rights is the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<sup><a
      href="#n250">250</a></sup> The United States was one of only
      two United Nations member countries that did not sign the
      Convention on the Rights of the Child.<sup><a
      href="#n251">251</a></sup> Despite the fact that the United
      States has not signed the Convention, it is an
      internationally accepted standard that should be considered
      by U.S. healthcare practitioners.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Convention recognizes the rights of
      children independent of their parents by allowing them to
      veto parents' decisions on issues of health, education, and
      religious upbringing.<sup><a href="#n252">252</a></sup> The
      Convention specifically states that a child should have input
      into all decisions affecting him or her.<sup><a
      href="#n253">253</a></sup> Because the decision to alter a
      child's genitals will forever change the course of the
      child's life, particular care should be taken to involve the
      child in this decision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The second international agreement that is
      relevant to the treatment of intersexuals is the Nuremberg
      Code, signed by the United States after World War II.<sup><a
      href="#n254">254</a></sup> The Nuremberg Code prohibits
      countries from conducting experimental <span
      class="page">[page 67]</span> medical treatments on patients
      without their express informed consent.<sup><a
      href="#n255">255</a></sup> Since genital reconstruction surgery
      has only been in practice during the last thirty years and no
      studies have been done to prove the procedures effectiveness,
      critics argue that genital reconstruction surgery is still
      experimental.<sup><a href="#n256">256</a></sup> If the
      procedure is an experimental procedure, then the level of
      consent required should be higher.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other countries look to the U.S. medical
      establishment in developing standards of care.<sup><a
      href="#n257">257</a></sup> It is important for intersexed
      children around the world that doctors within the United
      States make a concerted effort to provide parents and
      children with all available knowledge regarding intersex
      conditions before making the recommendation to perform
      genital reconstruction surgery.</p>

      <p class="text1">VI. C<span
      class="sc1">ONCLUSION</span><br />
       Through its research and publication of many of the facts
      about intersex genital surgery, the Colombian Court has
      opened up a worldwide medical, ethical, and legal debate.
      However, rather than following the Colombian Court's
      decision, the world should heed the court's advice. Diversity
      should not be "a factor of violence and exclusion," but
      rather it should be "an irreplaceable source of social
      wealth."<sup><a href="#n258">258</a></sup> The court,
      paraphrasing Johns Hopkins University professor, Dr. William
      Reiner, challenges the world to listen to intersexuals and to
      learn to coexist with them.<sup><a
      href="#n259">259</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">With those words in mind, future legal
      decisions in the United States and abroad should prohibit
      hospitals from performing childhood genital reconstruction
      surgery when it is not medically necessary. The current
      insistence on genital "normalizing" surgery can be explained
      by our society's obsession with physical appearance and our
      fear of people who are "different."<sup><a
      href="#n260">260</a></sup> However, as the Americans with
      Disabilities Act and other anti-discrimination laws integrate
      more and more people with different physical characteristics
      and abilities, society will begin to accept physical
      differences as a natural and positive part of being
      human.<sup><a href="#n261">261</a></sup> At the point <span
      class="page">[page 68]</span> that our society makes room for
      the intersexed through laws prohibiting gender reassignment
      surgery and unnecessary genital reconstruction surgery on
      children, then people will begin to acknowledge the existence
      of intersexuals. When faced with the fact that 3% of the
      population has chromosomes, genitals, and sexual
      characteristics that are different, teachers will need to
      modify sex education courses. Ideally, children will learn
      that every individual has unique sexual characteristics that
      help make up their gender identity and sexual preference.
      Through open discussions of growth and sexual development,
      intersexed children will learn that they are not alone, and
      others will learn that intersexuality is a common condition
      that may effect someone they know.<sup><a

      the urgency and necessity of the procedures, and the optimal
      age at which surgery should be performed. Id. at 2. Finally,
      the court looked at whether there were any studies showing
      the beneficial or detrimental effects of surgery. Id. The
      court stated that in response to its request for information
      it had received numerous documents, most of which concurred.
      Id. at 3. In the United States, Germany, and Colombia (up
      until this point), surgery on the external genitalia is
      performed as soon as possible after the birth of the infant,
      usually within the first week. Id. at 4. The internal gonads
      are generally removed during adolescence. Id. According to
      medical experts, the surgery is done immediately so that the
      parents will not raise their child without a clear gender
      role. Id. Doctors also hope to prevent the child from
      becoming confused about their gender and deciding to change
      their assigned sex in the future. Id. When the ambiguity is
      not discovered at birth, such as in the case of Ramos, the
      child is usually assigned the gender that the parents have
      raised him or her with thus far. Id. Proponents of the
      surgery argue that if the child's genitals do not conform to
      their social sex, their parents may feel uncomfortable with
      the child's ambiguity. Id. at 5. In addition, the child may
      be teased by their peers and develop low self-esteem or other
      psychological problems. Id. In opposition to the surgery, the
      court received an amicus brief from ISNA to which it often
      references in its opinion. Id. See Intersex Society of North
      America, ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery,
      Nov. 7, 1998, available at <a

      Critiques of the surgery include lack of informed consent by
      parents, lack of long-term studies, and random choice of sex
      assignment by doctors and parents. Ramos Summary, supra <a
      href="#n54">note 54</a>, at 4. The court was not able to
      locate any follow-up studies that had been done on the
      effectiveness of these medical procedures. Id. The court
      referred to the Nuremberg Code that prohibits research and
      experimentation on human subjects without the individual's
      consent. Id. at 6-7.<br />

      "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one
      shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or
      scientific experimentation." Id. art. 7. In Ramos, the
      Colombian Constitutional Court explores the legal dilemma
      created by the doctor's mandate to help the patient in
      whatever way possible stemming from the benevolence principle
      in Articles 44 and 49 of the Colombian Constitution; the
      patient's right to have access to science and technology from
      Articles 13 and 49 of the Constitution; versus the patient's
      right to autonomy and physical integrity, from Articles 1,
      12, 16 and 44. Ramos Summary, supra <a href="#n54">note
      54</a>, at 6. The court also mentions the advancement of
      science that is encouraged by allowing doctors to develop new
      techniques through experimentation without strict judicial
      control. Id. The court states that these constitutional
      principles may often be in contradiction. Id. The court's
      decision is controlled by the principles of autonomy in
      Article 1, and the preservation of the life and health of the
      people in Articles 2 and 46. Id. at 7. Thus, the court
      concludes that people must have more autonomy to consent to
      procedures that are risky to their life and health. Id.; see

      608 P.2d 635 (Wash. 1980) . In limited circumstances, parents
      can consent for their incompetent children to be sterilized
      to protect them from harmful pregnancies. Id. at 638.
      However, there are strict procedural guidelines that the
      court follows before allowing parental consent. Id. at 639.
      The following guidelines must be followed: (1) the child must
      be represented by a disinterested guardian ad litem; (2) the
      child must be incapable of making her own decision about
      sterilization; and (3) the child must be unlikely to develop
      sufficiently to make an informed judgment about sterilization
      in the foreseeable future. Id. at 641. Even after the court
      establishes the listed criteria, the parent or guardian
      seeking an incompetent's sterilization must prove by clear,
      cogent, and convincing evidence that there is a need for
      contraception. Id. First the judge must find that the
      individual is physically capable of procreation. Id. Second
      the judge must find that she is likely to engage in sexual
      activity at the present or in the near future under
      circumstances likely to result in pregnancy. Id. Finally the
      judge must determine that the nature and extent of the
      individual's disability, as determined by empirical evidence
      and not solely on the basis of standardized tests, renders
      him or her permanently incapable of caring for a child, even
      with reasonable assistance. Id.<br />

      (last updated Dec. 22, 2003). The American Medical
      Association defines informed consent as "a basic social
      policy for which exceptions are permitted: (1) where the
      patient is unconscious or otherwise incapable of consenting
      and harm from failure to treat is imminent; or (2) when risk
      disclosure poses such a serious psychological threat of
      detriment to the patient as to be medically contraindicated.
      Social policy does not accept the paternalistic view that the
      physician may remain silent because divulgence might prompt
      the patient to forego needed therapy. Rational, informed
      patients should not be expected to act uniformly, even under
      similar circumstances, in agreeing to or refusing treatment."

      practice of female genital mutilation is carried out by
      members of certain cultural and religious groups within the
      United States; (2) the practice of female genital mutilation
      often results in the occurrence of physical and psychological
      health effects that harm the women involved; (3) such
      mutilation infringes upon the guarantees of rights secured by
      Federal and State law, both statutory and constitutional; (4)
      the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of female
      genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any single
      State or local jurisdiction to control; (5) the practice of
      female genital mutilation can be prohibited without abridging
      the exercise of any rights guaranteed under the first
      amendment to the Constitution or under any other law; and (6)
      Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of Article
      1 , the necessary and proper clause, section 5 of the

      [hereinafter Nuremberg Code]; Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger
      Institute, Inc. 782 A.2d 807 (2001) . This case discusses
      experimental research on children in the United States
      without informed consent. Id. at 811. The court in that case
      stated, "The Nuremberg Code is the most complete and
      authoritative statement of the law of informed consent to
      human experimentation. It is also part of international
      common law and may be applied, in both civil and criminal
      cases, by state, federal and municipal courts in the United
      States." Id. at 835 [internal quotations omitted]. The court
      refers to the text of the Nuremberg Code to support its
      conclusion that the consent to the research was invalid, "The
      voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely
      essential. This means that the person involved should have
      legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to
      be able to exercise free power of choice, without the
      intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress,
      over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or
      coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and
      comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved
      as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened
