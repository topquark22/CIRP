      <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      word &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo; has been well described in
      <i><a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">Marion's case</a></i>, in the Australian
      Supreme Court:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">A treatment is
          therapeutic when it is administered for the chief purpose
          of preventing, removing or ameliorating a cosmetic
          deformity, a pathological condition or a psychological
          disorder, provided that the treatment is appropriate for
          and proportionate to the purpose for which it is
          administered.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n1">1</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,
      any medical procedure that falls outside that definition of
      "therapeutic" is <i>non-therapeutic</i>. There is also a
      helpful discussion of the differences between therapeutic and
      non-therapeutic procedures by <a
      href="/library/legal/somerville1981/">Somerville</a>.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
      its advocates claim that male circumcision---particularly
      routine and/or ritual circumcision of male infants---is a
      ``therapeutic'' intervention, by the above definition, it
      clearly falls under the definition of non-therapeutic. Still,
      the legal and ethical position of circumcision is not well
      understood. Circumcision is a very complex issue, a been said
      of it, "Mothers demand it, doctors profit by it and babies
      cannot complain about it."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> It is estimated that, with more
      than one million circumcisions a year at a cost of the order
      of $200 each, doctors in the United States earn in excess of
      $200 million <i>per annum</i>, from circumcisions. Such a
      major financial incentive to continue routine neonatal
      circumcision helps cloud the legal and ethical issues
      inherent in this activity.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nahid
      Toubia has said that the fundamental question here is whether
      the child or society has the right to decide to alter the
      child's genitals.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> For a lawyer from a common law
      tradition, the legal and ethical principles on which
      non-therapeutic circumcision should be judged are neither
      complex nor novel; and the answer to that question is simple:
      in the United States Supreme Court case of <i>Union Pacific
      Railroad v. Botsford</i> (1891), it was said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">No right is held more
          sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law,
          than the right of every individual to the possession and
          control of his own person, free from all restraint or
          interference of others, unless by clear and
          unquestionable authority of law. As well said by Judge
          Cooley ``the right to one's person may be said by a right
          of complete immunity: to be left alone.''<font
          size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision
      involves the amputation of a body part. Whether done for
      ritual, cultural, "routine," or social reasons, the part
      amputated is healthy flesh from the healthy organ of a
      healthy male. Those who say that it is proper to circumcise
      another, and would do it to another without that other's
      consent, are required to justify the alleged propriety and to
      justify this interference with the bodily integrity and
      functioning of that other.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      people choose, as adults and of their own free will, to have
      their genitals mutilated, by circumcision or by genital
      piercing&mdash;for whatever reasons&mdash;then so be it; but
      the infliction of this on innocent children, as this paper
      will show, is wholly unacceptable under the law.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      is not for those who argue that children have a right to
      remain intact and to be protected from circumcision to
      demonstrate that circumcision is damaging and, unless
      required for legitimate therapeutic reasons, unjustifiable.
      Even if it were wrongly suggested that the burden were so
      laid on the protectors of children, there is more than
      sufficient evidence available for that purpose. Rather, it is
      clearly for the circumcisers, not least in the light of
      mainstream medical knowledge and current legal concepts, to
      make good their general and specific assertions, by careful
      and rigorous evidence, that circumcision is in all cases
      painless, risk-free, harmless, beneficent, and in the best
      interests of the child.</p>

      <p><b>1. CIRCUMCISION IN BRITAIN</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      have concentrated my remarks on the American medical
      profession's practice of routine neonatal circumcision and on
      ritual circumcision because these have had a malign influence
      on medical and legal thinking in Britain. In Britain each
      year, far too many "medical" circumcisions are performed in
      the absence of compelling therapeutic need.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> It seems
      likely that the continuing acceptance of British medical
      school thinking of the 1920s to the late 1950s and early
      1960s (despite Gairdner's landmark <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">paper</a>)<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> coupled with
      an unwillingness to question the ritual claims, results in
      something approaching 60,000 circumcisions each year, almost
      all without any legitimate medical justification, and some
      one-half for purely ritual reasons.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> Ritual and medical misfeasance
      interact and each supports the other in a form of <i>danse
      macabre</i>.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      circumcisions performed in Britain fall broadly into 4
      groups. First, there are those small number---of the order of
      1% or perhaps fewer---where less invasive treatments (such as
      antibiotics, simple stretching of the prepuce, steroid
      creams, or preputioplasty) for a problem with the foreskin is
      of no avail: these almost invariably involve the presence of
      Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,
      are those circumcisions where the doctor, for reasons of
      idleness, supposed ease (at least for himself) of treatment,
      ignorance of the anatomy, function, and value of the
      foreskin, ignorance of the literature and so on, refers every
      slight or imaginary problem of the foreskin for
      amputation.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third,
      there are the ritual circumcisions, which are wholly
      non-therapeutic and wilful, whether performed by lay
      circumcisers (<i>mohels,</i> in the case of Judaism), some of
      whom may possess medical qualifications, or by complaisant
      family doctors.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth,
      there are those ritual circumcisions performed in hospitals
      by hospital doctors acting in that capacity.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      the United States, doctors, in order to be paid, must fit
      treatments into the health insurers' reimbursement codes,
      hence the unjustifiable diagnosis in neonates of "congenital
      phimosis," "redundant foreskin," or some other illegitimate
      excuse for routine circumcision. These fictions both ensure
      reimbursement from insurance companies and allow the doctor
      to cajole the parents into this procedure under the pretext
      that the child's penis is abnormal. Anecdotes are legion in
      the United States of the improper solicitation of this
      procedure. Hospital staff have bullied parents, recited to
      them the litany of bogus medical reasons without any mention
      of the contraindications, or have told parents that it is
      either mandatory, hospital policy, or state law that every
      boy must be circumcised.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British
      doctors, however, do not have to pretend that these
      circumcisions are anything other than pure religious ritual
      (<i>vide</i> the circumcision clinic at the Bradford Royal
      Infirmary where nurses circumcise, at a modest cost, for
      ritual reasons). Instead, they excuse and attempt to justify
      their actions by stating that, if a boy is going to be
      circumcised anyway, he should be circumcised within the
      National Health Service for reasons of safety. This, however,
      not only betrays the child, who is as entitled as any other
      patient to ethical and responsible care from a doctor, but
      also lends a spurious air of medical acceptability to a
      pre-historic blood ritual.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      British medical profession's failure to examine the physical,
      psychological, and sexological consequences of circumcision
      itself may stem from unjustified fears of breaching codes of
      religious tolerance, fears of provoking the politically
      dangerous charges of "anti-Semitism" as well as charges of
      misconduct both by the individual doctor and by the
      profession as a whole.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,
      it should be acknowledged that a medical degree is not an
      liberating force. The failure of the medical profession, or
      of many elements within the medical profession, to examine
      circumcision objectively may stem from personal motivations
      of individual doctors. Many doctors involved in the endless
      "invention" of medicalised excuses for circumcision do so as
      a consequence of pre-existing biases of religious,
      psychosexual, or financial origin.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly,
      there are doctors in both Britain and the United States who
      argue strongly for routine circumcision, though in the teeth
      of the objective medical evidence, and usually by omitting
      any reference to the corpus of literature. In Britain, these
      tend to be doctors of Jewish or Muslim belief.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> Unlike
      American doctors, these men do not go as far as to urge
      universal infant circumcision on the whole population, but
      they do present a dishonest, distorted, and
      religiously-motivated view of the alleged "medical benefits"
      of circumcision. This appears to be motivated by a conscious
      or even unconscious desire to have the general public believe
      that ritual circumcision is an acceptable practice. The
      effectiveness of these tactics is shown both by the general
      lack of criticism of ritual/routine circumcision in Britain,
      and by the advice invariably given by advice columnists and
      "agony aunts" in the British popular press and on television
      that circumcision is a minor procedure causing no harm or
      loss.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      the United States, however, the campaign by a few doctors
      with religious biases, as well as Gentile doctors, to push
      mass circumcision on the entire population, at any cost, is
      unremitting. The long, shameful, and discreditable history of
      medicalised propaganda for mass circumcision in the United
      States is a roster of such extremists as Drs. J. M. Moses,
      Abraham L. Wolbarst, and Abraham Ravich in the nineteenth and
      twentieth centuries to the current propagandists Drs. Edgar
      J. Schoen and Gerald N. Weiss (discussed more fully below).
      They are joined by Gentile doctors, the most vocal of whom is
      Dr. Thomas E. Wiswell.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
      can only speculate on the motivations of those Christian,
      Jewish, and Muslim doctors, particularly those in the United
      States, who misrepresent the consequences of circumcision on
      bodily and functional integrity. One must also wonder what
      the motivation could be for those doctors, such as Schoen,
      who not only agitate for an entirely circumcised United
      States, but unceasingly work to push circumcision on Europe,
      and probably elsewhere as well. It is one thing to try to
      rationalise ritual circumcision and no more, although the
      dishonesty employed is unacceptable. It is entirely another
      thing to strive for the circumcision of the entire world.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      motives of doctors without evident pre-existing religious
      biases are unlikely to be any less disturbing. One deep
      anxiety at work here may be that unbiased scientific
      investigation and documentation of the harm of circumcision
      and the corresponding value of intact genitalia may place
      certain religions in a bad light. Furthermore, the seeming
      reluctance of the medical profession to admit to themselves
      (let alone to the public) that they have been guilty of
      having harmed millions of boys over the years by circumcising
      them for bogus medical reasons may also be behind this
      silence. These anxieties certainly appear, as discussed
      below, to have motivated the stances that the General Medical
      Council and the British Medical Association have taken in
      respect to circumcision.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
      anxieties, however, whilst understandable, are obstacles in
      the path of scientific advancement and community safety and
      have led to professional misconduct on a wide scale, and as
      such are wholly unacceptable from a legal and ethical
      standpoint. Injustices cannot be ignored simply because the
      naming of an injustice implies the naming of a guilty party.
      This sort of sophistry was best summed by Szasz:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Why is RNC [routine
          neonatal circumcision] legal? Because it is defined as
          preventive medicine. Why is it defined as preventive
          medicine? To avoid having to ban it as genital
          mutilation.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n11">11</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>2. THE ORIGINS OF NON-THERAPEUTIC CIRCUMCISION</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      order to explain why circumcision has traditionally existed
      in a legal and ethical muddle, it is helpful to examine some
      of the deeply-felt irrationalities that motivate it.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind
      the religious sanitation, the motives for circumcision are
      pre-historic, primitive, barbaric, and cruel. Circumcision
      sprang from sacrificial impulses, from the desire to control
      individuals and to mark them with tribal identifiers, to
      initiate the youths into the tribe, and, through the
      infliction of an excruciatingly painful procedure, gain proof
      of the youths' fortitude and courage.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      is likely also that mutilating the genitals of others has a
      deep sexual motive. This motive combined with the urge to
      control people when, in the nineteenth century, doctors first
      introduced "medicalised" circumcision in the vain attempt to
      prevent masturbation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13-14</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      those who can stomach it, the comments and behaviours of
      proponents of circumcision would make a fruitful area of
      psychological study.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> They fully bear out
      Woodmansey's comment that "Something must be done to help the
      parents who show such an irrational need...."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> It would
      seem wholly plausible that inflicting circumcision on a boy
      provides some circumcisers and onlookers with a sexual
      thrill. Groups such as the Acorn Society, the Gilgal Society,
      and the Cutting Club openly admit to a morbid fascination
      with circumcision to the point of sado-masochistic fetish.
      These groups advertise that doctors are among their members.
      There are those on the Internet who discuss the erotic
      stimulation they experience by watching other males being
      circumcised, swap fiction and about it, and trade in
      videotapes of actual circumcisions. Furthermore, there are
      anecdotal accounts of doctors becoming sexually aroused when
      circumcising boys.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> Circumcision certainly
      provides an opportunity not only to handle boys' penises
      without the condemnation that a sexual assault (in the sense
      that phrase is normally used) would attract, but also the
      opportunity to exercise power over another human being, to
      alter the penis and to control it and the boy's future sexual
      life.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely,
      there is also a strong undercurrent of sexual repression
      flowing through the traditions of peoples who practice ritual
      circumcision. Szasz writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">The roots of both RNC
          (``Routine Neonatal Circumcision'') and anti-masturbatory
          measures lie in Jewish law, which recognises the
          legitimacy of erotic pleasure associated with sexual
          intercourse, provided that the act is marital-genital
          congress between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman. Every
          other sexual act is strictly prohibited. Masturbation is
          condemned unequivocally both in the Talmud and in
          extra-Talmudic literature. The <i>Zohar</i> (an
          authoritative commentary on the Pentateuch) calls
          masturbation ``a sin more serious than all the sins of
          the Torah.''<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> Recognising the obvious
          connections between touching the penis and sexual
          arousal, Jewish law ``definitely prohibits touching one's
          genitals---the unmarried man never, and the married man
          only in connection with urination.''<font
          size="2"><sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> When an
          Orthodox Jewish father bladder trains his son, he
          admonishes him: ``Without hands! Better a bad aim than a

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This

      the remark of Lord Jakobovits, the former Chief Rabbi, in the

          other 95 per cent. or 99 per cent. must accept and treat
          as equal violations of the moral code which, after all,

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
      it would be encouraging to imagine that Lord Jakobovits would
      apply the same reasoning to circumcision, which since the
      days of the Greeks and Romans has indeed been considered a
      violation of the moral code by the majority,<font

          particular the Jewish Members of this House should
          perhaps remember that Hitler and the Nazis persecuted not
          only the Jews and gypsies but also homosexuals. No doubt

      Maimonides (1135-1204 AD.), a noted Jewish rabbi, sage, and

          bodily injury caused to that organ is exactly that which
          is desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor
          does it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision
          simply counteracts excessive lust.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p><b>3. CURRENT POSTURES</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
      today it is usually rationalised on the grounds of hygiene or
      disease prevention, circumcision is also put forward as a
      deeply religious and/or cultural expression. Frequently
      stated are comfortable claims such as "It's part of being
      Jewish/Muslim to be circumcised," or "It's the All-American
      way to be circumcised, to be a regular guy." Thus, behind the
      window-dressing of medical excuses lurk barely concealed
      irrationalities that have marked this amputation from its
      earliest days.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      medical literature itself, while giving the illusion of
      integrity and scientific impartiality, is equally vulnerable
      to contamination from the pre-existing biases of doctors. Dr.
      Edgar J. Schoen, although a well-known advocate of universal
      neonatal circumcision, was still, despite his documentable
      lack of impartiality, appointed the chairman of the 1989
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Task Force on
      Circumcision. In a recent paper, Schoen attempted to promote
      neonatal circumcision in Europe with the irrational "medical"
      argument that "evidence indicates that women in Middle
      America have a sexual preference for circumcised men."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n26">26-27</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly,
      another American advocate of mass circumcision on supposedly
      "medical grounds," Dr. Martin L. Dresner, wrote in the pages
      of a leading American urological journal: "The strong
      preference that a majority of men and women have for the
      circumcised phallus is enough for me to want to offer it to
      those parents and patients who desire it."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> Dresner
      concludes his argument on the alleged "medical"
      justifications for subjecting all new-born boys to foreskin
      amputation by playing on the irrational American middle-class
      anxiety over conformity, stating:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">When asked, "What do
          you think?" by those that are still undecided despite

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
      evidence of the pervasiveness of irrational, non-scientific
      anxieties in American medicine is found in a paper published
      by Dr. Jerry Byrum, in which he claims to evaluate, in an
      unbiased fashion, all the medical literature pertaining to
      circumcision. Leaving aside the fact that he only presents
      the literature published by advocates of mass circumcision
      and ignores all the literature documenting the rich sensory
      innervation of the prepuce, Byrum, like Dresner, concludes
      his allegedly unbiased and thoroughly scientific argument
      with an even stronger appeal to a falsified and carefully
      manipulated middle-class American conformism, stating:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">For what it is worth, I
          would have my newborn son circumcised. For me, it's still

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.
      Gerald N. Weiss, another vocal American advocate of mass
      circumcision, wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">For millennia the
          male's preputial cavity has acted as a cesspool for
          infectious agents transmitting diseases, although
          amenable to prophylactic surgery...More than half the
          people on this globe live in fear of plagues, often
          unaware of means of prevention.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n31">31</a></sup></font></font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
      by the "snake-oil" claims of circumcisers, the assertion that
      the foreskin is a "cesspool of infection" and the primary
      cause of plagues is not, and indeed could not be,
      substantiated by Weiss. Later, Weiss's unhealthy obsession
      with foreskin amputation is shown by his repetition: "The
      very anatomy, gross and microscopic, of the preputial sac
      speaks of the nature of a cesspool." That any
      <i>soi-disant</i> responsible medical journal (even one in
      the United States) saw fit to publish this piece is
      stunning.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.
      Terry Russell,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></font> an Australian general
      practitioner, and an advocate of mass circumcision for
      ``hygiene'' reasons offers: "What man after a night of
      passion is going to perform penile hygiene before rolling
      over and snoring the night away (with pathogenic organisms
      multiplying in the warm moist environment under the
      prepuce)"; to which one can only say that there is no
      evidence educed of "pathogenic organisms" and that the woman,
      who is just as likely to "roll over and snore the night away"
      will have her much more convoluted, internal, and thus
      retentive, genitals bathed in her and her partner's fluids.
      Furthermore, the argument for the ease of cleaning claimed
      for male circumcision has not led to demands in any civilised
      country for excision of the clitoral hood and the labia in
      infant girls (who, despite also producing smegma) are relied
      upon to wash.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      Britain, supporters of universal non-therapeutic circumcision
      also typically, and untrammelled by evidence, twist the
      realities. While most supporters of Jewish and Muslim
      circumcision claim both a religious and scientific mandate,
      it is interesting to note that one never observes them
      claiming solidarity with the other cultures or religions who
      circumcise, presumably because a link to African tribesmen,
      Australian aborigines, New Guinea head hunters, or Filipino
      villagers would betray the uncomfortable superstitious
      reality behind the religious smokescreen.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      more chillingly honest account of the reality behind
      circumcision advocacy can be seen in an article by
      Flusfelder, a Jewish man, who wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">My wife is not Jewish.
          Our child---regardless of the condition of his penis---is
          not Jewish, if you pay attention to the Orthodox
          authorities. All the same, it was important to me to have
          Julius circumcised.... ``You know, it still won't make
          him Jewish,'' said Dr Cohen....I held Julius's legs down
          and apart. Whenever I felt a tremor from him, I pushed
          down slightly harder on the knees. The action seemed to
          comfort him. He stopped crying. He became calm. It was
          almost as if he trusted us....Dr Cohen gathered Julius's
          foreskin between his fingers, pulled it away, and his sad
          little glans was exposed....I heard the sound of Dr
          Cohen's breathing, and then I heard the sound of scissors
          tearing through skin. And then, a moment later, the
          horrible scream that Julius made of utter, excruciating
          pain....Supposedly, circumcised penises have 30 per cent
          less sensitivity than uncircumcised ones....God is
          perfect, man cannot be, so let us blemish our synagogue
          floors and mutilate our sons to prove it. I still don't
          believe in God. And if I have another son I am sure that
          he will be circumcised too.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n33">33</a></sup></font></font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
      can only ask "why?" Why this mutilation, of his son, by a man
      who does not believe in God, and thus for whom the "religious
      duty" can have no meaning; when the child cannot become
      Jewish by so doing it (or less Jewish by not doing it) and
      thus "cultural identity" seems meaningless; when he does not
      claim any medical benefits for doing it; and he accepts that
      it is painful, and damaging to penile sensitivity?</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither
      should we seek a rational basis for the remark made by Rabbi
      Julia Neuberger of the King's Fund and a member of the
      General Medical Council's committee on circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">I don't think the World
          Health Organisation saying ``stop'' is a reason for

          against it, as one does with female circumcision.<font

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawud
      O. Noibi of IQRA Trust London has advised solicitors acting
      for a Muslim father.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup></font> He writes, <i>inter alia:</i>
      "Under Islamic Law, the circumcision of boys is very
      essential and required. Indeed, most of the schools of
      Islamic Law argue strongly that it is obligatory to
      circumcise boys and that it is sinful on the part of their
      parents not to do so." Dr. Sami Aldeeb's research has
      conclusively demonstrated that the claim that Islam requires
      circumcision is illegitimate because there is no mention of
      circumcision in the Koran.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup></font> It is noteworthy that Muslims
      claim, as do Jewish religious authorities, that the failure
      to circumcise the child is a sin by the parents. A
      belief-system that holds that salvation and/or avoidance of
      sin depends on the sacrifice of another, rather than a
      sacrifice of oneself requires careful analysis.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noibi
      also alleges: "The earlier the circumcision is done the more
      convenient and less painful it would be for the child."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> He merely
      echoes here what is often said by ritual circumcisers about
      pain, the medical evidence notwithstanding; but the phrase
      "more convenient" is a chilling one. How is it <i>more
      convenient</i>? For whom is it <i>more convenient</i>? One
      suspects that the ``convenience'' is not that of the child:
      Maimonides gives convincing if wholly unattractive reasons
      for circumcision in the early days:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">In the first place, if
          one waited until the boy grew up he might not then let
          himself be circumcised; in the second place, because the
          child experiences less pain than the adult on account of
          the tenderness of its skin and the weakness of its
          imagination, the adult fearing something before it has
          happened, seeing its arrival; in the third place, because
          the parents to not as yet love their child with fervent
          tenderness. That emotion has not yet been formed in the
          parents of which love for the child is born. For this
          emotion grows constantly with the sight of the child and
          increases in strength in the same measure as the child
          increases in years. Consequently, if circumcision were
          postponed to the second or third year, it would often be
          omitted entirely, due to the tender affection of the
          father for his child. But at its birth the love of the
          father, who is bound to this commandment, is still very
          imperfect.<font size="2"><sup><a

      v. Brown</i>.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup></font> The only other case in which
      non-therapeutic circumcision receives a mention is <i>R v.
      Adesayna</i> (finding that the ritual scarification of the
      cheeks of young boys was criminal). <i>Adesayna</i> can
      hardly be described as a ``leading case.''<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup></font> The Law
      Commission say that Judge King-Hamilton QC considered that
      the potential for serious injury, as part of the ritual
      scarification of the cheeks of two boys by their mother was
      great because of the danger that the slightest move of the
      head might lead to injury to the eye, in distinction, he
      considered, from the accepted practices of ear-piercing and
      ritual circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></font> Such a comment, however, is
      clearly <i>obiter</i>.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Commission's assertion that, "male circumcision is lawful
      under English common law," is undermined by the Consultation
      Paper itself. If the law were indeed as clear as the
      Commission would have us believe, then it is curious that the
      Association of Chief Police Officers are quoted as seeing a
      need to "make the position entirely clear;" it is also of
      note that the Commission makes reference to "formulating
      rules as to the nature of the consent given by the victim and
      the limits and the circumstances in which consent is legally
      effective."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      the law were "clear," as alleged by the Commission, and
      ritual circumcisions were lawful at common law, it would not
      be necessary to "put the lawfulness of ritual male
      circumcision beyond any doubt," as the Law Commission
      propose.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      general rule in English criminal law, and reflected in other
      common law jurisdictions, is that any application of force,
      no matter how slight, is <i>prima facie</i> an assault, but
      that <i>consent</i> will serve as a defence to assaults that
      do not inflict actual bodily harm. There are certain
      exceptions to this general rule as to the defence of
      consensual violence, the most important of which is that
      medical treatment is lawful even when grave bodily injury is
      inflicted in the course of it, provided consent is present or
      an emergency makes it appropriate to dispense with consent.
      Thus Lord Lane in <i>Attorney-General's Reference (No 6 of
      80)</i> said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">So, in our judgment, it
          is immaterial whether the act occurs in private or
          public; it is an assault if actual bodily harm is
          intended and/or is caused. This means that most fights
          will be unlawful regardless of consent. Nothing which we
          have said is intended to cast doubt upon the accepted
          legality of properly conducted games and sports, lawful
          chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical
          interference, dangerous exhibitions, etc. These apparent
          exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of
          a legal right, in the case of chastisement or correction,
          or as needed in the public interest, in the other
          cases.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      broad reason given, and expressly approved by the House of
      Lords in <i>R v. Brown</i>, for certain exceptions to the
      general prohibition on assaults inflicting bodily harm (even
      with consent) was one of public policy, even though, as Lord
      Templeman himself said, public policy is not static, and
      behaviour that once was tolerated is now criminalised---he
      gives the example of duelling.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></font> Second, in the context of
      non-therapeutic circumcision, it is helpful to examine
      critically what is implied by the claim of public policy (a
      claim clearly made <i>obiter</i> and not amplified or
      explained by Lord Templeman nor given any support by the
      other Law Lords) to justify routine or ritual circumcision.
      Lord Templeman, in a passage that has been heavily relied
      upon by ritual circumcisers, stated:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">In some circumstances
          violence is not punishable under the criminal law. When
          no actual bodily harm is caused, the consent of the
          person affected precludes him from complaining. There can
          be no conviction for the summary offence of common
          assault if the victim has consented to the assault. Even
          when violence is intentionally inflicted and results in
          actual bodily harm, wounding or serious bodily harm the
          accused is entitled to be acquitted if the injury was a
          foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the
          person injured was participating. Surgery involves
          intentional violence resulting in actual or sometimes
          serious bodily harm but surgery is a lawful activity.
          Other activities carried on with the consent by or on
          behalf of the injured person have been accepted as lawful
          notwithstanding that they involve actual bodily harm.
          Ritual circumcision, tattooing, ear-piercing and violent
          sports including boxing are lawful activities.<font
          size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n51">51</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
      are instances where society may be entitled to legitimise the
      infliction of harm on another without that other's consent,
      such as the punishment of crimes. Yet, to describe and
      consider the infliction of harm on another without that
      other's consent as part of the legal framework of consensual
      injuries is to inflict a grave and profoundly unhelpful
      distortion to language and legal thinking.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      failure to analyse the various situations involving assaults,
      injuries, and consent was a major factor in the flaws in the
      House of Lords judgment of <i>R v. Brown</i> and the Law
      Commission's Consultation Paper <i>Consent in the Criminal
      Law</i>.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n52">52-53</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
      seemingly obsessed were their Lordships by their repugnance
      towards <i>homosexual</i> sado-masochistic behaviour (but not
      seemingly towards the <i>heterosexual</i> sado-masochistic
      practices advertised, promoted, and offered by the dominatrix
      Miss Whiplashes of Britain) that they, and in turn the Law
      Commission, lost sight of the essential difference between
      consent given by oneself to an injury to oneself, and assent
      given by one <i>qua</i> parent or guardian for an injury to a
      child.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently,
      Lord Templeman's language in the quoted passage needs to be
      examined critically, since this examination reveals the lack
      of logic or even precision of thought that has so bedevilled
      the legality of non-therapeutic circumcision. He states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">When violence is
          intentionally inflicted and results in actual bodily
          harm, wounding or serious bodily harm the accused is
          entitled to be acquitted if the injury was a foreseeable
          incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured
          was participating.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n54">54</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
      a general comment it may pass muster, though it seems to
      suffer from a degree of circularity. Its applicability to
      non-therapeutic circumcision, however, is more doubtful
      Non-therapeutic circumcision certainly requires the
      application of force, and in legal terms <i>violence</i> to
      the person being circumcised; that violence is inflicted
      deliberately, with intention, and is not an accidental
      application of violence. It inflicts, within the definitions
      of the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, a wounding
      (which is any injury where the full thickness of the skin is
      breached), and in the light of the medical evidence, causes
      serious (or as the 1861 Act describes it, <i>grievous</i>)
      bodily harm. The injury was <i>ex hypothesi</i> a
      ``foreseeable incident'' of the amputation of the foreskin.
      Two elements thus remain.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
      one must determine whether the child can be properly
      described as ``participating.'' He certainly is physically
      present; but no one has asked, or indeed---given his age in
      most cases---could ask for his views. He certainly has
      violence inflicted upon him; but the need to restrain him,
      the clear medical evidence of the pain he suffers (although
      that pain has traditionally been denied by circumcisers), and
      his lack of any input into what is being inflicted upon him
      makes a nonsense of any suggestion of his participating
      actively in his circumcision. The self-serving claim that
      such a child ``participates'' in his circumcision is
      reminiscent of Humpty Dumpty's argument:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">"When <i>I</i> use a
          word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it
          means just what I chose it to mean---neither more or
          less."<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n55">55</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
      is the case in <i>bris milah</i>, where it is often asserted
      that the infant derives some sort of "spiritual benefit" from
      his ``participation.''</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,
      one must determine whether circumcision is lawful; and here
      Templeman's <i>obiter dictum</i> seems to say no more than:
      force is lawful when it is lawful, and unlawful when it is
      unlawful. His words are bereft of anything that assist in
      defining whether an act might or might not be lawful. In as
      much as one can make any sense of his comment, it appears
      that he is suggesting (as shown by his phrase "Other
      activities carried on with the consent by or on behalf of the
      injured person have been accepted as lawful...") that consent
      might appropriately be given by someone other than the
      assaulted person. One is left, however, in difficulties as to
      what the word "Other" refers to. Is it in contrast, as
      grammar and its position would suggest, referring to
      "surgery," which is the subject of the preceding sentence? Or
      is it supposed to refer back to, and contrast with, "lawful
      activity in which the person injured was participating"? No
      matter how one construes the remark, one must observe that
      ritual circumcision is, for a Jewish boy, commanded to be
      inflicted when he is a neonate, and for a Muslim boy, to be
      is inflicted during childhood. Consequently, these assaults
      are never, and never intended to be, performed on a fully
      consenting and legally competent adult and are thus in sharp
      factual, ethical, and legal distinction to the other
      activities set out by Templeman.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Templeman
      prays in aid that an exemption for non-therapeutic
      circumcision from the ordinary rules dealing with assaults
      under the common law is a matter of public policy, and in so
      suggesting, seems to indicate that it is not to be seen as
      being merely an example of a surgical procedure, but rather
      is an exemption in its own right. Has it been clearly
      established that the common law, as Templeman alleges, has
      created a special exemption for non-therapeutic circumcision;
      a procedure which for centuries in Britain was practised
      solely by Jews and the few Muslims? To assert this is to
      postulate a policy of religious toleration of Jews and their
      religion in Britain over the centuries. Much as we may regret
      it, there is no evidence to support this: indeed, in
      mediaeval times, Britain demonstrated the same religious
      intolerance as other countries in the deplorable pan-European
      hostility towards Jews. Given that England expelled the Jews
      in 1290 and given a general hostility towards other religions
      and even Christian sects, it is hard to imagine that the
      common law developed a special dispensation for Jewish ritual
      circumcision.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      more plausible explanation for the toleration of ritual
      non-therapeutic circumcision by Jews and Muslims springs from
      the English legal principle that surgery may be performed by
      any person, and not solely by a medically qualified doctor.
      That explanation fits the pattern of non-therapeutic
      circumcision in Britain more easily than some late
      twentieth-century political correctness about religious
      toleration; it explains the toleration of circumcision in
      Britain of Christian circumcision in the latter part of the
      nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth century as a
      prevention of, and punishment for, masturbation and other
      medicalised excuses.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      non-therapeutic circumcision be merely an example of a
      surgery, albeit often performed by the medically unqualified,
      then it can be put into the framework, as any other medical
      procedure, where legal guidelines operate for example as to
      consent, rationale, benefit, and the protection of operator
      and the person operated upon.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If,
      however, despite the lack of any authority to support that
      and despite the theoretical problems inherent in that
      concept, non-therapeutic circumcision is an exception in its
      own right (rather than simply an example of a surgical
      procedure) then it needs to be re-examined in the light of
      current medical knowledge as to its severely adverse effects
      in terms of pain, risks, and, above all, the considerable
      damage to function. Such academic writings as there have been
      in the past that have indicated a toleration of
      non-therapeutic circumcision were explicitly on the false
      premise of there being lack of physical harm to the
      child.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n57">57-58</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr
      Sebastian Poulter comes closest to a proper analysis of male
      circumcision in earlier academic writing, albeit that his
      writing is flawed by a misunderstanding of the effect of the
      medical studies on pain, risks, and inevitable losses and
      damage. Poulter writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">The basic right to
          bodily integrity which everyone possesses under the
          English common law means that any interference with this
          right amounts to an assault or battery....The question
          raised in cases of circumcision, excision or infibulation
          is whether the operation can be justified as constituting
          lawful as opposed to unlawful interference with this
          right.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n59">59</a></sup></font></font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing
      there, it is noteworthy that Poulter groups male circumcision
      with various forms of female genital mutilation.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
      continues:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Although there are no
          precedents in this field to rely on there would appear to
          be three possible grounds upon which a defence of
          lawfulness might succeed at common law. The first is that
          the procedure is therapeutic. If this can be established
          a parent can validly consent to it on behalf of a child
          who is too young to understand what is being done. It
          would appear unlikely that this line of defence could
          generally succeed other than in comparatively rare
          instances of physical defect or abnormality. Second,
          although the matter is not entirely free from doubt, it
          seems that a parent may equally validly authorise a
          non-therapeutic operation, provided it is not actively
          against his child's interests. This would appear to have
          been the basis upon which the vast majority of male
          infants have been circumcised in this country with
          impunity from time immemorial. There is no need under
          this heading for the parent to establish that the
          operation is positively beneficial for the child, merely
          that he was acting reasonably in authorising it. Third,
          it has been tentatively suggested that a parent may even
          authorise something that is against his child's interests
          if it is compensated by sufficient advantage to others
          and is not seriously detrimental to the child. This
          exception is particularly apposite for establishing the
          legitimacy of transplant operations which directly
          benefit patients in pressing need (e.g. a brother or
          sister). It seems extremely unlikely that it could
          justify the more remote and controversial benefit of
          satisfying a deeply-felt community attachment to
          traditional customs. Moreover, to the extent that female
          circumcision, excision and infibulation are in fact
          mutilations and hence seriously detrimental to the child
          the defence would be ruled out in any case.<font

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poulter
      concludes that male circumcision is lawful; but this can only

      right of a parent to assent to an assault to the bodily
      integrity of his child for non-therapeutic grounds (i.e., his
      grounds 2 and 3) and in the correctness of his view that male
      circumcision is harmless and is not, in medical terms and its
      consequences to the victim, to be equated with female
      circumcision. The correctness of his view of parental consent

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      February 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
      Committee on Bioethics released a statement on "<a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/">"Informed Consent, Parental
      Permission, an Assent in Pediatric Practice"</a>." This
      document states in part:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">In attempting to adapt
          the concept of informed consent to pediatrics, many
          believe that the child's parents or guardians have the
          authority or ``right'' to give consent by proxy. Most
          parents seek to safeguard the welfare and best interests
          of their children with regard to health care, and as a
          result proxy consent has seemed to work reasonably
          well.<br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
          the concept encompasses many ambiguities. Consent
          embodies judgements about proposed interventions and,
          more importantly, consent (literally ``to feel or sense
          with'') expresses something for one's self: a person who
          consents responds based on unique personal beliefs,
          values, and goals.<br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus
          ``proxy consent'' poses serious problems for pediatric
          health care providers. Such providers have legal and
          ethical duties to their child patients to render
          competent medical care based on what the patient needs,
          not what someone else expresses. Although impasses
          regarding the interests of minors and the expressed
          wishes of their parents or guardians are rare, the
          pediatrician's responsibilities to his or her patient
          exist independent of parental desires or proxy
          consent.<font size="2"><sup><a

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      American Academy of Pediatrics Committee concluded that, for
      a child-patient, the concepts of informed consent and of
      patient assent cannot apply. The concept of informed parental
      permission cannot apply because informed parental permission,
      they suggest, allows for medical interventions only in
      situations of clear and immediate medical necessity, such as
      disease, trauma, or deformity. Thus, they suggest that, in
      non-essential treatments that could be deferred without
      substantial risk, the physician and family wait until the
      child's consent can be obtained.</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      BMA and the GMC seem unable or unwilling to recognise that
      their refusal to discuss the ethical difficulties in
      performing medically unnecessary and medically harmful
      surgery on a child was itself a declaration of their position
      in ethical terms. Being prepared not only to participate in
      these non-therapeutic circumcisions, but also to lend support
      to and not condemn such procedures, itself sends a signal
      that performing such surgery is not seen by these bodies as
      unethical.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
      8 August 1998, the <i>BMA News Review</i> published a news
      item about the Fifth International Symposium on Sexual
      Mutilations. In this article, the BMA medical ethics
      committee chairman Michael Wilks is quoted as saying, "We
      don't have a position on this because there is no clear
      evidence of either the benefits or the harm of circumcision,
      although there is an issue of consent."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></font> This is a remarkably glib and
      inaccurate comment, which both misstates the corpus of the
      medical literature and also fudges the vital issue of assent
      for non-therapeutic circumcision on a child.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      the same issue, the <i>BMA News Review</i> also published a
      ``debate'' between Dr. Janet Menage, and Dr. Nigel
      Zoltie.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup></font>
      Zoltie is credited only as being an accident and emergency
      consultant in Leeds, but in truth he is also a ritual Jewish
      circumciser, as well as a member of the Initiation Society
      (headed by Dr. Morris Sifman)---a crucial fact he revealed in
      a published letter to the editor of the <i>BMJ</i>.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup></font> This
      presents an obvious conflict of interest. Since Zoltie has a
      pre-existing bias in favour of circumcision, complicated by a
      presumed financial incentive in promoting circumcision, his
      "medical" opinion on circumcision is difficult to distinguish
      from a marketing campaign. In this light, Zoltie's arguments
      are illuminating and bear closer study if we are to
      understand how pre-existing biases can corrupt and distort
      not only the practice of medicine, but medical ethics as
      well. Zoltie writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Those who criticise the
          actual operation use emotive words like mutilation, and
          ascribe a wide variety of complications to the surgery.
          However, mutilation is in the eye of the beholder. What
          is mutilation to one observer may be beautiful to another
          pierced body parts, for example.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      glance at any standard dictionary, however, reveals that
      mutilation is independent of, and not defined by or solely
      by, notions of aesthetics.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2"><b>Mutilate</b>: 1. To

          href="#n82">82</a></sup></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      is an example of rhetorical obfuscation. Society is not
      seeking to stop cosmetic surgery <i>per se;</i> rather, as <a
      href="/library/legal/somerville/">Somerville</a> made clear,
      the considerations for such surgery on a child differ from
      those for adults:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">It is necessary for the
          law to recognize and accommodate three realities in the
          context of medical interventions. First, medical
          interventions are not regarded in practice as prima facie
          illegal. Second, some non therapeutic interventions are
          accepted by our society. Third, those unable to consent
          for themselves need increased protection. It is proposed
          that the most satisfactory approach to such an
          accommodation is to regard therapeutic interventions as
          prima facie legal and to retain the present criteria of
          prima facie illegality with respect to non-therapeutic
          medical procedures.(31) Then, at a second stage of the
          analysis of the legality of any particular medical
          intervention, therapeutic benefit and personal "informed"
          consent should be treated as necessary, but not always
          sufficient, alternative validating requirements within
          the limits set by public policy.</font></p>

          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Under such a scheme,
          the prima facie presumption of illegality of any
          non-therapeutic intervention on those incapable of
          consent could not be rebutted without statutory
          authorization of that procedure. In comparison, the
          personal "informed" consent of at least a competent adult
          would rebut this presumption where to do so was not
          contrary to public policy. In the therapeutic situation,
          the use of therapeutic benefit and consent as alternative
          validating criteria must be subject to the proviso that
          where the person is capable of consenting, his consent
          must be obtained if the intervention is not to constitute
          a criminal offence. That is, the prima facie presumption
          of the legality of therapeutic interventions would be
          rebutted in such circumstances by the absence of
          consent.<font size="2"><sup><a

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
      the infliction of such devastatingly destructive surgery on
      an unconsenting child, solely for (as Zoltie puts it)
      "cosmetic" reasons, imposes the parents' notions of
      aesthetics on the child. Tattooing, described by Lord
      Templeman as one of the lawful exceptions to the general
      rule, is regulated by statute.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup></font> The clear reason why
      tattooing is prohibited for a person under the age of 18 is,
      as Poulter puts it:</p>

          possibly resulting in serious injury... or leading to an

          designed to be permanent, they may later come to be
          resented by the child when he has grown up..... and if
          their original purpose later seems to him to be misguided

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoltie
      further remarks:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Another issue is that
          of parental consent. Parents often decide on difficult

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed;
      but the decision is a discharge of parental duties, regulated
      by the law. Zoltie continues:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">It is a matter of
          opinion, not fact, whether a procedure is better carried

          href="#n87">87</a></sup></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">This remark is scarcely capable of logical
      reading; but to the extent that it suggests complications for
      the adult that are non-existent when an infant is circumcised
      is medical nonsense. Further:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">...simply because the
          child may not have appreciated the benefits while still

      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      is difficult to understand how Zoltie can say this, when he
      has clearly said that the procedure is, as he puts it, to "be
      regarded as cosmetic surgery." What "benefits" is the infant
      supposed to have received, albeit he "may not have
      appreciated"?</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoltie
      then tellingly states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">The followers of two of
          the world's religions Jews and Muslims perform

          religious persecution to prevent a group fulfilling its

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
      note here the misrepresentation and (perhaps) wilful
      ignorance of the medical literature commonly found in the
      writings of advocates or apologists for mass circumcision,
      and a further misrepresentation of the provisions of
      international law as to the limits on the exercise of
      beliefs. As was tellingly put by Dr. Keith Wollard, the
      chairman of the Australian Medical Association's ethics
      committee, the debate about non-therapeutic circumcision
      "mustn't degenerate into some sort of criticism of Jewish and
      Muslim communities."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup></font> Wollard is correct, but
      Zoltie himself is here attempting to make legitimate
      criticism of circumcision appear to be criticism of the
      "Jewish and Muslim communities." Advocates of mass
      circumcision commonly use this tactic to stifle legitimate
      debate, silence proper criticism, and deflect attention from
      the evidence by the offensively inaccurate, thinly-veiled
      charge of anti-Semitism and religious persecution. It seems
      that the tactic is to smear any and every criticism of
      non-therapeutic circumcision as anti-Semitic so as to
      suppress by intimidation and/or to discredit those who report
      the facts of circumcision. As we have seen above, there seems
      to be an implicit fear among circumcisers that allowing
      parents the facts about circumcision runs the risk that
      parents will decide that the health and welfare of their son
      is more important than any alleged religious duty. The
      Queensland Law Reform Commission, however, observes:</p>

      <p><b>7. CONSENT ON BEHALF OF A CHILD</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central
      to the consideration of non-therapeutic circumcision are the
      issues of consent and the validity of the proxy assent given
      by a parent for the non-therapeutic circumcision of a child.
      Whatever sense, if any, might be extracted from Templeman's
      quoted <i>obiter dictum,</i> consent is, even on his terms, a
      central ingredient of the lawfulness of the violence
      inflicted. Therefore, the effectiveness and legal validity of
      that assent is vital. It is a legal truism that a child,
      especially one of tender years, is legally incapable of
      giving effective consent, and that consent (or more properly
      <i>assent</i>) can be given by parents in appropriate
      situations. The question then arises as to what those
      situations might be, and, in particular, whether those
      situations include circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons.
      It is important to be clear that, contrary to popular beliefs
      (particularly in the United States) parents do not possess
      rights over their children, but rather have duties towards
      them, which give them certain defined powers to discharge
      those duties. This concept has a long history springing from
      the notion that the Crown/State is the <i>parens patriae</i>
      and exercises a jurisdiction protective of children. In its
      modern guise, it might be summarised in the adage that in
      questions concerning the upbringing of a child that a child's
      best interests are paramount.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n99">99</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
      if a circumciser might escape criminal conviction as a result
      of a non-therapeutic circumcision, there still remains the
      much more probable chance of civil action by the child for
      the performance of a procedure that is agreed to have no
      clearly demonstrable medical justification. Whilst the heavy
      burden of proof in a criminal trial might result in the
      acquittal of a circumciser, the need only for the plaintiff
      in a civil trial to prove his case on a balance of
      probabilities puts the circumciser at risk.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      centrality of consent springs from the fundamental principle
      of respect for autonomy: every autonomous person has the
      right---the absolute right in law---to decide what may, or
      may not, be done to him. In the field of medicine, it is
      trite law that any treatment or investigation involving a
      touching, carried out without consent is a battery, which
      could result in an action for damages or even criminal
      proceedings. Time and time again, the courts have supported
      an individual's right to autonomy of his or her body. Thus, a
      competent adult has the absolute and unfettered right to
      refuse treatment even if that refusal will lead to a certain
      and hastened death. As was recently shown in a case in
      Britain, an adult may refuse treatment even if doctors
      sincerely believe that she is misguided and that her refusal
      will put the life of her unborn child in jeopardy. So well
      established is this principle that no useful purpose would be
      served by exploring this concept in any detail.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      lawfulness of the consent, however, depends on a number of
      factors: the competence of the consent giver; the freeness of
      the consent from duress and/or fraud; and the awareness of
      the nature of the risk and/or injury to be experienced by the
      patient, since a person cannot either in law or in logic be
      properly regarded as voluntarily assuming the risks of an
      assault if he is not in a position to be aware of the nature
      and extent of the risks. The phrase "the competence of the
      consent giver" relates not solely to whether the
      consent-giver is of legal age and mentally competent, but
      also to whether the consent is within his power to give.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
      there is an increasing acceptance of the desirability to
      involve children in the consent process involving their
      medical treatment, a child under the age of 16 is not,
      generally, in a position to give valid consent. It is
      necessary in most cases for the final decision---the formal
      act of consent---to be given by a competent parent or
      appropriate adult on behalf of the child. That ability to
      give permission for the infliction of medical treatment on a
      child is not a <i>right</i> as popularly believed; but rather
      the discharge by the parent of the duty to care for the
      child. As Lord Scarman has said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">The principle of the
          law...is that parental rights are derived from parental
          duty and exist only so long as they are needed for the
          protection of the person and property of the
          child....Giving consent to medical treatment of a child
          is a clear incident of parental responsibility arising
          from the duty to protect the child.<font size="2"><sup><a

      deepest of respect, admirable and worthy of wide
      dissemination and study.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">The responsibilities
          and powers of parents extend to the physical, mental,
          moral, educational and general welfare of the child....No
          doubt in most cases of medical treatment or surgery, no
          conflict will arise between the interests of the parents
          and those of the child. In other cases, the risk of
          conflict may be so slight or theoretical that it can be
          disregarded. but in some cases---and claims that an
          abortion or sterilisation is in the best interests of a
          child are likely to be among them---a conflict between
          the interests of the parents and the child may arise. In
          such a case, the application of established and
          fundamental principle will deny the right of the parents
          to consent to the operation or treatment. If an operation
          or treatment is to be performed or carried out in such a
          case, only a court of general jurisdiction exercising the
          <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction....can authorise the
          operation or treatment.<font size="2"><sup><a

      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">A parent has no
          authority to consent to the medical treatment of his or
          her child unless it is in the best interests of the
          child. This is because implicit in parental consent is
          understood to be the determination of what is best for
          the welfare of the child [citing Marion's case at p.
          315]. If a parent purports to consent to a treatment
          which is not in the best interests of the child, the
          consent is of no effect and any person acting on such
          consent would be guilty of assault if any physical
          interference is involved. Notably, what is in the best
          interests of a child is a matter to be determined
          objectively.<font size="2"><sup><a

          that what is in the parents' or family's best interests

          This does not always follow---in all cases the best
          interests of the young person must be considered and not
          merely assumed.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      QLRC made no claim for the legality at common law for male
      infant circumcision, despite the majority of Australian
      males' being circumcised by the 1960s (and a current rate of
      male circumcision of between 25% and 35%). Indeed they

          endangering life or health. A number of criminal offences

      <p><b>8. THE CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS CLAIMS</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      is beyond the confines of this paper to analyse the flaws in
      the popular, and populist, espousal of cultural relativism
      implicit in the reluctance to take a stand against
      culturally-motivated breaches of human rights; and of course,
      criticism of behaviours, such as circumcision, takes moral
      courage. Such criticism risks the offensively inaccurate and
      deliberately intimidating charge of racism, and specifically
      of "anti-Semitism"; it risks being accused of insensitivity
      to the culture of others, and of "Western imperialism."</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      answer to these charges, it is proper to point out that
      criticism of certain behaviours is not, and can never of
      itself be, <i>racist</i> in the correct sense of that word,
      since racism implies a hatred of the group <i>qua</i> group,
      and goes far beyond criticism of behaviour based on human
      rights founded on customary international law. Thus, few
      would argue that criticism of Chinese foot-binding was an
      expression of an ``anti-Chinese'' and racist stance.
      Similarly, few would argue that criticism of <i>Sati</i> (the
      forced immolation of widows) is an expression of an
      ``anti-Hindu'' stance. So too criticism of circumcision for
      the inevitable harm that it inflicts is not racism or
      anti-Semitism---though such a charge often has the effect
      desired by those who make it of stifling legitimate
      criticism.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those
      who would deny the universality of fundamental and protected
      human rights, and those who would argue that any and every
      criticism of a culture is <i>ipso facto</i> improper, need to
      address the inherent problems in their position.
      Authoritarian regimes are quick to use the excuse of
      ``culture'' when their tyranny is criticised. The United
      Nations World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995,
      denounced culture as a principal source of gender-based
      violence and exploitation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n114">114</a></sup></font> Roslyn Higgins has remarked
      that the non-universal, relativist view of human rights is
      state-centred and "rarely advanced by the oppressed, who are
      only too anxious to benefit from the perceived universal
      standards."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n115">115</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      reasons typically advanced are that non-therapeutic
      circumcision is justified because it satisfies some religious
      or cultural need or societal demand. That there is no medical
      justification for routine circumcision is clear from a review
      of the medical literature on the subject and from statements
      by medical associations in the common law countries over some
      30 years. These associations, being subject to individual
      biases of their members, however, also say that circumcision
      is performed for religious, cultural or societal reasons, and
      they make no objection to its performance on these grounds.
      Do these provide a satisfactory answer?</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      some Jews and Muslims claim some religious reason for
      circumcision, and if the Australia Aborigines, African
      tribes, and South Pacific islanders claim a centuries-old
      cultural tradition, the American circumcisers lack even that.
      Their bogus, medicalised excuses are grounded in a history of
      medical quackery, rigid middle-class conformism, sexual
      repression, and irrational, market-driven phobias regarding
      hygiene. These are the origins of such excuses as "It's
      cleaner," or "It's less trouble for the mother to look
      after," or the ``locker room claim,'' which in reality is an
      expression of the circumcised father's anxiety about being
      reminded of his own loss.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
      are also worrying undertones in the attitudes, common in the
      United States, and espoused by Schoen, but also to be seen
      elsewhere, that it is acceptable to circumcise infants in
      order to meet the mother's notions of aesthetics. In reality,
      these are no more than social conditioning and ignorance of
      the normal. There is also present the mother's wish to
      control her sons through the functioning of his genitals,
      and, from that, one might deduce an urge to control men as a
      whole as well.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n116">116</a></sup></font> It is usually the mother
      who takes the final decision to circumcise.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n117">117</a></sup></font> What lies
      behind the oft-expressed remark by pro-circumcision American
      women that they prefer a circumcised man because "he lasts
      longer", and that they will have their sons circumcised so as
      to give his future partners more pleasure? The questions
      posed by these stances seem to demand study; they certainly
      do not seem to be the healthy thoughts of a normal
      mother.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      cannot be denied, in the light of international instruments
      and domestic law, that the expression of culture and religion
      are legally protected and an important factor in a child's
      upbringing.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n118">118-119</a></sup></font> It is equally wrong to
      claim, as so often is done, that where this arises it is the
      deciding factor. Certainly, all other things being equal, it
      is likely to represent the factor that tips the decision in
      favour of a particular course of action.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
       href="/library/legal/dwyer2/">Dwyer</a> has written
      persuasively on the issue of alleged parental rights and
      children. He argues that it is the children who hold the
      rights rather than the current notion that it is parents who
      protect the child's rights, since this view provides no, or
      no adequate, sanctions against abusive parents.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n120">120</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually,
      however, it is argued by ritual circumcisers that it is
      sufficient to claim that one's religion or culture or
      societal norms demand circumcision and that such claims are
      conclusive. This error springs from a misreading of the
      provisions for the protection of religious expression in
      human rights documents. Thus, Article 9 <i><a
      href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm">European
      Convention on Human Rights</a></i> provides that everyone has
      the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion but
      this freedom is subject to limitations on its exercise where
      necessary for the protection of the rights and freedom of
      others.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      the protection of children, the same point is also made
      generally by the 1989 <i><a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">United Nations
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a></i> in Article
      14.3. In addition, Article 19.1 specifically provides that
      "States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative,
      administrative, social and educational measures to protect
      the child from all forms of physical or mental violence,
      injury, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or
      exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of
      parents, legal guardians or any other person who has the care
      of the child." Article 19.2 provides for effective programmes
      to prevent the abuses detailed in sub-paragraph 1, including
      education, reporting, referral, and "judicial involvement."
      It is unarguable that circumcision involves an injury to the
      child as well as the other forms of ills described by Article
      19.1. Thus, ritual circumcision is clearly not only a
      prohibited activity under the <i>Convention</i>, but also
      States Parties are under the obligation to take measures to
      provide protection. Ritual circumcisers, whilst happy to call
      attention to the protection of religion in international law,
      studiously ignore this vital provision designed to protect
      the most vulnerable, since it provides an unanswerable
      prohibition of their activities.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      basic point, here and elsewhere in international law, is that
      none of the freedoms granted by human rights legislation may
      be exercised so as to deprive another of, or to interfere
      with another's, equally protected freedoms.</p>

      <p><b>9. THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD IS PARAMOUNT</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      dealing with the difficult issues raised when a child's
      welfare and upbringing are involved, the English courts have
      made it clear, time and time again, that the sole question is
      the welfare of the child, and that the courts can and will
      come to a differing conclusion to that of the parents. The
      House of Lords in <i>Re B (a minor)</i> held that a court was
      concerned with only one primary and paramount consideration,
      the welfare of the child.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n121">121</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>In <i>Re E (an infant),</i> it was held that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">In wardship proceedings
          the paramount consideration was the welfare of the
          infant, and in considering this the element of religious
          upbringing was of great importance and the wishes of the
          mother of an illegitimate child must be very seriously
          regarded by the court, but the court was not bound to
          give effect to them if satisfied that the infant's
          welfare required otherwise.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Court of Appeal in <i>Re J (a minor) (wardship:medical
      treatment)</i> considered the future medical management of a
      severely brain-damaged premature baby with a considerably
      shortened life expectancy. Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR
      said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">[I]t is sensible to
          define the relationship between the court, the doctors,
          the child and its parents. The doctors owe the child a
          duty to care for it in accordance with good medical
          practice recognised as appropriate by a competent body of
          professional opinion (see Bolam v Friern Hospital
          Management Committee [1957] 2 All ER 118, [1957] 1 WLR
          582). This duty is, however, subject to the qualification
          that, if time permits, they must obtain the consent of
          the parents before undertaking serious invasive
          treatment. The parents owe the child a duty to give or to
          withhold consent in the best interests of the child and
          without regard to their own interests. The court when
          exercising the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction takes
          over the rights and duties of the parents, although this
          is not to say that the parents will be excluded from the
          decision-making process. Nevertheless in the end the
          responsibility for the decision whether to give or to
          withhold consent is that of the court alone.<font

          accept without reservation that the decision of a devoted
          and responsible parent should be treated with respect. It
          should certainly not be disregarded or lightly set aside.
          But the role of the court is to exercise an independent
          and objective judgment. If that judgment is in accord
          with that of the devoted and responsible parent, well and
          good. If it is not, then it is the duty of the court,
          after giving due weight to the view of the devoted and
          responsible parent, to give effect to its own judgment.
          That is what it is there for. Its judgment may of course
          be wrong. So may that of the parent. But once the
          jurisdiction of the court is invoked its clear duty is to
          reach and express the best judgment it can.<font

          of family law (in adoption, for example, where it is

          of the demands of the child patient's welfare, the
          starting point---and the finishing point too---must

      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      is suggested that where the court has been asked to rule on
      whether or not a child should be subjected to non-therapeutic
      circumcision, the general principles and the limits of the
      actions of parents are clear. Once the features inherent in
      non-therapeutic circumcision, as touched on in this paper,
      are before the court, it should not be difficult to see
      behind the usual assertions that it is not in the child's
      best interests to undergo this procedure. Particularly likely
      to be unconvincing is the common assertion that treats the
      child as merely a ``group-object'' rather than as an
      individual. Thus, it is not acceptable, and would not satisfy
      a court, to assert (usually with no real evidence) that
      ``boys'' of this class are damaged by non-performance on
      circumcision: it is necessary to consider each boy as an
      individual, to look at his needs and not to subsume them to
      the alleged needs of the group/society/tribe.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
      since it is clear that for Muslims there is no Koranic verse
      stating that a boy must be circumcised as an infant or even
      by any particular age, it would be entirely appropriate to
      defer circumcision until the boy can decide for himself as an
      adult (as with tattooing). Even for Jews, it is clear that
      the failure to circumcise does not deprive the boy of his
      Jewish identity (which rests solely on his having a Jewish
      mother) and that the ``sin,'' if such it be, in not
      circumcising is that of the father rather than the son.
      Whilst not circumcising the infant might distress the
      parents, that distress is not, and should never be allowed to
      become, a factor in determining the child's welfare. So
      again, it would be proper to allow the boy himself to chose
      whether or not to be circumcised when he is an adult.</p>

      <p><b>10. CONCLUSION</b></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
      would agree that discrimination is never acceptable, yet all
      genital mutilations are a form of discrimination as well as a
      deprivation of the child's legally protected human rights.
      Non-therapeutic circumcision of boys is therefore
      discrimination. To inflict the inevitably damaging genital
      mutilation of boys, whilst enacting legislation to declare as
      criminal the similar procedure when done to girls, is an
      additional form of discrimination. To allow ritual or
      cultural circumcision for boys further discriminates between
      those boys who, because of an accident of birth, are at risk
      of non-therapeutic circumcision and those more fortunate boys
      who are not.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
      to circumcise a child on the basis of the shabby tactics, the
      distortions, the emotional blackmail, and the irrationalities
      of circumcisers is merely to increase the insult. To allow
      the psychosexual pathology or the impulse to sacrifice
      another for one's own alleged needs to hold sway is not only
      a breach of the common law and international norms, but also
      a profound rejection of notions of human decency and
      humanity.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
      the attempts by advocates of ritual Jewish or Muslim
      circumcision to claim the religious high ground as the
      justification for the imposition of the ritual sacrifice of a
      child's bodily and functional integrity is unacceptable.
      Since the legal and ethical principles are clear, and since
      the medical evidence of the effects of genital circumcision
      are clear, it is unacceptable to deny any child every effort
      to protect him from circumcision simply because he happens to
      be born of a gender, or in a country, or to parents where
      such practices take place.</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
      April 18, 1791, William Wilberforce addressed the House of
      Commons. On that date, Wilberforce argued for the abolition
      of slavery, but his words, forgiving their typically
      nineteenth-century Christian religious imagery, are equally
      suited to the abolition of circumcision.</p>

      or misinformed parents. Although British doctors have been
      guilty of participating in the circumcision mania that has

      Britain should now fearlessly and vigorously lead the way in
      the abolition of circumcision---as it did with the abolition
      of slavery---and in the establishment of legal protections of
      the bodily and functional integrity of every child, male and

      circumcisions performed on the NHS each year. On BBC2's
      Newsnight on 29 April 1996 it was suggested that an
      additional 30,000 ritual circumcisions were performed
      annually outside the NHS. The combined estimated number of
      circumcisions performed annually in Britain, then, would be
      60,000.</font></p>

      received, in September 1995, an email from a member of the
      Acorn Society in Britain, a semi-underground,
      sado-masochistic, homosexual fetishistic circumcision ring
      that actively recruits teenage boys for its "rituals." The
      writer had read a cover article in their magazine which,
      without my knowledge or permission, "published" a post that I
      had sent to an Internet Newsgroup. My post contained a
      transcription of the manufacturers' instructions on the use
      of the Plastibell circumcision device. The writer of the
      email had found my post highly erotic and enquired (in vain)
      whether I would provided him with more such material so that
      he could masturbate over it. Further examples of this
      psychopathology have been collected and presented on the

      IV tried to hellenise the Jews and banned circumcision, as
      related in I Maccabees 1:14-15. This ban lasted at least
      until 141 BCE. Under the Romans, when Emperor Hadrian banned
      circumcision in 132 AD. This ban lasted until 140 AD, when
      Emperor Antoninus Pius issued a rescript to the ban and
      allowed only the Jews to circumcise their children.
      Circumcision for all other peoples in the Empire remained a
      capital crime. Following the example set by Roman law,
      Byzantine emperors and later the Church throughout the middle
      ages passed successive laws banning Jews from circumcising
      their non-Jewish slaves and servants. Finally, it must be
      mentioned that circumcision was banned as immoral in the
      Soviet Union. See: Linder A, ed. <i>The Jews in Roman

      neonatal male circumcision as a means of controlling men,
      see: Rothblatt M. <i>Unzipped Genes: Taking Charge of
      Baby-Making in the New Millennium</i>. Philadelphia: Temple
      University Press. 1997. Ms. Rothblatt argues for the
      institution of "Inocuseeding." By it she means the universal
      vasectomizing of all teenage males, just after they have
      surrendered a couple samples of sperm for cryo-preservation.
      (With time and progress, this procedure may be able to be
      effected just after birth, with circumcision, vasectomy and
      the banking of future sperm cells all done together.)
      Inocuseeding will guarantee, she argues, that children are
      not made by accident, and besides its good effects on child
      design it will bring vast benefit to the women of the world,
      who now are so vulnerable to unintended pregnancy and the
      costs and illnesses that can come with it. See: Proulx LG.
