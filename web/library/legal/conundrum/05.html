<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing discussion of
medical consent in general and in the special case of parental
permission for procedures on children yields a framework for
analyzing circumcision. For simplicity, the analysis below is
limited to the standard case of neonatal circumcision on newborn
boys with normal genitalia. In 1999, history was made when a United
Kingdom family court addressed on the merits a proposed
circumcision of a five-year-old boy for religious reasons and
unambiguously concluded that an order for circumcision would not be
granted as circumcision did not satisfy the &ldquo;paramountcy of
welfare&rdquo; standard, i.e., it was not in the best interests of
the child.<sup><a href="#n134">134</a></sup> Due in part to the
pervasive presence of neonatal circumcision in American society, no
case addressing the validity of parental permission for a routine
circumcision has ever been decided in a United States court.
Instead, courts have repeatedly demonstrated their determination to
avoid any confrontation with the legal issues raised by neonatal
circumcision. In 1987, a lawsuit challenging the legal validity of
parental permission for neonatal circumcision was denied by a
California trial court and subsequently affirmed by the state
appeals court.<sup><a href="#n135">135</a></sup> The California
Supreme Court denied the petition for review.<sup><a
href="#n136">136</a></sup> More recently, the Eighth Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed a trial court&rsquo;s invocation of lack of
standing as a justification for refusing to consider a
mother&rsquo;s claim on behalf of her son who was circumcised with
his father&rsquo;s consent, but without her consent.<sup><a
href="#n137">137</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, an ongoing
contest in New Jersey is attracting national attention which - like
<i>Re J</i> - involves two divorcing parents with opposite desires
regarding circumcision of their male child, three-year old Matthew
Price. The Price case, in which unlike the British case neither
parent claims any religious motives for their desires regarding the
circumcision of their son, may in the end become the first recorded
case directly addressing the viability of parental consent to
circumcision. Already, the New Jersey Supreme Court has ordered the
trial court to hold a rehearing in the matter, and has appointed an
experienced children&rsquo;s rights attorney as guardian ad
litem.<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite well-settled
precedent supporting the viability of such a claim, which though
technically moot is &ldquo;capable of repetition, yet evading
review,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n139">139</a></sup> the court ruled,
based on the fact that the plaintiff had already had a circumcision
performed, that no remedy existed for the plaintiff and the court
could not protect him from being circumcised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no
possibility of obtaining consent from the patient, the issues then
become whether parents can give effective permission for the
procedure, and what legal and ethical obligations doctors may have
in this situation. Doctors do have a strict obligation to ensure
that parents receive all material information relating to the risks
and benefits of circumcision in a manner that they can comprehend,
that any parent giving permission is fully competent to evaluate
the information provided and that the treatment&rsquo;s potential
consequences, and that parents are not in any way unduly influenced
by the manner or timing of the disclosure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements for
surrogates are in some respects more stringent than those affecting
a patient&rsquo;s own consent. While in certain circumstances,
patients may themselves be able to provide legally valid consent to
prophylactic removal of their own healthy tissue, parents can never
grant permission for prophylactic removal of healthy tissue from
their children. The benefits of the proposed procedure must clearly
outweigh short - and long term disadvantages, and spiritual costs
and benefits may not be incorporated into this analysis. The
decision must be made solely for the patient&rsquo;s own benefit;
even potentially life-saving assistance for a close family member
cannot justify violating a non-consenting patient&rsquo;s right to
be free of intrusive medical procedures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents should thus be able
to give effective permission for circumcision, and doctors should
be permitted to perform a circumcision, only if the benefits
clearly outweigh any attendant costs. As we shall see, the evidence
does not support routine circumcision.</p>

<p><a id="IVA" name="IVA" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>A. Does routine circumcision provide urgently needed medical
benefits?</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision does not
correct an existing injury, disease or harmful malfunction. Thus,
even <i>if</i> circumcision provides <i>some</i> medical benefit,
there is no urgency to perform the procedure. General ethical and
legal principles concerning surgery on children therefore dictate
that the decision whether a male will be circumcised <i>must</i> be
suspended until the male is capable of making the decision himself.
This is even clearer if claimed medical benefits would not be
realized until adulthood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most, some contend that
circumcision is a prophylactic measure, to prevent urinary tract
infection (UTI) in boys, penile cancer and sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) in adult males.<sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup>
Thus, the only claimed benefit that males would realize before
adulthood is a reduced rate of UTI. It cannot plausibly be
maintained that this is an <i>urgently</i> needed medical benefit.
Moreover, even if urgency were not required, and even if the
claimed prophylactic benefit were significant, that benefit would
at a minimum, have to clearly outweigh any harm that circumcision
might cause in order to overcome the general, well-established
presumption against incursion on a non-consenting person&rsquo;s
physical integrity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as explained
below, the claims that circumcision has prophylactic value have
been essentially refuted. These claims are the latest in a long
history of claimed benefits from circumcision that have proven to
be illusory. In 1896, for example, the medical profession contended
that circumcision helps avoid &ldquo;phimosis, paraphimosis,
redundancy (where the prepuce more than covers the glans),
adhesions, papillomate, eczema (acute and chronic), oedema,
chancre, chancroid, cicatrices, inflammatory thickening,
elephantiasis, naevus, epithelioma, gangrene, tuberculosis,
preputial calculi, hip-joint disease, hernia, &hellip;[o]nanism,
seminal emissions, enuresis, dysuria, retention, general
nervousness, impotence, convulsions,
hystero-epilepsy.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n141">141</a></sup> All of
these claims were ultimately shown to lack scientific foundation.
More recent justifications likewise have been shown to lack
scientific merit.<sup><a href="#n142">142</a></sup> The evidence
regarding the current claims is evaluated below.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1.
Phimosis, balanitis, and hygiene concerns do not justify routine
circumcision</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although commonly given as
justifications for neonatal circumcision,<sup><a
href="#n143">143</a></sup> there is no scientific evidence to support
these claims. The incidence of phimosis following circumcision
(0.3% to 1.0%)<sup><a href="#n144">144</a></sup> is approximately
the same as far males never circumcised (0.6% to 0.9%).<sup><a
href="#n145">145</a></sup> In comparative studies the incidence of
phimosis and balanitis was not significantly different between
those circumcised and those not circumcised.<sup><a
href="#n146">146</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it has likewise been
asserted that a circumcised penis is more hygienic, no studies in
the medical literature exist to support such a claim. To the
contrary, circumcised boys under the age of three years have been
found to have more problems associated with poor hygiene than
intact boys.<sup><a href="#n147">147</a></sup></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2.
Urinary tract infections do not justify routine
circumcision</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the claimed benefits of
circumcision, only one - reduction of UTI - would occur during
childhood, before a male is able to decide for himself whether to
undergo the procedure. Some studies have suggested a weak
association between having a foreskin and developing a UTI<sup><a
href="#n148">148</a></sup> a large proportion of UTIs are the
result of anatomical defects of the urinary tract and
kidney.<sup><a href="#n149">149</a></sup>. The connection however,
is extremely tenuous; one study calculates that roughly 195 boys
would require circumcision to prevent one UTI occurrence.<sup><a
href="#n150">150</a></sup> Even a study by a leading circumcision
advocate estimated that circumcision prevents UTI is less than one
percent of boys who undergo the procedure.<sup><a
href="#n151">151</a></sup> Unfortunately, no one has yet made a
viable attempt at producing data demonstrably free of influence
from the numerous potential confounding variables. Until a study
takes into account the influence of rooming in,<sup><a
href="#n152">152</a></sup> breast feeding,<sup><a
href="#n153">153</a></sup> level of parental education,<sup><a
href="#n154">154</a></sup> prenatal maternal UTI,<sup><a
href="#n155">155</a></sup> premature birth,<sup><a
href="#n156">156</a></sup> history of UTI in a first degree
relative,<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup> hygienic
practices,<sup><a href="#n158">158</a></sup>previous bacterial or
viral infection,<sup><a href="#n159">159</a></sup> previous course
of antibiotics,<sup><a href="#n160">160</a></sup>race,<sup><a
href="#n161">161</a></sup> urine collection method<sup><a
href="#n162">162</a></sup> and diagnostic criteria,<sup><a
href="#n163">163</a></sup> so definitive conclusions are possible
regarding the protective effects of neonatal circumcision. This
list of other possible variables suggests that even if circumcision
did have an effect on UTI, a comparable or greater prophylactic
effect could be accomplished by less drastic and less intrusive
means - for example, by simply teaching parents and children proper
hygiene and by encouraging mothers to breastfeed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, most UTIs are
minor are are easily treated with oral antibiotics. The foreskin
has been linked to the more serious infections that reach the
kidneys.<sup><a href="#n164">164</a></sup> The most common
infection-related claim by defenders of circumcision is that males
not circumcised will develop renal failure.<sup><a
href="#n165">165</a></sup> However, that claim is
unsupportable.<sup><a href="#n166">166</a></sup> There is no
reliable data on the rate of renal failure on children in the
United States.<sup><a href="#n167">167</a></sup> Two Swedish
studies have yielded more reliable information.<sup><a
href="#n168">168</a></sup> The first study showed that UTI was not
responsible for any of the renal failures among children in
Sweden.<sup><a href="#n169">169</a></sup> The second study showed
that UTI was responsible for only five percent of renal failures
among children.<sup><a href="#n170">170</a></sup> Using the highest
recorded Swedish national rate of renal failure in children and
assuming all cases of renal failure from boys could be prevented by
neonatal circumcision, it would take 476,190 circumcisions to
prevent one renal failure. Those 476,190 would, as a statistical
matter, cause at least 952 life-threatening complications.<sup><a
href="#n171">171</a></sup> Circumcising to prevent renal failure is
thus clearly irrational.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if circumcision
does reduce UTI, it is a woefully ineffective method, especially
when weighed against the very significant complications and other
disadvantages which are discussed below in further detail. Contrary
to the retrospective data gathered elsewhere, a prospective study
of 603 Japanese boys, none of whom were circumcised, found that
none had ever had a UTI.<sup><a href="#n172">172</a></sup> This
result casts much doubt upon the American studies from which one
would have predicted that between six and twenty-four of these boys
(1-4%) would have a UTI. The Japanese study suggests that either
Japanese hygiene is vastly superior or that the American studies
are flawed.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3.
Penile cancer does not justify circumcision</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurate data on the rates
of penile cancer in circumcised and intact men in the United States
is not available. There have been no epidemiologic studies of the
rate of penile cancer in circumcised males, nor has there been any
studies that distinguished on the basis of circumcision status.
Claims that routine circumcision has lowered penile cancer rates
are therefore difficult to support. Countries such as Japan,<sup><a
href="#n173">173</a></sup> Norway,<sup><a
href="#n174">174</a></sup> Finland<sup><a
href="#n175">175</a></sup> and Denmark,<sup><a
href="#n176">176</a></sup> in which circumcision is rare, have
penile cancer rates that are lower than the estimated rates in the
United States.<sup><a href="#n177">177</a></sup> In any event, the
rate of penile cancer in all western countries is extremely low;
among all males in Japan, Finland, Norway, and Denmark, countries
that employ national cancer registries, for example, the rate of
cancer ranges form 0.5 to 0.8 per 100,000. In the United States,
where the cancer incidences are based on estimates, the incidence
of penile cancer is approximately 0.8 per 100,000. and accounts for
only 0.16% of all cancers in American males.<sup><a
href="#n178">178</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comparison, the
combined rate of ovarian and breast cancer in women is 264 times
higher than the rate of penile cancer in men, and breast cancer is
much more common in men than penile cancer.<sup><a
href="#n179">179</a></sup> As noted above, clear incontrovertible
evidence demonstrates that prophylactic removal of breast and/or
ovarian tissue would reduce the likelihood of developing cancer
enough to add months to the life expectancy of women with genetic
markers for breast cancer.<sup><a href="#n180">180</a></sup> Yet as
also noted above, the substantial potential benefit of an
oophorectomy and/or mastectomy is universally regarded as
inadequate to justify such prophylactic surgery, except in a woman
at high-risk for ovarian or breast cancer.<sup><a
href="#n181">181</a></sup> It would be unthinkable to perform the
surgery on a young girl. If a female were ever to undergo such
prophylactic surgery it could not occur until after she both
reached adulthood and gave informed consent for the procedure. Even
if it were correct that circumcision reduces the risk of penile
cancer to a statistically significant degree, it would still be
clearly unjustified to use circumcision as a prophylactic. Even if
the highest estimates of reduced risk were accurate, it would take
over 260,000 circumcisions to prevent a single case of penile
cancer. It follows that in 260,000 circumcisions one would expect
520 life-threatening complications.<sup><a
href="#n182">182</a></sup> Routinely amputating healthy tissue in
quest of such remote and speculative benefits is irrational and
violates both medical ethics and human rights.<sup><a
href="#n183">183</a></sup></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>4.
Sexually transmitted disease prevention does not justify routine
circumcision</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of circumcision in
preventing STDs is even less clear. For each sexually transmitted
infection, including HIV, there are contradictory medical
studies.<sup><a href="#n184">184</a></sup> Because the epidemiology
of STDs involves a mixture of biological, sociological and
psychological factors, it is impossible to isolate the foreskin as
a factor in the spread of STDs. The available medical literature
suggests certain trends, but nothing definitive. Circumcised men
actually appear more likely to contract urethritis (such as
gonorrhea or chlamydia) or viral infections (such as herpes simplex
or human papillomavirus). Intact men, on the other hand, appear
slightly more prone to genital ulcers (such as chancroid).<sup><a
href="#n185">185</a></sup> The role of circumcision in the
transmission of HIV is far from decided.<sup><a
href="#n186">186</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although several African
studies have suggested that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV
infection, several others have failed to document any significant
influence.<sup><a href="#n187">187</a></sup> A few population
studies have found circumcision to increase the risk of HIV
infection.<sup><a href="#n188">188</a></sup> Meta-analysis of the
published studies has revealed a significant degree of between
study heterogeneity. The one trend noted is that a foreskin may
place an African man who engages in high-risk sexual behaviors at
increased risk for HIV infection.<sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup>
For the general population, circumcision does not appear to have an
impact.<sup><a href="#n190">190</a></sup> Even proponents of
circumcision acknowledge that the African experience with HIV does
not apply in first world countries.<sup><a
href="#n191">191</a></sup> The most effective timing of
circumcision is also under dispute. One African study documented
that males circumcised before fifteen years of age were at
increased risk of contracting HIV,<sup><a
href="#n192">192</a></sup> while those circumcised after twelve
years of age were at a lower risk.<sup><a
href="#n193">193</a></sup> Because genital discharge is more
prevalent than genital ulcers, the one consistent trend, from
several recent population surveys, is that circumcised men are at
greater risk for contracting a STD.<sup><a
href="#n194">194</a></sup> It is therefore inappropriate to cite
avoidance of STDs as a justification for circumcision.</p>

<p><a id="IVB" name="IVB" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>B. Harm caused by male circumcision</i></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1.
Complications</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cost side,
retrospective studies show that rates of immediate complications
associated with neonatal circumcision are somewhere between
2.0%<sup><a href="#n195">195</a></sup> and 6.8%.<sup><a
href="#n196">196</a></sup> One prospective study, looking at only
for evidence of hemorrhage, found the rate of hemorrhage was
9.9%<sup><a href="#n197">197</a></sup> These estimates all exceed
the 1.0% to 1.7% rate for complications for circumcisions performed
after the first month of life.<sup><a href="#n198">198</a></sup>

death and frequently necessitating a transfustion;<sup><a

href="#n229">229</a></sup></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2.
Pain</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional and generally
under appreciated cost is trauma to the newborn. Research has
determined that newborns experience more pain from a give noxious
stimuli than do older children and adults.<sup><a
href="#n230">230</a></sup> The procedure is <i>extremely</i>
painful.<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup> During circumcision,
forceps or other probes are inserted into the delicate foreskin,
where they are used to scrape, tear apart, and destroy the normal
erogenous tissues. The baby&rsquo;s sensitive foreskin is crushed,
and the raw flesh is cut with scissors. Circumcision is usually
followed by al alternation in sleep pattern marked by prolonged
rapid eye movement sleep.<sup><a href="#n232">232</a></sup> The
procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his
environment thus interfering with his process of bonding with his
mother and nursing.<sup><a href="#n233">233</a></sup> General
anesthesia is considered too risky for use in the neonatal period,
so most neonatal circumcisions are performed without
anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n234">234</a></sup> Topical and local
anesthetics, which blunt some of the pain do not adequately protect
the infants. Experimental evidence indicates that newborns
experience marked pain during circumcision, even when these agents
are employed.<sup><a href="#n235">235</a></sup> In, 1997,
researchers altered the number of subjects enrolled in an infant
circumcision pain study because they concluded that inflicting pain
on unanesthetized control patients was unethical.<sup><a
href="#n236">236</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision causes trauma
to infants who are born with relatively few pain coping
mechanisms.<sup><a href="#n237">237</a></sup> Pain causes
irreversible changes in the infant&rsquo;s developing brain,
heightening his pain perception.<sup><a href="#n238">238</a></sup>
These facts strongly support at least delaying circumcision until a
male is older, when more can be done to avoid pain because the pain
is more developed, thereby reducing the likelihood of permanent
damage from the trauma. A prominent pediatric urologist has opined
that postponing circumcision until after toilet training may also
decrease the high rate of meatal stenosis in circumcised
boys.<sup><a href="#n239">239</a></sup></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3.
Loss of Function</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent study found that
in circumcision approximately 50% of the penile skin sheath is
removed, along with specialized nerves endings that are fundamental
to normal sexual response.<sup><a href="#n240">240</a></sup> The
sheath provides a natural lubricant and facilitates vaginal
penetration during sexual intercourse.<sup><a
href="#n241">241</a></sup> As a portion of the male reproductive
apparatus, the foreskin clearly is not trivial.<sup><a
href="#n242">242</a></sup></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>4.
Loss of immunological Protection and Physical Protection</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human foreskin serves to
protect the glans, an internal structure, from injury. The prepuce
also serves valuable immunological functions by providing several
defenses against infection.<sup><a href="#n243">243</a></sup> The
infant&rsquo;s prepuce has a pronounced tight tip with a sphincter,
formed from the whorl of muscle tissue that stays closed to keep
out foreign matter but opens to permit the outflow of urine.<sup><a
href="#n243">243</a></sup> The sub-preputial wetness contains
several secretions that act to destroy harmful
microorganisms.<sup><a href="#n245">245</a></sup> The prepuce contains
Langerhans cells, which provide the first line of mucosal
immunity.<sup><a href="#n246">246</a></sup> Our understanding of
mucosal immunity is still in its infancy.<sup><a
href="#n247">247</a></sup></p>

<a id="IVC" name="IVC" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>C.
Medical Considerations Strongly Disfavor Routine
Circumcision</i><br />
<br />
 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate decision-making
regarding the permissibility of infant circumcision requires
balancing a neglible reduction of overall UTI and penile cancer
rates against the significant disadvantages of the procedure - loss
of functional and highly erogenous tissue, loss of immunological
properties of the foreskin, risks of complications and the
excruciating pain the newborn experiences. This balancing surely
would yield the conclusion that the procedure is medically
contra-indicated and not in the best interest of the infant
patient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous medical bodies
around the world have recognized that routine infant circumcision
is not medically justifiable. For example, in 1996, the Australian
Association of Pediatric Surgeons announced that it does not
support routine infant circumcision, because it is
&ldquo;inappropriate and unnecessary.&rdquo;<sup><a
href="#n248">248</a></sup> In 1997, the Australian Medical
Association stated that neonatal circumcision should be discouraged
by the medical profession.<sup><a href="#n249">249</a></sup> In
1991, the Australian College of Pediatrics likewise discouraged the
practice of neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
href="#n250">250</a></sup> The National Health and Research Council
of Australia has stated that neonatal circumcision has &ldquo;no
medical indication&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the hazards of the
operation outweigh&hellip;any possible advantages.&rdquo;<sup><a
href="#n251">251</a></sup> The British Medical Association has
recommended that male circumcision be done only when medically
necessary, stating that complications, including death, may result
from this generally unnecessary surgery.<sup><a
href="#n252">252</a></sup> In 1996, the Canadian Pediatric Society
recommended that &ldquo;[c]ircumcision of newborns should not be
routinely performed.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n253">253</a></sup>
Significantly, even though circumcision is the most frequently
performed operation on children in the United States, a recent
review article in an American journal discussing optimal times for
performing various urological procedures on children did not
mention circumcision.<sup><a href="#n254">254</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AAP has issued a series
of statements regarding circumcision. Remarkably, even though the
procedure is widespread in the United States and performed by many
of the organization&rsquo;s members, the AAP has never endorsed
routine infant circumcision. In 1975, the AAP Task Force on
Circumcision issued its first policy statement on circumcision,
concluding that &ldquo;[t]here is not absolute medical indication
for routine circumcision of the newborn.&rdquo;<sup><a
href="#n255">255</a></sup> In 1999, the AAP admitted that
scientific evidence does not support routine neonatal
circumcision.<sup><a href="#n256">256</a></sup> Apparently
unprepared, however, to accept the necessary conclusion that this
prevalence practice should stop, the AAP merely stressed the
importance of giving parents of male infants accurate and unbiased
information and the opportunity to discuss the decision with a
doctor.<sup><a href="#n257">257</a></sup> In 1991, the American
Academy of Family Physicians took no position other than to state
that it was a parental decision.<sup><a href="#n258">258</a></sup>
Numerous medical bodies have stated their opposition to neonatal
circumcision, or have at least acknowledged that the practice is
not medically sound.<sup><a href="#n259">259</a></sup> Not a single
national or international medical organization in the world
recommends the procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="IVD"
name="IVD" /><i>D. Can parental permission for circumcision be
effective?</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the foregoing, one
might wonder how parental permission for routine circumcision could
ever be effective, even if physicians comply with the requirements
of informed permission. Like all surgical procedures, circumcision
should not be subject to authorization by a surrogate for an
incompetent person urless it is medically necessary. While there is
some dispute in the American medical community today as whether
routine circumcision provides any medical benefit, absolutely no
one in the medical community seriously maintains that it is
medically necessary or that it corrects an existing injury,
disease, or malfunction.<sup><a href="#n260">260</a></sup>
Accordingly, the <i>Queensland Law Reform Commission</i> in
Australia recently stated that &ldquo;consent by parents to
[neonatal circumcision] being performed may be invalid in the light
of the common law&rsquo;s restrictions on the ability of parents to
consent to the non-therapeutic circumcision of
children.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n261">261</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both a best interests and a
substituted judgment approach support this conclusion. Recent
cost-utility analyses for neonatal circumcision that take as a
given the supposed benefits with respect to only UTIs, but also
cancer and STDs&rsquo; have concluded that over the course of a
lifetime, circumcision on the whole either impairs health<sup><a
href="#n262">262</a></sup> or has virtually no medical benefit.<sup><a
href="#n263">263</a></sup> The evidence presented by weighing the
costs and benefits suggests that circumcision is, in terms of the
physical well-being of a boy, not in his best interests and not
something to which a rational and fully informed person would be
expected to consent. The inference of what the infant male would
choose for himself, if able, receives further support from the
actual choice of intact adult males. If the ultimate goal of
medical decision-making for an incompetent person is to determine
what the person would decide for himself, if able, the best
evidence may be what similarly situated competent persons actually
decide for themselves. Of males circumcised in the United States,
only 3 in 1,000 choose to have this surgery performed later in
life, suggesting that the overwhelming majority believe that the
risks and sequelae of becoming circumcised outweigh any supposed
benefits.<sup><a href="#n264">264</a></sup> If doctors followed the
AAP Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to delay the decision until
the child is old enough to grant consent,<sup><a
href="#n265">265</a></sup> circumcisions would rarely be performed in
this country, as is the case in most other nations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One author has noted that
parents may authorize overtreatment of a child, even though it
provides no medical benefits to the child and may actually cause
him harm, because it makes the parents feel better that they are
purchasing some &ldquo;care&rdquo; for their child. The author
opines that this is a form of child abuse-causing harm to a child
in order to gratify parents-and, perhaps stating the obvious,
contends that &ldquo;the infant&rsquo;s interests should absolutely
supercede those of his or her parents.&rdquo;<sup><a
href="#n266">266</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>E. Non-medical reasons
including social concerns and religion cannot justify parental
permission for circumcision</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents choose
circumcision for their sons not because they mistakenly believe it
is medically beneficial, but rather for non-medical reasons. Most
common is a concern that their son may have social difficulties if
his genitals do not look exactly like those of his father and those
of the majority of his peers.<sup><a href="#n267">267</a></sup>
This claimed social benefit for the child is both unsupported and
insufficient to justify a non-consensual surgical intervention. It
is unsupported because there is no evidence that intact boys
undergo any greater social difficulties as a result of the
difference between their genitals and those of their fathers or
peers. If there were any such risk, any competent person could
easily deal with this by explaining to their son that his genitals
are natural and those of his father and some of his peers were
surgically altered when they were babies. These &ldquo;social
concerns&rdquo; are not sufficient enough to violate the physical
integrity of a non-consenting person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small percentage of North
American parents choose circumcision for religious reasons, and our
society is uncomfortable in criticizing or countermanding parents
who act for their children on the basis of deeply held convictions.
As discussed supra in Part I.D., it is a mistake, however, for
physicians to believe that parents have a right to make their
religious beliefs controlling on the question of whether a child is
to undergo a non-medically indicated surgical procedure. No court
has ever held that parents have a first amendment right to have
unnecessary medical procedures performed on their children. To give
that power gratuitously to certain parents because they have
particular religious beliefs would be to violate one of their
children&rsquo;s constitutional and moral rights-the right to equal
protection. If the state and the medical profession protect some
children against medically inappropriate practices, they must
protect all children against all medically inappropriate practices
unless they can demonstrate that denying that protection to some
children would be better <i>for those children</i> (who themselves
have no religious beliefs).<sup><a href="#n268">268</a></sup> As
the Supreme Court has stated, parents are free to make martyrs of
themselves, but they are not free to make martyrs of their
children.<sup><a href="#n269">269</a></sup> In other words, parents
are not free to force their children to undergo unnecessary and
harmful surgery, however well intentioned they might be. A United
Kingdom family court has recently endorsed the principle that at
least where two parents of two different religions disagreed on
whether to circumcise, and where a local authority exercising
parental responsibility under a care order, a circumcision could
not be ordered. The court noted that mainstream medical opinion in
the United Kingdom requires both paternal and material consent to a
circumcision.<sup><a href="#n270">270</a></sup></p>

<i>F. Informed Consent</i> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, even of
non-medically indicated surgery is such as circumcision were
legally and ethically permissible to perform on children, parental
authorization for such surgery would still have to comport with the
requirements of informed consent. As previously discussed, there
are three basic requirements to informed consent: 1) disclosure of
all relevant and material information; 2) verifying and fostering
the capacity of the decision-maker; and 3) ensuring that the
decision is voluntary.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1.
Disclosure</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians are always under
a legal and ethical duty to fully disclose to the decision-maker
all available information regarding a proposed procedure. Because
the duty requires all <i>available</i> information and not just the
information a given physician happens to have acquired to be
disclosed, physicians are under a duty to acquire all available
information to as surgery that they perform. Physicians who perform
circumcisions, therefore, have a legal and ethical duty to their
infant patients to obtain and provide to the patients&rsquo;
parents all available medical information regarding circumcision.
This includes all pertinent available information about the nature
of the foreskin, the pain that infants incur when it is removed,
the risk of complications from the surgery, and any possible
medical benefits and costs that may result from having it removed.
A medical practitioner who fails to completely disclose the
potential physical costs (and, presumably, other disadvantages is
negligent.<sup><a href="#n271">271</a></sup></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a.
Nature and purpose of the foreskin</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent articles in leading
medical journals have documented the foreskin&rsquo;s complex
structure.<sup><a href="#n272">272</a></sup> Although the foreskin
has been described as &ldquo;the fold of skin covering the
glans,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n273">273</a></sup> it is actually a
complex, junctional tissue similar to the eyelids or the lips. It
is designed to protect the glans of the penis, an internal
structure, from trauma and infection.<sup><a
href="#n274">274</a></sup> It also contains the highest
concentration of fine-touch neuroreceptors in the penis. Only lips
and fingertips have comparable neuroreceptors densities. By
contrast, the glans is a neurologically dumb organ.<sup><a
href="#n275">275</a></sup> Due to the foreskin&rsquo;s rich
abundance in neuroreceptors and its exquisite specialization as a
producer of sexual pleasure, it may, in fact, be the most sensitive
part of the infant male&rsquo;s body.<sup><a
href="#n276">276</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents also need to be
aware that the anatomically complete penis' involuting structure
allows for erection without tightening of the skin over the penile
shaft. During coitus the complete skin system of the penis,
including the foreskin, allows for non-traumatic intromission and
penile movement within the vaginal vault without chafing.<sup><a
href="#n277">277</a></sup> Physicians owe a duty to male patients
to inform their parents of the functionality and sensitivity that
their sons will lose for a lifetime if a circumcision is carried
out.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b.
Pain</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians have an
obligation to be forthright with parents about the pain that
infants endure when their foreskin is removed surgically. Evidence
suggests that physicians rarely do so, and that this omission is
clearly unethical. Mary physicians may neglect to discuss the pain
with parents because they fear it will be disturbing for the
parents. But it <i>should be</i> disturbing and physicians owe a
duty to the infant patient to make his parents aware of this
disquieting aspect of circumcision. Physicians have a further
obligation to make parents aware that adequate and safe anesthesia
is not available during the neonatal period. They owe no duty to
parents to make them feel better about granting permission for an
unnecessary surgery.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>c.
Risk of Complications</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because healthy, richly
innervated, erogenous tissue is removed with every circumcision,
the complication rate of circumcision-if &ldquo;complication&rdquo;
means harmful effect is 100% because it denies the patient the use
and function of this specialized tissue. As mentioned above, the
risk of additional immediate complication is between 2% and
10%.<sup><a href="#n278">278</a></sup> The danger of a later
complication, such as meatal stenosis, represents an additional 5%
to 10% likelihood of a harmful complication.<sup><a
href="#n279">279</a></sup> Many of the potential immediate and
later complications can be quite severe. Physicians are clearly
obligated to make parents aware of these complication rates and the
nature of the harms that might befall their son.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d.
No Significant Medical Benefits</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No significant medical
benefit clearly has been demonstrated to result from routine
neonatal circumcision, ash physicians have a duty to inform parents
of that fact. As discussed below, studies purporting to demonstrate
prophylactic health benefits have fatal flaws in their design
and/or focus on maladies that are extremely rare - much rarer than
the complications that result from circumcision itself.<sup><a
href="#n280">280</a></sup> At best, these studies demonstrate the
truism that amputation of healthy tissue can have marginally reduce
the rate of maladies afflicting the organ from which it was taken
simply because less tissue is available to contract a condition.
Naturally, routine prophylactic amputation in children has never
been entertained as an ethically or scientifically viable medical
procedure. When the proposed benefits and real costs are
aggregated, as in a cost-utility analysis, the proposed benefits
are insufficient to counter the real costs.<sup><a
href="#n281">281</a></sup> A physician who states that neonatal
circumcision helps those illnesses without stating that any
potential benefits are far outweighed by the real harm perpetrated
violates his or her duty to provide accurate, complete
information.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>e.
Are physicians adequately disclosing this information?</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of actual practice
reveals that physicians who perform circumcisions themselves know
next to nothing about the part of the body that they are removing.
A 1975 survey revealed that 47% of physicians believed that a
non-retractable foreskin in a newborn was an indication for
circumcision, when it is perfectly normal and healthy for a
newborn&rsquo;s foreskin to be non-retractable and for the foreskin
to become retractable only as a boy approaches adolescence.<sup><a
href="#n282">282</a></sup> There is little evidence that physician
knowledge has improved since then.<sup><a
href="#n283">283</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misinformation
promulgated regarding the painlessness of circumcision is
unconscionable. Parents who cringe when their baby&rsquo;s heel is
pricked for a blood sample are led to believe that their son feels
little or no pain when a large part of his penis is cut off. This
may be because parents typically believe that anesthesia is used
even when it is not, or that if a local anesthesia is in fact used,
the anesthesia is highly effective when it is not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the risk of
complications and the supposed medical benefits associated with
circumcision, studies reveal that physicians underreport the risks
and exaggerate the supposed benefits. A 1987 study found that
physicians routinely inform parents about only a small minority of
the medical complications associated with elective
circumcisions.<sup><a href="#n284">284</a></sup> The common
practice is to mention only pain, infection and bleeding as
complications of newborn circumcision.<sup><a
href="#n285">285</a></sup> This is far below the standard level of
disclosure for other surgeries, whether medically indicated or
cosmetic. The physician should disclose each of the many potential
complications mentioned above, addressing the risks of serious
bodily harm and even death, the probability of
&ldquo;success,&rdquo; and the alternatives to circumcision, ad any
risks associated with these alternatives. A study has shown,
however, that physicians do not do this.<sup><a
href="#n286">286</a></sup> When selecting which medical
complications to mention to parents, physicians tend to use a
subjective assessment of the frequency and seriousness of
complications. The study revealed that the physicians&rsquo;
probability of estimates were inaccurately low and their
assessments of the seriousness of potential complications were
consistently lower than those expressed by mothers of newborn
sons.<sup><a href="#n287">287</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why
physicians provide inadequate information. Many who discuss the
surgery with the mother postpartum assume that the arguments for
and against circumcision have already been discussed with a health
care provider. Those who meet the parents well in advance of the
birth may simply feel too busy to properly discuss the pros and
cons with the parents, and may not have equipped themselves with
the literature necessary to adequately present the facts to the
parents. Compliance with the medical profession&rsquo;s ethical
requirement for obtaining true informed consent is a
time-consuming, laborious process. Doubtless, wherever they can,
many physicians will cut corners on such a task, especially where
as with circumcision, they may believe than some parents would
prefer not to learn the full truth regarding potential
complications.<sup><a href="#n288">288</a></sup> The current
perception that circumcision is &ldquo;just a little snip&rdquo;
and the cultural prejudice that a child&rsquo;s physical integrity
is less important than an adult&rsquo;s physical integrity makes it
easier to justify bypassing a full disclosure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, physicians may
simply feel uncomfortable full discussing with parents the risks of
circumcision.. Furthermore, many parents choose circumcision for
non-medical reasons. Likewise, many physicians see circumcision as
a cultural, not a medical, practice. Physicians may believe that
discussing the possible complications with parents is more likely
to upset the parents than to influence the parent&rsquo;s decision.
Parental hostility following complete disclosure is not
uncommon.<sup><a href="#n289">289</a></sup> The easiest path, in
terms of the physician&rsquo;s own comfort, is to provide sparse
information because the parents will decide who will provide
medical care for their child, and sometimes the fear of losing
patients may override the duty to do what is in the best interest
of the child.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Etchells et al.
suggest that physicians base the content of their discussions with
the parents on the perceived motives of each set of parents:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the parents&rsquo; decision is based on strong cultural
beliefs and practices, a detailed impersonal account of all known
risks and benefits would probably not be relevant or helpful.
However, if the decision is based on personal experiences (e.g.,
the father was circumcised), a detailed discussion of the risks and
benefits would be helpful in helping the parents to come to a
decision.<sup><a href="#n290">290</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is simply
untenable. Obvious practical and ethical difficulties are created
by an approach that requires physicians to determine parental
motives and to provide widely diverging types and levels of
information depending on this determination. More fundamentally,
the authors fail to explain how parental motives alters the risk,
the benefits, the treatment options, or the physician&rsquo;s duty
to the patient, i.e. the child, to give full disclosure. Tellingly,
physicians&rsquo; positions regarding circumcision are inconsistent
with their positions on therapeutic privilege<sup><a
href="#n291">291</a></sup> and substitute consent for adult
incompetent patients.<sup><a href="#n292">292</a></sup> This
suggests a failure to accord proper respect to the interests and
rights of children who are the patients and an improper focus on
the interests and desires of the parents. The extent of information
that parents actually want or feel comfortable receiving is legally
and ethically irrelevant to the physician&rsquo;s duty of
disclosure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misleading presentation
medical personnel typically give to parents may also result from a
failure to seek out available information. Three years after the
release of the 1975 AAP Task Force on Circumcision report, which
stated that &ldquo;[t]here is no absolute medical indication for
routine circumcision of the newborn,&rdquo;<sup><a
href="#n293">293</a></sup> only 49% of Chicago area, pediatricians,
obstetricians and family practitioners were aware of the
AAP&rsquo;s position.<sup><a href="#n294">294</a></sup> At that
time, 41% recommended routine infant circumcision despite the AAP
report, while only 15% recommended the infant forgo the
practice.<sup><a href="#n295">295</a></sup> The frequency of
routine circumcision in Chicago area hospitals (70% to 90% remained
unchanged in the three years following the AAP&rsquo;s
statement.<sup><a href="#n296">296</a></sup> Another study in 1975
analyzed a random group of 92 primary care physicians and 103
parents of male infants.<sup><a href="#n297">297</a></sup> Despite
the content of the 1975 AAP report, 65% of the physicians conveyed
a positive attitude about routine neonatal circumcision to their
patients.<sup><a href="#n298">298</a></sup> Although pediatricians
were more likely to have a neutral attitude, both family and
general practitioners were more likely to favor routine neonatal
circumcision.<sup><a href="#n299">299</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A particular
physician&rsquo;s attitude toward circumcision may derive more from
the results of personal experience and cultural background than
from careful study of the medical literature. A physician&rsquo;s
gender and circumcision status, for example appear to affect
whether he or she promotes or discourages circumcision. One study
found that 100% of the health care providers surveyed who
encouraged circumcision were male, while 81% of those discouraging
the practice were female.<sup><a href="#n300">300</a></sup> Another
survey found that circumcised physicians were more likely to favor
circumcision than those not circumcised.<sup><a
href="#n301">301</a></sup> Physicians asked to summarize their
opinions regarding circumcision offered a wide variety of opinions,
ranging from &ldquo;personally I appreciated the cosmetic
effect&rdquo; to &ldquo;barbaric ritual perpetuated for irrational
reasons.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n302">302</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code of Ethics of the
Canadian Medical Association instructs physicians to &ldquo;inform
[their] patient[s] when [their] personal morality would influence
the recommendation or practice of any medical procedure the patient
needs or wants&rsquo; and to indicate when their opinion is
contrary to the generally held position of the profession.<sup><a
href="#n303">303</a></sup> This is undoubtedly sound practice. It
suggests that a physician who belongs to a religion that requires
male circumcision should disclose this during any discussion with a
patient or parent concerning circumcision. Likewise, a physician
who recommends neonatal circumcision has an obligation to state,
depending on what country he is practicing in, that his national
medical organization does not recommend neonatal circumcision. As
with any ineffective, outdated treatment, physicians have a sound
basis for refusing to perform neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
href="#n304">304</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians&rsquo; failure to
adequately inform themselves about circumcision and to pass on all
acquired relevant information is reflected in the level of parental
knowledge about circumcision when parents give permission for the
surgery. A 1979 study surveyed two hundred mothers to determine
their attitudes toward and knowledge of neonatal
circumcision.<sup><a href="#n305">305</a></sup> Of those that were
either doctors or other health care providers, 95% circumcised
their sons. Although the mothers offered a wide variety of reasons
for granting permission, few of these reasons had any medical
validity (let alone sufficient weight to actually make their
decision rational). Eighty-seven percent of mothers considered
circumcision to be without risk or complications, and 80% of
mothers stated that no physician ever explained the risks to
them.<sup><a href="#n306">306</a></sup> A 1996 study revealed that
35% of mothers who gave permission for circumcision of their sons
believed that neonatal circumcision had no risks involved.<sup><a
href="#n307">307</a></sup> Twenty-five percent of the women in this
study believed that they had not been given enough
information.<sup><a href="#n308">308</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the physician is
obligated to disclose all personal interests unrelated to the
patient&rsquo;s health that he or she may have when obtaining
consent to medical treatment.<sup><a href="#n309">309</a></sup> The
Supreme Count of California held that a cause of action for lack of
informed consent exists where a physician fails to disclose, prior
to obtaining the patient&rsquo;s consent to remove his spleen, that
the physician has made arrangements to use portions of the spleen
for economically beneficial medical research purposes.<sup><a
href="#n310">310</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumcision context,
there arises a particular egregious, if relatively rare,
application of this principle that his drawn significant media
attention in recent years - the harvesting of foreskins from living
babies and the subsequent use of the foreskins for profit by the
medical industry.<sup><a href="#n311">311</a></sup> Clearly such
use of foreskins taken from living donors should be prohibited even
with parental permission, because it is not related in any way to
the circumcision itself and the affected infant cannot possibly
consent to this use of his formerly, healthy functional
tissue.<sup><a href="#n212">312</a></sup> In fact, two American
Medical Association (AMA) policy statements appear to explicitly
bar such a practice. AMA Policy E-2.08 on &ldquo;Commercial Use of
Human Tissue,&rdquo; requires informed consent from patients for
the use of organs or tissues in clinical research, mandates
disclosure of potential commercial applications prior to realizing
a profit on products developed from biological materials, prohibits
the use of human tissue and its products for commercial purposes
without the prior consent of the patient providing the original
cellular material, and demands that diagnostic and therapeutic
alternatives offered to patients conform to standards of good
medical practice and be free of influence in any way be the
commercial potential of a patient&rsquo;s tissue.<sup><a
href="#n313">313</a></sup> AMA policy E-2.167 on &ldquo;The Use of
Minors as Organ or Tissue Donors&rdquo; requires that all such use
have parental approval, that a &ldquo;clear benefit&rdquo; to the
minor exist, that the minor be the only available source of the
tissue, and that minors be allowed to serve as sources of tissue
only for close family members.<sup><a href="#n314">314</a></sup>
Medical applications of foreskins harvested from live donors are
also forbidden under international law pursuant to the European
Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.<sup><a
href="#n315">315</a></sup> Even if such use of circumcised
foreskins were ethical, physicians would certainly have an
obligation to disclose that potential conflict of interests to
parents.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2.
Capacity</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical personnel have a
duty to the newborn child to ensure that parental surrogates have
the capacity to make a rational, reflective decision about
circumcision. They should fully disclose all relevant information
about the procedure well in advance of the birth, and then evaluate
whether the parents understood the information. If the parents do
not appear to understand, the physician should attempt to convey
the information in another way that is clearer to the parents. Some
researchers have contended that parents are less rational in
medical decisions concerning their children than they are in
medical decisions concerning themselves.<sup><a
href="#n316">316</a></sup> Medical personnel may therefore have a
heightened duty when dealing with parental surrogates to ensure the
surrogate is capable of making a rational decision on behalf of the
infant patient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several studies have looked
into different media for presenting information to parents about
circumcision and what effect each would have on the likelihood of
parents giving permission. A survey of obstetric clinic patients in
a large urban hospital showed that oral communication of the risks
involved would significantly reduce the rate of circumcision (72%
in the study group versus 94.4% in the control group). The authors
concluded that mothers in the population they studied requested
circumcision for their sons because of inadequate medical
information or strong social motives.<sup><a
href="#n317">317</a></sup> Another study showed that videotape
counseling modestly reduced parental permission for circumcision
when compared with standard oral counseling (70.5% versus 75.9%,
OR=0.76, 95%, CI=0.61-0.94). Prior to the study, the circumcision
rate at that medical center was 90.4%.<sup><a
href="#n318">318</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents may actually be
resistant to receiving information about circumcision, and that
would diminish their capacity to understand what is presented. One
study of oral provision of information to mothers about risks had
to be suspended when many mothers became upset and expressed their
unwillingness to have the physician who provided the information
care for their children in the future.<sup><a
href="#n319">319</a></sup> The obstetrical nurses were also
belligerent to the physician who provided the mother&rsquo;s with
oral information because the physician was upsetting their
patients.<sup><a href="#n321">321</a></sup> Parents are often
irritated by any discussion of circumcision because their minds are
already made up.<sup><a href="#n320">320</a></sup> Told that
circumcision carries the risk of penile amputation, serious
life-threatening infection, and death, parents find that their
self-esteem challenged by this information because they do not want
to unnecessarily place their children at risk while at the same
time often being unwilling to rethink a decision they have already
made. In short, they do not want to be confused or unsettled by the
facts. As noted previously, the physician&rsquo;s obligation is to
the child, not to the parent, and that obligation includes a duty
to overcome parental resistance, and ensure that parents receive,
understand, and take into account all of the facts.<sup><a
href="#n322">322</a></sup> Otherwise, their permission for
circumcision of the infant cannot be effective.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3.
Voluntariness</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntariness
requirement demands that physicians provide information regarding
circumcision to parents in an unbiased fashion well in advance of
the birth and that physicians do not themselves propose the
procedure to parents. To ensure that any parents who are
predisposed to request circumcision receive full information in
advance of birth, the physician might tell parents that he or she
will assume, unless the parents indicate otherwise, that the baby
is not to be circumcised. If the subject first arises at birth, or
if the parents do not receive the relevant information about the
procedure until the time of birth, the physician should refuse to
perform the procedure until such time as the parents have been able
to review the information fully and demonstrate to the physician
that they understand the information. One group of physicians has
suggested simply waiting twelve hours after birth before asking
parents about circumcision, in order to provide an opportunity to
discuss the procedure&rsquo;s advantages and disadvantages with the
parents.<sup><a href="#n323">323</a></sup> However, given the
tremendous psychological and physical impact of becoming a parent,
this waiting period is inadequate to allow the parent sufficient
opportunity to allow the parent sufficient opportunity to absorb
and analyze information regarding the circumcision procedure before
making a decision. Some writers have questioned whether, given the
perinatal emotional upheaval, parental permission can ever be truly
free and informed in the neonatal context.<sup><a
href="#n324">324</a></sup> Indeed, one author (Svoboda) has
accumulated a significant number of consent forms for neonatal
circumcision, not a single one of which adequately discloses all
significant risks to the procedure in a manner parallel to the
disclosures which are commonly made for other surgeries.<sup><a
href="#n325">325</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, current
practice appears inconsistent with the voluntariness requirement as
well. It is customary in the United States to ask a woman during
one of the initial prenatal visits whether she desires circumcision
for her baby if it is a boy.<sup><a href="#n326">326</a></sup> As
noted above, offering a medically unnecessary surgery such as
circumcision is unethical.<sup><a href="#n327">327</a></sup> It is
also a subtle form of coercion; offering circumcision can easily be
interpreted as a recommendation.<sup><a href="#n328">328</a></sup>
Mothers are left with the impression that &ldquo;it must be the
thing to do, or our doctor would not have told us about
it.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n329">329</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more troubling is the
common occurrence of parents being presented with the circumcision
question for the first time when a mother is in labor at a
hospital. Surgeon George Kaplan notes that &ldquo;all too often the
consent to circumcise is included in a sheaf of papers that the
mother signs hurriedly on her way to the delivery room. No
discussion has been held regarding the merits of the procedure or
of the inherent risks.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n330">330</a></sup>
Kaplan characterizes this practice as
&ldquo;inexcusable.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n331">331</a></sup>
Raising the circumcision issue for the first time upon the
mother&rsquo;s arrival at the hospital to give birth amounts to
manipulation and coercion. Because the physician and the hospital
benefit financially from the parent&rsquo;s decision, such a
practice raises grave concerns about unethical profiteering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective consent to
elective, cosmetic surgery cannot arise unless and until the
patient himself is capable of giving it. Infant males are clearly
incapable of providing voluntary consent (and in fact uniformly
howl in protest of the procedure), and without medical necessity or
urgency, there is no justification for looking to a surrogate to
give permission. Unlike cases involving medical necessity for
treatment of a child, in the circumcision context there is simply
no predicate for departing from the general rule that the patient
himself must give voluntary consent to any incursion on his
physical integrity by medical professionals. The AAP Committee on
Bioethics sensibly recommends delaying, elective, cosmetic surgery
until a child is old enough to give consent., and this would apply
to circumcision.<sup><a href="#n332">332</a></sup> As previously
noted, the Australian Association of Paediatric Surgeons has taken
this position specifically with respect to circumcision,<sup><a
href="#n333">333</a></sup> as have scholars who have considered the
issue.<sup><a href="#n334">334</a></sup> Because, as discussed
above, no sufficient conditions exist for not deferring the
procedure, ethically and legally it <i>must</i> be deferred, given
the harm caused by the procedure and the probability that as an
adult the patient will most likely not desire it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all compelling reasons
to delay circumcision, it is necessary to examine why circumcision
is performed at such a young age. For many years, two rationales
supported the practice of circumcising right after birth. First, it
was once thought that the newborn could not feel pain.<sup><a
href="#n335">335</a></sup> Although this has been proven false,<sup><a
href="#n336">336</a></sup> and the opposite - that newborns
actually feel greater pain from the same trauma than do adults -
has been proven true, some physicians still blindly adhere to the
old myth.<sup><a href="#n337">337</a></sup> Second, it was once
regarded as less costly to perform circumcision right after birth
because general anesthesia is not used.<sup><a
href="#n338">338</a></sup> That rationale might have some force if
the first rationale, that babies feel less pain were true, but it
is hard to imagine any medical professional seriously espousing
this rationale today, when the babies-feel-no-pain myth has been
disproved. One would expect that medical professionals would not
use ineffective anesthesia on older children and adults simply
because it would be cheaper, and that no parents would knowingly
agree to subject their infant to excruciating pain when that could
easily be avoided, simply to save money.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But old habits die hard in
the medical profession. In the case of children, rationality runs
up against an additional obstacle - a pervasive unconscious view of
children as less than full persons and of childhood as simply a
time to be gotten through, a prelude to adulthood, rather than a
period of life having independent worth, which should be as happy a
time as society can make it. Medical personnel possessing this
attitude may decide that pain in infancy is less cause for concern
than pain in later life; adult pain is serious, but infant pain
will be gotten over. So it may well be a lack of respect for
newborns as persons and a lack of concern for their experience
rather than any genuine medical rationale that compel physicians to
perform circumcision in the neonatal period.<sup><a

To make the case that neonatal circumcision is necessary, one need
to demonstrate that it is either indispensable, inevitable,
mandatory, unavoidable, or essential for good health. No one has
attempted to make the case that all males with foreskins are in
poor health. In his pamphlet &ldquo;Neonatal Circumcision IS
Necessary&rdquo; surgeon Gerald N. Weiss gives a string of
arguments lauding the advantages of neonatal circumcision, but
never makes the case that circumcision is either indispensable or
essential for good health.<br />

See Queensland Law Reform Commission, supra note 250, <i>In re
Jane</i>, 85 A.L.R. 409, 435 1988) (discussing the relevance of its
finding by speculating that a contrary conclusion could lead to a
wide range of wrongs occurring including female circumcision:
&ldquo;The consequences of a finding that the court&rsquo;s consent
is unnecessary are far reaching both for parents and for children.
For example, such a principle might be used to justify parental
consent to the surgical removal of a girl&rsquo;s clitoris for
religious or quasi cultural reasons, or the sterilization of a
perfectly healthy girl for misguided, albeit sincere, reasons.
Other possibilities might include parental consent to the donation
of healthy organs such as a kidney from one sibling to
another.&rdquo;)<br />
