      <p><i>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does consent
      currently work in contexts involving children?</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents traditionally
      have made most medical decisions for their minor children.
      Like surrogate decision-making for incompetent adults,
      parental permission for medical procedures on children, when
      appropriate and properly secured constitutes an exception to
      the general requirement of personal consent to medical
      treatment.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup> Except in an
      emergency, informed permission by parents is generally
      required to perform any medical procedure on a child;
      otherwise, the procedure would be tortuous and probably
      criminal assault.<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, the the
      authority of parents is circumscribed by the welfare of their
      children; they may not make decisions or their children that
      are likely to cause them permanent harm or otherwise impair
      their healthy development.<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup> As
      the rights of the child as distinct persons have been
      increasingly recognized in modern times, children's welfare
      has become an overriding constraint on their medical care,
      limiting parental discretion.<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> The Queensland Law Reform
      Commission forcefully stated the limits on parental power to
      grant permission for children's treatment as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A parent has no authority to consent to the medical
          treatment of his or her child unless it is in the best
          interests of the child. This is because implicit in
          parental consent is understood to be the determination of
          what is best for the welfare of the child. If a parent
          purports to consent to a treatment which is not in the
          best interests of the child, the consent is of no effect
          and any person acting on such consent would be guilty of
          assault if any physical interference occurred.<sup><a
          href="#n101">101</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, courts clearly
      have power to insert themselves into decision-making on
      behalf of children.<sup><a href="#n102">102</a></sup> "Under
      the doctrine of parens patriae, the state has a right, indeed
      a duty, to protect children. State officials may interfere in
      family matters to safeguard the child's health, educational
      development and emotional well being."<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup> Thus the principal limit on
      parent's decision making is a legal and moral requirement
      that they act in the best interests of their children, which
      triggers state action when parents demonstrably act contrary
      to the best interests of the child, as defined by the
      state.</p>
      <a id="IIIB" name="IIIB"></a> 

      <p><i>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents may not
      sacrifice their children's physical well being for the sake
      of religious belief</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When parents make
      decisions about their children's medical care that are
      inconsistent with their children's well-being&ndash;that is,
      decisions not within the range of reasonable
      alternatives&ndash;they commit child abuse or neglect and can
      be charged accordingly in civil and/or criminal proceedings.
      Just as is true of adult incompetents, surrogate decisions
      for children must rest on the temporal interests of the
      patient, not on supposed spiritual or other worldly interests
      of the patient or of the surrogate. Thus, parents are neither
      excused for their obligation to secure necessary medical care
      for their children nor from their obligation to protect their
      children's physical integrity from unwarranted medical
      procedures simply because they have religious beliefs
      inconsistent with the child's temporal well being.<sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous judical
      decisions have addressed parental power to refuse medically
      indicated procedures that are contrary to parents' religious
      beliefs. The reigning legal principle was announced by the
      United States Supreme Court in <i>Prince v.
      Massachusetts</i>:<sup><a href="#n105">105</a></sup> "Parents
      may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not
      follow that they are free, in identical circumstances, to
      make martyrs of their children before they have reached the
      age of full and legal discretion when they can make that
      choice for themselves."<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup>
      This principle is controlling regardless of whether the
      child's life is in danger: parents are always required by law
      to proceed in accordance with their child's best
      interests.<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup> In fact,
      sometimes courts do not require any actual harm to justify
      compelling a medical procedure that parents have refused on
      religious grounds.<sup><a href="#n108">108</a></sup> The
      prevailing rule is that the state properly overrides parental
      objections to care when necessary to avoid physical harm to
      the child.<sup><a href="#n109">109</a></sup> For example, in
      <i>Jehovah's Witnesses v. King County Hospital</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n110">110</a></sup> the United States Supreme Court,
      citing <i>Prince v. Massachusetts</i>, upheld <i>per
      curiam</i> a Washington federal district court decision that
      the state of Washington properly ordered necessary blood
      transfusions for a child whose parents objected to the
      transfusion on religious grounds.<sup><a
      href="#n111">111</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover in recent
      years the very notion of parental entitlement has been
      increasingly questioned. Recognition of and respect for
      children as persons distinct from their parents has grown,
      leading legal scholars and judges to insist that parenthood
      is a fiduciary role rather than a property-owning one, so
      that parental authority should be viewed as a limited
      privilege rather than a right.<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup> In addition, there has been
      growing support for the view that children themselves possess
      rights in connection with their upbringing,<sup><a
      href="#n113">113</a></sup> and that those rights constrain
      the freedom of parents as well as the power of the
      state.<sup><a href="#n114">114</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the
      established limits on parental authority and freedom and the
      current trend toward greater protection of children against
      inappropriate parental decision-making, medical personnel
      cannot simply comply with parental preferences for, or
      against a given procedure even when those preferences are
      grounded in religious belief. As with incompetent adults, the
      physician himself owes duties to the child patient himself
      and those duties in some circumstances require resisting or
      even refusing surrogates choices.<sup><a
      href="#n115">115</a></sup> Those duties may be conceptualized
      as required medical professionals to ensure that parents are
      making the same decision that the child would make if able to
      do so, or as requiring medical professionals to ensure that
      parental choices are consistent with what objectively is in
      the child's best interests. In other words, the professional
      obligation owed to a child patient is the same as that owed
      an incompetent adult patient.</p>
      <a id="IIIC" name="IIIC"></a> 

      <p><i>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents may
      authorize a non-medically indicated procedure only if it is
      clearly in the child's best interests</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where parents request
      a procedure that is <i>not medically indicated</i>, courts
      have taken an even more child-protective stance and required
      strong evidence that the procedure is in the patient-child's
      interests. Sometimes courts allow the child's best interests
      to be determined using the more subjective, substituted
      judgment standard.<sup><a href="#n116">116</a></sup> On other
      occasions courts insist on the more objective, "best
      interests" approach, presumably because the substituted
      judgment approach might allow parent inappropriately to
      inject their own preferences into the decision-making
      process.<sup><a href="#n117">117</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While theoretically
      clear, the distinction between the two standards has a
      definite tendency to sometimes blur in practice, as courts
      have demonstrated by involking the "best interests" language
      while applying an analytical approach more consonant with the
      substituted judgment approach.<sup><a href="#n118">118</a></sup>
      As with incompetent adults, courts do not permit procedures
      to be performed on children when the procedures will only
      benefit other people and not the patient.<sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup> This is true even in cases where
      the potential benefit to a close relative substantially
      exceeds the risk to the child-patient, and where one might
      therefore reasonably assume many competent persons would
      choose to undergo the procedure. For example, in <i>Little v.
      Little</i><sup><a href="#n120">120</a></sup> the <i>guardian
      ad litem</i> for a 14-year-old mentally incompetent, but
      otherwise healthy girl applied on the encouragement of the
      mother to grant permission for the removal of a kidney from
      the girl.<sup><a href="#n121">121</a></sup>. The purpose of
      the procedure was to transplant the kidney into the girl's
      brother who was suffering from end-stage renal disease. In
      refusing the order the Texas Court of Appeals stated that
      "[t]his power of parents&hellip;to consent to surgical
      intrusions upon the person of the minor&hellip;is limited to
      the power to consent to medical `treatment.'"<sup><a
      href="#n122">122</a></sup> In other words, the permission is
      limited to care for an injury, disease or malformation.
      Similarly, in <i>In re Richardson</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n123">123</a></sup> a Louisiana Court of Appeals ruled
      that Kidney transplant surgery from a mentally retarded child
      to his sister could not take place because it would
      contravene the "minor's right to be free in his person from
      bodily intrusion to the extent of the loss of an organ unless
      such loss be in the best interest of the minor."<sup><a
      href="#n124">124</a></sup> The <i>Richardson</i> court
      rejected the substituted judgment test in favor of the best
      interest test and concluded that the procedure was not in the
      best interest of the prospective donor's interest, because
      any direct benefit was highly speculative.<sup><a
      href="#n125">125</a></sup> In <i>Curran v. Bosze</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n126">126</a></sup> the Illinois Supreme Court
      likewise rejected the substituted judgment approach in a case
      involving a proposal to subject three-and-one-half-year-old
      twins to blood testing to determine bone marrow compatibility
      with their half brother, who was dying of leukemia, reasoning
      that it was impermissibly speculative for a court of law or
      anyone else to attempt to ascertain the future intentions of
      such young children.<sup><a href="#n127">127</a></sup> Most
      recently, and in a dramatic endorsement of the best interests
      principle, an English Court of Appeals refused to allow
      parents of Siamese twin girls to undertake the separation of
      the twins, where one severely brain-damaged twin was
      virtually surely to die as a result of the procedure, but
      where in the absence of the procedure, both twins would
      almost certainly lose their lives in a few years.<sup><a
      href="#n128">128</a></sup> The court held that parental
      consent may only be given for treatment which is in the best
      interests of the child, and that in this case the treatment
      was not in the weaker child's best interest.<sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The above statement is erratum.
      In actuality the British court did authorize the surgery to
      separate the conjoined twins.]</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents, like
      substitute decision-makers for incompetent adult patients,
      should be viewed as agents for their children, required to
      make decisions for their children in a manner consistent with
      their children's best interests.<sup><a
      href="#n130">130</a></sup> Medical professionals owe a duty
      to their minor patient to assist parents in making decisions
      that conform to that standard. A recent statement of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Bioethics
      supports the conclusion that physicians are constrained in
      accepting parental direction regarding medical care for
      children by the requirement that the care be medically
      beneficial and that any surgery on children must be necessary
      to prevent serious harm. According to the AAP Committee,
      parent permission for medical intervention can substitute for
      the child's consent only in situations of clear and immediate
      medical necessity, such as disease, trauma, or
      deformity.<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> The AAP
      Committee directs that for non-essential treatments,
      particularly those that can be deferred without loss of
      efficacy, the physician and family must wait until the
      child's consent can be obtained.<sup><a
      href="#n132">132</a></sup> The medical profession in the
      United Kingdom adheres to similar rules. The United Kingdom
      Department of Health's guidelines state that</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>[t]hose acting for the child can only legally give
          their consent provided that the intervention is for the
          benefit of the child. If they are responsible for
          allowing the child to be subjected to any risk (other
          than one so insignificant as to be neglible) that is not
          outweighed by the prospect of medical benefit to the
          child, they act illegally.<sup><a
          href="#n133">133</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist parents in
      making decisions that comport with their child's best
      interests, medical professionals must satisfy the same
      requirements of informed consent/parental permission that
      apply to decision-making by competent adults and by
      surrogates for incompetent adults. First, the physician must
      disclose to parents all relevant information that a competent
      patient would want to know if the procedure were to be
      performed on him. Second, the physician must ensure that
      parents have the capacity to understand and think rationally
      about the information given to them. Third, the physician
      must ensure that the parents' decision is voluntary and not
      manipulated in any way by the manner in which it is presented
      or the time at which parents' permission is sought. With
      respect to interventions that are not medically indicated, it
      is improper at any time for a physician to suggest the
      procedure to parents who have not inquired about it; such a
      suggestion would amount to solicitation and would likely be
      interpreted by parents as a medical recommendation. Just as
      it would be unethical for a physician to recommend a
      non-medically indicated intervention to the surrogate of an
      incompetent adult, it is also unethical to recommend such an
      intervention to the surrogate of a child.</p>
