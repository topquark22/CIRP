      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      How does consent work when the patient is a competent
      adult?</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competent adult
      patients are entitled to make the decisions regarding their
      medical care themselves.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> This
      uncontroverted principle is fundamental to medical practice.
      The entitlement arises from the principle of individual
      self-determination that lies at the core of our political
      system and moral beliefs.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> To
      facilitate self-determination in the medical setting, a
      process of "informed consent" has evolved. "[I]nformed
      consent is an autonomous authorization of medical
      intervention&hellip; by individual patients."<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> Proper respect for the individual
      patient and for his right to control his own life requires
      that physicians refrain from surgical interventions, unless
      they are authorized by the patient based on an understanding
      of the best available information pertaining to a proposed
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> In legal terms,
      securing consent without providing adequate information
      constitutes legally redressable negligence.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, while patients
      necessarily rely on physicians to find the source of a malady
      if there is one,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> once
      physicians have identified a problem and delineated treatment
      options, the patient's right of consent requires that the
      patient actively participate in the process of deciding which
      option to choose. Accordingly, the physician has a legal and
      ethical duty to engage the patient in the consent
      process.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Specific
      requirements for informed consent have become increasingly
      stringent, reflecting modern society's greater skepticism
      toward medical authority and increased concern with
      safeguarding bodily integrity and personal autonomy.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> Today those requirements fall into
      three categories: disclosure, capacity and
      voluntariness.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Disclosure</i> 

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of disclosure
      arises from the principle that an individual's right to
      self-determination entails a right to know the truth and to
      receive any and all information that is available, so that
      the treatment decision is the individual's own decision
      rather than someone else's decision.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> Patients have a relatively high
      desire for information.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> An
      uninformed decision to follow the recommendation or
      suggestion of a medical professional is in effect a choice
      coerced by the medical professional. In addition to honoring
      the patient's ability to cope with the consequences of the
      procedure chosen.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> In
      contrast, a patient's discovery after the fact that he was
      not given all the information he would have wanted can
      undermine his ability to deal effectively and positively with
      any adverse effects of the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical professionals
      do not always fulfull this duty of disclosure, even when
      treating competent adult patients, and with respect to some
      procedures it may be common practice to give the patient much
      less information than he or she would need to participate
      meaningfully in the decision-making. Forty years ago, a
      physician might have been insulated from liability for
      non-disclosure if this was the common and accepted practice
      among medical professionals in connection with the particular
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> Today, a rule more
      respectful of patients prevails, requiring disclosure of all
      information that the patient would deem relevant in reaching
      a decision without regard to what the traditional common
      practice has been.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, before obtaining
      consent to a medical procedure, a physician must provide
      adequate information to the patient in a manner that the
      patient can comprehend.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
      "Adequate" means the amount and kind of information that the
      average person in the patient's position would want to have
      in reaching an informed decision.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> Typically this means that the
      clinician must fully explain the proposed procedure, the
      expected short-term risks and long-term consequences, the
      available alternatives and their risks and benefits and the
      consequences of declining or delaying treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> The patient should be made aware of
      both short-term costs - for example pain, length of
      confinement in a hospital, recovery time and potential
      complications. - and long term costs - such as loss of
      functioning, restriction of activities and physical scarring.
      In general, the test "for determining whether a potential
      peril must be divulged is its materiality to the patient's
      decision."<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> Physicians must
      disclose <i>all</i> material information, that is, all
      "information which the physician knows or should know would
      be regarded as material by a reasonable person when deciding
      to accept or reject a recommended medical procedure."<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> Importantly, the physician has an
      obligation to provide all significant information that is
      available, even if he or she were previously unaware of it.
      In other words, the duty of disclosure entails an obligation
      on the part of the physician to acquire information as it
      becomes available.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> Naturally,
      there is a limit to how much and what kind of information
      medical professionals must provide. The physicians duty is to
      provide information that the average person would need to
      make an intelligent decision. This suggests that information
      that is not relevant need not be provided. Relevant
      information is that information which would have a bearing
      from the patient's perspective on medical care.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> The materiality criterion suggests
      that physicians need not provide information that would not
      influence the average patient's decision-making. However,
      even very slight risks generally must be disclosed to
      patients, particularly if the consequences are severe. In a
      recent Australian case, for example, a patient who underwent
      an elective operation on her right eye and who had
      persistently questioned the physician concerning potential
      complications was never informed that there was a one in
      14,000 chance that the operation would leave here blind. The
      operation did in fact leave her virtually blind.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> The High Court of Australia ruled
      that the physician was negligent in not revealing the risk of
      this complication, even though the risk was slight.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> This ruling is consistent with
      patients' expectations; a 1988 study in Australia found that
      77% of patients said they wanted more information about their
      treatment.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to
      requirements as to the content of the information provided, a
      physician's duty of disclosure entails a requirement as to
      <i>how</i> he or she provides the information in a manner
      conducive to patient comprehension. Studies have found that
      some form of written disclosure, either alone or in
      combination with verbal disclosure, imparts greater knowledge
      than verbal disclosure alone.<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup>
      This suggests that physicians should provide full written
      explanations of procedures to their patients when
      practicable. Presumably, this would be practicable with
      respect to any procedures performed routinely or in
      non-emergency situations.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions to the
      disclosure requirement, if any, are legally tenuous. A
      patient may voluntarily forego some elements of disclosure,
      but it is not clear that this "waiver' provides the physician
      any protection from a negligence suit.<sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup> The so-called therapeutic
      privilege." Adopted in the past by the Supreme Court of
      Canada as sometimes permitting the withholding of information
      in order to lessen the patient's suffering<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> is increasingly disfavored, and, in
      fact, has more recently been ruled unacceptable in that
      country.<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> The High Court of
      Australia has similarly ruled, "Except in those cases where
      there is a particular danger that the provision of all
      relevant information will harm an unusually nervous disturbed
      or volatile patient, no special medical skill in involved in
      [complying with legal mandates that require] disclosing the
      information, including the risks attending the proposed
      treatment."<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> By comparison,
      the therapeutic privilege doctrine has never received much
      support in the United States; just a smattering of lower
      courts have on rare occasions endorsed it.<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup> As early as 1972, in the leading
      case of <i>Canterbury v. Spence</i>, the District of Columbia
      Circuit tersely observed that the "physician's privilege to
      withhold information for therapeutic reasons must be
      carefully circumscribed&hellip; for otherwise it might devour
      the disclosure rule itself."<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup>
      The rule is that physicians must provide accurate and
      complete information to all patients, even though a small
      percentage might prefer not to know about the risks of
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> The only generally
      recognized exception, which is narrowly construed, applies to
      situations where, because of the patient's emotional
      condition, disclosure is very likely to cause physical or
      mental harm.<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Capacity</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity is the
      patient's ability to understand information relating to
      treatment decisions and to appreciate the consequences of a
      decision.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> The capacity
      requirement reflects the belief that persons unable to make
      rational decisions about their medical care should be
      protected from making decisions that are harmful or that they
      would not make if they were able. The requirement imposes on
      physicians a duty to assess whether a person is capable of
      making a rational decision based upon that information. To
      accomplish this, the clinician should provide full disclosure
      about a proposed procedure and then evaluate whether the
      patient does in fact understand the information disclosed. In
      dealing with competent adults, medical professionals must
      presume that the adult has the requisite capacity and proceed
      with full disclosure unless and until they determine that a
      patient actually is not capable of understanding.
      Non-disclosure cannot be justified by a suspicion or
      uncertainty concerning the adult's capacity for
      understanding.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, a
      patient's understanding is often limited not so much by his
      inherent inability to comprehend, but by the clinician's
      inability to convey information understandably. The capacity
      requirement precludes doctor's from obtaining consent without
      full disclosure based on the doctor's determination of
      incapacity, where any incapacity can be cured by reasonably
      improving the manner in which information is presented. In
      fact, this requirement suggests a duty on the part of medical
      professionals to make greater efforts to communicate
      information when initial efforts are unsuccessful.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Voluntariness</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntariness
      requirement protects the patient's right to make health care
      choices free from manipulation or undue influence.<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup> Manipulation occurs where medical
      personnel distort and/or omit information in order to induce
      the patient's acceptance or rejection of a procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> Full disclosure can obviate
      manipulation by omission, but not the danger of manipulation
      by distortion.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power inbalance
      between doctor and patient creates a great danger of undue
      influence. A patient cannot obtain treatment without an
      agreeable medical professional, and typically can do little
      more than respond to treatement the physician offers.
      Patients are often ill and anxious at the time that consent
      is sought, making them even more vulnerable to influence by
      medical professionals. Because of the inherent imbalance of
      power in the physician-patient relationship, the manner and
      order in which physicians present information can greatly
      influence the importance patients attach to different
      considerations and can, intentionally or otherwise, persuade
      the patient to select the option favored by the
      physician.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the
      physician has a duty to distance himself as much as possible
      from his personal preferences and values and to present
      interests at stake for the patient. Physicians also must be
      sensitive to the fact that patients are likely to interpret a
      suggestion, or even the mere mention of an option, as a
      recommendation. To counteract this danger, bioethicists
      recommend that physicians actively and explicitly
      <i>encourage</i> physicians to make decisions
      independently.<sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of
      disclosure is also important. The immediacy of the need for a
      medical procedure can interfere with the patient making a
      voluntary decision.. The patient may have little time to
      digest information and reflect on alternatives; he or she is
      likely to be emotionally overwrought and be especially
      reliant on the physician to make decisions for him or her.
      Certainly with an elective procedure that can be performed at
      any time, it would be inexcusable for a physician not to
      provide a patient with full disclosure far in advance to
      allow the patient sufficient time to reflect on whether to
      undergo the procedure.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, an adult
      patient's decision to undergo a procedure must truly be
      <i>his</i> or <i>her</i> decision, a true reflection of his
      or her autonomy an right to self-determination. This will
      only be true if the physician fully and objectively discloses
      all information relevant and material to the decision. Doing
      so ensures that the patient understands the information,
      encourages the patient to make the decision independently and
      steers clear of any actions that could amount to undue
      influence and/or manipulation.<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup></p>
      <a id="IIB" name="IIB"></a> 

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      How does informed consent work when compentent adults request
      non-medically indicated procedures?</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A physician's
      obligation regarding the content of information provided to a
      patient is even greater in connection with procedures such as
      cosmetic surgery, that are not "medically indicated," i.e.,
      that are not undertaken to secure a medical benefit.<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> Because the procedure entails no
      medical benefit, the only possible <i>medical</i> result is
      harm, so a physician must proceed with particular
      caution.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literature
      addressing consent for cosmetic surgery is fairly sparse; the
      American Medical Association Code of Ethics, for example,
      does not address it.<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup> However,
      a general principle running through the limited discussion
      available holds that the more elective a procedure, the more
      important the role of full disclosure.<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> Because the patient is often eager
      to proceed prior to consulting the physician, the physician
      needs to temper the this enthusiasm with an enumeration of
      all possible complications. The clear disclosure of all
      significant health considerations is a prerequisite to the
      patient's ability to make a rational decision about whether
      to proceed.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, the
      physician should also ensure that someone requesting a
      procedure that is not medically indicated is fully competent
      and acting voluntarily. It would be particularly troubling if
      a physician not only failed to ensure fully informed and
      uncoerced reflection on the potential costs of a
      non-medically indicated procedure but also in fact suggested
      the procedure or presented information about it in a way that
      could possibly be interpreted as a recommendation.
      Encouraging a patient to undergo a procedure that has no
      medical benefit is presumptively inconsistent with medical
      ethics.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong concern
      regarding voluntariness may arise in situations where the
      cultural practices of some group dictates that individuals
      undergo a physical alteration that does not benefit them
      medically, particularly where those individuals are
      subordinate within the group. Indeed, a physician will often
      be ethically and legally barred from performing such
      procedures that might cause harm and that are without medical
      benefit.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is a
      Muslim woman's request that a doctor circumcise her daughter.
      Probably already covered by common law assault statutes, the
      procedure is now specifically banned by a number of statutes
      passed in the past few years. Any physician who performs such
      a procedure violates medical ethics and, in many states,
      criminal and civil law as well.<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup> Recently, a Seattle hospital agreed
      to perform a minor, largely symbolic genital cutting on a
      Muslim woman who requested it, but subsequently reversed
      itself in the face of public outcry.<sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup> This event reflects the widespread
      understanding that doctors should refuse to become complicit
      in physically cultural practices and that consent should be
      treated with skepticism when it comes from persons who
      historically have been less than fully autonomous. At least
      two authors have noticed the dramatic disparity between the
      treatment of female genital cutting and circumcision,
      commenting emphatically on the violation of equal protection
      created by current statutoryl law.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>
      <a id="IIC" name="IIC"></a> 

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Can adults consent to prohylactic removal of healthy
      tissue?</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if a procedure is
      not needed to correct an existing problem, but might reduce
      or eliminate risk of medical problems in the future? Current
      practices and attitudes with respect to risk of cancer in
      women are instructive. Genetic tests can now detect genes
      that predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. Women
      with the relevant mutations would significantly reduce the
      risk of contracting these cancers if they underwent
      prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy. These women
      could thereby increase their lifespan by an average of 2.9 to
      5.3 years.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup> Even in the
      average woman without these genetic markers, prophylactically
      removing both breasts and ovaries would result in average
      gain of six to eight months of life expectancy.<sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup> Without providing their reasoning,
      the authors concluded that "prophylactic surgery obviously
      unreasonable for these women."<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> Although such prophylactic surgery
      is generally deemed inappropriate,<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> given the substantial benefits and
      assuming fully informed consent could be provided by the
      patient herself, it may be legally and ethically
      permissiable. By contrast, it clearly would be impermissible
      in the case of an incompetent individual, where permission
      would have to be provided by a surrogate.<sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup></p>
      <a id="IID" name="IID"></a> 

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      How does informed consent work in contexts involving
      incompetent adults?</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the doctrine
      of informed consent is predicated on respect for the autonomy
      of the patient, the doctrine applies even when the patient is
      not competent. The effect of applying the doctrine to
      incompetent adult patients is not to give the physician or
      anyone else a <i>right</i> to decide for the patient.<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup>. Rather, in such cases, under the
      principle of "substituted judgment," a surrogate for the
      patient, typically a relative, is legally <i>permitted</i> to
      stand in the place of the patient; this means that the
      surrogate can make decisions on behalf of the patient in
      furtherance of the rights <i>of the patient</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> Surrogates are under a legal
      obligation to decide not on the basis of how <i>they</i> want
      the patient to be treated, but rather on the basis of how
      <i>the patient</i> would choose to be treated if he or she
      were capable of choosing.<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup> As
      a general rule, the more a surrogate seems influenced in here
      decision-making by her personal values and preferences, the
      less willing a physician should be to accept the surrogate's
      authorization for a procedure.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the patient was
      formerly competent, the substitute decision-makers typically
      must present clear and convincing evidence as the wishes of
      the patient before he or she became incompetent.<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup>. For example, where a once-competent
      adult has become disabled by trauma or old age and is on life
      support surrogates must demonstrate that, when competent, the
      patient indicated a preference not to have his or her life
      prolonged by medical means if there was no hope of
      recovery.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> Where such evidence
      is lacking or where the patient was never competent, the
      surrogate must provide evidence as to what a rational person
      would likely want for himself or herself in light of the
      relevant aspects of the situation.<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> In other words, the patient's best
      interests must be proved by the surrogate.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup>. The substitute decision-maker's
      judgment is subject to review and challenge if it appears
      irrational or self-interested.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether
      to perform a medical procedure on an adult who has never been
      competent arises most often when mentally disabled women have
      guardians who wish to sterilize them.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup> These guardians typically believe
      that sterilization will benefit the disabled women by
      preventing a pregnancy that could have serious physical,
      psychological, and social consequences.<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup>. Nevertheless, in light of the
      presumption of bodily integrity and the difficulty of
      attributing contrary preferences to an adult that has never
      been competent, courts and legislators have become
      increasingly unwilling to allow such sterilization.<sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, to
      authorize surgery on an incompetent adult patient, a
      surrogate must clearly demonstrate that the benefits of the
      surgery outweigh the short- and long-term costs for the
      patient. The incompetent person's presumptive right against
      invasion of his or her bodily integrity places the burden on
      anyone who would infringe that right to prove that it is
      necessary for the incompetent person's welfare. Importantly,
      the costs and benefits relevant to an assessment of an
      incompetent person's interests is connection with a medical
      procedure are only temporal, earthly interests such as
      physical and mental health, social relationships and
      finances. Assessment of costs and benefits on behalf of an
      incompetent person cannot justifiably include what the
      surrogate decision-maker believes to be spiritual or other
      worldly costs and benefits for the patient. There is no
      assurance that the patient would share that perception. The
      law gives no one authority to decide what another person's
      spiritual interests are, regardless of whether the latter
      person is or ever has been competent.<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> This principle is rarely tested, but
      in <i>In re</i> Quinlan,<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup>
      which involved a once-competent woman in a persistant
      vegetative state, the New Jersey Supreme Court involked the
      principle to reject a claim by the woman's parents that the
      hospital must withdraw life support because the claim was
      inconsistent with the parent's religious values.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> The court stated emphatically that
      the parents had no right, based on religious freedom or
      parenthood, to make that decision for their daughter.<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these
      constraints the surrogate is legally authorized to <i>grant
      permission</i> (the more precise terminology) to medical
      intervention for an incompetent adult. However, for a
      competent adult making decisions regarding his own care, such
      permission must be informed. The physician's professional and
      legal duties are at least as stringent as in the case of an
      autonomous adult. Because the patient &ndash; the person with
      the greatest stake in the operation&ndash;is not able himself
      to insist upon receiving and then evaluating all the relevant
      information, more care must be taken to ensure that decisions
      are made in the correct way. Hence, when a surrogate is faced
      with a decision on whether an incompetent adult should
      undergo surgery, medical personnel have a duty <i>to the
      patient</i> to fully disclose to the surrogate all available
      information that a reasonable competent adult would want
      before deciding whether to undergo the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup> Physicians also have a duty to
      ensure that the surrogate is capable of understanding the
      information provided and of fully appreciating the
      consequences of a decision at the moment of decision making.
      Likewise, physicians also have an obligation not to
      manipulate the surrogate by presenting the information in a
      manner designed to secure permission, rather than
      facilitating an objective evaluation of the risks and
      benefits of the procedure. In addition to these requirements,
      which also arise in securing permission for a surgical
      procedure from a competent patient, a physician seeking
      permission for a surgical procedure on an incompetent adult
      must ensure that the substitute decision-maker is not acting
      out of self-interest but rather is deciding on the basis of
      what is best for the patient.</p>
      <a id="IIE" name="IIE"></a> 

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>E.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would non-medically
      indicated surgery be allowed for a non-autonomous
      adult.</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few
      situations in which a surrogate for an incompetent adult
      requests a non-medically indicated procedure. The most common
      are similar to the cases indicated above in which a concerned
      family member seeks to withdraw life support from a patient
      who is terminally ill or in a persistant vegetative state, or
      to take away a mentally disabled woman's ability to
      procreate.<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup> In all of these
      situations, the surrogate may perceive non-medical benefits
      for the patient that he or she believes outweigh any medical
      harm that might result from the decision. However, there is
      no assurance that the views of surrogates, often close family
      members, will necessarily be the same as the patient's had he
      or she been confronted with the situation while
      competent.<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup> As noted above,
      surrogates in both cases must present strong evidence as to
      the patient's preferences when competent or as to the
      patient's best interests.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the
      choice of physically invasive procedures, such as
      sterilization, courts and legislatures have been increasingly
      resistant to allow them and increasingly concerned that
      surrogates might choose such procedures out of self-interest
      rather than out of respect for the incompetent adult. In
      several states, sterilization is simply not permitted.<sup><a
      href="#n87">87</a></sup> A doctor today who performs a
      sterilization operation on an incompetent woman without court
      approval is vulnerable to criminal, civil and professional
      ethics charges, despite having permission from the woman's
      parents or other guardians.<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup>
      Typically, if a court chooses to grant approval of the
      procedure at all, it is only after a determination "that the
      condition of the conservatee `<i>requires</i> the recommended
      course of medical treatment,'" and that there are no
      alternative means of protecting the incompetent woman's
      physical well-being and interests.<sup><a
      href="#n89">89</a></sup> Consistent with this approach, the
      California Supreme Court found in <i>Conservatorship of
      Valerie N</i>.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup> that parents
      of a mentally retarded woman could not have her sterilized,
      "inasmuch as there was neither evidence of necessity &hellip;
      nor sufficient evidence that less intrusive means &hellip;
      [were] not presently available to [the conservatee]."<sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup> The Court based its decision upon
      the incompetent patient's fundamental "right &hellip; to be
      free of intrusive medical and surgical procedures."<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, courts
      have not been faced with claims by guardians to have
      incompetent adults in their care undergo surgery to remove a
      normal healthy non-diseased, un-injured part of the body
      simply for the sake of conforming to cultural norms or as a
      prophylactic measure to avoid some infinitesimal risk of
      disease to that part of the body. Were a guardian of an adult
      to seek such a procedure, doctors and lawyers would inform
      him without hesitation that his request in inappropriate and
      legally unsupportable. Imagine, for example, Muslim parents
      of a woman who was never competent asking a doctor to
      circumcise her; the doctor surely must refuse. Courts have
      even been hesitant when removal of healthy tissue has been
      sought for the purpose of transplantation&mdash;that is, to
      provide a medical benefit to (perhaps even save the life of)
      another person who may be a close relative of the incompetent
      adult. They have held that surrogates may not authorize this
      type of removal because it does not constitute medical
      treatment for the incompetent donor.<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup> In many such cases, an objective
      analysis would probably show that a transplant would maximize
      the overall good and that the average competent person would
      altruistically agree to donate the tissue or organ, but the
      law nevertheless prohibits that result because of grave
      concerns about violating a person's physical integrity
      without his consent.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Medical
      Association Code of Medical Ethics does not address a
      physician's ethical obligation in situations where guardians
      for an incompetent adult seek non-medically indicated medical
      intervention. However, the Code includes a more general
      mandate to physicians to help patients "make choices from
      among the therapeutic alternatives <i>consistent with good
      medical practice</i>."<sup><a href="#n94">94</a></sup> This
      might be read to imply that a physician must discourage a
      surrogate from seeking a procedure that would not be
      medically beneficial to the patient. Certainly, physicians
      have no affirmative obligation to undertake a non-medically
      indicated intervention when asked to do so. Therefore, it is
      no justification for violating an incompetent person's
      physical integrity that a surrogate might be asked to do
      so.<sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mention in
      the legal or ethical literature of physician's
      <i>proposing</i> non-medically indicated procedures to
      surrogates who have not themselves requested the procedure.
      This is unsurprising. Such a practice would so clearly offend
      the canons of ethics of the medical profession as to generate
      a reaction of horror and recrimination by legal and medical
      authorities. The prohibition of solicitation by doctors,
      based upon the impropriety of a physician putting his or her
      financial welfare above the welfare of the patients,<sup><a
      href="#n96">96</a></sup> would apply even more stringently to
      solicitation of surrogates for incompetent adults than it
      does to solicitation of competent adults. Any physician who
      proposed to a surrogate for an incompetent adult that the
      surrogate give permission for non-medically indicated surgery
      which the surrogate had not requested would jeopardize his or
      her license to practice medicine.</p>

      the parens patriae power applies equally to incompetents and
      infants, both procedures violate the minor's personal
      integrity, and while sterilization invokes profound privacy
      interests in procreative choice not raised by circumcision,

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="n87"
      name="n87"></a> 87. In some states, sterilization is
      prohibited by statute where a mentally disabled woman is
      capable of participating in the decision making process and
      declines to consent. <i>See, e.g.</i>, C<span
      class="sc">OLO</span>. R<span class="sc">EV</span>. S<span
      class="sc">TATE</span>. &sect; 27-10.5-128(4) (2000). In at
      least one state, California, the legislature initially passed
      a statute prohibiting sterilization under any circumstances,
      but a court ruled the prohibition unconstitutional, on the
      grounds that incompetent women have reproductive rights that
      include a right to be sterilized if they want to be and if
      that is in their best interests. See In re Valerie N., 707
      P.,d 760, 771s72 (Cal. 1985) (invalidating Ann. Cal. Probate
      Code &sect; 2356(d)). More commonly courts have held that
      sterilization of mentally incompetent women is prohibited in
      the absence of statutary authority. See Am. Jur. 2d Mentally
      Impaired Persons &sect; 126 (1996); Elizabeth Scott,
      <i>Sterilization of Mentally Retarded Persons: Reproductive
      Rights and Family Privacy</i>. 1986 D<span
      class="sc">UKE</span> L. J. 806, 817 N.32 (1986). States that
      do permit courts to authorize sterilization generally require
      that courts find by clear and convincing evidence that
      sterilization is in the best interests of the incompetent
      woman. <i>See</i> Scott, <i>supra</i>, at 817-19. Many
      require that all less drastic (nonpermanent) contraceptive
      methods have been found unworkable and that there be no
      alternative to sterilization. <i>See id</i>. at 820 n.43.
      Significantly, current law precludes courts from considering
      the interests of parents or other guardians for the
      incompetent woman in deciding whether to authorize
      sterilization. <i>See id</i>. at 821-22.<br />
