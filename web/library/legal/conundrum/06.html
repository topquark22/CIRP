        Infants do not have the capacity to give consent to any
        aspect of their medical care. Physicians may only obtain
        legally valid permission from parents to perform procedures
        on their incompetent children, provided full disclosure of
        all material information is made to parents who are able to
        understand that information and to appreciate the
        consequences of their decision, and provided that the
        parents are able to decide whether to grant their
        permission free from any manipulation or undue influence.
        Moreover, regardless of the motivations and desires of
        physicians and parents, the only interventions for which
        parents may grant their permission are those conferring
        benefits that clearly outweigh the short- and long-term
        costs for their infant patient.</p>

        <p class="justified">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Consent places physicians in a very delicate position, one
        that is appropriately governed by stringent ethical norms.
        Physicians should approach decision-making on behalf of a
        newborn with the greatest caution and a strong presumption
        against intrusive procedures. Amputating a highly sensitive
        and functional part of the body is extremely intrusive and
        should be undertaken only in situations of urgent
        necessity. Neonatal circumcision as it is routinely
        performed in this country clearly does not satisfy this
        criterion. It is therefore unethical and unlawful, no
        parental permission for the procedure should be effective.
        Moreover, even if it were permissible for physicians to
        give effect to parental permission for circumcision,
        physicians would be under a stringent obligation to their
        infants patients to ensure that any such permission is
        informed--voluntarily given based upon competent review of
        all relevant information. Available evidence suggests that
        physicians today routinely fail to fulfill this duty. In
        doing so, they discredit their profession and expose
        themselves to legal liability.</p>

        <p class="justified">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Consent to neonatal circumcision has not been directly
        considered by the courts; therefore, our analysis, out of
        necessity, relies on established legal precedents of cases
        that share common elements with neonatal circumcision. With
        near uniformity, these precedents indicate that neonatal
        circumcision would not be valid. Court decisions are in
        part influenced by the culture in which they occur.[340]
        However, circumcision has gradually but steadily been
        falling out of favor in the past few decades. When the
        balance of public opinion shifts to opposing the practice,
        the legal system will likely become more accepting of
        lawsuits and lobbying for the protection of baby boys.
        Consequently, the legal system will no longer be able to
        ignore the conflict between this practice and the legal and
        ethical duties of medical professionals. In the meantime,
        the medical community ought to hold its members
        responsible, and every medical professional should
        personally reexamine the ethics of the practice.</p>

        <p class="justified">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The persistence of routine neonatal circumcision in this
        country may be explained partly as cultural blindness, a
        blindness that afflicts medical professionals as much as it
        does the general population. Part of the explanation also
        lies in a disregard for the distinct personhood and dignity
        of children. The analogy to sterilization of mentally
        retarded women is most telling; though once done routinely,
        primarily to avoid the social costs of creating wards of
        the state and of creating more disabled individuals,
        sterilization now requires court approval and a strong
        showing that it would be medically beneficial to the
        incompetent woman. Even in fairly compelling circumstances,
        courts have denied permission for sterilization of an
        incompetent patient. The change came when we as a society
        started to respect the mentally disabled as persons and
        accord them the dignity they are due as persons. We must
        now do the same for children, and that will mean ending the
        practice of routine infant male circumcision.</p>
