>  FGM has been specifically criminalised in Australia - in NSW in 1994, 
>  in South Australia in 1995, and in Victoria in 1996 (s.32 Crimes 
>  Act).  Consent is expressly not a defence.

>  The NSW offence applies where the operation is performed on a person 
>  ordinarily resident in NSW, wherever the operation is actually 
>  performed.  The Victorian legislation creates a separate offence 
>  (s.33) of taking or arranging to take a person from the State in
>   order to have FGM performed.  I believe the SA approach is similar.

>  The Model Criminal Code proposed at the federal level includes the 
>  criminal offence of FGM, with a prohibition on removal of a child for 
>  purposes of performing FGM.  This part of the Code is still under 
>  discussion.
