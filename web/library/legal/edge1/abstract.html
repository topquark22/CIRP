        <h2>Male Circumcision After the Human Rights Act 1998</h2>

        <p><b>Peter W. Edge</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>The circumcision of infants, once regarded as relatively
      uncontroversial, has become a focus for medical and legal
      debate involving both significant support and pressure
      groups, and a rapidly growing body of medical and legal
      literature. This paper considers the legality of infant
      circumcision in English law, both in the context of
      established doctrines of family and criminal law, and under
      the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a>. A number of assumptions
      underpin this paper, which need to be outlined before moving
      on to discussion of the substantive English law.</p>
