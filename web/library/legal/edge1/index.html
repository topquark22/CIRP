      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="justify">The circumcision of male infants, once
      regarded as relatively uncontroversial, has become a focus
      for medical and legal debate involving both significant
      support and pressure groups,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      and a rapidly growing body of medical and legal
      literature.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> This paper
      considers the legality of infant circumcision in English law,
      both in the context of established doctrines of family and
      criminal law, and under the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a>. A number of assumptions
      underpin this paper, which need to be outlined before moving
      on to discussion of the substantive English law.</p>

      <p class="justify">Firstly, that specificity, including
      specificity in nomenclature, assists analysis. Nomenclature
      remains contentious in this area, in part due to petitio
      principii, and in part due to a desire to use a general term
      encompassing procedures carried out upon the genitals of both
      males and females. It is extremely difficult to identify
      common procedures between the genders,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> however, because they are carried out
      on the genitals.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Some writers
      have sought to identify equivalent procedures by recourse to
      hypotheticals, but even these are flawed. Bashir, for
      instance, argues that "[t]here are several forms of [female
      genital mutilation] which may vary in severity but always
      result in irreversible damage to the clitoris and the
      consequent loss of tactile sensation and ability to achieve
      orgasm. [It] would only be similar to male circumcision if
      the penis were amputated".<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The
      impact of such an amputation on potential fertility without
      medical intervention would seem greater than in even the mast
      extensive procedure carried out on females, while placing the
      ability to achieve orgasm solely in the penis may
      over-simplify some male sexualities. Even if an anatomical
      equivalence could be identified, the gendered context of the
      different procedures carried out on males, subincision and
      superincision are uncommon in the English jurisdiction and
      "removal of the foreskin or prepuce"<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> is generally equated with
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> That procedure,
      and that procedure only, is the subject matter of this
      paper.</p>

      <p class="justify">Secondly, that any religious motivation
      behind the procedure needs to be engaged with. A common theme
      in the broader literature is to refer to genital procedures
      upon female children as "customary"<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> or traditional, with "no basis
      whatsoever in any religion".<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      This can include, as part of a broader counter to
      justifications for the procedures, rejecting sincere
      religious arguments as inauthentic either on the basis that
      they are not a true representation of the religious system
      being discussed, effectively heretical, or that if they are a
      true representation, the system itself is unauthentic because
      it acts "as an instrument of fear oppression and
      exploitation".<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Both
      strategies profoundly misunderstand the positions of
      religious interests in a pluralist society - the State does
      not have the capacity to decide what the 'true' form of a
      particular religion is, or proceed on the basis that the
      substantive content of a particular religious system excludes
      it from the category of religion. It is more honest and
      respectful of religious difference, albeit uncomfortable for
      a liberal analyst, to conclude that a particular religious
      practice should be suppressed. The discussion that follows
      proceeds on the basis that circumcision is capable of raising
      religious interests.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">Thirdly, that infants are in a different
      position from adults where circumcision is concerned. The
      English legal order distinguishes between the rights of
      adults and the rights of children over their own bodies, for
      instance in relation to tattooing.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Adults responsible for their own
      well-being can make decisions even over radical bodily change
      such as gender reassignment surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> while in the last resort the courts
      can exercise authority to override the evaluation of a child
      and compel them to undergo, or abstain from, bodily change.
      This sharp difference in approach is due to a judgment that
      children lack the experience and capacity to make some
      decisions in a fully autonomous and informed way. A
      consequence of this is that the courts can be required to
      determine the best interests of the child in a way which does
      not arise for competent adults. As well as looking to
      capacity, there is an argument that some changes to a child's
      body are essentially irreversible, and result in an
      imposition on the future adult the child will become.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Although this argument can be
      overstated, it is an important one, and another reason for
      distinguishing between adults and children. Additionally,
      this paper restricts discussion to infants, rather than
      emcompass older children, whose increasing autonomy may
      involve their exercise of contemporaneous religious and other
      rights.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">Bearing these three principles in mind,
      the next section discusses the English law relating to the
      removal of the foreskin from infants and young children.</p>

      <h3>The English Law</h3>

      <p class="justify">General criminal offences of main,
      wounding and grievous bodily harm clearly prohibit such
      serious surgery taking place without the consent of the
      individual, or their parents.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      In some circumstances, however, even an operating consent
      will not suffice to exclude the operation of the criminal
      law.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Lord Templeman assumed
      in Brown that circumcision was not prohibited in the criminal
      law, but this was uncritical obiter dicta.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Later the Law Commission indicated
      that "male circumcision is lawful under English common
      law",<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> but recommended that
      the lawfulness of male circumcision on infants and children
      in accordance with the Jewish and Muslim religions should be
      put beyond doubt.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> In its 1996
      guidance to doctors, the BMA noted that religiously motivated
      circumcision was assumed to be lawful, and that this
      assumption had never been challenged.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> The BMA indicated that an adult who
      later objected to having the procedure would have no recourse
      against a competent circumcision, so long as parental consent
      had been obtained.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> Parental
      consent was a key concern in such cases:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">"The BMA
          strongly recommends that either the written consent of
          both parents, or of the person with parental
          responsibility be obtained for circumcision . . . Doctors
          should be aware of potential difficulties if both parents
          do not follow the same cultural tradition. A case raised
          with the BMA concerned a GP who circumcised, without any
          enquiry, a baby unknown to him but who parents were, in
          fact, unmarried and estranged. The child's father had
          taken the baby without the mother's permission, fully
          aware that the procedure would be completely contrary to
          her wishes and that he had no legal right to consent. The
          mother made a formal complaint about the doctor
          concerned."<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="justify">A conflict between a Muslim father,
      seeking circumcision of his five year old son, and a
      non-Muslim mother opposed to such circumcision, formed the
      basis for <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/"><cite>Re
      J</cite></a>,<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> the only
      decision dealing with religiously motivated circumcision in
      the English courts. Before hearing the case, which was a
      hearing on a specific issue order for circumcision, Wall J
      had already identified it as raising points of general
      interest and likely to go to appeal. His extensive
      consideration of the issues was later endorsed by the Court
      of Appeal as "impregnable",<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>
      and merits discussion at length.</p>

      <p class="justify">In relation to the foundations identified
      earlier, Wall J's judgment is a strong one. Firstly, early in
      his judgment Wall J specifically identifies the procedure to
      be carried out for religious purposes, rather than to treat a
      medical condition,<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> but
      performed by a qualified medical practitioner using a general
      anaesthetic.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> It may be
      therefore, that this specificity excludes traditions which do
      not make use of pain-killing techniques, or where the
      procedure is carried out by religious rather than medical
      specialists. He also distinguishes the procedure from illegal
      procedures carried out on female children,<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> and embeds the case in the male
      gender, for instance by the use he makes of the linkage
      between the father and his son.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> Secondly, Wall J explicitly
      recognises the religious motivation of the father, even
      though he identified him as someone who did not practise his
      religion, or mix in Muslim circles.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> In may be that this recognition was
      assisted by the existence of a corpus of Islamic law,<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> but Wall avoids identifying this
      corpus with the beliefs of the father, concentrating on the
      latter.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> Thirdly, the entire
      case is predicated upon the need for the court to assess the
      best interests of the child where the parents are in
      conflict.</p>

      <p class="justify">Turning to the substance of the decision,
      it may usefully be divided into three separate findings --
      firstly that circumcision of children for religious purposes
      was potentially lawful; secondly, that it could be authorised
      by the parents operating in concert without a detailed
      analysis of best interests; and thirdly, that, having been
      called upon to determine the best interests of this
      particular child because of parental conflict, the court
      considered that circumcision would not be in the best
      interests, and so should not be carried out.</p>

      <p class="justify">On the first finding, if Wall J had
      concluded that religiously motivated circumcision could never
      be lawful, this would have been conclusive to resolve the
      issue before him, and thus his finding on possible lawfulness
      constitutes part of the ratio decidendi of this case. This
      key part of the decision was very brief, and is based
      primarily on an uncritical acceptance of the Law Commission
      report noted above.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">On the second finding, a technical reading
      of the judgment could conclude that, as the parents in the
      case were not concurring, his further statement that, as the
      parents could combine together to authorise such circumcision
      was obiter dicta. Similarly, his suggestion that because of
      the irrevocable nature of circumcision where the parents were
      in dispute, or a local authority had parental responsibility
      for the child, the matter should be referred to the court for
      resolution was not essential to the decision.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> The issue of who can consent for the
      child leads Wall J to an unusual position. Moving smoothly
      from a situation posited by the medical profession where the
      mother had parental responsibility, but the father did not,
      Wall inferred a maternal veto, albeit one which can be
      overridden.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> This does not
      appear based on a sound consideration of the issues, so it is
      perhaps fortunate that this concept does not appear to have
      significantly affected the judgment.</p>

      <p class="justify">On the third finding, having determined
      that he was required to determine the best interests of the
      particular child, Wall J found that a review of medical
      opinion suggested a lack of consensus on whether circumcision
      was a health benefit or a detriment,<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> and he preferred to highlight social
      factors.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> The father's case
      for circumcision was primarily that of identity --
      circumcision would give the child his proper identity as a
      Muslim, and reinforce his relationship with his
      father.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> The mother's case was
      that the child did not have a Muslim identity, and that the
      procedure carried small but definite medical and
      psychological risks.<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> In
      finding for the mother, Wall J was particularly influenced by
      a number of factors -- the child's essentially secular
      upbringing, making his circumcision exceptional rather than
      necessary to fit in with family and peers; the irreversible
      nature of the procedure; the small but definite physical and
      psychological risks; the youth of the child, making him able
      to experience the discomfort of the procedure without
      appreciating its purpose; and the opposition of the
      residential parent to the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> Wall J acknowledged that, in some
      cases, the courts would probably order circumcision against
      the wishes of one parent in the best interest of the child.
      From the example he gives, the social context seems pivotal
      to the issue -- a child whose family or peers are circumcised
      is more likely to be circumcised.</p>

      <p class="justify">Wall J briefly considers the possible
      impact of the <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
       target="_blank">European Convention on Human Rights</a> upon
      incorporation through the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a>. The discussion is
      restricted to the lawfulness of restricting circumcision in
      fractured families, where parental interests clash, rather
      than considering where allowing circumcision per se
      constitutes a violation of the Convention.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">In the Court of Appeal,<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> the father's arguments in favour of
      the circumcision of the child were that Wall J had erred in
      focussing on the child's religious upbringing, which was
      non-Islamic, rather than on the child's religion, which under
      Islamic law was Muslim;<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> that
      too much weight was given to the mother's arguments against
      circumcision, and too little to the father's arguments in
      favour, particularly on medical issues;<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> and that the court had set too hard
      a burden on contested circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> Given that the appeal was brought by
      the father seeking circumcision, it is unsurprising that the
      essential lawfulness of circumcision was not challenged. All
      the submissions were rejected very briefly in the leading
      judgment by Thorpe, L.J., who also noted that these cases
      could be avoided if the father's community practised
      circumcision on very young infants rather than on older
      children,<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> a point which had
      already been picked up by some Muslims.<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup> The Court as a whole chose to
      endorse an element of the judgment which was not, however;
      contested at appellate level. The point is made most clearly
      in the judgment of Butler-Sloss P who referred to:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">"a small group
          of important decisions &hellip; which, in the absence of
          agreement of those with parental reponsibility, ought not
          to be carried out or arranged by a one-parent carer
          although she has parental responsibility &hellip; Such a
          decision ought not to be made without the specific
          approval of the court. Sterilisation is an example
          &hellip; [circumcision] is irreversible, and should only
          be carried out when the parents together approve of it
          or, in the absence of parental agreement, where a court
          decides that the operation is in the best interest of the
          child"<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3><cite>Re J</cite> in Broader Contexts</h3>

      <p class="justify">Although <cite>Re J</cite> dealt with a
      very specific issue, it represents the confluence of two
      broader bodies of law -- the criminal law relating to
      offences against the person, and the family law relating to
      exercise of parental responsibility over infants. As this
      paper suggest below, this confluence produces some important
      tensions. Additionally, the placing of Re J in both bodies of
      law provides a basis for critique.</p>

      <p class="justify">As discussed above, there have been a
      number of assertions that circumcision is potentially lawful,
      given the presence of suitable consent. The issue of consent
      for infants is turned to below. It may be argued, however,
      that the level of physical change caused by circumcision
      cannot be consented to on non-therapeutic grounds, either by
      the individual or, more relevantly, by a parent on behalf of
      an infant. This would have the consequence of bringing
      circumcision with in the ambit of offences against the
      person, including the special offence under the Children and
      Young Persons Act 1933 s. 1(1). The court could not authorise
      a procedure which constituted a criminal offence, so <cite>Re
      J</cite> includes a finding that it is possible to consent to
      circumcision. In doing so, neither court considered the
      important case of <cite>Adesanya</cite>.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> In that case a Yoruban was convicted
      of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. She had used a
      razor blade to produce scarification on the cheeks of her
      fourteen and nine year old sons, in accordance with the
      practices of her community. Initially, the case seems to have
      strong implications for circumcision -- in both cases "the
      singular cut both entails an alliance&hellip;, and erects a
      boundary. It enacts both identity and difference".<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">The trial judge distinguished between this
      form of scarification and circumcision by reference to the
      potential for serious harm, for instance injury to the eye,
      if the child is moved during the procedure. This does not
      seem a strong ground circumcision, as circumcision carries
      with it a number of health risks ranging from minor,
      transient damage with accompanying pain and suffering,
      through a range of complications,<sup><a
      href="#n52">51</a></sup> to accidental amputation of the
      penis. In an important commentary, Poulter suggested three
      further grounds for justifying <cite>Adesanya</cite> which,
      if a sound distinction between scarification and
      circumcision, may support the lawfulness of the
      latter.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> Firstly, that a minor
      who consents to such an act may come to regret it in later
      life. If the irrevocable nature of scarification explains why
      it cannot be consented to by, or presumbably for, children,
      it may be argued that circumcision is similarly
      irrevocable.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> Secondly, that
      the decline in observance of the practice in the traditional
      territory of the Yoruban people requires less respect for the
      practice in England. It is arguable that Poulter's approach
      consistently emphasises ethnicity over individual religious
      rights,<sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup> and that a closer
      focus on individual rights would place less emphasis on the
      number of practitioners of a particular religious
      manifestation, whether in the jurisdiction or globally. There
      is, in any case, some evidence for suggesting that some
      members of groups traditionally practicing circumcision
      almost universally have discontinued the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup> Thirdly, that certain explicit
      exceptions granted by the legislature. No such exception
      exists for religiously motivated circucision.</p>

      <p class="justify">It is perhaps possible to distinguish
      between scarification and circumcision on grounds of utility
      and visibility.<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> It seems true
      that facial scarification has an element of general
      visibility in the public domain which is lacking in relation
      to circumcision, and it could be argued that the intimate
      nature of circumcision makes it less pervasive in the male's
      social life. This would receive some support from the
      restriction upon tattooing of minors.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> A number of better developed
      arguments have been put forward suggesting that religious
      circumcision confers a number of incidental health and
      physical benefits.<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> The
      significance of these arguments is not that they establish
      the procedure as a medical one, but that they serve to offset
      any health or secular disbenefit produced by the religiously
      motivated procedure. If the courts were prepared to accept at
      least some of these arguments they may provide a sound basis
      for distinguishing circumcision from scarification, which it
      has not been argued confers any special health benefits.
      Although accepting that arguments over such benefits were
      currently taking place,<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup>
      neither Wall J nor the BMA have been prepared to accept the
      arguments as proven. Accordingly, this does not seem a good
      ground to distinguish <cite>Adesayna</cite>. Identifying an
      inconsistency does not, however, mean that Re J was wrong, It
      may indicate, instead, that Adesanya was mistaken, and that
      parents can carry out facial scarification. If this is the
      case, a fuller consideration of the issues raised would have
      been appropriate, even in the contexts of a family law case,
      as opposed to a criminal prosecution.</p>

      <p class="justify">Turning to family law, in <cite>Re
      J</cite>, it was accepted at an early stage in the judgment
      that parents could agree together to consent to circumcision,
      but that consent where this consensus was absent would
      require the intervention of the court.<sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup> Normally, an individual with
      parental responsibility may act alone in discharging that
      responsibility,<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> so the
      requirement for consensus might be seen as a limit on this
      particular form of physical change. Although placed in the
      same category as sterilisation, the cases indicate that
      non-therapeutic sterilisation always requires the consent of
      the court regardless of parental agreement. Thus, this
      restriction is less than that on sterilisation,<sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup> perhaps due to the lesser impact of
      the procedure, the absence of eugenic concerns or, to be
      pragmatic, the considerably larger number of circumcisions
      the courts would be called upon to consider. The scope of
      this restriction is unclear -- must the courts be called upon
      in the absence of agreement between two individuals with
      parental responsibility, or only in the presence of
      disagreement. If we give a primary role to consent, as would
      follow from criminal law, we might argue that only a dyadic
      self-contradiction by the decision makers requires a court
      intervention. If we give a primary role to the quality of the
      decision making process by which the interests of the child
      are to be advanced, however, we might argue that the consent
      of two individuals closely entwined with the interests of the
      child are needed for such an irrevocable step. Where more
      than one individual has parental responsibility, either
      formulation produces the same result, but the former would
      seem more apt to allow an individual with sole parental
      responsibility to consent without approval of the court.
      Similarly, by analogy with the sterilisation cases,
      circumcision for therapeutic reasons may not fall within this
      restriction.<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">An obvious question is whether this
      consent is always operative, or must meet particular
      criteria. In particular, whose interests are to be taken into
      account when deciding whether to consent, and how are those
      interests to be evaluated?</p>

      <p class="justify">In our scenario there seems to be at least
      four individuals or groups which might be seen as benefiting
      from the circumcision: the infant, their parents, their
      religious community, or their deity or deities. Potential
      benefits for the infant have been discussed above. The
      parents might be considered to benefit through satisfaction
      of their religious duties -- a point stressed in relation to
      the Islamic father in <cite>Re J</cite>. The religious
      community might be seen to benefit by the continuation of a
      strong marker of group identity. Finally, the deity or
      deities for when the circumcision is being carried out might
      be seen to benefit from this obediance. Serious evidential
      problems exist in ascertaining benefits to a religious
      community. Arguments based on the interests of deities are
      unlikely to be deployed in the plural legal system, no matter
      how strong a role they may place in the life of the decision
      makers.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup> In any case, it seems
      that despite the possible existence of some parent-centred
      parental rights,<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> parental
      rights exist primarily to benefit the child,<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> and those acting for the child can
      only give their consent provided that the intervention is for
      the benefit of the child,"<sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup>
      although Bridge has argued compellingly that the courts allow
      doctors to impose a certain level of risk on a child "for the
      purposes of conceding to the religious wishes [of the
      parents]".<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> For instance, if
      parents agreed together for their infant to be circumcised
      because they wished to watch a circumcision, or to win a bet,
      this would seem insufficient. Those with parental
      responsibility "have power to consent to non-therapeutic
      procedures insofar as they are for the benefit of the child",
      or benefit others without causing more than a minimal
      detriment to the child.<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">Secondly, the courts have not accepted
      that the parents' assessment of the child's best interests
      must be approved uncritically when considering physical
      change. Allowing a degree of latitude to parents,
      particularly over mundane, routine matters,<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> by requiring them to act to benefit
      the child, even though the courts might have come to a
      different conclusion as to their best interests, the courts
      have indicated that the parents' perceptions can be
      wrong.<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup> In relation to
      sterilisation, for instance, in <cite>Re</cite> D
      <cite>(Sterilisation)</cite><sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>
      the court exercised its wardship power to prohibit
      sterilisation of an eleven year old, despite the wishes of
      her widowed mother.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">Thus, while requiring parental agreement
      constitutes a limit on the practice, the uncritical
      endorsement of a joint parental decision to circumcise seems
      to give an unusual degree of latitude to parents considering
      this procedure. It may be, however, that the court in
      <cite>Re</cite> J did not mean to suggest that parental
      decision making could take into account issues other than the
      best interest of the child, or was immune from challenge
      before the courts, simply that consent to circumcision was a
      parental responsibility which could be exercised.
      Alternatively, the court may have recognised that allowing
      parents to decide this matter for themselves largely takes
      the legal system out of the equation. As Brazier notes in a
      different context:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">"who will ever
          know what happened? Only if some interested third party
          intervenes will the matter reach the light of day in time
          to prevent the procedure going ahead"<sup><a
          href="#n74">74</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Impact of the Human Rights Act</h3>

      <p class="justify">It has been suggested that a number of
      international instruments, including the United Nations <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> and the <a
      href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm"
      target="_blank">Convention against Torture</a>, prohibit
      non-therapeutic circumcision.<sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup>
      In particular, if such circumcision is contrary to the <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
       target="_blank">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, the
      coming into force of the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> could result in the
      extension of the assault provisions in the Offences Against
      the Person Act, and the Children and Young Persons Act 1933
      to cover circumcision of infants with parental
      consent.<sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">The most potent challenge to circumcision
      would come from a finding that it consituted torture,
      inhuman, or degrading treatment contrary to Article 3. Unlike
      other convention rights, a restriction on Article 3 cannot be
      explicitly justified by reference to social needs or the
      rights and interests of others.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup> Feldman has argued that, if inhuman
      treatment can occur in the absence of degrading treatment,
      then circumcision falls within the ambit of Article 3 as
      inhuman treatment.<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup> There are
      a number of grey areas in relation to Article 3 which may
      serve to exclude many circumcisions from its ambit. Firstly,
      it has been suggested that Article 3 may only limit State
      action, rather than requiring the State to intervene between
      private individuals.<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup> In the
      recent case of <cite>A v United Kingdom</cite>,<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> however, the court found that
      "[c]hildren and other vulnerable individuals, in particular,
      are entitled to State protection, in the form of effective
      deterrence, against such serious breaches of personal
      integrity".<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup> Secondly, the
      role of consent in Article 3 has not been made explicit. The
      cases concerning corporal punishment of children, however,
      suggest that parental consent to the treatment of a child
      will not exclude the operation of Article 3,<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> although an individual may receive
      non-consensual treatment to preserve their physical and
      mental health.<sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup> Thirdly, to
      constitute inhuman treatment, ill treatment must meet a
      certain threshold of severity. Although the cases indicate
      that the level of physical change involved in circumcision
      would meet this threshold,<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup>
      the nature and context of the complained behaviour is
      relevant.<sup><a href="#n84">85</a></sup> Finally, as Feldman
      points out, there is some difficulty in arguing that
      circumcision is degrading treatment, in the sense that it
      humiliates or debases.<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup> If
      younger children are less likely to be debased or humiliated
      by conduct, as <cite>Costello-Roberts v UK</cite><sup><a
      href="#n87">87</a></sup> suggests, it may be particularly
      difficult to argue that an infant is degraded by
      circumcision. If inhuman treatment is an aggravated form of
      degrading treatment, this may prevent recourse to Article
      3.</p>

      <p class="justify">These uncertainties, together with a
      reluctance by the Court and Commission to deal with
      applications under Article 3, make it more likely that
      circumcision will be resolved by reference to some other
      Convention right, probably Article 8.<sup><a
      href="#n88">88</a></sup> Article 8 provides a right to
      respect for private and family life, which may be interfered
      with only in accordance with the law, and when necessary in a
      democratic society for national security, public safety, the
      economic well-being of the country, the prevention of
      disorder or crime, the protection of the rights and freedoms
      of others.<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> The right to
      private life includes rights to physical and moral integrity
      of the person, prohibiting minor infringments on physical
      autonomy such as the taking of blood and urine
      samples.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup> This can require the
      state to provide deterrence, through criminal sanctions, for
      third party violations by, for instance, sexual assault by a
      private individual.<sup><a href="#n91">91</a></sup> It would
      seem unlikely that parental authorisation <cite>ipso
      facto</cite> excludes an infringement from the scope of
      Article 8, as this would allow parents to authorise
      themselves to commit, for instance, sexual assaults upon
      their children. While a consent to medical treatment for a
      child unable to consent would be covered by the same
      principles discussed above, it seems that non-therapeutic
      circumcision would fail to be justified by reference to
      interests other than those of the child.</p>

      <p class="justify">Of the acceptable grounds, the most likely
      seems to be the rights and interests of others -- in
      particular, of the parents and the religious community of
      which they are a part. A parental wish to have their son
      circumcised might fall within Article 9 as a manifestation of
      religious belief, although Feldman disagrees with this
      approach as "the beliefs in question are those of the
      parents, and one person's religious freedom should not be
      used in order to justify an interference with another
      person's right to bodily integrity.<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup> Although unsupported by the Article
      9 jurisprudence, this seems a potentially valuable limit to
      Article 9 rights. It is more likely that the rights
      identified would themselves emerge from Article 8 -- the
      rights of the child's parents to respect for their family
      life. Family life carries with it the idea of parental
      authority over children, for instance in relation to medical
      treatment,<sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup> which can clash
      with a child's individual autonomy rights.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup> The Convention organs may well be
      reluctant to require, as opposed to allow, the State to make
      decisions for the family.<sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justify">As a final point, it may be argued that a
      range of procedures carried out on females are unlawful by
      statute,<sup><a href="#n96">96</a></sup> and that allowing
      circumcision of males is to discriminate between the genders
      by offering differential levels of protection.<sup><a
      href="#n97">97</a></sup> There are some specific problems
      with this approach notably the restriction on competent
      females under the Act, wheras competent males can opt to be
      circumcised, so that the reach of the Act can be seen as
      discrimination, rather than its exclusion. More
      fundamentally, it was suggested above that the location of
      the procedures makes it extremely difficult to find a
      comparator which will allow us to judge whether
      discrimination has occurred. For this reason,
      non-discrimination does not seem a strong basis for
      challenging the existing law, particularly given the status
      of non-discrimination as a complementary, rather than free
      standing right under the Convention.</p>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>

      <p class="justify">The emphasis on joint parental consent
      allowing circumcision places the involvement of the courts in
      circumcision clearly within the fractured family, where
      parental views as to the child's best interests differ. The
      courts thus appear as intervening only to resolve a dispute
      between parties intimately affected by their decision. The
      courts side with one parent or another -- they do not
      intervene against the adult members of the family in order to
      further their own vision of best practice in child rearing.
      Although the courts are placed clearly within a context of
      competing demands, the strengths and weaknesses of <cite>Re
      J</cite> flow from just this context. Although somewhat trite
      in any legal discussion, an element of particular interest in
      <cite>Re J</cite> is the variety of competitions which
      emerge.</p>

      <p class="justify">The most obvious is between those who
      argue for a prohibition on circumcision, and those who would
      oppose such a prohibition as a form of non-plural
      imperialism. As Chessler observes "[a]ny prohibibition of
      male circumcision will be debated by cultural relativists and
      universalists".<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup> The courts
      have attempted to avoid this debate by entering into
      discussion of circumcision where the child is already between
      traditions -- those of the parent seeking circumcision, and
      the parent opposing circumcision. Although only partly
      successful even here, the tensions would be much more
      exacerbated if, for instance, they reached into an intact
      Muslim family to prevent the child being circumcised. A
      practice regarded as necessary by many members of the Islamic
      and Jewish communties (communties already exposed to racism,
      Islamaphobia and anti-Semitism) would have been shifted from
      a harmless cultural practice on an offence against the
      person. If we regard motive as irrelevant in determining
      child abuse,<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup> so as to include
      a parent seeking to benefit the child through application of
      immoderate and unreasonable chastisement,<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> entire orthodox communities would
      be classified as committing, encouraging, or supporting
      "nonaccidental physical injury"<sup><a
      href="#n101">101</a></sup> to children. It is not impossible
      that the birth of an infant into such a community could
      require a local authority to make enquiry for their well
      being.<sup><a href="#n102">102</a></sup> Even a decision that
      the courts consent was required for every circumcision would
      have led to massive involvement in the religiously motivated
      family arrangements of a significant proportion of the United
      Kingdom population.</p>

      <p class="justify">Another obvious tension, visible in both
      commentary and the decisions of the Courts, is how to
      categorise the particular procedure in question -- is it an
      essentially harmless procedure, or an unnecessarily risky
      operation which, even in the absence of complications, has
      long term adverse effects? In <cite>Re J</cite> the court
      dealt with competing medical evidence by allowing different
      arguments to, in essence, neutralise one another, allowing
      the judges to focus on the social context of the child .
      Presumably, whatever the difference of opinion within the
      medical profession, there is an accurate characterisation of
      the medical impact of circumcision? In the long term, this
      attempt to avoid the medical debate seems neither in the best
      interests of the child, nor intellectually sustainable.</p>

      <p class="justify">The tensions in how we characterise
      circumcision might be seen as, ultimately external to the
      legal process, to be resolved in due course by medical
      knowledge. A further, fundamental, tension is, however, much
      more lawyerly. How are we to characterise the recipient of
      circumcision? Are they a hyper-autonomous individual, a
      holder of rights against the world, or are they an integral,
      organic part of broader communities, both religious and
      familial? This is not a manifestion of the argument as to
      whether circumcising children for community reasons treats
      them as means not ends. We can treat the child as the end,
      but construct circumcision quite differently if we see it as
      something whereby "his culture, religion and family is
      enhanced",<sup><a href="#n103">103</a></sup> as opposed to
      something carried out upon him for the benefit of others.</p>

      <p class="justify">It is a manifestation of this tension
      which produces the final, and perhaps most interesting
      conflict with <cite>Re J.</cite> As argued above, it is
      necessary to find that circumcision with parental consent is
      not criminal assault before it is possible to enter into
      discussions based on the best interests of the child. The
      courts could not avoid becoming entangled with both criminal
      law and family law issues. These distinct areas of law,
      however, do not necessarily carry the same timbre as to the
      characterisation of the individual. It may be argued that
      criminal law represents almost an extreme form of
      individualism within the English legal system, while family
      law has long accommodated a more embedded construction of the
      individual. These competing models cannot, in this scenario,
      remain distinct. The introduction of the <a

      Human Rights Act 1998</a> may provide a route by which these
      different models of the individual compete more
      explicitly.</p>

       <a id="n11" name="n11"></a>11 Much of the current movement
      against circumcision emerges from a context of routine,
      non-religiously motivated circumcision, but is unsympathetic
      to arguments based on religious interests. For a fuller
      identification of different religious interests, see Edge, P
