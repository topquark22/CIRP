      <p class="text2">Male circumcision is as invasive as female
      circumcision. Although complications differ between the two,
      there is a naive and uninformed belief that little boys do
      not suffer, but little girls do--a function of the differing
      roles the sexes are "assumed" to play in society. The extent
      of removal should not make a difference. Neither child asks
      for the abrupt ripping and tearing of his or her genitals.
      Interestingly similar justifications have been advanced for
      each procedure--a further demonstration of the correlation
      between the two abuses.</p>

      <p class="text2">The brutal nature of female circumcision
      makes it too difficult, if not impossible, for Westerners to
      imagine any justification for the act. Practicing communities
      claim to adhere to both cultural values and religious
      doctrine in their continuation of the practice. Deeply
      embedded cultural arguments range from the continuing
      survival of the tribal group to the need for initiation into
      adulthood.<sup><a href="#n132">132</a></sup> Generally,
      identical or similar justifications are given throughout all
      the regions and communities in which female circumcision is
      performed.<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup> Similarly, male
      circumcision is an invasive and umutilating act that has been
      justified for thousands of years. Like female circumcision,
      the procedure has both significant cultural and religious
      justifications. Explanations for the practice range from
      tribal symbol to hygiene. The justifications for male and
      female circumcision vary only with regard to religious
      orientation and asserted medical necessity for the male
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="A" name="A"></a>A. <i>Cultural
      Justification for Female and Male Circumcision</i><sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Female circumcision advocates continue to
      offer several justifications for the practice. The logical
      underpinnings of these justifications are erroneous. Some of
      these reasons include the following: cleanliness;<sup><a
      href="#n135">135</a></sup> genital aesthetics;<sup><a
      href="#n136">136</a></sup> still birth prevention ;<sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup> the promotion of socio-political
      cohesion;<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup> the deterrence of
      female promiscuity<sup><a href="#n139">139</a></sup> by
      virginity preservation;<sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup>
      male sexual enhancement;<sup><a href="#n141">141</a></sup>
      the increasing of marital opportunities;<sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup> health maintenance;<sup><a
      href="#n143">143</a></sup> and fertility enhancement.<sup><a
      href="#n144">144</a></sup> Circumcision opponents contend
      these reasons have no validity; female circumcision is done
      to control women, keeping them subordinate to men.<sup><a
      href="#n145">145</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Like its female counterpart, similar
      cultural justifications are offered in support of male
      circumcision. Male circumcision supporters suggest that
      circumcision improves hygiene,<sup><a
      href="#n146">146</a></sup> increases cosmetic value,<sup><a
      href="#n147">147</a></sup> diminishes sexual desire,<sup><a
      href="#n148">148</a></sup> enhances sexual pleasure,<sup><a
      href="#n149">149</a></sup> increases fertility,<sup><a
      href="#n150">150</a></sup> indicates a tribal identity by
      signifying adulthood,<sup><a href="#n151">151</a></sup> and
      physiological purity,<sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup> or
      demonstrates a sacrifice,<sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup>
      pain endurance,<sup><a href="#n154">154</a></sup> or
      enslavement.<sup><a href="#n155">155</a></sup> These
      justifications, like those provided for female circumcision,
      are inaccurate and insufficient reasons for the continued
      removal of healthy body parts. Just as institutional racism
      and sexism were falsely justified through pseudo-scientific
      "authority" these dubious reasons also serve to perpetuate
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="B" name="B"></a>B. <i>Male
      Circumcision: The Medical Justifications and Medical
      Counterarguments</i></p>

      <p class="text2">The only major difference between the
      justifications offered for male and female circumcision is
      the strong reliance on "medical evidence" supporting the
      justification for male circumcision. Controversy surrounds
      this justification. Of the circumcisions performed in the
      United States, over ninety percent are performed as a medical
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n156">156</a></sup> However,
      "[t]here are few situations in which circumcision is
      justified for medical reasons."<sup><a
      href="#n157">157</a></sup> In the 1970s, both the American
      College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy
      of Pediatrics issued a policy against routine circumcision of
      newborns, stating that there is a lack of medical indications
      for the procedure.<sup><a href="#n158">158</a></sup> Male
      circumcision, however, continues to be linked to the
      prevention of venereal disease, cervical cancer, urinary
      tract infections and penile cancer,<sup><a
      href="#n159">159</a></sup> but "in the absence of well
      designed prospective studies, conclusions regarding the
      relationship of [such diseases or infections to circumcision
      are tentative."<sup><a href="#n160">160</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The latest findings come from a <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/">study</a> published in the
      April 2, 1997, <i>Journal of the American Medical
      Association</i>, in which researchers indicate that there is
      no evidence that circumci sion protects against contracting
      sexually transmitted diseases.<sup><a
      href="#n161">161</a></sup> Edward Laumann, one of the authors
      of the study, states that "[the researchers] were being very
      cautious in reporting those numbers because this is always a
      hot-button issue. . . . The claim has always been that being
      circumcised acted as a prophylactic against getting sexually
      transmitted diseases."<sup><a href="#n162">162</a></sup> Now,
      however, "[t]here doesn't seem to be a powerful medical or
      health reason to do it."<sup><a
      href="#n163">163</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Laumann reports two benefits of the study's
      results. One, that circumcision may reduce sexual
      disfunction.<sup><a href="#n164">164</a></sup> Another, that
      circumcised men engage in a "more elaborate set of sexual
      practices."<sup><a href="#n165">165</a></sup> Although the
      study does not firmly take one side or the other in the
      debate over whether to circumcise, it does make it clear that
      "circumcision offers men little health benefit."<sup><a
      href="#n166">166</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Edgar J. Schoen, a physician with the Kaiser
      Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, California, in an
      article on post-newborn circumcision, contends that newborn
      circumcision benefits a child in the same way a vaccine
      benefits a child.; it is a long-term procedure providing
      constant protection from disease.<sup><a
      href="#n167">167</a></sup> Schoen cites the beneficial effects
      of newborn circumcision, explaining how the benefits have led
      to an increase in post-newborn circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n168">168</a></sup> He argues, however, against male
      circumcision later in childhood, which undermines his
      advocacy of newborn circumcision.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>Although I believe newborn circumcision can be
        strongly recommended on medical grounds, circumcision later
        in childhood is more problematic. In later childhood, the
        greater danger from [urinary tract infections] is past. A
        fully retractable foreskin with good genital hygiene almost
        eliminates the possibility of phimosis and decreases the
        chance of developing local infection and penile
        cancer.<sup><a href="#n169">169</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="text2">Schoen suggests that good hygiene is the
      only necessary measure to reduce the risks involved if a
      newborn is not circumcised. If the medical profession is
      concerned about the benefits of circumcision and the
      prevention of certain infections in adulthood, it is
      contradictory that Schoen would state that the danger of
      urinary tract infection diminishes later in childhood and
      there is, therefore, no need for post-newborn circumcision.
      "<i>Unequivocal proof</i> that lack of circumcision is a risk
      factor for increased urinary tract infection is currently
      unavailable. . . . The behavior change suggested
      (circumcision) is not harmless and therefore cannot be
      recommended with unequivocal proof of benefit."<sup><a
      href="#n170">170</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although there may be a possible causal link
      between circumcision and its "advantages and disadvantages,"
      there is evidence to suggest that medical history,
      socioeconomic factors, and genetics are major factors
      contributing to the general medical trends regarding
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n171">171</a></sup>. The
      correlation between circumcision and lack of subsequent
      penile cancer is one of the biggest arguments put forth in
      favor of circumcision.<sup><a href="#n172">172</a></sup> The
      incidence of penile cancer, however, is a prime example of
      how other factors contribute to or possibly explain the
      trends in the disease. In the case of cancer of the
      penis:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>[t]he overall annual incidence ... in U.S. men has
        been estimated to be 0.7 to 0.9 per 100,000 men and the
        mortality rate is as high as [twenty-five percent]. This
        condition occurs almost exclusively in uncircumcised men.
        In five major reported series since 1932, not one man had
        been circumcised neonatally. The predicted lifetime risk of
        cancer of the penis developing in an uncircumcised man has
        been estimated at 1 in 600 men in the United States; in
        Denmark, the estimate is 1 in 909. In developed countries
        where neonatal circumcision is not routinely performed, the
        incidence of penile cancer is reported to range from 0.3 to
        1.1 per 100,000 men per year. This low incidence is about
        half that found is uncircumcised U.S. men, but greater than
        that in circumcised U.S. men.<sup><a
        href="#n173">173</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>
      These statistics suggest that factors other than circumcision
      cause a greater incidence of penile cancer. 

      <p class="text2">An early study of worldwide distribution of
      penile cancer showed low rates in Israel, "an exclusively
      circumcised male population," and the U.S., "a largely
      circumcised male population."<sup><a
      href="#n174">174</a></sup> In Canada and Europe, countries
      where the practice is sporatic or rare, the rates were just
      as low.<sup><a href="#n175">175</a></sup> This evidence
      illustrates that similar standards of living rather than
      whether a male is circumcised may lead to consistent rates of
      penile cancer.<sup><a href="#n176">176</a></sup> Lower
      standards of living combined with poor hygiene can lead to
      disease and infection. Developing countries which have lower
      standards of living and have the lowest standards of hygiene
      have the highest rates of penile cancer,<sup><a
      href="#n177">177</a></sup> and that is is most common among
      peoples in whom ignorance and poverty combine to maintain
      hygiene at is lowest standard."<sup><a
      href="#n178">178</a></sup> Surgery is unnecessary when
      optimal hygiene is an effective measure in preventing penile
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n179">179</a></sup> The effectiveness
      of hygiene is yet another factor which proves that
      circumcision proponents have not collected data from a broad
      range of the world's population. Male circumcision opponents
      suggest that pro-circumcision data on penile cancer and other
      diseases is not conclusory and the alleged need for the
      procedure is merely a fallacy;<sup><a
      href="#n180">180</a></sup> circumcised boys are not less
      likely to develop health problems as a result of the removal
      of their foreskin.<sup><a href="#n181">181</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>If the medical arguments for circumcision were
        sound, surely we would expect to see other medically
        advanced and technologically sophisticated societies in
        Europe and Japan implementing this practice, or, if not,
        suffering the dire consequences in statistically
        significant numbers which this highly flawed research would
        predict. Neither is true.<sup><a
        href="#n182">182</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>
      Although we may believe that foreskin has no vital
      significance, it does have several important
      functions.<sup><a href="#n183">183</a></sup> The foreskin
      serves as a (sic) integral part of the penis. The intact
      penis does not require special care.<sup><a
      href="#n184">184</a></sup> The penis is self-cleaning as the
      vagina and "smegma is not dirt, but rather `beneficial and
      necessary'"<sup><a href="#n185">185</a></sup> Conversely,
      circumcision has been considered harmful to hygiene as the
      wound demands constant care to avoid infections.<sup><a
      href="#n186">186</a></sup><br />
      <br />

      <p class="text2">Nevertheless, the controversy over the
      alleged health benefits of circumcision continues. The
      American Academy of Pediatrics recently noted that "[n]ewborn
      circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as
      well as disadvantages and risks."<sup><a
      href="#n187">187</a></sup> The word "potential" should be
      noted; its use reiterates, once again, that there is no

      conclusive evidence or data which recommends circumcision out
      of medical necessity. As the debates intensify and
      uncertainty persists, the American Academy of Pediatrics will
      reconsider its neutral position in the latter part of 1997
      and issue a statement to that effect.<sup><a
      href="#n188">188</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="C" name="C"></a>C. <i>"Fitting In":
      Mutilating Children in the Name of Conformity</i></p>

      <p class="text2">There are several motivations for the
      perpetuation of both genital abuses. One of the greatest
      motivations for women and men to continue this practice is
      the fear of losing the moral, psychological, or material
      benefits of belonging.<sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">American parents of baby boys are often
      concerned that their child's penis looks like everyone
      else's,<sup><a href="#n190">190</a></sup> thereby making sure
      it is "aesthetically pleasing."<sup><a
      href="#n191">191</a></sup> Men perpetuate the mutilation of
      their sons. Circumcised father are obsessed with conformity,
      wanting their child's penis also to be circumcised. They
      worry about the social problems an uncircumcised child may
      confront as he matures.<sup><a href="#n192">192</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Women from cultures where female
      circumcision is practiced often defend the damage
      incurred.<sup><a href="#n193">193</a></sup> Actions taken
      against circumcision raise the specter of the invasion and
      humiliation that accompanied colonialism.<sup><a
      href="#n194">194</a></sup> Moreover, criticism from the
      outside is considered less tolerable than criticism coming
      from within a culture.<sup><a href="#n195">195</a></sup>
      "When the demands of conformity conflict with rationality or
      individual need, denial intervenes as a mechanism for
      survival. In this way, man y women [and men] justify their
      own oppression."<sup><a href="#n196">196</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="D" name="D"></a>D. <i>Religious
      Justifications for Female and Male Circumcision: To Mutilate
      in the Name of God.</i><sup><a href="#n197">197</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="D1" name="D1"></a>1. <i>Legitimizing
      Female Circumcision Through Religion: Islam.</i> Adherence to
      religious doctrine, like cultural continuity, is another
      theoretically unsound justification for female circumcision.
      Since several predominately Muslim, African countries
      practice female circumcision, female circumcision is
      generally associated with Islam. In these countries, the
      performance of female circumcision is justified through
      Islam, although the act itself clearly preceded Islam in
      Africa.<sup><a href="#n198">198</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Islamic Law has two main sources, the Qur'an
      and the Hadith. The Qu'ran is the most authoritative source
      of Islamic doctrine, while Hadith is religious
      commentary.<sup><a href="#n199">199</a></sup> The Qur'an is a
      compilation of the words of God as revealed to the Prophet
      Muhammed.<sup><a href="#n200">200</a></sup> The Hadith is a
      collection of the prophet Muhammed's lifetime sayings and
      actions, also referred to as <i>sunna</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n201">201</a></sup> which "confirmed, extended,
      elaborated, explained, and complemented the
      revelation."<sup><a href="#n202">202</a></sup> Religious
      justification may stem from misuse of the word <i>sunna</i>
      in describing one of the types of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n203">203</a></sup> For Muslims, the failure to
      perform an act identified as <i>sunna</i> is
      unacceptable.<sup><a href="#n204">204</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are different sayings of the Prophet
      Muhammad that address female circumcision. There is not,
      however, a single passage in the Qur'an mandating that a
      woman be circumcised.<sup><a href="#n206">206</a></sup> One
      saying of the Prophet Muhammad is: "Cut slightly without
      exaggeration (<i>ikhtafidna wa-la tanhikna</i>), because it
      is more pleasant (ahza) for your husbands."<sup><a
      href="#n207">207</a></sup> This saying, however, like other
      sayings, is not considered <i>sunna</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Generally Orthodox religious scholars do not
      advocate the practice of female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n208">208</a></sup> The Qur'an itself bans the
      alteration of the human body in verse 4:119: "[Satan said, "I
      shall] mislead them and tempt them and order them to slit the
      ears of animals and God's creation."<sup><a
      href="#n209">209</a></sup> Another Qur'anic verse forbids
      followers to harm themselves: "Spend in the way of God, and
      do not seek destruction at your own hands."<sup><a
      href="#n210">210</a></sup> These are just two of the
      scripture-based religious arguments which demonstrate that
      Islamic law does not mandate female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n211">211</a></sup> Moreover, the "transmission" of
      the practice helps to explain why the practice is not
      religiously based.<sup><a href="#n213">213</a></sup> "When
      Islam entered Asia countries from Arabia or Iran, it did not
      carry `female circumcision' with it, but when it was imported
      to Asia through Nile Valley cultures, [female circumcision]
      was a part of it."<sup><a href="#n214">214</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="D2" name="D2"></a>2. <i>Judaism,
      Christianity and Female Circumcision.</i> Besides the Islamic
      justification, it is important to look at other religious
      sects that perform and justify female circumcision. The
      Bible, like the Qur'an, does not mention female
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n215">215</a></sup> There are,
      however, Christian groups in Africa which pe rpetuate female
      circumcision. To accommodate this practice, these groups
      founded churches independent of Western sects of
      Christianity.<sup><a href="#n216">216</a></sup> In an attempt
      to combat Christian missionary condemnation of African
      culture, these groups promote traditional customs and support
      female circumcision as a link to the past.<sup><a
      href="#n217">217</a></sup> Like Islam and Christianity, there
      is no religious doctrine that mandates female circumcision in
      Judaism.<sup><a href="#n218">218</a></sup> Ethiopian Jews,
      are the only known Jews to practice female
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n219">219</a></sup> Female
      circumcision, however, can be interpreted as forbidden by
      Judaism.<sup><a href="#n220">220</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="D3" name="D3"></a>3. <i>Judaism and
      Male Circumcision: The Bible and its Contradictions.</i>
      Unlike its female counterpart, adherence to male circumcision
      is based on religious doctrines. In Judaism, male
      circumcision finds its origins in both oral and written
      tradition.<sup><a href="#n221">221</a></sup> Several passages
      from the Old Testament prescribe the rite which began with
      Abraham.<sup><a href="#n222">222</a></sup> Abraham was
      commanded by God to circumcise himself and his
      offspring.<sup><a href="#n223">223</a></sup> For Jews,
      circumcision is the divine covenant formed between God and
      Israel and God's chosen people.<sup><a
      href="#n224">224</a></sup> A circumcised penis is a symbol of
      identity among Jews; it distinguishes the Jew from the
      non-Jew. It not only signifies the covenant, but also
      signifies a people that have suffered persecution throughout
      the ages.<sup><a href="#n225">225</a></sup> "The precept of
      circumcision is a most major one. Failure to circumcise one's
      son subjects the individual to the penalty of <i>karet</i>,
      or extirpation. The Torah relates that even Moses nearly
      forfeited his life because he was late in fulfilling the
      command of having his son circumcised."<sup><a
      href="#n226">226</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The ritual circumcision always takes place
      on the eighth day following birth.<sup><a
      href="#n227">227</a></sup> If the eighth day falls on the
      Sabbath or Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, the ritual still
      takes place.<sup><a href="#n228">228</a></sup> In order to be
      circumcised, the child must be healthy; the <i>mohel</i> is
      generally the one who determines whether the child can
      undergo the ritual.</p>

      <p class="text2">Aside from the religious rationale that
      circumcision is a God-given command, several other reasons
      for the perpetuation of the practice have been
      advanced.<sup><a href="#n229">229</a></sup> The procedure, in
      the first century, was said by Philo to be performed for
      reasons of cleanliness and health benefits.<sup><a
      href="#n230">230</a></sup> Maimonides, in the twelfth
      century, said that circumcision "counteract[ed excessive
      lust."<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup> The divine
      injunction, however, is the true origin of male circumcision
      in Judaism.<sup><a href="#n232">232</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although religious scholars interpret the
      Old Testament to mandate male circumcision, and mention of
      male circumcision can be found throughout the text,
      significant passages exist which do not support the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n233">233</a></sup> The Bible is
      opposed to body mutilation or deformation.<sup><a
      href="#n234">234</a></sup> Leviticus 19:28 reads: "You shall
      not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print
      any marks upon you: I am the Lord."<sup><a
      href="#n235">235</a></sup> Genesis 1:27 also states, "[s]o
      God created Mankind in his own image, in the image of God, he
      created him."<sup><a href="#n236">236</a></sup> If human
      beings were created in the image of God, it would appear that
      no corrections to the human body are necessary unless the act
      of circumcision signifies a flaw in God's design.<sup><a
      href="#n237">237</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="D4" name="D4"></a>4. <i>Islam and
      Male Circumcision.</i> Islamic circumcision differs slightly
      from Jewish circumcision in that the procedure often occurs
      only after a Muslim boy can recited the entire Qur'an;<sup><a
      href="#n238">238</a></sup> However, the age of the boy varies
      depending upon family and region; the earliest it is ever
      performed is on the seventh day following birth.<sup><a
      href="#n239">239</a></sup> There is no direct mention of
      circumcision in the Qu'ran; however, according to the sayings
      of Muhammad, God tested Abraham, commanding him to circumcise
      himself.<sup><a href="#n240">240</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Most Muslims consider circumcision essential
      and a <i>sunna</i>, an action of the prophet, which indicates
      that all past prophets performed it.<sup><a
      href="#n241">241</a></sup> There are many narrative reports
      which demonstrate that circumcision was a <i>sunna</i> at the
      time of Muhammad.<sup><a href="#n242">242</a></sup> One
      <i>sunna</i> in particular states that when a convert came
      before Muhammad, "Muhammad told him: `Shave off your
      unbelievers hair and be circumcised.'"<sup><a
      href="#n243">243</a></sup> Another report records that
      Muhammad stated that an uncircumcised man could not go on the
      pilgrimage to Mecca.<sup><a href="#n244">244</a></sup>
      Muhammad is also quoted as saying circumcision is a norm
      taught be God to His creation.<sup><a
      href="#n245">245</a></sup> Islamic proponents of male
      circumcision, however, acknowledge that these narrative
      reports are not credible and may not be authentic. Moreover,
      Islam like Judaism, offers several religious arguments
      against circumcision such as banning the alteration of the
      human body.<sup><a href="#n246">246</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="D5" name="D5"></a>5. <i>Christianity
      and Male Circumcision</i>. Christian doctrine is grounded in
      the scripture of both the Old Testament and the <a
      href="/pages/cultural/christian.html">New Testament</a>,
      which states is several sections that circumcision is
      unnecessary.<sup><a href="#n248">248</a></sup> The Old
      Testament may justify the procedure for Christians based upon
      the fact that Jesus was circumcised. Since Jesus is a "most
      perfect being" in Christian theology, Christians themselves
      must be circumcised.<sup><a href="#n249">249</a></sup> Most
      Christian parents in today's society are apt to rely on
      medical justifications rather than religious ones.<sup><a
      href="#n250">250</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although several groups rely on a religious
      justification for female circumcision, none have a strict
      textual doctrine mandating the brutal act. As for male
      circumcision, at least in the Jewish religion, there is
      doctrine, which on its face is supportive, although
      contradicts other areas of Jewish law.<sup><a
      href="#n251">251</a></sup> Such religious justification
      demonstrates that communities are most hesitant "to break
      with age old practices that symbolize the shared heritage of
      a particular ethnic group."<sup><a href="#n252">252</a></sup>
      Be it tradition or religion, neither reason can justify the
      infliction of pain on innocent men, women and children. The
      call for eradication of male circumcision must be made, as it
      has with female circumcision.</p>

        The need to "fit in" is a cultural justification stemming
        from reasons of socio-political cohesion and tribal

        Many of those who practice female circumcision think that
        the glandular secretions of the genitals are foul smelling
        and unclean and that the hand used to cleanse a woman's
        genitals will contaminate anything else she may touch.
        Koso-Thomas, <i>sup ra</i> note 31, at 7.<br />

        Proponents believe that the clitoris could develop into
        male genitalia and should therefore be removed. The organ
        is also considered too ugly to see or touch.

        Circumcision is said to protect a woman's chastity and make
        her a suitable bride. Proof of virginity is often necessary
        for marriage. <i>Id</i>.<br />
         <a id="n141"

        Proponents believe the clitoris is homologous to the penis,
        if left intact, it causes men to be over-excited and to
        prematurely ejaculate. Those holding this belief think men
        should decide when the sexual act ends. In addition, when a
        woman is stitched closed, a man experiences increased
        pleasure due to the narrow opening of her vagina.
        <i>Id</i>.<br />
         <a id="n142"

        It is argued that a woman who reaches puberty will be
        married within one year if circumcised. In certain
        communities, men will not marry women who are not
        circumcised. Koso-Thomas, <i>supra</i> note 31, at 7.<br />

        Many proponents believe that circumcision makes a person
        cleaner, assuming that smegma, the buildup of dead tissue
        under the foreskin, is bad. Romberg, <i>supra</i> note 1,
        at 4. Hygiene, one of the traditional justifications, is
        most likely grounded in the fear of masturbation. It was
        thought that a boy cleasing under the foreskin would learn
        to masturbate, thus leading to insanity or other mental
        illness. Brigman, <i>supra</i> note 52, at 339.<br />
         <a id="n147"
        name="n147"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 147.

         <a id="n148"

        Circumcision is thought to reduce masturbation.
        Wallerstein, <i>supra</i> note 1, at 2. Others think the
        foreskin causes an involuntary erection and its removal
        will counteract excessive lust. Romberg, <i>supra</i> note

        The idea is that circumcision prevents or reduces premature
        ejaculation. Wallerstein, <i>supra</i> note 1, at 2.<br />
         <a id="n150"
        name="n150"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150.
        The idea is that circumcision increases or is necessary for
        fertility. The procedure is often part of fertility
        ceremonies. Romberg, <i>supra</i> note 1, at 8.<br />
         <a id="n151"

        <i>Id</i>. Uncircumcised boys under the age of one have a
        very small increased risk of urinary tract infections
        (UTIs). Urinary tract infections are rare only about one
        percent of infants that are un- circumcised get a UTI. UTIs
        are generally treated with antibiotics. It is also
        important to note that a circumcised infant can still get a
        UTI. Just because the risk may be lower does not mean that
        a circum- cised child is not susceptible to a UTI. Just
        because a risk may be lower does not mean that a
        circumcised child is not susceptible to a UTI. Linda

        Dealer</i>, Aug 8, 1995, at 4E. The medical focus is always
        on American or Jewish men. If there is a medical necessity
        for circumcision, countries as advanced as the United
        States would routinely circumcise their children because if
        it did not, an epidemic proportion of men would die of
        penile cancer.<br />

        <blockquote>
          First it expands to cover the penis which increases by
          fifty percent in diameter and length upon erection.
          Without this extra skin, the skin of the circumcised
          penis is pulled taut when erect and sometimes is bowed,
          causing discomfort during erection or intercourse.
          Secondly, the foreskin protects the glans (the head of
          the penis), In infancy it shields the glans from
          contamination of urine and feces, and throughout life, it
          maintains the glans as the internal organ it was meant to
          be. Without the foreskin the sensitive mucous membrane of
          the glans becomes dried up and is keratinized, a process
          of unnatural thickening that occurs and lessens
          sensitivity. Thirdly, because the foreskin represents one
          third or more of the most erogenous tissue of the penis,
          having a greater concentration of fully developed,
          complex nerve endings than the glans, the pleasurable
          function of this delicate tissue is lost. Finally, the
          presence of the foreskin facilitates pleasurable
          intercourse by increasing sensitivity and enhancing the
          pleasure dynamic of the couple. Altering form inevitably
          alters function.

          Just as smegma is produced under the male foreskin, it is
          also produced under the clitoral foreskin and may come in
          contact with the female's urethra, vagina, cervix, and
          rectum. For that matter, since the penis may come in
          contact with female smegma during coitus, female smegma
          could be blamed for causing prostatic and penile cancer.
