      <p class="text2">Male and female circumcisions are performed
      differently. Rarely, however, does either involve the use of
      anesthesia. Instead, the victim suffers tremendous pain from
      the invasive and inhuman act of pulling and slashing off his
      or her genitalia. The resulting complications differ between
      the two procedures, but both male and female circumcision
      have drastic physical and psychological consequences.</p>

      <p><a id="A" name="A"></a>A. <i>Female Circumcision
      (Infibulation, Clitoridectomy, Sunna):<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The History, Procedures, and
      Complications</i></p>

      <p class="text2">Female Circumcision is a practice dating
      back to antiquity.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Several
      ancient cultures, including the Phoenicians, Hittites, and
      ancient Egyptians, practiced the act.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Female circumcision was, and still
      is for some groups. a symbol of distinction. enslavement and
      even subjugation.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Originating
      in Egypt, the practice of female circumcision migrated from
      the Red Sea coastal tribes to Arab traders and then to
      eastern Sudan.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are several traditional practices and
      techniques of female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Generally female circumcision
      entails the incision and removal of all or part of a woman's
      external genitalia.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> Female
      circumcision may be "minor" in form, a painful prick of the
      clitoris, or "major" in form, the cutting and removal of all
      genitalia.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> The act is
      frequently performed on infants, although it is most commonly
      performed on girls four to six years old, depending upon a
      community's cultural norm.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      Other groups may wait until the girl reaches adolescence, or
      marrying age to perform the circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Female circumcision can take three
      forms:<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> infibulation,<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> clitoridectomy<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> and sunna.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> Infibulation is considered the most
      severe form of female circumcision while sunna is generally
      viewed as the least severe form of excision.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> The operations have usually been
      performed by traditional birth attendants and, in more recent
      years, by traditional surgeons and trained midwives.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> The practitioner's medical training,
      however varies by community and region.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> Procedures are performed with a
      variety of available instruments,<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> although most surgical instruments
      are crude and unsanitary.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Regardless of the patients age, the method
      used, or the type of practitioner, female circumcision
      results in physical and psychological complications.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> The procedures have both immediate
      and long-term effects. Common short-term complications<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup> include bleeding,<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> infection,<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> pain,<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> urine retention,<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> stress and shock,<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> damage to the urethra or
      anus,<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> and keloid
      scarring.<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> Long-term
      complications<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> include
      repeated urinary tract infections, urethra and bladder
      stones, keloid scarring and dermoid cysts.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup> Infibulated women are often cut and
      restitched several times throughout their lives, resulting in
      additional physical complications and health risks.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> Besides these physical effects,
      women experience both sexual<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup>
      and psychological effects from circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> Some of the psychological
      complications include anxiety, melancholy, and depression, as
      well as frigidity and insatiability.<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> Often, however, psychological
      complications may not appear until years after the
      precipitating event.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup></p>

      <p><a id="B" name="B"></a>B. <i>Routine Infant Male
      Circumcision: The History, Procedures,<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Complications</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Hebrew patriarch Abraham's covenant with
      God is said to be the first written account of male
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> The Old
      Testament's account, however, is preceded by pictorial
      narratives on ancient Egyptian tombs and temples.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> Even six thousand year old Egyptian
      mummies show evidence of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> Some historians speculate that the
      practice dates back 5,000 years to the native tribes of the
      African west coast, while others postulate that the practice
      evolved in the Stone Age.<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup>
      Like female circumcision, however, there is no precise date
      as when the procedure of cutting the foreskin actually
      began.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are four types of male circumcision:
      (1) simple circumcision or routine infant circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup> which is the removal of the foreskin
      or prepuce; (2) subincision<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup>
      which is simple circumcision followed by a slitting of the
      penis to expose the glans; (3) salkh<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> which entails the skin being flayed
      from just below the navel to the upper thigh; and
      superincision<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> "which involves
      longitudinally cutting the preputium from the upper surface
      and extending the cut to the pubic region."<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> Simple circumcision (routine infant
      circumcision) as practiced in most parts of the world differs
      from certain types of female circumcision in that it does
      involve the removal of all genitalia.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The penis, like a woman's genitalia is
      formed at birth without the need for alteration or
      "improvement." The male and female embryological structures,"
      consisting of "similar cell and nerve tissues."<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> An uncircumcised penis consists of
      the shaft,<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> the glans or
      rounded head at the end, the sulcus,<sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup> the meatus,<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup> and the foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup> Male circumcision is the removal of
      the entire foreskin, which consists of two layers of tissue
      covering the entire delicate glans.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup> The traditional method of removal
      can be performed in a number of ways. The two most common
      techniques are direct surgery<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup>
      and the squeezing technique.<sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In both procedures, presurgery preparation
      involves restraining the infant and sterilizing the
      genitals.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup> In most cases no
      anesthesia is used.<sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup> The
      foreskin must be separated from the glans before the
      procedure; sometimes this is done forcibly.<sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup> In direct surgery, the foreskin is
      held in a clamp away from the glans while</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>[o]ne blade of a scissor (or a scapel) is inserted
        between the foreskin and glans and the foreskin is cut
        along its full length .... The incision is spread apart to
        expose the glans. Then using a scapel or scissors, the
        foreskin is completely cut off close to the groove.<sup><a
        href="#n69">69</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If there is any bleeding, it is controlled by applying
      pressure to the area.<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> This
      procedure takes only about five minutes and is most often
      used or adolescent and adult circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The two methods used in the squeezing
      technique are the Gomco clamp<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>
      and the plastic bell.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> Both
      procedures involve the literal squeezing of the foreskin for
      its removal.<sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup> The Gomco clamp
      procedure usually lasts about ten minutes, while the plastic
      bell technique takes five or ten days.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> The method chosen generally depends
      on the physician; all procedures are considered
      "satisfactory," but each has its complications.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Judaism, neither of these procedures is
      used; the act is ceremonial, generally practiced outside of
      the hospital.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> In a ritual
      circumcision, there are three phases: "meelah (the surgical
      removal of the foreskin), periah (the tearing of the genital
      membrane underneath the foreskin, back to the corona), and
      metizitzah (suction)."<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup> Blood
      must be drawn in every circumcision and therefore the third
      phase is "usually of distinctive interest."<sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup> Originally, the mohel sucked the
      blood himself from the infant's penis; however alternative
      procedures were devised in response to the transmission of
      diseases in the latter part of the nineteenth century and the
      early part of the twentieth century.<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> More sanitary methods for suctioning
      now involve using a cotton swab or a small glass tube to draw
      out the blood.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup> After the
      suctioning of blood, a sterile dressing is applied to the
      penis and the newborn is wiped in a diaper.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some of the complications of male
      circumcision are meatal ulceration,<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup> hemorrhaging,<sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup> infection,<sup><a
      href="#n85">85</a></sup> retention of the plastic bell
      ring,<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup> concealed penis,<sup><a
      href="#n87">87</a></sup> urethral fistula,<sup><a
      href="#n88">88</a></sup> urinary retention,<sup><a
      href="#n89">89</a></sup> glans necrosis,<sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup> injury and loss of glans,<sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup> excessive skin loss,<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup> skin bridge,<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup> and preputial cysts.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup> Meatal ulceration occurs as a result
      of ammonia from urine burning an infants exposed
      glans.<sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup> An ulcer, covered by a
      crust, can be anywhere from 2 millimeters in depth to more
      than 5 millimeters wide.<sup><a href="#n96">96</a></sup> When
      a plastic bell ring is used to remove the foreskin, the
      foreskin should dry and fall off with the ring.<sup><a
      href="#n97">97</a></sup> Retention of the plastic ring is a
      result of the failure of the ring to fall off, becoming
      buried under the skin.<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup> This
      is extremely painful and the cosmetic results are
      horrific.<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup> Moreover, as a
      result of circumcision, a fistula, an abnormal opening of the
      body, may occur on the underside of the penis from
      "accidental crushing of the urethra by the circumcision
      clamp, an abnormality in the urethra, or from a stitch placed
      in the underside of the penis to control excessive bleeding
      at the site of the frenulum."<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> In addition, when too much skin is
      removed during circumcision, the result is devastating since
      the newborn's penis is very tiny and its future growth is
      indeterminable.<sup><a href="#n101">101</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Most complications that accompany male
      circumcision occur infrequently. The risks, however, are
      relatively great given that the procedures are considered
      easy to perform.<sup><a href="#n102">102</a></sup> There is a
      ninety to ninety-five percent chance that a circumcision will
      heal rapidly with little bleeding or infection.<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup> Although most complications that
      occur are easy to resolve, many result in extreme or
      disastrous consequences such as pain, trauma, psychological
      ill effects, lifelong mutilation,<sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup> and death.<sup><a
      href="#n105">105</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>When viewed in terms of percentages--the fact that
        some of the complications occur in one out of several
        hundred or thousand infant circumcisions--the risks seen
        insignificant. But when viewed in terms of individuals and
        families involved in these tragic events--particularly when
        the operation is unnecessary--the risks seem quite
        significant.<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Besides the physical complications, male
      circumcision, most often performed with no anesthesia,
      results in pain and psychological trauma. The theory that the
      procedure results in pain was questioned in the past, but
      there is no longer any doubt that newborns suffer great pain
      any psychological stress.<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup>
      Many physicians support the use of local anesthesia because
      "[i]f neonatal circumcisions are . . . performed, the should
      be done as humanely as possible."<sup><a
      href="#n108">108</a></sup> Dr. Greg Miller, a neonatologist,
      teaches residents from the Medical College of Wisconsin about
      circumcision anesthesia. Dr. Miller says that excuses for not
      using anesthesia "`drive me up the wall. You wouldn't do that
      to an adult. You wouldn't do it to an animal,' he said of
      performing the procedure without pain relief."<sup><a
      href="#n109">109</a></sup> He further adds that "it doesn't
      take a medical study to prove that experiencing intense pain,
      even briefly, is something you never forget. And its
      certainly something you'd rather avoid."<sup><a
      href="#n110">110</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A recent study conducted by Canadian
      researchers further supports the use of anesthesia to reduce
      the pain of circumcision.<sup><a href="#n111">111</a></sup>
      The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
      concludes that newborns who had "an anti-pain cream applied
      to [their] penises . . . before their foreskins were sliced
      off . . . cried less and half as often as a comparable group
      of babies that weren't given an analgesic."<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup> The newborns with the analgesic
      "also closed their eyes, furrowed their brows and pursed
      their lips less. And their heart rates didn't jump as nearly
      as high."<sup><a href="#n113">113</a></sup> Circumcision "is
      still all too often barbaric," wrote Dr. Thomas E. Wiswell of
      Thomas Jefferson University in an editorial accompanying the
      study.<sup><a href="#n114">114</a></sup> Wiswell added that
      painkillers should always be given, and parents and
      physicians should demand no less."<sup><a
      href="#n115">115</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">These statements and study obviously suggest
      the nature of cir- cumcision is inhumane. A newborn's
      reaction is illustrative of the immense pain and trauma
      suffered.<sup><a href="#n116">116</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">That newborn circumcision is a
      psychologically traumatic experience is obvious. The infant,
      after living in the protected uterine environment for [nine]
      months, goes through the birth trauma and usually is
      immediately separated from the mother . . . After [two] or
      [three] days of such separation, the infant is firmly
      restrained, placed under strong lights and subjected to a
      surgical procedure without anesthesia. The only question is
      whether the trauma is short-lived, as is generally believed,
      or of longer, possibly permanent, duration, as is suggested
      by some research.<sup><a href="#n117">117</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Infliction of male circumcision on a newborn
      may result in long-term psychological and developmental
      effects.<sup><a href="#n118">118</a></sup> Ample evidence
      demonstrates that the experience of a newborn affects his
      behavioral patterns throughout his lifetime.<sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup> Opponents of circumcision argue
      that cutting an infant imprints violence on the babies brain.
      James Prescott, a psychologist, contends that circumcision
      "encodes the primitive immature, developing brain with pain
      when it was designed to be encoded with pleasure. This is one
      of the beginning stages in establishing the sadomasochistic
      personality."<sup><a href="#n120">120</a></sup> Men,
      circumcised as newborns, have recently come forward in an
      attempt to document the harm they suffered as a result of
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n121">121</a></sup> Although a
      relatively small group has participated in the documentation,
      the statistics clearly imply what men are feeling, but are
      too ashamed to express. Respondents report physical, sexual,
      emotional, and psychological harm due to removal of their
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n122">122</a></sup> The highest
      percentage of respondents reported dissatisfaction with
      circumcision, resentment over the surgery, and feelings of
      mutilation and a lack of natural wholeness.<sup><a
      href="#n123">123</a></sup> Moreover, a large percentage of
      these men suspect that circumcision has reduced their sexual
      pleasure.<sup><a href="#n124">124</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The effect circumcision has on sexuality and
      sexual experience is a controversial area of study. As early
      as the thirteenth century, Rabbi Moses Maimonides recognized
      that the objective of circumcision was to limit sexual
      intercourse and curb sexual excitement:<sup><a
      href="#n125">125</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>The bodily injury caused to that organ is exactly
        that which is desired; it does not interrupt any vital
        function, nor does it destroy the power of generation.
        Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there
        is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual
        excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment;
        the organ necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and
        is deprived of its covering from the beginning.<sup><a
        href="#n126">126</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Studies show that the foreskin is an
      erogenous zone consisting of "naked nerve endings" which are
      destroyed as as result of the procedure.<sup><a

          Quite conceivable also, circumcisions at some early point
          in human history replaced human sacrifice as a way of
          placating hostile forces and spirits. At what period
          these practices came into conjunction with the obsessive
          preoccupation with virginity and chastity that today
          still characterizes Islamic-Arabic cultures is not known,
          but infibulation clearly appears to be the result of that

        In the fifth century B.C., Herodotus reported on female
        circumcision and thought its origin was Ethiopian or
        Egyptian. The custom is further reported in a Greek papyrus
        dated 163 B.C. and by a Greek geographer in 25 B.C.; both
        inplied that the procedure was a premarital rite for women

        the procedure wherein one or more parts of the female
        external genitalia are removed. In this procedure, the
        clitoris is either partially or fully removed. The labia

        <i>Sunna</i> is the least severe and rarest of the three

        procedure stems from its use in anthropological studies. In
        subincision, the would remains open through adulthood.
        These procedures are usually performed by Australian
        aborigines or Bedouin communities. <i>Id</i>. The Aranda of
        Central Australia refer to the subincised penis with the
        same name as the female vulva, and [the] effusion of blood
        was regarded as serving the same function as menstruation,
        which in the female enabled her naturally to dispose of the
        evil humors that accumulate in the body." Ashley Montagu,

        Gomco method begins with cutting the foreskin to expose the
        glans and placing a cap over the glans. The cap is then
        covered by the stretched foreskin which is tied to the cap
        handle. 

        <blockquote>
          The hole in the base plate is placed over the cap handle
          and the flange on the handle is fitted into a groove in
          the screw device. The foreskin is now firmly held between
          the metal cap and the rim of the hole in the metal plate.
          By turning the screw device, the handle and cap are
          raised, squeezing the foreskin tightly against the plate
          opening, While the clamp is squeezing the foreskin
          tightly against the plate opening, the bulk of the
          foreskin is cut off. The clamp remains in place for at
          least five minutes, and when it is released, the base of
          the foreskin usually can be easily separated from the
          penile shaft.

        There is an estimated eight to thirty-one percent change of

        Infection is common, and since the circumcised penis has
        contact with wet and dirty diapers, there is increased
        danger of infection. The common symptoms are fever, pus,

        The study concluded that "[t]he amount of tissue loss

        block (DPNB) is a local anesthesia that may reduce the
        physiologic response, but there are inherent risks and
        concerns about its safety that have been expressed by the
        American Academy of Pediatrics. The procedure has not been
        widely adopted. Snellman and Stang, <i>supra</i> note 107,
        at 705-08. "Perhaps the most significant function of the
        dorsal penile nerve block is that it alleviates the
        consciences of the adults involved." Romberg, <i>supra</i>

          Although the [EMLA] cream certainly is better from the
          patient's point of view, many doctors . . . do the nerve
          blocks mostly because the procedure is more convenient
          for them. The cream must be applied half an hour to an
          hour ahead, but the doctor's usually don't schedule
          circumcisions; they work them in around other duties.

        previously contacted a circumcision organization in the
        past ten years. The vast percentage of men who submitted
        the questionnaire were Caucasian, Christian, between the

        sensation in circumcised and uncircumcised men and found no
        difference. Dr. Foley, however is just one of the doctors
        to have refuted this finding: 

        <blockquote>
          Normally the surface of the glans in composed of a smooth
          glistening membrane only a few cells in thickness. The
          surface cells are alive, and naked nerve endings are
          distributed among these cells. After circumcision when
          the glans is exposed to soiled diapers and rough
          clothing, this membrane becomes 10 times thicker, and the
          free nerve endings disappear.

        Morgan provides support for the theory that sexual pleasure
        is reduced and reports: 

        <blockquote>
          The subcutaneous tissue of the glans is provided with
          special sensory receptors that are concerned with
          appreciating pleasurable sensations occurring during
          coitus. They are stimulated normally only when the glans
          is exposed. In the circumcised subject these receptors
          are constantly stimulated and lose their sensitivity.
