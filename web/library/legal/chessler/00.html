      <blockquote>
        <p><small>The baby's screams fill the entire building: . .
        . The end of his penis is bright red!! There is blood on
        the diaper!! He is crying pitifully, high-pitched wail that
        I have never heard out of him before.</small><sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p><small>Never will I forget the sound as scissors
        separated the flesh between my legs from my body. It haunts
        me.</small><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

        <p><small>[I]t's perverse to excuse one cruelty by invoking
        a worse one. The genitals of both sexes should be left
        intact, without encouraging a "dreadfulness competition
        between" assaults on little girls or boys.</small><sup><a
        href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h4 align="center">I<span class="sc">NTRODUCTION</span></h4>

      <p class="text2">Guests began arriving around 2 p.m., all
      bearing gifts of joy.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> The mood
      was celebratory as men, women, and children, from as far
      north as Haifa, came to witness the sacred ceremony. Eight
      days<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> before a Jewish boy was
      born and the time had finally arrived for the covenant to be
      formed between the infant and God; the boy was to be
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Shortly after all
      the guests had arrived, they were ushered into the tiny
      living room. The room, hot from the Israeli sun, was filled
      with chatter and excitement.</p>

      <p class="text2">As the <i>mohel</i><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> entered, silence spread across the
      house. The <i>Sandak</i><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> held
      the child while the mohel evoked an erection from his tiny
      penis and then placed it in pincers. The pincers kept the
      foreskin separate from the rest of the penis. A short prayer
      was recited and then the mohel cut the foreskin with the
      stroke of a small knife. A piercing scream echoed throughout
      the house and into the bright beautiful summer day. No
      anesthesia was used to numb the pain as the baby was cut. His
      penis began to bleed profusely as he wailed helplessly. The
      mother too cried while the guests, incongruously, shouted and
      clapped their hands in celebration.</p>

      <p class="text2">At the same time this newborn girl entered
      into his covenant with God, a little girl in Africa was
      undergoing her ritual circumcision:<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>The little girl, entirely nude, is immobilized in
        the sitting position on a low stool by at least three
        women. One of them with her arms tightly around the little
        girl's chest; two others hold the child's thighs apart by a
        force, in order to open wide the vulva ... The traditional
        operator says a short prayer ... Then she spreads on the
        floor some offerings to Allah ... Then the old woman takes
        her razor and excises the clitoris. The infibulation
        follows ... The little girl howls and writhes in pain ...
        The operator wipes the blood from the wound, and the mother
        as well as the guests verify her work ...</small><sup><a
        href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">She like the little boy, just took part in
      her rite of passage.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Both
      youngsters were now initiated into adult society and
      considered full members of their religious and cultural
      order. These rites of passage serve "as the chief vehicle to
      link generations in the transmission of the culture
      complex[.]"<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Acceptance took
      two barbaric acts of blood fear and agonizing pain. Although
      both had achieved their rite of passage through similar pain
      and anguish, a difference persists in the perception of human
      rights activists and the Western legal world regarding these
      procedures.</p>

      <p class="text2">While concerns about female circumcision are
      at the forefront of human rights law, male circumcision,
      amazingly, continues to be virtually ignored. Although many
      activists and writers throughout the world condemn female
      circumcision, they fail to acknowledge the similarity between
      male and female circumcision in Western society. This
      hypocritical condemnation of one form of circumcision, merely
      because the act is considered "more extreme," demonstrates a
      basic denial and ignorance of human rights law. There appears
      to be a "hypersensitivity" to female human rights at the
      expense of male human rights; this double standard, which
      accepts and condones male circumcision but condemns female
      circumcision, makes the concept of human rights
      meaningless.</p>

      <p class="text2">This comment examines the similarities and
      differences between female and male circumcision, arguing
      that the global community adamantly opposes female
      circumcision, while neglecting to similarly construe male
      circumcision. Part I explains the types, history, and
      procedures of male and female circumcision and the resulting
      physical and psychological complications. Part II discusses
      the legal remedies for the eradication of female circumcision
      and how these legal arguments, as well as other remedies,
      should be applied to male circumcision. In Part IV and the
      conclusion, this comment suggests several recommendation for
      the eradication of male circumcision and the importance of
      officially recognizing male circumcision as human rights
      abuse.</p>

      Romberg. Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma xix (1985). Male
      circumcision is performed routinely; it is the most
      frequently performed elective operation. Edward Wallerstein,
      Circumcision: An American Health Fallacy 1 (1980).
      Eighty-five percent of the world's population is
      uncircumcised. Earl Jenson, <i>Cruel Ritual</i>, Salt Lake
      City Tribune., Sept. 18, 1994, at A18. An estimated one out
      of six males in the world is circumcised. In America,
      approximately eighty percent of newborn males are
      circumcised. Roger Highfield, <i>Study Finds Circumcision
      Doesn't Aid Health</i>, Ottawa Citizen, Apr. 2, 1997, at A8.
      Circumcision is rare in Europe, China, the Far East, and
      Central and South America; it is more commonly performed in
      North and South America, the Near East, Polynesia, Canada and
      among Muslims of India and Indonesia, Australian Aborigines,
      various African tribes, and Jewish people throughout the
      world. John R. Holman et al., <i>Neonatal Circumcision
      Techniques</i>, 52 Am. Fam. Physician 511 (Aug 1995). "[The
      United States] is the only `advanced' nation in the world
      still routinely circumcising most (60%) of its newborn males
      for non-religious reasons." NOHARMM, a "Circumcision
      Comparision" [hereinafter NOHARMM Comparison] (information
      sheet on file with the <i>Buffalo Law Review</i>); see
      <i>also</i> Laurie Smith Anderson, <i>Routine Circumcision

      Mire, <i>A Wrongful Rite</i>, Essence, June 1994, at 42. An
      estimated 85 to 114 million African women are circumcised.
      Nahid Toubia, Female Genital Mutilation: A Call For Global
      Action 21 (1993). In 1995, seventy percent of the thirty
      million women in Egypt were circumcised. Sarah Gauch,
      <i>Egyptian Documentary Film Fights Female Circumcision</i>,
      Plain Dealer, Oct. 24, 1995 at 6E. Currently, two million
      young women (infants and adolescents) per year are at risk of
      circumcision. Toubia, supra, at 21; see also Robbie McClaran,
      <i>Facts about Female Circumcision</i>., Dallas Morning News,
      May 22, 1994, at 1F. Statistically, this results in five
      females every minute being circumcised. Benjamin K. Lim,
      <i>Female Circumcision Remains A Curse, Workshop Says</i>,
      Reuters, Ltd., (Aug. 31, 1995). However, there is a lack of
      definitive data as a result of the difficult nature of
      gathering such statistics, especially when the procedure is
      illegal in several countries. Toubia, <i>supra</i>, at 22.
      Female circumcision is currently practiced in twenty-six
      African countries, a few communities in Asia, and by African
      immigrants in the Americas, Australia, and Europe. Id. at 21.
      The procedure is practiced by Muslims, Christians, some
      animists, and by Ethiopian Jews. Id.; see <i>infra</i> notes
      197-200 and accompanying text. Although practiced by these
      religions it is not a religious requirement. <i>Day One:
      Scarred for Life</i>. (ABC television broadcast, Sept. 20,
      1993); see also Toubia, <i>supra</i>, at 21. The distribution
      of the practice demonstrates a strong correlation between
      similar cultures and countries where performed. Id.<br />

      following is a first hand account of a circumcision I
      attended at Kibbutz Sde Boqer in the Negev Desert of
      Israel.<br />
      <a id="n5"
      name="n5"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Jewish
      law requires male children be circumcised on the eighth day
      following birth. This requirement is traced to the Old
      Testament. <i>Bereshit/Genesis</i> 17:12 reads: And he that
      is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every
      manchild in your generations;" and <i>Vayyiqra/Leviticus</i>
      12:2-3 reads: "If a woman have conceived seed, and born a
      manchild...[a]nd on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin
      shall be circumcised." <i>Bereshit/Genesis</i> 17:12,
      <i>Vayiqra/Leviticus</i> 12:2-3. All biblical references
      throughout this comment are to the Jeruselem Bible.<br />
      <a id="n6"
      name="n6"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Judaism
      refers to circumcision as <i>Brit Milah</i> or <i>Bris</i>.
      <i>Bris</i> means "covenant" and &lt;&lt;i&gt;milah</small>
      means "circumcision." The Jewish religion traces the sacred
      ritual of circumcision to <i>Bereshit/Genesis</i>
      17:9-12:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>And God said to Avraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
        there- fore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their
        generations. This is my covenant, which you shall keep,
        between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every manchild
        among you shall be circumcised. And you shall circumcise
        the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the
        covenant between me and you.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2"><small><i>Bereshit/Genesis</i>
      17:9-12.<br />
      <a id="n7"
      name="n7"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. A
      <i>mohel</i> is an observant Jew trained specifically to
      perform circumcisions. However a <i>mohel</i> is not
      medically trained and therefore much controversy surrounds
      his qualifications for performing this procedure. Romberg,
      supra note 1, at 51.<br />
      <a id="n8"
      name="n8"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.
      <i>Sandak</i> is the Hebrew word for "Godfather" or the one
      who holds the baby at a circumcision. See New Bantam-Megiddo
      Hebrew &amp; English Dictionary 165 (6th ed. 1988-89). The
      grandfather held the child at this particular ritual.<br />
      <a id="n9"
      name="n9"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.
      Frequently female circumcision is referred to as female
      genital mutilation (FGM). For purposes of this comparative
      analysis, this comment will use the term circumcision, a
      choice not loosely decided upon. Contrary to the prevailing
      opinion, the word circumcision is not a misnomer. Although
      many disagree with this choice of language because male
      equivalent of female circumcision is often viewed as
      non-mutilating, an analogy can be, and should be, made
      between the two acts. The use of the term circumcision draws
      a parallel between the male and female acts and their
      cultural and religious justifications. There is extensive
      literature on female circumcision which criticizes the use of
      the term circumcision because it is viewed as either
      "nonmutilating" or the removal of the foreskin should be
      considered insignificant in light of female circumcision.
      However, there should be no right to take a child, male or
      female, against his or her will and remove a body part that
      is perfectly healthy; this is clearly a double standard. To
      deny one, and overlook the obvious analogy, is to deny human
      rights. For differing opinions on terminology, see Robbie D.

      Genital Mutilation</i>, 9 Geo. Immige. L.J. 105,116-118.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its a festive,
      beautiful and intimate family ceremony where--bagels and
      cream cheese close by--the infant boy loses a foreskin and
      gains his official religious name. This may strike some
      people as a tough trade, but thus it has been among Jews for
      thousands of years.<br />

      Lightfoot-Klein writes:</small></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>Excision practices can be assumed to date back
        thousands of years, conceivably to the early beginnings of
        mankind. Quite conceivable also, circumcisions at some
        early point in human history replaced human sacrifice as a
        way of placating hostile forces and spirits. At what period
        these practices came into conjunction with the obsessive
        preoccupation with virginity and chastity that today still
        characterizes Islamic-Arabic cultures is not known, but
        infibulation clearly appears to be the result of that
        meeting.</small>
