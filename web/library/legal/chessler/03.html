      M<small>ALE</small> C<small>IRCUMCISION</small></p>

      <p class="text2">Human rights activists and the media have
      been successful in advancing legal arguments against female
      circumcision. The international community has taken a stand
      against the procedure, creating international and domestic
      remedies. Fortunately for women, there is hope of eventual
      eradication. The same response has not occurred for male
      circumcision, exhibiting the Western legal world's hypocrisy.
      In the West, where routine male circumcision proceeds
      unnoticed and unquestioned, female circumcision is now widely
      understood as a human rights abuse.</p>

      <p class="text2">Legal arguments advanced in opposition to
      female circumcision may likewise be utilized against male
      circumcision. There are several international laws, such as
      the <a
      href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/BH769.txt">
      Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
      Against Women (CEDAW)</a>,<sup><a href="#n253">253</a></sup>
      the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on
      the Rights of the Child (CRC)</a>,<sup><a
      href="#n254">254</a></sup> the <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/z1afchar.htm">African
      Charter on Human and People's Rights</a> (ACHPR),<sup><a
      href="#n255">255</a></sup> as well as domestic and foreign
      statutes that provide a sound basis for arguing for the
      eradication of female circumcision. Except for the CRC, these
      international laws, unlike domestic and foreign statutes,
      provide support for eradication, but do not ban the practice.
      The best legal remedy to address male circumcision on a
      worldwide scale, however, may be the combined application of
      the CRC, customary international law, and existing domestic
      laws. The establishment of a convention for the protection of
      males seems unlikely. In the United States, the largest
      performer of routine infant circumcision, and the focus of
      this analysis, the best solutions include the use of existing
      domestic child abuse laws, a federal law banning the
      procedure, and civil litigation.</p>

      <p><a id="A" name="A">A</a>. <i>Legal Remedies for Female
      Circumcision: Utilizing International Documents, Foreign
      Legislation, and Domestic Legislation</i><sup><a
      href="#n256">256</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="A1" name="A1">1</a>. <i>International
      Documents and Foreign Legislation</i>. Female circumcision is
      most often linked to issues of sexual equality,<sup><a
      href="#n257">257</a></sup> since its justification has been
      connected to claims that women are inferior and subordinate
      to men.<sup><a href="#n258">258</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/BH769.txt"
       target="_blank">CEDAW</a> is the most promising convention
      calling for an end to this type of discrimination against
      women.<sup><a href="#n259">259</a></sup> CEDAW focuses on
      traditional practices which violate women and their human
      rights. Articles 1 and 5 specifically call for the
      elimination of discrimination against women based on cultural
      practices impairing women's human rights and fundamental
      freedoms.<sup><a href="#n260">260</a></sup> The cultural
      justifications for female circumcision continue to perpetuate
      the inequality of women in society. "[T]he elimination of
      prejudices and customary and all other practices which are
      based on the idea of the inferiority of either of the sexes
      or on stereotyped roles" are addressed in Article 5. In
      addition, Article 12 of CEDAW focuses on the health of
      women,<sup><a href="#n261">261</a></sup> while Article 10,
      similar to Article 5, calls for the elimination of
      stereotypical conceptions of the role between the
      sexes.<sup><a href="#n262">262</a></sup> These articles
      illustrate the need for the elimination of female
      circumcision. The abuse results in drastic health
      complications and continues to allow men to dominate women by
      destroying their genitalia.<sup><a href="#n263">263</a></sup>
      CEDAW signatories are in direct violation of these articles
      when they permit the practice of female circumcision.&lt;</p>

      <p class="text2">The Committee responsible for implementing
      <a
      href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/BH769.txt"
       target="_blank">CEDAW</a> has made several recommendations
      which specifically address the eradication of female
      circumcision. General Recommendation No. 14 calls for its
      eradication through a variety of means.<sup><a
      href="#n264">264</a></sup> This recommendation is said to
      take normative approach; its language follows that of the CRC
      by linking the practice to health.<sup><a
      href="#n265">265</a></sup> CEDAW urges that measures be taken
      which are educational in nature and that women's groups take
      the lead in the eradication.<sup><a
      href="#n266">266</a></sup> There is no call, however, for
      drafting legislation or implementing an enforcement body for
      protection.<sup><a href="#n267">267</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although <a
      href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/BH769.txt"
       target="_blank">CEDAW</a> appears promising, one of the
      greatest barriers to its implementation is the lack of an
      effective enforcement mechanism. Like other U.N. documents,
      CEDAW is difficult to enforce, for example, in rural African
      communities.<sup><a href="#n268">268</a></sup> Even though
      CEDAW has been widely ratified by countries practicing female
      circumcision, the convention still contains the largest
      number of reservations of all human rights treaties and
      conventions.<sup><a href="#n269">269</a></sup> The majority
      of reservations are founded upon the convention's direct
      conflicts with <i>Shari'ah</i> (Islamic Law) and traditional
      practices.<sup><a href="#n270">270</a></sup> Such strong
      reservations make the eradication of female circumcision by
      the application of this treaty more difficult. Efforts to
      combat the abuse, however, must include CEDAW's
      application.</p>

      <p class="text2">Continued female circumcision also violates
      several provisions of the more recent <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> (CRC).<sup><a
      href="#n271">271</a></sup> The CRC contains the only
      "codified prohibition" of female circumcision in human rights
      law.<sup><a href="#n272">272</a></sup> Article 24(3) requires
      nations to abolish traditional practices that jeopardize the
      health of children.<sup><a href="#n273">273</a></sup> The
      article's scope is said by its drafters to encompass female
      circumcision<sup><a href="#n274">274</a></sup>--although not
      specifically highlighted, the term `harmful traditional'
      practices is meant as a prohibition on female
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n275">275</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In addition, there are three other <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/" target="_blank">CRC</a>
      articles with which female circumcision conflicts: Article 19
      proscribes child abuse;<sup><a href="#n276">276</a></sup>
      article 16 provides children with a right to privacy;<sup><a
      href="#n277">277</a></sup> and article 37 prohibits the
      torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of
      children.<sup><a href="#n278">278</a></sup> Subjected to
      circumcision, a child's privacy is violated. Moreover the
      child falls victim to extreme physical and mental violence.
      It is difficult, at the very least, to deny that the vicious
      ripping of a child's genitals with a dirty knife constitutes
      torture or cruel treatment. The international community
      should be called upon to declare that female circumcision
      violates all four applicable CRC articles.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/z1afchar.htm"
      target="_blank">African Charter on Human and People's
      Rights</a> is another international instrument which can be
      utilized to eradicate female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n279">279</a></sup> Several articles of the treaty can
      be interpreted to proscribe female circumcision. Although the
      African Charter recognizes the importance of traditional
      practices in numerous articles,<sup><a
      href="#n280">280</a></sup> its purpose is to protect human
      rights. Since the fundamental basis of the African Charter is
      to protect human and peoples' rights, it is contradictory if
      female circumcision is considered a legitimate traditional
      practice. Article 29(7) clearly reiterates the aim of the
      Charter: "[t]o preserve and strengthen positive African
      cultural values." Many practicing communities may, from a
      cultural prospective, view female circumcision as a positive
      value worthy of preservation. The Western world and many
      international organizations, however, would disagree.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/z1afchar.htm"
      target="_blank">African Charter</a> in article 4 states:
      "Human beings are inviolable. Every person shall be entitled
      to respect for his life and the integrity of his
      person."<sup><a href="#n281">281</a></sup> Article 5
      proclaims that "torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading
      punishment or treatment shall be prohibited."<sup><a
      href="#n282">282</a></sup> Article 16 declares that all are
      entitled to the highest level of physical and mental health.
      Article 18 calls for state assurance of non-discrimination
      against women as well as "the protection of the rights of the
      woman and the child as stipulated in international
      declarations and conventions."<sup><a
      href="#n283">283</a></sup> Female circumcision is clearly in
      violation of the terms of these articles. If women are
      entitled to the highest level of health maintenance, female
      circumcision must be considered a violation of this right.
      Women experience great physical and psychological
      complications as a result of the inhuman treatment inflicted
      upon them.<sup><a href="#n284">284</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to the variety of international
      documents which provide a useful framework for banning female
      circumcision, a number of countries prohibit the practice.
      Burkina Faso, Great Britain, Sweden, and Switzerland are just
      a few of the countries which have actively responded to the
      abuse.<sup><a href="#n285">285</a></sup> Countries such as
      Canada, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, and
      Switzerland punish the practice under child abuse laws, while
      Great Britain and Sweden have explicitly outlawed the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n286">286</a></sup> African
      countries such as Cameroon, Djibouti, Egypt, Ghana, and Sudan
      have also enacted legislation which prohibits female
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n287">287</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="A2" name="A2">2</a>. <i>Recent
      Domestic Legislation</i>. As new immigrants gave brought the
      practices of female circumcision within the borders of the
      United States, the government and individual states, in
      similar fashion with foreign legislation, are outlawing
      female circumcision. Not only has President Clinton signed
      legislation criminalizing female circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n288">288</a></sup> but several states have
      specifically enacted legislation prohibiting the
      practice.<sup><a href="#n289">289</a></sup> Congressional
      response to the issue of female genital mutilation is not
      surprising in light of the state's interest in child
      welfare.</p>

      <p class="text2">The federal ban on female circumcision is a
      result of the tireless efforts of Senator Harry Reid, a
      democrat from Nevada, and retired Representative Patricia
      Schroeder, a democrat from Colorado. In September 1994,
      Senator Reid introduced a "Sense of the Senate" resolution
      condemning the practice of female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n290">290</a></sup> Following this resolution, Senator
      Reid introduced the bill banning the practice.<sup><a
      href="#n291">291</a></sup> In June 1995, the United States
      House of Representatives passed retired-Representative
      Schroeder's resolution, "urging the President to help end the
      practice of female [circumcision] world wide."<sup><a
      href="#n292">292</a></sup> However, it was not until
      September 30, 1996, that President Clinton signed the
      Department of Defense Omnibus Appropriations Bill which
      contained a provision criminalizing female genital
      mutilation.<sup><a href="#n293">293</a></sup> Although the
      law is now in effect, it contains no specific enforcement
      provisions.</p>

      <p><a id="B" name="B">B</a>. <i>Legal Remedies for Male
      Circumcision: Utilizing International Documents, Customary
      International Law, and Domestic Law</i></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="B1" name="B1">1</a>. <i>International
      Documents and Customary International Law</i>. The
      international community has failed to view male circumcision
      as a human rights abuse. A call for eradication of this
      physical and psychological abuse is necessary and may be
      developed through interpretation of a combination of
      treaties, customary international law, and American domestic
      law.<sup><a href="#n294">294</a></sup> The <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/" target="_blank">CRC</a>
      is one example of a convention applicable to male
      circumcision. Male circumcision, like female circumcision, is
      a `harmful traditional practice.' The act itself may
      constitute child abuse because of its non-accidental physical
      and psychological infliction on children.<sup><a
      href="#n295">295</a></sup> The procedure is generally done
      without anesthesia and consequently a child is subject to
      cruel and torturous treatment. Moreover, a child is an
      individual and does have a right to privacy.<sup><a
      href="#n296">296</a></sup> The CRC's articles are directly
      applicable to the case of male circumcision and should be
      utilized to seek its eradication.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <a href="/library/ethics/UN-human/"
      target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>
      (UDHR),<sup><a href="#n297">297</a></sup> which is generally
      accepted as customary international law, could also be
      utilized. The human rights principles referred to in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-charter/">Charter of the United
      Nations</a> are articulated in the UDHR.<sup><a
      href="#n298">298</a></sup> The UDHR provides for universal
      standards of human rights for all peoples and all
      nations.<sup><a href="#n299">299</a></sup> Common practice by
      nations over the past fifty years has established these
      rights as customary international law. "A customary norm
      binds all governments, including those that have not
      recognized it, so long as they have not persistently objected
      to its development."<sup><a href="#n300">300</a></sup> Some
      of these rights have ever reached the status of preemptory
      norms; freedom from torture is one such example.<sup><a
      href="#n301">301</a></sup> Article 5 of the UDHR prohibits
      acts of torture and inhuman treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n302">302</a></sup> Although male circumcision takes
      less than ten minutes to perform, the duration of the abuse
      is superfluous; ten minutes of unnecessary and violent
      treatment which removes a perfectly healthy body part should
      be recognized and treated as torture. Therefore, the
      fundamental guarantees of the UDHR should protect these
      infants and be utilized in the abolition of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two other articles of the UDHR are
      applicable to male circumcision: article 12 provides a right
      to privacy, and article 3 provides a right to security of
      person.<sup><a href="#n303">303</a></sup> A newborn is
      entitled to the same privacy rights as any human being.
      Circumcision is a violation of a child's bodily integrity,
      privacy, and security. The unwarranted removal of a child's
      healthy foreskin can be likened to amputation and "if one
      wishes to practice an amputative type of preventative
      medicine, one could find many more rewarding structures to
      cut off rather than the foreskin."<sup><a
      href="#n304">304</a></sup> The U.N. has called upon
      governments, urging the act of amputation be
      abolished.<sup><a href="#n305">305</a></sup> Male
      circumcision, like amputation, is another form of torture or
      inhumane treatment that violates the security of person.
      Subjecting a child to this invasive and mutilating procedure
      is a violation of these norms. The U.N. should acknowledge
      male circumcision as an act of torture and inhumane treatment
      and call for its eradication. The difficulty, however,
      remains that there is no mechanism to enforce such customary
      norms.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="B2" name="B2">2</a>. <i>Domestic
      Remedies</i>. The United States is the only Western country
      that still routinely circumcises infant boys for nonreligious
      reasons.<sup><a href="#n306">306</a></sup> An obvious
      response to this abuse is the invocation of domestic remedies
      that criminalize the practice under existing child abuse
      statutes or authorize damages and recourse through civil
      law.<sup><a href="#n307">307</a></sup> State statutes
      prohibiting assault and battery and conspiracy to commit
      assault and battery could be possible methods of combatting
      male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The difficulty is applying these statutes is
      that most Americans do not perceive male circumcision as a
      human rights abuse, let alone child abuse.<sup><a
      href="#n308">308</a></sup> Moreover, establishing the
      requisite mental state for the crime would be
      difficult.<sup><a href="#n309">309</a></sup> It is difficult
      to prove that a parent who chose to circumcise a child out of
      religious fealty or a sincerely held desire to protect a
      child from disease intended to "purposely, knowingly or
      recklessly cause bodily injury" to that child.<sup><a
      href="#n310">310</a></sup> Given these difficulties, the best
      remedy would be passage of a law specifically outlawing the
      practice of male circumcision, much like the statute
      criminalizing female circumcision.</p>

      <p><a id="C" name="C">C</a>. <i>Constitutional Issues</i></p>

      <p class="text2">The criminalization of circumcision presents
      formidable constitutional problems.<sup><a
      href="#n311">311</a></sup> Constitutional derived rights of
      privacy, autonomous parental rights, and the protection of
      the free exercise of religion cut against in some capacity,
      the criminalization of circumcision. Any attempt to prohibit
      male circumcision would have to pass vigorous constitutional
      tests.</p>

      <p class="text2">Constitutional challenges could make
      criminal sanctions difficult to apply. The Constitution does
      not expressly state that parental decision-making regarding
      the care, custody, and control of children constitutes a
      fundamental rights. However, the Supreme Court has recognized
      that the Constitution protects such decisions, limited by the
      requirement that parents "may not endanger the lives or
      physical well-being of their children simply to raise them
      within the confines of their own culture."<sup><a
      href="#n312">312</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="C1" name="C1">1</a>. <i>Parental
      Rights and The Right to Privacy.</i> Unlike the free exercise
      of religion, the right to privacy is not expressly granted in
      the Constitution. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted
      the Constitution, specifically, the first, second, third,
      fourth, fifth, and ninth amendments, to confer fundamental
      privacy rights.<sup><a href="#n313">313</a></sup> The Court
      has extended fundamental privacy rights, in differing
      degrees, to areas of sex,<sup><a href="#n314">314</a></sup>
      marriage,<sup><a href="#n315">315</a></sup>
      child-bearing,<sup><a href="#n316">316</a></sup> and
      child-rearing.<sup><a href="#n317">317</a></sup> If a right
      is deemed fundamental, government action that impinges on the
      right must pass a test of strict scrutiny.<sup><a
      href="#n318">318</a></sup> The criminalization of male
      circumcision, however, can survive the strict scrutiny
      required for government interference with parental rights, as
      the procedure renders extreme physical and often emotional
      damage to the infant.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two of the Supreme Court's strongest
      opinions favoring parental rights are <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/405/645.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Stanley v. Illinois</i></a><sup><a
      href="#n319">319</a></sup> and <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/381/479.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i></a>.<sup><a
      href="#n320">320</a></sup> In <i>Stanley</i>, the Court
      struck down a statute that denied an unmarried father, upon
      the death of the mother, custody of his children. The
      decision focused upon the parent's interest in keeping his
      child and not on a child's interest in staying with his
      parent. "<i>Stanley</i> made it very clear that the mere
      assertion of [the state's] parents patriae interest in the
      protection of the child was insufficient to warrant
      abridgement of parental rights unless the potential harm to
      the child was significant."<sup><a href="#n321">321</a></sup>
      In <i>Griswold</i>, the Supreme Court held that married
      couples have the right to obtain contraception; the Court
      based its opinion not on the right to privacy, but on the
      fundamental safeguards protecting the home and family.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>Certainly the safeguarding of the home does not
        follow merely from the sanctity of property rights. The
        home derives its pre-eminence from the seat of family life.
        And the integrity of that life is something so fundamental
        that it has been found to draw to its protection the
        principles of more than one explicitly granted
        Constitutional Right . . . .</small><sup><a
        href="#n322">322</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The Supreme Court, however, has limited
      parental rights "it appears that parental decisions will
      jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a
      potential for significant social burdens."<sup><a
      href="#n323">323</a></sup> Furthermore, the Supreme Court in
      <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/410/113.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Roe v. Wade</i></a> held that a state has
      a significant interest in safeguarding health and safety in
      the maintenance of medical standards.<sup><a
      href="#n324">324</a></sup> Therefore the State's interest in
      protecting the health, safety and welfare of children
      supplants the parent's fundamental rights to make decisions
      regarding their children when those decisions jeopardize the
      health or safety of the child.<sup><a
      href="#n325">325</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Often the Supreme Court overrides family
      relationships in efforts to protect children.<sup><a
      href="#n326">326</a></sup> <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Prince v. Massachussetts</i></a> is the
      pre-eminent case affirming that the government may intercede
      on behalf of children by undercutting parental rights.<sup><a
      href="#n327">327</a></sup> <i>Prince</i> held that,
      "[P]arents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it
      does not follow that they are free ... to make martyrs of
      their children before they have reached the age of full and
      legal discretion when they can make the choice for
      themselves."<sup><a href="#n328">328</a></sup> Therefore,
      parents do not have the constitutional authority to consent
      to superfluous practices, such as male circumcision, that
      jeopardize the health and safety of children.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="C2" name="C2">2</a>. <i>Freedom of
      Religion--The Free Exercise Clause</i>. The United States
      Constitution guarantees that "Congress shall make no law
      respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
      free exercise thereof."<sup><a href="#n329">329</a></sup> The
      First Amendment confers two different religious protections
      by way of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise
      Clause. The Establishment Clause protects minority religions
      from government endorsement of the majority's religion, while
      the Free Exercise Clause grants wide ranging protection to an
      individual's personal religious choices.<sup><a
      href="#n330">330</a></sup> The government, however, maintains
      a compelling interest in protecting children from harmful
      religious practices.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Supreme Court's free exercise line of
      law begs the question whether criminalization of circumcision
      would apply to those who practice religion on religious
      grounds. The Supreme Court's 1990 decision in <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/494/872.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Employment Division v. Smith</i></a>
      demonstrated a break with most past free exercise theory,
      holding enforceable laws not <i>intended</i> to burden
      religious activity but nevertheless placing a substantial
      burden on the free exercise of an individual's
      religion.<sup><a href="#n331">331</a></sup> The <i>Smith</i>
      majority stated: "the right to free exercise does not relieve
      an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and
      neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the
      law proscribes . . . conduct that his religion
      prescribes."<sup><a href="#n332">332</a></sup> The issue in
      <i>Smith</i> was whether the State of Oregon could
      criminalize the possession of peyote without exempting those
      Native American Indians for whom the use of peyote
      constituted a central part of their religious rituals.<sup><a
      href="#n333">333</a></sup> The majority held that the State
      could decline to exempt Native American Indians and that, as
      long as the ban on the possession of peyote was neutrally
      enforced, the Court was not required to balance the state's
      interest in criminalizing the possession of peyote against an
      individual's religious beliefs.<sup><a
      href="#n334">334</a></sup> Moreover, the Supreme Court has
      "never held that an individual's religious belief's could
      excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law
      prohibiting conduct that the State is free to
      regulate."<sup><a href="#n335">335</a></sup> That the record of
      free exercise jurisprudence is not contrary to such a
      proposition was clearly articulated by Justice Frankfurter in
      <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/310/586.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Minersville School District Board of
      Education v. Gobitis</i></a>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>Conscientious scruples have not in the course of the
        long struggle for religious toleration, relieved the
        individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the
        promotion or restriction of religious beliefs. The mere
        possession of religious convictions which contradict the
        relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve
        the citizen from the discharge of political
        responsibilities.</small><sup><a href="#n336">336</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2"><a id="C3" name="C3">3</a>. <i>Religious
      Freedom Restoration Act.</i> The <i>Smith</i> decision
      demonstrates the Rehnquist Court's trend toward curtailing
      the free exercise of religion.<sup><a
      href="#n337">337</a></sup> Following <i>Smith</i>, religious
      lobbies expressed concern that the decision limited the free
      exercise of religion.<sup><a href="#n338">338</a></sup> "For
      the first time, the Court held that the compelling state
      interest test should be invoked in religious exemption cases
      only when the governmental action at issue is neither neutral
      nor generally applicable, that is, when the law facially
      persecutes a particular religion."<sup><a
      href="#n339">339</a></sup> In response to the controversial
      decision, Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration
      Act (RFRA).<sup><a href="#n340">340</a></sup> RFRA provides
      that the "government shall not substantially burden a
      person's exercise of religion" unless it first demonstrates
      that the "application of the burden to the person" is the
      "least restrictive means" in the furtherance of "a compelling
      governmental interest."<sup><a href="#n341">341</a></sup>
      RFRA, in contrast to the <i>Smith</i> decision, "privileges
      religiously motivated conduct."<sup><a
      href="#n342">342</a></sup> At the signing of RFRA, President
      Clinton indicated "that the bill was an exercise of
      Congress's `extraordinary' power to `reverse by legislation a
      decision of the United States Supreme Court.'<sup><a
      href="#n343">343</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">On June 25, 1997, the Supreme Court
      reaffirmed its holding in <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/494/872.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Smith</i></a> and struck down RFRA.<sup><a
      href="#n344">344</a></sup> Ruling that Congress had
      overstepped its bounds in eschewing judicial precedent--the
      line of Supreme Court decisions stemming from
      <i>Smith</i>--the Court health that "[w]hen the exercise of
      religion has been burdened in an incidental way by a law of
      general application, it does not follow that the persons
      affected have been burdened any more than other citizens, let
      alone burdened because of their religious beliefs."<sup><a
      href="#n345">345</a></sup> While many religious leaders and
      civil rights advocates will see <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/000/95-2074.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Boerne</i></a> as the Court's further
      departure for "vigorously protecting religious
      rights,"<sup><a href="#n346">346</a></sup> other are in
      accord with the high court's decision, maintaining that "RFRA
      did not vindicate constitutionally recognized religious
      liberty; it heretically exalted believers above the ordinary
      commands of the law . . . ."<sup><a
      href="#n347">347</a></sup> Even by the standards set in RFRA,
      however, the government has been permitted to protect public
      health and safety in derogation of some religious
      freedoms.</p>

      <p class="text2">In <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/390/598.html"><i>Jehovah's
      Witnesses v. King County Hospital</i></a>,<sup><a
      href="#n348">348</a></sup> the Supreme Court, applying
      <i>Prince v. Massachussetts</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n349">349</a></sup> affirmed a district courts ruling
      mandating that a child of Jehovah's Witness parents receive
      an emergency blood transfusion.<sup><a
      href="#n350">350</a></sup> Over the parents' due process and
      free exercise objections, the district court found the
      parent's conduct not constitutionally protected.<sup><a
      href="#n351">351</a></sup> The King County decision, like the
      decision in Prince, placed limitations upon parental free
      exercise rights, both holding that "these rights do not
      include a right to endanger seriously a child's physical
      health or safety."<sup><a href="#n352">352</a></sup> These
      cases establish the State's interest in protecting the
      welfare of children and promoting societal values.<sup><a
      href="#n353">353</a></sup> If the welfare of children is to
      be protected, circumcision cannot be performed as our society
      values humanity and not abuse.</p>

      <p class="text2">The fact that circumcision is a tenet of
      certain religions is not a reason to provide an exemption
      from a generally applicable criminal law. The government's
      motivation for a criminal law would be for the protection of
      the safety and health of newborns, not intentional
      discrimination against specific religions. As evidenced by
      the massive government regulatory system, protecting the
      health of the nations is a primary concern. The State is free
      to regulate health standards and therefore, compliance with a
      generally applicable law against circumcision would be
      mandatory, regardless of the burden placed on individual
      religious beliefs.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other major constitutional conflicts have
      arisen between freedom of religion and secular law. In
      <i>Reynolds v. United States</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n354">354</a></sup> the Supreme Court held that
      religious practices which are harmful to society could be
      limited and stated that limitation is necessary in order to
      avoid "mak[ing] the professed doctrines of religious belief
      superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit
      every citizen to become a law unto himself."<sup><a
      href="#n355">355</a></sup> A difficulty exists in arguing
      that circumcision is harmful to society. However, abusing
      infants strikes against the core of societal values. Male
      circumcision, performed as a religious practice or for
      non-religious reasons, is an abuse, and if society refuses to
      tolerate any form of child abuse, society must refuse to
      tolerate male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Cases involving interplay between education
      and religion have also sparked constitutional
      conflicts.<sup><a href="#n356">356</a></sup> One case is <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/406/205.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Wisconsin v. Yoder</i></a>,<sup><a
      href="#n357">357</a></sup> in which the Supreme Court held
      that Amish parents could not be prevented from withdrawing
      their children from public schools, since they contended that
      public schooling would lead to destruction of their
      religion.<sup><a href="#n358">358</a></sup> There are,
      however, significant differences between the right of a
      parent to deny education on religious grounds, and
      circumcision as a religious rite:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>(1) denial of education is at least partly
        reversible, whereas the disfigurement caused by the removal
        of a body part is not, and (2) the physical pain and
        suffering, with potentially significant surgical and
        general health complications, inflicted on infants by
        circumcision is not found in parents denial of education to
        their adolescent children.</small><sup><a
        href="#n359">359</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>A circumcised child cannot "technically" reverse the
      procedure, whereas a child may seek education later in
      life.</p>

      <p><a id="D" name="D">D</a>. <i>Civil Lawsuits and the
      Informed Consent Doctrine</i><sup><a
      href="#n360">360</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Civil Lawsuits may provoke one of the best
      means of preventing male circumcision, since such suits will
      avoid the constitutional issues of parental rights and
      religious freedom. Under tort law, a patient has the right to
      exercise control over his or her body.<sup><a
      href="#n361">361</a></sup>. The informed consent doctrine
      grants patients the right, absent extenuating circumstances,
      to decide whether to subject themselves to a medical
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n362">362</a></sup> Infants,
      however, are legally incompetent to consent to medical
      procedures.<sup><a href="#n363">363</a></sup> A physician
      must provide the patient with all the medical information on
      the procedure so the patient can make an informed
      decision.<sup><a href="#n364">364</a></sup> Since there is no
      conclusive medical necessity for male circumcision,
      physicians have a responsibility to inform parents that the
      removal of the foreskin is unnecessary and that both extreme
      physical and psychological complications can result.<sup><a
      href="#n365">365</a></sup> A physician who does not fulfill
      his or her duty to disclose could be subject to a suit for
      damages by the parents or child.<sup><a
      href="#n366">366</a></sup> Moreover, it is the duty of the
      physician to serve the child's interest and not the
      parent's"<sup><a href="#n367">367</a></sup> However, the
      establishment of a civil remedy for those harmed by
      circumcision poses the same difficulties as criminalizing the
      procedure: American society possesses predetermined beliefs
      and cultural values regarding male circumcision and its
      effects.<sup><a href="#n368">368</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The final potential legal remedy that could
      be used by those harmed by male circumcision is a civil
      rights class action suit against hospitals and doctors who
      perform circumcision.<sup><a href="#n369">369</a></sup>
      Filing a class action lawsuit would place the blame directly
      upon the perpertrators. Hospitals should be in the forefront
      of preventing routine infant circumcision, refusing to
      endorse male circumcision unless medically warranted.<sup><a
      href="#n370">370</a></sup> A large percentage of doctors are
      aware that routine infant circumcision is unnecessary; by
      performing the procedure, doctors are culpable.<sup><a
      href="#n371">371</a></sup> The advantage to a class action
      suit is that it avoids constitutional issues;<sup><a
      href="#n372">372</a></sup> the suit is not focused on
      parental rights or religious rights, but on the institutions
      and individuals who actually carry out the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n373">373</a></sup> Such a class action suit, however,
      would fail to protect many Jewish newborns, since the
      procedure is generally performed outside a medical facility;
      only a criminal law could protect those children.</p>

      African countries among various tribal groups. The ACHPR
      could be utilized in these countries against male
      circumcision. Most of the articles applicable to female
      circumcision, with the exception of article 18, can be
      applied to protect infant males from this abusive practice.
      Although most people who practice male circumcision view it
      as positive traditonal value that should be preserved, the
      infliction of pain and suffering on infant males is torture
      and an inhuman social practice, mandating abolition.<br />

      pass a law banning female circumcision. N.D. Cent. Code
      &sect;12.1-36-01 (1997). Other states have followed North
      Dakota's lead See Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect;780 (1996);
      Minn. Stat. &sect;144.3872 (1996). As this comment went to
      press, the Governor of Illinois signed into law Illinois
      Public Act on 90-88 criminalizing female genital mutilation.
      See H.B. 106, 90th Leg., 1997-98 Reg. Sess. (Ill. 1997)
      Minnesota's law contains no specific penalty. Minn Sent.
      Guide II.A (1995). Enactment of this statute within the
      health section of the Minnesota code demonstrates the
      misconceptions surrounding male and female circumcision and
      fails to acknowledge the lack of conclusive medical evidence
      warranting male circumcision and its resulting complications.
      Tennessee's statute makes female circumcision a criminal
      offense. Tenn Code Ann. &sect;39-13-10 (1996). The statute
      specifically uses the word "circumcises" and although it
      refers to excision and and infibulation, utilizing the word
      "circumcises" is a reiteration of the hypocritical nature of
      the legislation and the United States' misconception of what
      constitutes human rights abuse.<br />
       Colorado, Louisana, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island
      have attempted to ban female circumcision. See S B 31, 60th

      domestic laws will be the United States, as it is the leader
      in routine infant circumcision. Conversely, it should be
      noted: The European medical community condemns the U.S. for a
      practice they call a barbaric violation of human rights.
      Europeans believe that males have a basic human right to an
      intact penis, a right to keep the body they were born with,
      and a right to body owner- ship and autonomy. For them it is
      a question of respect and dignity. <a
