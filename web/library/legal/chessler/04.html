      <p>IV. F<small>INAL</small>
      R<small>ECOMMENDATIONS</small></p>

      <p class="text2">Any strategy for eradication must utilize
      both domestic and international laws. Domestic laws,
      especially in democratic societies, have been approved by the
      people and are more likely to be enforced than international
      law. International law also presents the problem of the
      perception that outsiders are suggesting that traditions are
      wrong and should be abandoned; this can often lead to
      resistance and feelings of alienation and resentment. As with
      any cultural practice, those who advocate circumcision fear
      moral imperialism.<sup><a href="#n374">374</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The major difficulty in dealing with
      cultural practices occurs when entire nations overwhelmingly
      hold a belief with regard to such practices. The question of
      condemning such a cultural norm raises the issue of whether
      such countries deserve moral sovereignty and autonomy because
      of the overwhelming democratic legitimacy given to the
      practice within the nation's borders. Whether or not
      democratic legitimacy can take precedent over issues of moral
      consequence is difficult to answer. The solution, perhaps, in
      these nations and others fearing moral imperialism, lies in
      the use and dissemination of sound scientific knowledge. In
      contrast to moral condemnation, scientific knowledge, by
      pointing out biological and verifiable facts, could be used
      to contradict local myths. A country's general health and
      welfare policy fortified by scientific research would wield
      authority without making communities morally inferior.</p>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision in practice and its
      justifications must be seen as comparable to female
      circumcision. Every child should have a birthright to his or
      her entire body. The size of the cut should not be an issue;
      the focus must be placed on the innocent children who are
      forced to suffer without consent. The penis should be left in
      its natural state; circumcision takes away something that
      belongs to the child and is a violation of basic human
      rights.<sup><a href="#n375">375</a></sup> The recent call for
      anesthesia is evidence of the increased awareness of the pain
      and suffering on infant faces. If anesthesia, however, were
      "deemed necessary for infant circumcision, this would force
      most parents and medical practitioners to [think] about the
      necessity of the operation."<sup><a
      href="#n376">376</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A positive step has been taken toward the
      eradication of female circumcision. An equally positive step
      must be taken to end the practice of male circumcision.
      International doctrines and domestic remedies may prove
      helpful, but a better solution lies in a method similar to
      that being used to combat female circumcision by the
      Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting
      the Health of Women and Children.<sup><a
      href="#n377">377</a></sup> The committee organizes seminars
      and workshops to educate practicing communities of the
      harmful act. The committee also lobbies in order to gain more
      recognition for the issue of female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n378">378</a></sup> Moreover, local programs of
      education are being instituted for women and birth attendants
      with the hopes of complete eradication by the year
      2000.<sup><a href="#n379">379</a></sup> Similar outreach
      efforts should be conducted to educate communities about the
      misperceptions and dangers of male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The anti-circumcision movement is slowly
      evolving, but more must be done to fight the practice. The
      application of domestic laws must be undertaken, especially
      in the United States. The United States' failure to take
      steps against male circumcision is hypocritical. The new
      federal law banning female circumcision demonstrates the
      unequal perceptions regarding male and female
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n380">380</a></sup> Retired
      Representative Patricia Schroeder, one of the bill's
      sponsors, stated: "[t]here is no place for FGM here."<sup><a
      href="#n381">381</a></sup> By condemning one practice and not
      the other, the United States is misleading its citizens,
      virtually saying there is a place in American society for
      mutilating boys but not for girls. This is also evident in
      Senator Reid's statement to the President regarding female
      circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>Although I believe this practice is a tortuous act
        when performed on any woman, I am most concerned about it
        being performed on children and young girls under the age
        of 18--in other words, below the age at which a child can
        give consent. A child does not have the ability to consent
        or understand the significance and the consequence this
        ritual will have on her life, on her health, or on her
        dignity. Young girls are tied and held down, they scream in
        pain and are not only physically scarred, but they are
        emotionally scarred for life.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision is also performed on
      children who cannot give their consent. These children scream
      in pain as well, and evidence exists that the ritual
      procedure produces both physical and emotional scars. Senator
      Reid also states that "female [circumcision] is difficult to
      talk about, but ignoring this issue because of the discomfort
      it causes us does nothing but perpetuate the silent
      acquiescence to its practice."<sup><a
      href="#n383">383</a></sup> This is exactly what the United
      States is doing with regard to male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">With the formation of <a
      href="http:www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
      target="_blank">DOC</a> (Doctors Opposing Circumcision), a
      campaign to ban routine infant circumcision is
      underway.<sup><a href="#n384">384</a></sup> "These doctors
      recognize that no one has the right to forcibly remove sexual
      body parts from another individual. They also believe that
      doctors should have no role in this painful, unnecessary
      procedure inflicted on the newborn."<sup><a
      href="#n385">385</a></sup> The first tenet of medical
      practice is <i>First, Do No Harm</i>. Routine circumcision
      does harm and violates this oath.<sup><a
      href="#n386">386</a></sup>. Dr. Benjamin Spock, the famous
      "baby doctor." recommended in early editions of <i>Baby and
      Child Care</i>, "the child care Bible," that infant males
      should be circumcised.<sup><a href="#n">387</a></sup>
      However, even the baby doctor changed his tune. "We now know
      that [circumcision] is not the only choice,," <a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/spock.html">
      Spock</a> has since written, "nor is it agreed that it is the
      most sensible choice. My own preference, if I had the good
      fortune to have another son, would be to leave his little
      penis alone."<sup><a href="#n388">388</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Activist Organizations such as <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org" target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>
      (National Organization of Circumcision Information and
      Resource Center), and <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/"
      target="_blank">NOHARMM</a> (National Organization to Halt
      the Abuse and Ritual Mutilation of Males) are educating
      communities by documenting the ramifications of circumcision
      and lobbying for the addition of male circumcision to the law
      against female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n389">389</a></sup> NOCIRC regularly publishes a
      newsletter, sponsors symposiums on circumcision, and
      publishes several informational pamphlets for distribution at
      medical facilities.<sup><a href="#n">390</a></sup> NOHARMM
      also distributes literature about male circumcision and its
      complications and produced a film which examines the ethics
      and human rights issues regarding infant male
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n391">391</a></sup> Recent
      support groups, such as <a href="http://www.norm.org/"
      target="_blank">NORM</a> (National Organization of Restoring
      Men) and BUFF (Brothers United for Future Foreskins, and
      informing the American public about the brutal removal of
      their foreskins.<sup><a href="#n392">392</a></sup> These
      groups are pioneering non-surgical techniques for restoring
      foreskins.<sup><a href="#n393">393</a></sup> Although these
      groups demonstrate the negative effects of circumcision, time
      and money would be best spent campaigning against future male
      circumcision and not focusing on the restoration of lost
      foreskins.</p>

      <p class="text2">Efforts are being made to study the cost
      effectiveness of male circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n394">394</a></sup> A recent cost-utility analysis
      indicated:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>[t]he net, discounted lifetime dollar cost of
        routine infant circumcision is $102 per person, while the
        net discounted life-time health cost is [fourteen] hours of
        healthy life. These results suggest that the financial and
        medical advantages of routine neonatal circumcision cancel
        each other and that factors other than cost or health
        outcomes must be used in decision making.<sup><a
        href="#n395">395</a></sup></small>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">An estimated $200 million per year is spent
      on male circumcision. As a result of the economics of
      circumcision, an intolerable dynamic occurs as physicians
      seeking profits perpetuate the abuse. Male circumcision, then
      could be argued, is market driven as opposed to ideologically
      based--the notion that non-medical parents demand
      circumcision and doctors provide the service is a guise
      created by both the physicians and insurance companies. A
      recent study in Madison, Wisconsin found the following: "[A]
      30-minute circumcision goes for $260 a cut. The hospital
      takes half; the doctor takes the other half. If a doctor does
      just one circumcision a day, five days a week for an entire
      year, he or she will increase his or her annual income by
      $33,800."<sup><a href="#n396">396</a></sup> These funds could
      be better spent on researching cures to life-threatening
      diseases or on other necessary health programs.<sup><a
      href="#n397">397</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Most insurance companies cover routine
      infant male circumcision. Male circumcision opponents are
      reaching out to insurance carriers and notifying them that
      there is no medical indication for the procedure. Several
      letters from insurance companies to male circumcision
      opponents indicate that male circumcision is covered because
      of artificial consumer "demand" and imbedded cultural
      norms.<sup><a href="#n398">398</a></sup> Positive efforts,
      such as writing to and lobbying insurance companies, must
      continue. Although insurance companies acknowledge that male
      circumcision is not a medical necessity and continue to cover
      the procedure, there must be hope that eventually some will
      take notice and cease issuing policies offering
      coverage--only then maybe "more doctors and parents will
      question the procedure."<sup><a href="#n399">399</a></sup>
      Moreover, it is ironic that insurance companies continue
      covering an unnecessary medical procedure, but often refuse
      to cover procedures which are of greater medical
      value.<sup><a href="#n400">400</a></sup> This too could be
      linked to a profit driven theory. Whether or not parents
      insist upon coverage of the procedure should be
      irrelevant.</p>

      <p class="text2">Like uncircumcised women, uncircumcised men
      can clean their genitals to prevent infection and disease.
      Optimal hygiene is a necessary replacement for circumcision;
      surgery is not a solution. For this to be successful,
      however, people will have to begin discussing their genitalia
      in an open manner with their children and others. Frank
      discussion of sexuality is generally discouraged in American
      society; it is often taboo to speak of one's penis or vagina.
      The discourse must change. Both physicians and parents must
      begin to look at and discuss the real issue--the abuse of
      innocent children.</p>

      <p class="text2">In religious communities, alternatives to
      traditional ceremonies must be suggested and incorporated;
      religious leaders must begin to speak out and question
      circumcision. For example, the Jewish community has begun to
      address the issues presented by circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n401">401</a></sup> An Alternative Bris Support Group
      has been formed for parents who wish to consider a bris
      without circumcision.<sup><a href="#n402">402</a></sup>
      Parents are now beginning to perform these nontraditional
      "circumcision" ceremonies. "[T]hey want to emphasize that
      [the] covenant [is] made in the heart rather than on the
      body, and that it is equally binding."<sup><a
      href="#n403">403</a></sup> Moreover, Jewish feminists are
      speaking out against male circumcision, recognizing that it
      is inconsistent with traditional Jewish values.<sup><a
      href="#n404">404</a></sup> These women contend that opposing
      circumcision is not just men's work, but it is also women's
      and that the tow must work together because "it is not
      possible to violate or suppress the sexuality of one gender
      without doing harm to the other."<sup><a
      href="#n405">405</a></sup> Women need to continue these
      efforts and begin working with male organizations to halt the
      abuse.</p>
      <hr />
      <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;374. Culture plays
      a significant role in any call for eradication of a cultural
      norm. Any prohibition of male circumcision will be debated by
      cultural relativists and universalists. There are two obvious
      opposing concerns: "the absolute right of cultural
      self-determination' and the right of the individual not to be
      subjected to a tradition or practice that might be harmful or
      fatal." Alison T. Slack, <i>Female Circumcision: A Critical
      Appraisal</i>, 10 Hum Rts Q 437, 470 (1988). This comment,
      however, does not address the arguments made by cultural
      relativists. For a discussion of the interplay between
      cultural relativism, and human rights, see Alison D. Rentelm,

        possessing one's foreskin, the ethics of altering another
        person's body with his permission and the basic concept of
        leaving the body in its natural state should certainly
        convince most people that the opera tion should not be
        done.</small></small>

      literature to inform the public that circumcision is
      unnecessary and of the physical and psychological effects
      that may occur as a result of circumcision. The organization
      has formed a public education campaign which targets
      prospective parents. Moreover, they attempt through a
      letter-writing campaign to "discourage insurance companies
      from covering the procedure." Laurie S. Anderson, <i>Routine
      Circumcision Focus of Reconsideration, Protest</i>, Baton
      Rouge Advoc., July 4, 1993, at 9C. Tim Hammond is founder of
      <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/" target="_blank">NOHARMM</a>
      which is a children's rights project of men against infant
      circumcision. Hammond states that the group has taken a
      strong stance against infant circumcision "because it
      violates bodyownership rights of children." He thinks that a
      relatively small group of people "understand the purpose and
      function of the foreskin and the increased sexual pleasure
      that can be derived if it is left intact. Furthermore Hammond
      states that "circumcision has been blindly accepted for so
      long in this country because males have been more reluctant
      than females to talk about their bodies to their physicians,
      and more often experience embarrassment or shame when
      discussing sexuality." Jill Sell, <i>National Group Opposes
      Male Infant Circumcision, Plain Dealer</i>, July 6, 1993, at

      Intact Penis</a>. (Newsletters and pamphlets are on file with
      the <i>Buffalo Law Review</i>). NOCIRC sponsored the First
      International Symposium on Circumcision (ISC) in 1989, and on
      March 3, 1989, the general assembly adopted the Declaration
      of the First ISC. Several of the declarations tenets read as
      follows:<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small> 

      <blockquote>
        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize the
        inherent right of all human beings to an intact body.
        Without religious or racial prejudice we affirm this basic
        human right.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognize the
        foreskin, clitoris and labia are normal, functional body
        parts.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents and/or
        guardians do not have the right to consent to the surgical
        removal of their children's normal genitalia.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only persons who
        may consent to medically unnecessary procedures upon
        themselves are the individuals who have reached the age of
        consent (adulthood), and then only after being fully
        informed about the risks and benefits of the
        procedure.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We categorically
        state that circumcision has unrecognized victims....
        Physicians who practice routine circumcisions are violating
        the first maxim of medical practice, <i>Primum non
        nocere</i>, "First Do No Harm", and anyone practicing
        genital mutilation is violating Article V of the United
        Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights: <i>"No one
        shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
        degrading treatment."</i></small>

      States such as New York, New Jersey, and Maryland had the
      highest fees while the lowest were found in the Midwest, Deep
      South and Southwest. <i>Id</i>.: Theodore G. Ganiats, MD, <a

      which fuel the debate over male circumcision such as the cost
      of the procedure, the pain associated with the procedure, the
      risk of urinary tract infections, and the risk of penile
      cancer. Lawler et al., supra note 394, at 587.<br />

      that the average cost of a circumcision in California is $100
      which adds up to several million dollars a year. John M.

      Ph.D., Madison, Wisconsin (Mar. 23, 1994) (on file with the
      Buffalo Law Review, anonymity of addressee) In this letter
      the medical director states:</i></small> 

      <blockquote>
        <small>GHC has chosen to continue to cover these procedures
        because GHC feels that a substantial number of our members
        want this to be covered. In fact, there would likely be a
        significant consumer negative response if we refused to
        [perform] these . . . The support for circumcision in this
        country is cultural and societal, not medical. GHC is
        responding to societal and cultural expectations by
        covering this procedure.</small>

      <small>I d.; Letter from W. Knox Fitzpatrick, M.D., Vice
      President, BlueCross/BlueShield of Utah, to Sandy, Utah
      (Sept. 21, 1994.) (on file with the <i>Buffalo Law
      Review</i>, anonymity of addressee). In this letter the Vice
      President of Medical Affairs states that "[i]t has been known
      for decades that circumcision provides no demonstrably
      medically necessary purpose. It is rooted in our culture,
      however, and efforts to the contrary have done little to
      abolish this habit." <i>Id</i>.<br />

      1988. The debate over male circumcision is even occuring in
      Israel. Israelis are joining "the group against mutilation of
      genitals." which started a public campaign calling for a ban
      on circumcision. Ohad Gozani, <i>International World
      Bulletin</i>, Daily Telegraph, (London), May 5, 1997, at 12.
      The group describes male circumcision as "a primitive and
      barbaric act." <i>Id</i>. One of the group's organizers
      further states: "(t)his is plain abuse, particularly of
      babies." <i>Id</i>.<br />

      <blockquote>
        <small>Judaism places infinite value on life, particularly
        human life. The principal of pikuah nefesh is fundamental
        in Judaism; that is, for the sake of saving an life, even
        the Sabbath may be desecrated. Sh'mirat haguf, the
        protection of one's body is high priority. Tattooing,
        cutting the flesh and amputation are all forbidden. . . .
        The precept of ba-al tashhit also informs biblical and
        Rabbinic thought. We are taught not to destroy the fruit
        trees, even during a war. ...Circumcision is antithetical
        to this very powerful life-affirming tradition.</small>
