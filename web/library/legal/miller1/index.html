      <p class="text1">Every year, in hospitals across the United
      States, hundreds of thousands of newborn boys are strapped
      naked to a board and assaulted in their genitals by ritually
      attired practitioners known as physicians.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Although the operation is painful, it
      is performed without anesthetic; the baby's cries are
      interpreted as signs of healthy lungs, and his subsequent
      traumatized sleep explained as proof that the operation
      caused no discomfort.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Memories
      of the pain may impair his intellectual or emotional
      development.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> And the procedure,
      although safe as surgeries go, is not risk-free. Boys
      experience hemorrhage, infection, and ulceration; the
      urethral opening narrows due to scarring; and the penis may
      be bent, deformed, split, perforated, amputated, or burned
      off.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Even if the operation goes
      well, the boy ends up with genitals that are structurally
      altered. Viewed from the perspective of normal human anatomy,
      he has been mutilated.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision, considered in this light,
      might seem like a practice that lawmakers would take
      seriously and attempt to stop. Yet the law has not
      intervened. On the contrary, the law affirmatively favors and
      protects the circumcision of boys.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> What explains this phenomenon?</p>

      <p class="text1">This article explores the legal treatment of
      male circumcision from the standpoint of cultural-legal
      analysis.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> The paper builds from
      a model about the relationship of law and culture&mdash;a
      model that sees this relationship as one of identity. Law is
      part of culture. The gulf between the complex economic and
      accounting terms of a federal banking agency's capital
      adequacy regulations and an African village's ritual of
      animal sacrifice may appear vast. However, the two
      institutions are more closely related than they appear. While
      the differences between them are indeed large, they are each
      means by which human beings organize their social life within
      the matrix of a shared culture.</p>

      <p class="text1">To understand the law in its cultural
      setting, it is necessary to look to information from fields
      outside the traditional domain of legal studies. Newspapers,
      situation comedies, marriage rituals, halftime ceremonies,
      tabloids, coffee room gossip, pop music, medical research,
      and modern art, among other data, all relate to the law, and
      can appropriately be considered when we evaluate the meaning
      of laws and regulations. The expansion of the relevant data
      set implies that law in its formal aspect&mdash;statutes,
      judicial decisions, administrative regulations, legislative
      histories and the like&mdash;will share the analytical stage
n      with information not normally associated with "law."</p>

      <p class="text1">Viewed in this fashion, the relevant
      materials tend to disclose the Operation of certain basic
      distinctions: polar categories that seem to be used by many
      cultures, in various forms, as devices for sorting and
      organizing social reality. Among the most important of these
      polarities are the following: purity and pollution, health
      and harm, self and other, natural and unnatural, beauty and
      deformity, male and female, order and chaos, good and bad,
      and true and false.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Usually,
      cultures assign a thing one of the polar values&mdash;it is
      either pure or polluting, for example&mdash;but in some
      cases, a culture admits a neutral category for things that
      have neither value: they are neither pure nor polluting. For
      example, traditional Christian culture viewed circumcision as
      neutral: it was not polluting to be circumcised, although
      Christians did not engage in the practice, but neither was
      lack of circumcision purifying.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      Overall, these categories define the social world. They are
      so basic that they tend to disappear from the consciousness
      of individuals socialized in the culture. They become
      "ground" rather than "figure."<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Their operation becomes more
      apparent, however, when we view cultures different from our
      own, or when we observe fluctuations in the assignment of
      values within a given culture over a period of time.</p>

      <p class="text1">These polarities offer a potentially useful
      tool for understanding the relationship between law and
      culture. It is a tool, however, that must be used with
      caution. Concepts such as purity and pollution are abstract
      representations. While they serve to elucidate aspects of
      social reality, they are far from complete descriptions.
      These polarities do not fully account for the multifaceted,
      complex, ambivalent, and contested nature of many human
      institutions. Moreover, to the extent these categories are
      used to compare different cultures, or features of a single
      culture over time, they risk obscuring the particular factors
      that uniquely condition and define the phenomena under
      examination. Even within a culture at a given time, these
      categories are not easily separated from one another.
      Something that is categorized as pure rather than polluting
      is also likely to be assigned values of being good, true,
      healthful, beautiful, and familiar. It is possible, indeed,
      that these polarities reflect different aspects of a single
      overarching social filter that separates what is to be
      brought close from what is to be cast out. Subject to these
      caveats, however, there is value to a cultural-legal analysis
      based on how a system defines its reality along basic
      polarities of social meaning. By applying these concepts,
      with due attention to their analytical limitations, we can
      identify aspects of social attitudes, values and beliefs that
      would otherwise be obscured, and can relate these aspects to
      one another in a more coherent fashion. By this method, we
      can draw out the cultural substrate of laws, and thus can
      offer a deeper and more nuanced interpretation of legal
      institutions than would be possible if we restricted the
      field of analysis to categories of information traditionally
      deemed relevant to legal studies.</p>

      <p class="text1">Applying cultural-legal analysis, this
      article divides Western, and specifically American, attitudes
      towards circumcision into three periods. For many centuries
      prior to the late nineteenth century, few Christian boys were
      circumcised, and prophylactic neonatal circumcision was
      unknown.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Circumcision of boys
      was limited principally to Jews, whose traditions were
      usually respected but were viewed with suspicion and kept at
      a distance by the broader Christian society. Christian
      society's response to circumcision during this period was
      ambivalent, reflecting the compromise within the early
      Christian church that established circumcision of the flesh
      as meaningless.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The
      neutrality of circumcision in Christian doctrine had
      important consequences for the categories that define and
      enforce cultural attitudes. Male circumcision was viewed as
      neither pure nor polluting, neither good nor bad, and neither
      true nor false. On the other hand, some cultural polarities
      worked against the adoption of circumcision among Christians.
      Because Christians did not circumcise their children, and
      Jews did, the state of being circumcised was classified
      within the dominant Christian culture as alien and unnatural.
      Likewise, Christian culture defined the uncircumcised phallus
      as aesthetically normative.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      And because of its unfamiliarity, the operation of
      circumcision was seen as chaotic rather than orderly. These
      cultural values gave inertia to the tradition of not
      circumcising males.</p>

      <p class="text1">During the last decades of the nineteenth
      and the first decades of the twentieth centuries, a
      remarkable shift occurred in the English-speaking
      world.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Physicians acting as
      norm entrepreneurs reconceived the phallus.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> They portrayed the uncircumcised
      penis as polluted, unnatural, harmful, alien, effeminized and
      disfigured, and depicted circumcision as true, orderly, and
      good. In a remarkably brief period of time, circumcision
      became ubiquitous: first as a remedy for disease, and later
      as a prophylactic procedure administered within a few days of
      birth.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> American society
      reached a "tipping point," at which the movement towards
      circumcision gained momentum and became nearly
      universal.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> In 1977,
      circumcision was the most common operation performed on males
      in the United States.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> It is
      still performed on approximately six out of every ten infant
      boys in this country.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> The
      triumph of circumcision continued even after its original
      rationales&mdash;deterring masturbation and spermatorrhoea
      (wet dreams) and treating miscellaneous other
      disorders&mdash;were discredited.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> Other purposes were supplied to make
      up for the deficit: circumcision was said to protect against
      penile cancer and urinary tract infections, and, lately, to
      reduce the risk of HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Despite continuing, although weakening,
      medical support, a grassroots movement against male
      circumcision developed during the 1980s and 1990s.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> Through persistent lobbying and
      publicity, these activists began to undermine the American
      social consensus. Like the physicians of the nineteenth
      century who promoted circumcision by manipulating cultural
      meanings, the anti-circumcision groups, acting as norm
      entrepreneurs, are now rehabilitating the prepuce by
      re-conceptualizing its place in the category system that
      defines our social reality. They promote the uncircumcised
      penis as pure, healthy, masculine, attractive, familiar, and
      natural, and portray circumcision as chaotic, false, and
      bad.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">These arguments against circumcision have
      taken root in several English-speaking countries.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> To date, American culture has not
      followed suit, although rates have dropped even here.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> Circumcision of boys remains
      normative, and the cultural revisionism of anti-circumcision
      norm entrepreneurs remains at the fringes of American public
      discourse. The persistence of the operation in the United
      States may be due to the insularity of a continent-sized
      country, to the influence of large Jewish and Muslim
      populations, or to other factors. Yet even the United States
      is again approaching a tipping point when circumcision rates
      fall precipitously as parents come to believe that their
      children will not suffer a stigma if uncircumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> A generation from now, it is
      probable that only a minority of American newborn boys will
      be circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text1">Even as circumcision practices and attitudes
      in the United States change, it is unlikely that culture will
      move to the point of condemning the procedure out of hand.
      Efforts by contemporary norm entrepreneurs to stigmatize
      circumcision are met with powerful opposition. Jews and
      Muslims may well feel uncomfortable with efforts to denigrate
      a precious religious heritage. Feminists, public health
      officials, and human rights advocates who oppose female
      genital mutilation in Africa may seek to avoid being linked
      with anti-circumcision advocates at home for different
      reasons. If male and female genital surgeries are seen as
      morally or physiologically equivalent, then people who
      support male circumcision in the United States might rethink
      their opposition to female genital mutilation abroad.
      Moreover, any identification between the male and female
      procedures would tend to undermine a core feminist belief
      about female genital mutilation, namely that it is an
      operation that embodies and enforces male domination of
      women's sexuality.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Opposition
      from these groups makes it unlikely that the normative image
      now being promoted by anti-circumcision advocates will
      receive full acceptance in American culture. More likely, the
      culture will revert to the condition it occupied before the
      nineteenth century revolution in attitudes towards
      circumcision. Circumcision will not be practiced by most
      Americans, but the procedure will not be stigmatized.</p>

      <p class="text1">Such a moderate change in cultural attitudes
      should stimulate limited changes in the law. Given that
      powerful groups oppose the outright stigmatization of
      circumcision, it is unlikely that the law will prohibit the
      practice, even when conducted for non-religious reasons.
      Changes will probably take place at the margin, however. As
      cultural attitudes shift, courts may demand a higher level of
      informed consent to the operation, and may be more willing to
      impose liability on physicians or hospitals that circumcise
      people by surprise or against their (or their parents')
      wishes. States may refuse to reimburse for circumcisions
      under Medicaid programs. Courts and juries may look with
      greater favor on plaintiffs who claim injuries from botched
      circumcisions. Furthermore, the law is likely to penalize
      physicians or hospitals for performing circumcision without
      anesthesia, or for failing to inform patients or their
      guardians that pain-reducing medication is available. In
      other words, the law is likely to evolve along with changes
      in social attitudes, but because the attitudinal changes are
      likely to be moderate, the legal response can be expected to
      be limited as well. This article proceeds as follows. Section
      I addresses the legal treatment of circumcision in the United
      States. Section II describes cultural attitudes in Western
      society prior to the end of the nineteenth century. Section
      III covers the rapid realignment of attitudes that occurred
      during and after the Victorian era. Section IV describes
      contemporary efforts to eradicate routine neonatal
      circumcision. Section V discusses prospects for the future,
      followed by a brief conclusion.</p>

      <p class="text1">At present, no law in the United States
      prohibits circumcision of males. Indeed, U.S. law favors
      circumcision, providing special exemptions and dispensations
      that are not available for other medical procedures. Several
      states specifically exempt circumcision from the ambit of
      laws prohibiting ritual abuse,<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> and rules regulating the
      unauthorized practice ofmedicine exempt Jewish ritual
      circumcisers (mohelim).<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> Both
      ritual and medical circumcisions, in short, are freely
      available under American law.</p>

      <p class="text1">Tort law does provide a remedy if a
      circumcision is botched.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup>
      However, the tort regime is not particularly effective as a
      means of regulating the procedure. Because circumcision only
      occasionally results in outcomes bad enough to generate a
      lawsuit, the vast majority of complications from circumcision
      are not compensated, even when liability may be
      established.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> Moreover,
      because complications can follow properly performed
      circumcisions, establishing liability is difficult even when
      the outcome is more serious. The doctrine of <i>res ipsa
      loquitur</i> is not available to establish liability from bad
      results.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> In addition, the
      patient may not discover or come to appreciate the full harm
      from the procedure until a substantial period of time has
      elapsed, resulting in the loss of rights under the statute of
      limitations.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The law provides a remedy, in theory, for
      unauthorized circumcisions: a patient or his representative
      may be able to sue for battery if the operation is performed
      without informed consent.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> But
      this rule does nothing to protect the persons on whom the
      procedure is actually performed, who are nearly always
      children below the age of consent. The child's parents
      consent to the procedure.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup>
      When these children grow up, they may decide that they would
      rather not be circumcised, but by then it is too late.
      Further, the informed consent requirement is not always
      effective to provide a remedy against unauthorized
      circumcisions. In <i>Banks v. Wright</i>, for example, the
      patient was admitted to the hospital for a heart bypass
      operation and awoke to find himself circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> A Louisiana appeals court held that
      although there had been no consent, the operation did not
      constitute a battery.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> The
      physician's liability could only be based, if at all, on a
      theory of negligent failure to disclose risks that could have
      influenced a reasonable person's decision whether to go
      forward with the procedure.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup>
      In <i>East v. United States</i>, the court held that no
      breach of the duty to provide informed consent existed, even
      though the patient was never advised that a circumcision
      might be performed during penile implant surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> The patient failed to demonstrate
      that the circumcision was unnecessary and did not establish
      that he would have refused consent if properly
      informed.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> Likewise, the court
      in <i>Kalina v. General Hospital of Syracuse</i> held that a
      hospital was not liable to the parents for circumcising their
      child when the parents had specifically informed the hospital
      that they wished to perform a ritual circumcision away from
      the hospital setting.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> The
      thrust of these and other cases is that circumcision is a
      harmless and, in fact, a generally helpful operation that
      should not be placed under excessive legal regulation.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The rather <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to
      male circumcision contrasts markedly with the legal treatment
      of female genital mutilation. At least nine U.S. states have
      adopted laws prohibiting genital mutilation of girls and
      imposing criminal sanctions for violations: Delaware
      (1996),<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> Illinois
      (1998),<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> Maryland
      (1998),<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> Minnesota
      (1994),<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> North Dakota
      (1995),<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> New
      York(1997),<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup> Rhode Island
      (1996),<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> Tennessee
      (1996),<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup> and Wisconsin
      (1997).<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> At the federal level,
      female genital mutilation is prohibited by the Federal
      Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act, enacted in
      1996.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> Federal immigration law
      is also used in the campaign against female genital
      mutilation. Several African women have sought asylum in the
      United States on the ground that they or their daughters
      faced a threat of genital mutilation if they returned
      home.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> These women have
      occasionally succeeded. In one highly publicized case from
      1996, the United States Board of Immigration Appeals granted
      asylum to a woman who claimed she was fleeing the threat of
      genital mutilation in her home country.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Given the contrast between the treatment of
      male and female genital surgeries, we might expect to see the
      disparate treatment challenged as inappropriate or even
      unconstitutional. A few commentators advocate this reasoning.
      William E. Brigman, in a 1984-85 paper in the <i>Journal of
      Family Law</i>, observed that a form of "cultural
      astigmatism" prevents Americans from perceiving that routine
      neonatal circumcision of males in the United States is the
      "most widespread form of child abuse in society
      today."<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> Similarly, Abbie J.
      Chessler concludes that male circumcision is just as barbaric
      and unjustifiable as female circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> Chessler condemns the failure to
      equate the procedures as hypocritical. She argues that the
      "double standard" which "accepts and condones male
      circumcision but condemns female circumcision makes the
      concept of human rights meaningless."<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> In her 1999 book, <i>The Whole
      Woman</i>, Germaine Greer also suggests that circumcision and
      female genital mutilation can be compared.<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> A student note by Shea Lita Bond,
      published in 1999, takes the same position.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents of male circumcision have also
      attempted, albeit ineffectually, to challenge the procedure
      in court on grounds of sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in
      <i>Fishbeck v. North Dakota</i> claimed that a state's female
      genital mutilation law deprived males of the equal protection
      of the law because it did not impose similar sanctions for
      male circumcision.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> The
      federal courts managed to drop this hot potato by holding
      that the plaintiffs lacked standing to contest the alleged
      disparity in treatment.<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> As of
      yet there has been no ruling on the merits of a gender
      discrimination challenge to male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">These commentators and activists are in the
      distinct minority. For Western observers generally, female
      genital mutilation and male circumcision are fundamentally
      different&mdash;so different that it is wrong to consider
      them in the same category. Most observers simply ignore the
      issue.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> When the Western
      narrative does address the question, it typically asserts
      that male and female genital procedures differ without
      offering reasons.<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> Arguments
      that the procedures might be comparable are met with disdain,
      mockery, or contempt: the comparison is "bizarre"<sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup> or "crass."<sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The paucity of analysis that one encounters
      in the Western narrative is not itself an accident: it
      illustrates the pervasive power of the West's cultural
      beliefs. The legal and ideological background, displaying
      only minimal regulation of the process which genitally
      mutilates boys and a powerful norm against genitally
      mutilating girls, does not exist independent of the culture.
      On the contrary, the laws and judicial decisions that relate
      to genital mutilation serve as the visible embodiment of a
      deep-seated system of social attitudes, norms, and beliefs.
      This phenomenon has roots extending back thousands of years
      in Western culture. These legal materials may appear
      straightforward and unexceptional, but viewed in their
      cultural context, they are remarkable.</p>

      <p class="text1">This section examines attitudes toward
      circumcision from the earliest recorded sources until the
      middle of the nineteenth century.<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> The purpose of the present
      discussion is to identify general cultural attitudes about
      male circumcision in order to place these attitudes in their
      proper historical context. The analysis in this section
      provides a reference point for subsequent discussion of

        <p class="section"><i>A. Background</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Males as well as females are genitally
      altered in many cultures. Indeed, male genital surgery is
      more prevalent; approximately 13.3 million boys are operated
      on every year as compared with 2 million girls.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> The most familiar form of male
      genital surgery is circumcision, the removal of the prepuce
      or foreskin, which is a sheath of skin surrounding the glans
      (or head) of the penis in humans and other mammals.<sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup> Yet circumcision is only one type of
      male genital surgery. Other forms include symbolic
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup>
      incision,<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> penile
      cutting,<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup> skin flaying,<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> epispasm (foreskin elongation or
      restoration),<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> infibulation
      (fastening the foreskin over the glans),<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> urethral routing or
      cauterization,<sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup> duct
      resection,<sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup> and castration
      both actual<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> and
      imagined.<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup> The focus of the
      present study, however, is on circumcision per se&mdash;the
      removal of the male foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text1">Male circumcision is an ancient
      practice,<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup> perhaps dating back
      to the Stone Age.<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup> Herodotus,
      the Greek historian of the fifth century BCE,<sup><a
      href="#n81">81</a></sup> noted the antiquity of the custom in
      his time and speculated that it had originated in Egypt and
      spread from there outward across the Levant.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> Egyptian tomb scenes from the Old
      Kingdom show priests performing the ritual on young
      noblemen;<sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup> in one, the priest
      assures the boy that the procedure will not hurt.<sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup> Syrian warriors with circumcised
      genitalia are depicted on artifacts from the third millennium
      BCE, or five thousand years ago.<sup><a
      href="#n85">85</a></sup> The Israelites practiced the custom
      beginning, according to the book of Genesis, with the
      circumcision of Abraham at age ninety-nine.<sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup> Arabian tribes followed similar
      practices, a tradition recorded in the circumcision of
      Ishmael.<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Other ancient peoples did not engage in male
      genital surgery. The "ice man" whose 5,000-year-old frozen
      body emerged out of a Swiss glacier a few years ago turns out
      not to have been circumcised.<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup>
      In the Middle East, residents of Shechem, a town in the
      Canaanite highlands, were apparently uncircumcised at one
      time. The Bible records how the Shechemite men agreed to be
      circumcised en masse in order to appease the sons of Jacob,
      who were outraged at the rape of their sister by a Shechemite
      prince.<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> The Philistines,
      traditional enemies of the Israelites, were also
      uncircumcised. When Saul wanted to get rid of David as a
      suitor for his daughter Michal, he demanded a hundred
      Philistine foreskins as a dowry; the foreskins were certain
      to be those of Philistines because all the Israelites would
      have been circumcised.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup> The
      Babylonians, who conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel in
      722 BCE, were not circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup> Neither were the ancient Greeks and
      Romans.<sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Ritual circumcision of males is practiced in
      many cultures today. Among Jews, the tradition is to
      circumcise boys eight days after birth.<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup> The bris is a joyous occasion to
      which guests are invited from near and far.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup> If possible, ten men constitute a
      minyan, or quorum required under religious law, to conduct
      worship services. The parents select a godmother and a
      godfather (sandak) for the ceremony. The mother hands the
      child to the godmother, who in turn passes him to the
      godfather, whose job is to hold the child during the miloh
      (cutting). The ritual expert, or mohel, performs the
      operation and recites the prescribed prayers.<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup> At the mezizah, the traditional (but
      now largely abandoned) culmination of the ritual, the mohel
      sips wine and sucks the infant's penis, spitting the mixture
      of blood and wine into a glass.<sup><a
      href="#n96">96</a></sup> Afterwards, the assembled crowd
      joins in a festive meal, the suedo shel mitzvo. Jews of all
      degrees of observance and assimilation practice circumcision,
      although Reform Jews may request that a doctor perform the
      operation in a hospital.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Muslims also circumcise boys as a matter of
      religious obligation.<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup> There
      is no set time for circumcision in Islamic cultures, so long
      as the procedure occurs by the time the boy reaches
      adulthood.<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup> Because there is
      no fixed time for the ritual, Muslim circumcisions can be
      performed on boys en masse. P.C. Remondino, a nineteenth
      century circumcision advocate, describes the festivities
      accompanying a traditional Arab circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> The operation itself was preceded
      by eight days of feasting by the entire community. Everyone
      dressed up and engaged in merry-making and rejoicing. Young
      men conducted mock battles. Dancing, singing and drumming
      accompanied the feasts and other ceremonies. On the eve of
      the circumcisions, the entire community attended a grand
      banquet. The following day, the candidates for initiation
      were dressed in yellow silk gowns and seated on pans of sand
      previously collected by the women during a moonlight
      expedition. An assistant fixed each child's arms and held his
      thighs apart from behind. The circumciser removed the
      foreskin with a knife and dressed the wound. Meanwhile, the
      women in the gallery sang, chanted, and banged on drums,
      cymbals and saucepans. This drowned out the cries of the
      children and distracted them from their pain. At the close of
      the ceremonies, the prepuces were buried amidst great
      rejoicing.</p>

      <p class="text1">The circumcision of boys is also common in
      Africa.<sup><a href="#n101">101</a></sup> The nature of the
      ritual on this continent varies across ethnic groups. Among
      the Xhosa of South Africa, circumcisions take place in the
      bush away from the routine of village life.<sup><a
      href="#n102">102</a></sup> These rituals are entirely set
      apart for men; women are not allowed to participate. Boys
      live in the initiates' camps for up to a month after their
      circumcision. Their separation from ordinary society is
      reinforced by dress and diet; they daub their faces with
      white paint, wear blankets, and restrict their diet.<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup> Those that do not survive the
      ritual are seen as preordained not to achieve manhood.<sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup> The ritual among the Gikuyu of
      Kenya is also part of an extended coming-of-age ceremony.
      Traditionally, the candidate's parents select a knowledgeable
      man to act as the boy's mutiri, or adviser; his job is
      to"prepare the boy for initiation, take care of him through
      the operation by physically supporting him, take care of the
      wound, and guide him afterwards."<sup><a
      href="#n105">105</a></sup> The mutiri functions as a mentor,
      instructing the initiate on how to relate to women and
      maintain sexual discipline.<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup>
      Many variations in the circumcision ritual are attested among
      other African peoples.<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Traditional cultures offer a number of
      rationales for circumcision. It is said to be a deeply rooted
      part of the people's history.<sup><a
      href="#n108">108</a></sup> The procedure may be necessary in
      order to marry.<sup><a href="#n109">109</a></sup> It cements
      mutual respect among men.<sup><a href="#n110">110</a></sup>
      It wards off evil or appeases supernatural forces.<sup><a
      href="#n111">111</a></sup> It contributes to social stability
      and coherence, marks identity, and confers honor.<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup> It protects against sexually
      transmitted diseases,<sup><a href="#n113">113</a></sup>
      enhances fertility,<sup><a href="#n114">114</a></sup>
      promotes hygiene,<sup><a href="#n115">115</a></sup> confers
      purity, <sup><a href="#n116"></a></sup> and controls
      sexuality.<sup><a href="#n117">117</a></sup> Whatever the
      rationale, the traditions of male genital surgeries are
      deeply embedded in the cultures where they flourish.<sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Ritual circumcision of boys is a durable
      tradition. Jews of ancient times refused to abandon the
      practice despite enormous pressure to do so. In 167 BCE the
      Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV, as part of a campaign to
      Hellenise the Jews, condemned to death every Hebrew who
      allowed a son to be circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup> The Jews responded with the
      Maccabean revolt, a campaign of guerrilla warfare that
      resulted in major victories for the rebels and, eventually, a
      peace treaty that restored Jewish ritual prerogatives.<sup><a
      href="#n120">120</a></sup> When the Roman Emperor Hadrian
      tried the same thing a few centuries later, the Jews revolted
      under Bar Kokhba in 132 CE.<sup><a href="#n121">121</a></sup>
      Although the rebellion was suppressed, Jews did not abandon
      circumcision. Perhaps because of the vigor with which
      traditional cultures protect their rituals of circumcision
      against outside interference, few imperial powers have
      emulated the Seleucids or Romans and suppressed
      circumcisions, either among the Jews or among other
      traditional peoples. Unlike many religions, Christianity does
      not practice circumcision. The reasons are historical. The
      unity of the early Christian church was "threatened and
      probably fractured" over the issue.<sup><a
      href="#n122">122</a></sup> Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles,
      viewed circumcision as meaningless and irrelevant.<sup><a
      href="#n123">123</a></sup> Other early Christians who viewed
      themselves as Jews opposed Paul's efforts.<sup><a
      href="#n124">124</a></sup> Eventually, Paul prevailed&mdash;a
      victory with profound consequences for the future of Western
      culture. The Church abandoned circumcision under the doctrine
      that Christ had abolished circumcision and other ritual
      separations between Jew and Gentile.<sup><a
      href="#n125">125</a></sup> Christian circumcision was
      spiritualized into a "circumcision of the heart."<sup><a
      href="#n126">126</a></sup> This change permitted free
      admission of Gentiles into the Christian church and resulted
      in the nearly complete rejection of circumcision among
      Christians.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision became a mark, for Christians,
      of how they were different from Jews. Indeed, some early
      Jewish converts to Christianity apparently attempted to
      reverse their circumcisions. Paul disapproved the practice,
      instructing the Corinthians that if they were called to the
      Church after being circumcised, they should not "seek to
      remove the marks of circumcision."<sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup> Paul treated the physical ritual
      of circumcision as meaningless, and therefore unimportant: "
      circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but
      obeying the commandments of God is everything."<sup><a
      href="#n128">128</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Although Christians eschewed circumcision,
      they displayed a curious fascination with the ritual. The
      Western calendar is based on the day of Christ's
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n129">129</a></sup> The Catholic
      Church celebrates the Feast of the Circumcision at the New
      Year. J.S. Bach's Christmas Oratorio contains a cantata
      dedicated to the circumcision, while some fine examples of
      Renaissance art&mdash;notably Federico Barocci's "The
      Circumcision of Christ"&mdash;celebrate the theme.<sup><a
      href="#n130">130</a></sup> The prepuce of the infant Jesus
      was one of the most important holy relics of the Middle
      Ages,<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> with at least twelve
      abbeys claiming the object.<sup><a href="#n132">132</a></sup>
      Thus, while Christians did not themselves become circumcised,
      they did not deny, and even celebrated, the circumcision of
      their Messiah. Because Christians lacked enthusiasm for
      circumcision, the practice was uncommon prior to the late
      nineteenth century.<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup> Many
      births occurred at home, attended by midwives or by
      physicians untrained in this particular surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup> The only practitioners who
      specialized in the operation were the Jewish mohelim, who
      would not ordinarily attend a Christian child. Outside the
      Jewish faith, circumcision was reserved for the treatment of
      physiological conditions.<sup><a href="#n135">135</a></sup>
      For most Christians, circumcision was not even an option.</p>

      <center>
        <p class="section"><i>B. Culture</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">We turn to the cultural aspects of Western
      attitudes toward circumcision prior to the turn of the
      twentieth century. For approximately nineteen centuries, as
      we have seen, Christian men were not circumcised, although
      there was no attempt to suppress circumcision when it
      occurred among Jews. This cultural norm can be analyzed using
      the system of polarities discussed in the introduction to
      this article. Western culture gave circumcision a neutral
      status with respect to some of these polarities and a
      negative status with respect to others. Overall, the
      polarities operated to deter circumcision among the dominant
      culture.</p>

      <p class="text1">1. Purity and Pollution</p>

      <p class="text1">Attitudes toward circumcision in Western
      culture differed markedly between the Jewish and Christian
      populations. For Jews, circumcision was a purifying ritual.
      Rabbinic interpretation linked the blood of the paschal lamb,
      shed to commemorate God's deliverance of Israel from Egyptian
      bondage, with the blood of circumcision, symbolizing God's
      covenant with Abraham.<sup><a href="#n136">136</a></sup>
      Circumcision blood, in Rabbinic thought, was explicitly
      contrasted with menstrual blood, which was viewed as
      "uncontrolled, impure, and dangerous."<sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup> Circumcision, moreover, was a
      valuable protection against falling into pollution.
      Maimonides, a physician as well as a philosopher, observed
      that the operation reduced the power of the affected
      organ.<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup> Thus, men could
      better resist the temptation to sin.</p>

      <p class="text1">For Christians, in contrast, circumcision
      was seen as neither pure nor polluting. This does not mean
      that the culture took no position on thepurity or impurity of
      circumcision. Christian society denied that circumcision was
      polluting and equally denied that it was purifying. The
      practice occupied a neutral ground between purity and
      pollution. This followed from the original compromise that
      made Christianity more than a Jewish sect; as Paul declared,
      circumcision was nothing and uncircumcision was nothing.
      Because physical circumcision had no spiritual meaning, it
      could be neither polluting nor purifying within Christian
      culture.</p>

      <p class="text1">As a practical matter, the classification of
      circumcision as neither pure nor polluting did inhibit
      circumcision. Because Christians were not circumcised, those
      who wanted to promote the procedure bore the burden of
      changing cultural norms. The culture's neutrality ruled out
      arguments that non-circumcision was polluting, or
      circumcision purifying. Because these are some of the most
      powerful arguments available to induce cultural change, their
      unavailability tended to reinforce the status quo.<sup><a
      href="#n139">139</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">2. Health and Harm</p>

      <p class="text1">The polarity of health and harm was not a
      major factor in the cultural treatment of circumcision prior
      to the end of the nineteenth century. For Jews, the benefits
      of circumcision were principally spiritual rather than
      material. Even Maimonides, a distinguished physician, did not
      promote circumcision as healthful. His focus on the medical
      aspects of circumcision related to methods for reducing pain
      or the application of religious law to cases in which the
      procedure was likely to cause injury or death.<sup><a
      href="#n140">140</a></sup> Christian culture, too, paid
      little attention to the health consequences of circumcision.
      Although beginning in the sixteenth century, physicians and
      anatomists began to posit benefits from the prepuce, such as
      protecting the glans from harm,<sup><a
      href="#n141">141</a></sup> until late in the nineteenth
      century, concerns about health and harm appear to have been
      secondary at best in shaping cultural attitudes.</p>

      <p class="text1">3. Self and Other</p>

      <p class="text1">Christian and Jewish attitudes toward
      circumcision also differed markedly along the polarity of
      self and other. For Jews, circumcision was by far the most
      salient mark of identity&mdash;it was the feature that
      distinguished a Jew from other peoples, a covenant demanded
      by God for all Jews. Circumcision, said Maimonides, was a
      reliable indicator of a person's Jewish identity because it
      was painful.<sup><a href="#n142">142</a></sup> People would
      not readily attempt to counterfeit a Jewish identity if the
      cost was undergoing such a procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n143">143</a></sup> Circumcision for Jews was an
      essential mark of self and, accordingly, was highly esteemed
      within Jewish culture.</p>

      <p class="text1">For Christians, on the other hand, the
      polarity of self and other worked to deter circumcision in
      Western culture. For Christians, circumcision appeared as
      foreign, alien, and grotesque.<sup><a
      href="#n144">144</a></sup> Being uncircumcised was an
      indication of Christian, as opposed to Jewish, identity. A
      person who prided himself on being a Christian would not want
      to lose the mark of identity that lack of circumcision
      provided. If a man was circumcised, on the other hand, people
      who observed him might infer that he was Jewish, an
      attribution many Christians undoubtedly wished to avoid.
      Another aspect of identity was the connection between boys
      and their fathers. It would be odd, and disquieting, for the
      son to observe that his own anatomy differed from that of his
      father. Thus, if the father was not circumcised, the son
      would probably not be circumcised either. This factor tended
      to lend inertia to the social practice. In traditional
      Western culture, therefore, the circumcised phallus was
      "other," and the uncircumcised phallus was "self."</p>

      <p class="text1">4. Natural and Unnatural</p>

      <p class="text1">Traditional Christian culture tended to view
      alterations in the human body as intrusions on the natural
      order and, therefore, as contrary to divine will. Renaissance
      anatomist Jacopo Berengario da Carpi, for example, believed
      that Jewish circumcision, because it cut away a valuable
      layer of protection for the glans, was "against the intent of
      nature."<sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> To remove the
      foreskin both altered the natural anatomy and, implicitly,
      questioned the utility of God's design. As anatomical science
      developed, Christian researchers reinforced the idea of the
      prepuce's "naturalness" by conceptualizing it as an integral
      part of the penis.<sup><a href="#n146">146</a></sup> Like any
      other part of the natural anatomy, the prepuce could fall
      prey to disease, but this was not a sufficient justification
      for its routine removal. Rather, the preferred approach was
      to retain as much of the organ as possible consistent with
      treating the disease.<sup><a href="#n147">147</a></sup> Thus
      the polarity of natural and unnatural favored continuing the
      tradition of not circumcising Christian males.</p>

      <p class="text1">Jewish thinkers gave much thought to the
      question of the naturalness of circumcision. Maimonides asked
      how a natural thing&mdash;the uncircumcised
      phallus&mdash;could be defective.<sup><a
      href="#n148">148</a></sup> His philosophically sophisticated
      answer was that circumcision was not actually a correction of
      a natural condition.<sup><a href="#n149">149</a></sup> The
      problem was that men were in an artificial condition because
      the moral qualities of the soul were adversely affected by
      bodily urges.<sup><a href="#n150">150</a></sup> To bring
      people into a condition of conformity with divine law, it was
      therefore appropriate and useful to subdue the flesh.<sup><a
      href="#n151">151</a></sup> This could be accomplished by the
      process of driving the law into the body by the operation of
      the intellect, but it could also be achieved by correcting
      conditions of the body that were especially conducive to sin.
      Circumcision, in other words, was not actually an alteration
      of natural conditions but rather a measure taken so men could
      refrain from sin and thus realize their natural relationship
      with God. Through this reasoning, Maimonides argued that
      circumcision was not, in fact, an unnatural state even though
      it involved the alteration of the physical body.</p>

      <p class="text1">5. Beauty and Deformity</p>

      <p class="text1">Western aesthetics emphasized the
      uncircumcised phallus as the paragon of masculine beauty. In
      large measure, this concept of beautiful male genitals was
      inherited from the Greeks and Romans, whose sculptures of
      nude men and boys always displayed the genitals in their
      uncut state.<sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup> These images
      of beauty received new attention, and emulation, in Western
      art during the Renaissance. Greek or Roman deities and
      symbolic figures, such as Nicola Pisano's Fortitude (1260),
      are invariably shown as uncircumcised. The same was true for
      Jewish figures from the Bible, even though the painters and
      their audience knew that these individuals were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup>
      Michaelangelo's David (1492), perhaps the most famous nude
      male sculpture of all time, is uncircumcised, as is
      Donatello's David (1430s-1450s).<sup><a
      href="#n154">154</a></sup> Even Jesus appears uncircumcised
      as an older child in Parmigianino's Madonna of the Rose
      (1529-30)<sup><a href="#n155">155</a></sup> or as an adult,
      in Michaelangelo's Crucifix.<sup><a
      href="#n156">156</a></sup> In short, the Western aesthetic of
      the phallus overwhelmingly evoked the image of the intact
      organ.</p>

      <p class="text1">6. Male and Female</p>

      <p class="text1">In traditional Christian culture, the
      polarity of male and female appears to have little bearing on
      the status of circumcision. A man was a man whether or not he
      was circumcised. Circumcision neither added to a man's
      gender, nor detracted from it. Nor was there anything in the
      lack of circumcision that either enhanced a person's manhood
      or detracted from it. Thus, circumcision was coded neutrally
      in Christian culture along the gender dimension.</p>

      <p class="text1">7. Order and Chaos</p>

      <p class="text1">For Jews, circumcision was coded in
      traditional culture as manifesting order rather than chaos.
      In part, the order reflected the fixed elements of the bris,
      which repeated in carefully orchestrated fashion a set of
      actions by the congregation and the mohel, which had been
      undertaken by Jews since time immemorial and was affirmed
      within Jewish culture as ordained by divine command. The
      ritual reflected the order of the universe and the submission
      to divine law that is emblematic of Jewish culture. As one
      Midrashic text states it, " circumcision is great since, but
      for that, the Holy one would not have created his
      world."<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision, for Jews, also reflected order
      rather than chaos insofar as it was considered a remedy
      against excessive sexuality. Maimonides argued that
      circumcision weakened the sexual organ in men and decreased
      their desire for sexual intercourse. By suppressing a source
      of temptation, circumcision thereby enhanced capacities for
      spirituality and reduced the incentive to sin.<sup><a
      href="#n158">158</a></sup> Maimonides cleverly used this
      argument, not only as an affirmative justification for the
      procedure, but as an explanation for why something that might
      appear to be disorderly was in fact orderly. Maimonides did
      not deny that circumcision was traumatic, painful, bloody and
      violent. But the very trauma imposed by the procedure, which
      might appear from the outside as a chaotic event, was in fact
      necessary to induce order in human society and in the
      relationship between man and God. The trauma was also
      necessary to effect a permanent weakening of the sexual urge
      in men as they reached adulthood.<sup><a
      href="#n159">159</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">From the Christian perspective, circumcision
      was not strongly coded as either chaotic or orderly, although
      the images of the circumcision of Christ displayed the ritual
      as a blessed and peaceful event. During the nineteenth
      century, however, as the procedure began to be employed by
      physicians to treat various diseases and conditions of the
      penis, it came to be seen as somewhat chaotic. This was a
      function of surgical knowledge and technology. Circumcision
      was painful, cutting, as it did, through some of the most
      sensitive tissues in the body. The pain could be reduced by
      anesthetics, but the available painkillers at the end of the
      nineteenth century were not very safe.<sup><a
      href="#n160">160</a></sup> And even if the patient did well
      with the anesthetic, he would experience pain during
      recovery. Moreover, prior to the late nineteenth century,
      surgeons knew little of antisepsis and regularly operated in
      non-sterile conditions.<sup><a href="#n161">161</a></sup>
      Infection was a frequent side effect of any operation, and
      circumcision was no exception. Candidates for circumcision
      could not have looked forward with much pleasure to the
      possibility of a gangrenous penis. Finally, most physicians
      and surgeons did not know how to perform circumcisions. As
      physician W.W. Sinclair remarked in 1889, the subject "is
      passed over very casually by the majority of writers of
      surgical works, or, on the other hand, made rather
      complicated."<sup><a href="#n162">162</a></sup> The available
      techniques were "formidable," "tedious," "slippery,""bloody,"
      "inexact," and "inelegant."<sup><a href="#n163">163</a></sup>
      Even as late as 1905, no generally accepted method of
      circumcision had been devised, leaving the operation to the
      physician's discretion.<sup><a href="#n164">164</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">8. Good and Bad</p>

      <p class="text1">Traditional Western culture coded
      circumcision as neither good nor bad. The moral neutrality of
      circumcision followed from Paul's injunction that physical
      circumcision is nothing&mdash;neither good nor bad&mdash;and
      that what matters is the circumcision of the heart that is
      not marked in any physical way.<sup><a
      href="#n165">165</a></sup> On the other hand, during the
      first part of the nineteenth century, many physicians
      entertained a negative moral view of circumcision from the
      standpoint of their professional discipline. The operation,
      in the view of these professionals, was "barbarous" and
      unwarrantable, except when performed for reasons of medical
      necessity.<sup><a href="#n166">166</a></sup> Thus, although
      traditional Christian morality did not condemn circumcision,
      the medical profession's ethic sometimes did as part of its
      increasing autonomous claim to social authority.</p>

      <p class="text1">9. True and False</p>

      <p class="text1">Traditional Western epistemology was neutral
      on the practice of circumcision; the practice had no
      truth-value in Christian doctrine. Engaging in, or avoiding,
      the practice did not in itself reflect either knowledge or
      ignorance.<sup><a href="#n167"></a></sup> This
      epistemological neutrality did not mean that the culture had
      carte blanche to promote or discourage circumcision, however.
      Because Christian doctrine held that physical circumcision
      was meaningless, reflecting neither knowledge nor ignorance,
      any attempt to imbue circumcision with meaning would run
      counter to the doctrinal premises.</p>

      <p class="text1">Thus, as in the case of purity and
      pollution, the Christian view that physical circumcision
      lacked truth-value in effect operated as a deterrent to the
      practice. Since Christians were not circumcised, proponents
      of circumcision had the burden of convincing Christians to
      change their ways, and religious doctrine removed arguments
      based on knowledge from the arsenal of weapons that a
      proponent of circumcision might have used to encourage social
      change.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text1">Toward the end of the nineteenth century, a
      remarkable change occurred in the attitudes and practices of
      the English-speaking world. Christians began to circumcise
      children, first as men and boys, and then as newborns. From a
      posture in which no males were circumcised except for
      treatment of disease or for religious reasons not shared by
      the majority culture, the society moved rapidly to a posture
      in which nearly every male was circumcised at birth.</p>

      <center>
        <p class="section"><i>A. Background</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">The movement towards routine neonatal
      circumcision occurred in two stages. First, physicians,
      acting as norm entrepreneurs, successfully promoted
      circumcision as a remedy for various diseases and conditions.
      In 1870, Lewis Sayre, a prominent orthopedic surgeon and
      president of the American Medical Association, was called to
      consult on the case of a five-year-old boy who was unable to
      straighten his legs.<sup><a href="#n168">168</a></sup> Sayre
      concluded that the condition was the result of paralysis but
      could not, at first, discern the cause. The mystery cleared
      up when the nurse informed Dr. Sayre that the child's
      "pee-pee" was sore. On examination, Sayre discovered that the
      foreskin had contracted around the glans, causing
      inflammation. "As excessive venery is a fruitful source of
      physical prostration and nervous exhaustion, sometimes
      producing paralysis," Sayre explained, "I was disposed to
      look upon this case in the same light, and recommended
      circumcision as a means of relieving the irritated and
      imprisoned penis."<sup><a href="#n169">169</a></sup> The
      results were miraculous; within a few weeks, the patient was
      completely cured. Generalizing from this case, Sayre
      hypothesized that genital irritation was a cause of many
      cases of paralysis and joint disease.<sup><a
      href="#n170">170</a></sup> At the 1870 meeting of the
      American Medical Association, he delivered a sensational
      paper theorizing that adhesions between the prepuce and glans
      caused all sorts of conditions.<sup><a
      href="#n171">171</a></sup> Sayre's paper provided the
      intellectual basis for the pro-circumcision movement that
      developed over the next 30 years.<sup><a
      href="#n172">172</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Within fairly short order, circumcision was
      promoted as a remedy for alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, gout,
      rheumatism, curvature of the spine, and headache;<sup><a
      href="#n173">173</a></sup> hysteria and other nervous
      disorders, paralysis, malnutrition, night terrors, and
      clubfoot;<sup><a href="#n174">174</a></sup> eczema,
      convulsions, and mental retardation;<sup><a
      href="#n175">175</a></sup> promiscuity, syphilis, and
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n176">176</a></sup> Physicians also
      advised circumcision for the treatment of neurasthenia, a
      generalized condition characterized by "morbid fears, fear of
      society, of solitude, or traveling, of places, of disease, or
      morbid impulses, to kill one's self or others, mental
      depression, wakefulness, headache, impaired memory, [or]
      deficient mental control."<sup><a
      href="#n177">177</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">By far the most important health benefit of
      circumcision lay in its efficacy at treating masturbation and
      spermatorrhoea (wet dreams).<sup><a
      href="#n178">178</a></sup> Jonathan Hutchinson, a prominent
      British physician and President of the Royal College of
      Surgeons, advocated this position in an influential paper
      entitled "Circumcision as Preventative of
      Masturbation."<sup><a href="#n179">179</a></sup> Hutchinson
      argued that circumcision could reduce masturbation because it
      freed adhesions that caused irritation and induced the
      patient to handle the penis, an act that naturally led to
      self-abuse.<sup><a href="#n180">180</a></sup> He expressed
      the hope that circumcision "may often accomplish much, both
      in breaking the habit as an immediate result, and in
      diminishing the temptation to it subsequently."<sup><a
      href="#n181">181</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Hutchinson's theories found a receptive
      audience in the United States. Writing in the journal Medical
      Age in 1898, W.M. Donald, a lecturer at the Detroit College
      of Medicine, observed that a "comfortable minority" of
      masturbation cases were caused by "preputial irritation, due
      to adhesions or undue length of the foreskin, or both, quite
      sufficient to account for the vice."<sup><a
      href="#n182">182</a></sup> For these cases, circumcision
      provided a cure, if performed early enough in life. Donald
      reported on three cases of masturbating boys ages six, nine,
      and ten in the Detroit orphan asylum. All suffered from
      elongated prepuces and phimosis. Circumcision was performed,
      with the following results:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text2">The youngest was in the grasp of the
          vice to such an extent that he attempted to masturbate
          the day following the operation, but succeeded in
          inducing only a vast amount of swelling and soreness,
          with tearing of the stitches. Since that time to the
          present writing, three months later, his nurse reports
          that he has been absolutely free of the trouble. The
          second boy was cured by the operation, and has since
          remained cured. The third boy, aged ten, was such an
          incorrigible case, having probably masturbated for
          several years, that after the operation, despite the fact
          that during the day he showed no sign of indulgence in
          his vice, yet when soundly asleep at night his nurse
          would discover him practicing it unconsciously. I
          thereupon ordered rough mits [sic] placed on his hands at
          night, so that the rough friction would awaken him from
          his sound sleep. After a few nights of this treatment he
          gave us no further trouble.<sup><a
          href="#n183">183</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Donald urged that where the physical
      indications were present, it was best to circumcise the boy
      "during the first year of life, so that to a degree at least
      danger of future moral contamination may be avoided."<sup><a
      href="#n184">184</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The pronounced benefits of circumcision led
      to an enormous increase in the frequency of the operation. By
      1889, circumcision had become fashionable, even in
      "vogue."<sup><a href="#n185">185</a></sup> The operation
      appears to have become a virtual cottage industry, at least
      for some doctors.<sup><a href="#n186"></a></sup> Cincinnati
      physician Merrill Ricketts was one enthusiastic convert to
      the circumcision cause. Writing in 1894, Ricketts boasted
      that he had circumcised 200 males and compared his experience
      at foreskin removal to that of King David.<sup><a
      href="#n187">187</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The triumph of circumcision was only half
      won, however, with the operation's acceptance as a means for
      curing disease. The problem was that circumcision as a
      remedial procedure was performed on older children or
      adults.<sup><a href="#n188">188</a></sup> The field of
      medicine did not consider the circumcision of this population
      optimal. It was painful, and the recovery period not
      particularly pleasant.<sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup>
      Complications occurred frequently and were hard to
      disguise.<sup><a href="#n190">190</a></sup> Moreover, if the
      operation was performed in order to cure a particular medical
      condition, the possibility always existed that it would
      fail.<sup><a href="#n191">191</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Accordingly, towards the end of the
      nineteenth century, as the medical efficacy of circumcision
      became firmly established, some normentrepreneurs began to
      promote neonatal circumcision, not as a remedy, but as a
      prophylactic.<sup><a href="#n192">192</a></sup> Because the
      benefits of circumcision were so manifest, and because the
      diseases against which it provided protection were so
      ubiquitous, the course of prudence was to remove the prepuce
      as soon as possible.<sup><a href="#n193">193</a></sup> It was
      not advisable to wait for the symptoms of disease to appear,
      especially given the danger that, once a condition was
      diagnosed, it might be impossible to cure.<sup><a
      href="#n194">194</a></sup> In practice, early circumcision
      meant performing the procedure soon after birth.<sup><a
      href="#n195">195</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Physicians saw several benefits to neonatal
      circumcision. The operation could be accomplished with less
      invasive cutting, and was therefore safer.<sup><a
      href="#n196">196</a></sup> Since they believed newborns could
      not feel pain, they could be circumcised without
      anesthetic.<sup><a href="#n197">197</a></sup> Physicians
      could avoid the risks of ether, chloroform, or cocaine, the
      available surgical anesthetics of the time.<sup><a
      href="#n198">198</a></sup> Although infants were likely to
      move around more than adults, this problem could be easily
      managed. The newborn could be "held by two assistants"<sup><a
      href="#n199"></a></sup> or "bandaged to a board after the
      Indian fashion of strapping the papoose."<sup><a
      href="#n200">200</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Performing the procedure on infants had
      other advantages from the standpoint of the physician.
      Infants were incapable of resisting, and could not voice
      their objections through any means other than crying, which
      they were expected to do in any event. Bad results could be
      explained away more easily: because newborns were prone to
      medical problems, circumcision complications would not
      necessarily raise questions about the physician. If the baby
      died, it was unfortunate, but many babies died.<sup><a
      href="#n201">201</a></sup> Moreover, since the neonatal
      operation was performed as a prophylactic rather than a cure,
      the physician did not have to explain any failure of the
      operation to achieve its intended result. If a child
      eventually developed some disease against which circumcision
      was protective, the physician who conducted the operation
      would often be out of the picture. Even if the physician was
      around, he could avoid blame. Circumcision was not thought of
      as a vaccine against masturbation and other diseases but only
      as a procedure that removed predisposing factors.<sup><a
      href="#n202">202</a></sup> Finally, routine neonatal
      circumcision provided reliable and steady work for
      physicians. The chance to earn some extra income provided
      these specialists with an incentive to promote the operation
      among their patients, adding further impetus to a cultural
      tide that was already running in favor of neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">Thus, after the turn of the century,
      physicians increasingly began to recommend newborn
      circumcision as a preventive measure. Articles appeared in
      medical journals advising the best means for performing the
      operation on young children.<sup><a
      href="#n203">203</a></sup> Nurses who tended the mother and
      newborn after delivery encouraged the operation. They were in
      the habit of checking whether the newborn had a retractable
      foreskin, and, if the baby did not (as most do not), they
      would suggest a "little operation."<sup><a
      href="#n204">204</a></sup> Advanced thinkers of the time also
      took up the cause. Bertrand Russell, in his book of advice
      for parents, Education and the Good Life, expressed doubts
      that infantile masturbation was harmful to health,<sup><a
      href="#n205">205</a></sup> but noted that "sometimes it is
      rendered more pronounced by some definite physical irritation
      which can be removed."<sup><a href="#n206">206</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Parents had every reason to accept neonatal
      circumcision. Medical opinion regarding the health benefits
      of the procedure was nearly universal.<sup><a
      href="#n207">207</a></sup> Circumcision alleviated parental
      concerns about masturbation: rather than constantly spying on
      their children to detect the telltale signs of solitary vice,
      parents could content themselves with the knowledge that they
      had done the right thing to stop masturbation before it
      began.<sup><a href="#n208">208</a></sup> Parents also gained
      social status from having circumcised children. Circumcisions
      were performed in the hospital, where physicians could
      operate under sanitary conditions and monitor the healing
      process for the first few days.<sup><a
      href="#n209">209</a></sup> Circumcision was thus a mark of
      hospital birth. It became an indicator of prestige.<sup><a
      href="#n210">210</a></sup> Upwardly mobile middle class
      families had their boys circumcised in order to reinforce
      their sense of social superiority over the lower social
      classes, especially immigrants who were surging into the
      country from Europe at the time.<sup><a
      href="#n211">211</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">By 1910, circumcision was one of the most
      common operations in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n212">212</a></sup> being performed on 56 percent of
      boys.<sup><a href="#n213">213</a></sup> Wealthier families in
      particular took to the procedure, a feature that continues to
      the present day.<sup><a href="#n214">214</a></sup> During
      World War II, physicians frequently performed the procedure
      on soldiers as a preventative measure against venereal
      diseases.<sup><a href="#n215">215</a></sup> Circumcision
      rates increased further during the baby boom years after
      these men returned home from the war.<sup><a
      href="#n216">216</a></sup> Masters and Johnson, writing in
      1966, reported that only two out of a sample of 120 men
      between twenty-one and thirty years old were not
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n217">217</a></sup> The authors
      reported that "the uncircumcised male, particularly one born
      in an urban area, indeed, is becoming a rarity in our
      society."<sup><a href="#n218">218</a></sup> Circumcision also
      became common in other English-speaking developed nations,
      <sup><a href="#n219">219</a></sup> although it never achieved
      the same popularity outside the Anglophone world.<sup><a
      href="#n220">220</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">What accounts for the success of the norm
      entrepreneurs who promoted circumcision? Three explanations
      stand out. We have seen that a principal impediment to the
      adoption of circumcision by non-Jews was the overwhelming
      force of Christianity in the culture. As the nineteenth
      century drew to a close, traditional Christianity found
      itself under assault from humanism, evolutionism, cultural
      liberalization, and other aspects of a modernist
      worldview.<sup><a href="#n221">221</a></sup> It was no longer
      so important, as time went on, for a man or boy to declare
      himself a Christian by remaining uncircumcised. In addition,
      as Christian beliefs lost their monopoly on the cultural
      background, those shaping public opinion could look to Jews
      as authority and even compare Christian beliefs unfavorably
      to those of the Jewish faith.<sup><a
      href="#n222">222</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">By the end of the nineteenth century,
      moreover, physicians had begun to assume greater status and
      prestige in popular culture.<sup><a
      href="#n223">223</a></sup> Doctors became secular confessors.
      Patients would come to them to disclose the most intimate
      details of their personal lives in hopes of gaining
      absolution through medical treatment. Freud was the most
      visible, and influential, embodiment of this trend toward
      physician as secular priest,<sup><a
      href="#n224">224</a></sup> but many other physicians played a
      similar role. As a result of the charisma associated with
      their claim to professional knowledge, physicians were able
      to recommend changes in social habits on ostensibly medical
      grounds and to have these recommendations respected, at least
      by the educated middle class where the movement toward
      circumcision gained its first and most permanent
      foothold.<sup><a href="#n225">225</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, and most importantly, circumcision
      provided a convenient means for managing cultural and
      professional anxieties.<sup><a href="#n226">226</a></sup> The
      Victorian era saw masturbation as immoral, disgusting, and
      deleterious to health.<sup><a href="#n227">227</a></sup>
      Physicians and moralists spearheaded a campaign against
      masturbation and spermatorrhoea that was massive in scope and
      pervasive in operation. Eventually, however, the campaign
      against masturbation and spermatorrhoea proved to be
      inconvenient for medical doctors and became a trap of their
      own making. On the one hand, while they had held seminal loss
      out as the cause of disease, the mechanisms of this disease,
      and the proper treatment for its ravages, were so vague that
      anyone with imagination could offer a cure and make money off
      it.<sup><a href="#n228">228</a></sup> Quacks and patent
      medicine vendors arose in profusion, siphoning income from
      trained doctors while threatening the public standing of the
      profession.<sup><a href="#n229">229</a></sup> Thus, the
      diseases of masturbation and spermatorrhoea, which physicians
      had promoted as a means for managing their occupational
      anxieties, ended up causing anxieties of their own. The
      medical profession also had to face the fact that, having
      identified these syndromes, it was unable to effect a cure,
      even with heroic measures such as night gloves, spiked penile
      rings, and wire cages.<sup><a href="#n230">230</a></sup> As
      masturbation panic grew, parents, advised by reputable
      medical authorities, came to believe that their children
      could begin to masturbate before puberty, even as early as
      age one.<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup> Doctors attempted
      increasingly desperate remedies: burning the urethra with
      caustic agents, passing metal rods up the urethral canal,
      inserting peccaries through the anus in order to compress the
      spermatic ducts, passing electric sparks through the
      testicles, and even castrating incorrigible offenders.<sup><a
      href="#n232">232</a></sup> Despite these measures, boys
      masturbated. The medical campaign was in danger of
      backfiring. Meanwhile, the principal anxiety for physicians
      that the disease of seminal loss warded off&mdash;the
      inability of medicine to understand the basis of disease,
      much less to cure it&mdash;began to fade as the century
      progressed.<sup><a href="#n233"></a></sup> By the end of the
      nineteenth century, medicine had begun to make real advances,
      most especially with the development of germ theory. Because
      medicine was obtaining a more scientific handle on disease,
      it could dispense with the reliance on seminal loss as the
      cause of diffuse symptoms that could not be explained by
      other means.<sup><a href="#n234">234</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision grew in popularity at the end
      of the nineteenth century as a convenient solution to these
      problems. Because circumcision was viewed as a preventative
      to masturbation,<sup><a href="#n235">235</a></sup> it offered
      the promise of resolving the problem with a simple operation.
      Parents their circumcised could comfort themselves with the
      knowledge that they had done the responsible thing to reduce
      the risk that their sons would fall prey to the secret vice.
      The failure to circumcise a child, on the other hand, would
      be close to "criminal negligence."<sup><a
      href="#n236">236</a></sup> In addition, physicians could rid
      themselves of some of the discomfort that the diseases of
      masturbation and spermatorrhoea were causing by recommending
      the relatively minor procedure of circumcision as a remedy
      and could, in the process, supplement their incomes with fees
      for performing the procedure. For these reasons, among
      others, circumcision became increasingly popular after the
      turn of the twentieth century as an exit strategy for
      concerns about masturbation.</p>

        <p class="section"><i>B. Culture</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">As discussed above, Western culture, and
      especially the culture of the United States, moved rapidly
      from a state in which circumcision of boys was rare and
      threatening, to one in which it was nearly universal. This
      movement was framed and argued in terms of familiar cultural
      polarities, which norm entrepreneurs manipulated to promote
      circumcision as a medical and cultural practice. Norm
      entrepreneurs effected this change in social values through
      the construction of a standard narrative that emphasized the
      positive features of circumcision and discounted its
      negatives. The narrative portrayed the foreskin as evil and
      dangerous&mdash;the "tight-constricted, glans-deforming,
      onanism-producing, cancer-generating prepuce."<sup><a
      href="#n237">237</a></sup> It pictured circumcision, on the
      other hand, as a "quick, painless and sterile operation on a
      barely-sentient new-born, the sharp scalpel in the expert
      hands of a trained doctor ... justifiable on grounds of
      health."<sup><a href="#n238">238</a></sup> This narrative
      reconceived the phallus in such a way as to alter the values
      assigned to circumcision across the polarities that shaped
      Western culture's concept of the social world.</p>

      <p class="text1">1. Purity and Pollution</p>

      <p class="text1">We have seen that prior to the late
      nineteenth century, circumcision in Western culture (except
      among Jews) was neither pure nor polluting. Part of the
      strategy of norm entrepreneurs who promoted circumcision was
      to change the cultural background by portraying the
      uncircumcised penis as polluting and circumcision as
      purifying. Circumcision "signified precisely that aversion to
      dirt&mdash;and not just dirt, but vulgarity, nasty habits,
      and diseases&mdash;that symbolically set one on a higher
      plane."<sup><a href="#n239">239</a></sup> The strategy here
      was two-fold.</p>

      <p class="text1">First, circumcision advocates stressed the
      operation's efficacy as a remedy for various polluting
      conditions. These included, most prominently, masturbation
      and spermatorrhoea. The loss of semen from these conditions
      was defiling.<sup><a href="#n240">240</a></sup> The culture
      was explicit on this point: masturbation and spermatorrhoea
      were "pollution." Because circumcision provided protection
      against these conditions, it was also, by implication, a
      protection against pollution. By the same token, the lack of
      circumcision was polluting, or potentially so, because it
      left in place the adhesions and other irritations that
      conduced to seminal losses.<sup><a href="#n241">241</a></sup>
      Thus, if a man was suffering from seminal losses (as most men
      were because of the near universality of masturbation and wet
      dreams), it was a good idea to submit to the purification
      ritual of circumcision.<sup><a href="#n242"></a></sup>
      Circumcision also came, over time, to be considered a remedy
      for a different but equally polluting set of
      conditions&mdash;venereal diseases such as syphilis and
      gonorrhea. Many physicians believed that the foreskin was a
      risk factor for these diseases. Doctors in the armed forces,
      concerned about these risks, strongly encouraged recruits to
      undergo the operation, and many submitted to the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n243">243</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">A second strategy of circumcision advocates,
      in the area of purity and pollution, was to characterize the
      prepuce and the smegma that accumulated underneath it as
      polluting. Smegma had previously been considered a healthy
      secretion of the sebaceous glands, and therefore part of the
      body's natural means for keeping the penile skin supple and
      soft.<sup><a href="#n244">244</a></sup> Circumcision
      advocates pointed to research findings that smegma contained
      only trace amounts of sebaceous matter; its principal
      constituent was, instead, desquamated, sloughed off)
      skin.<sup><a href="#n245">245</a></sup> Smegma was thus a
      form of waste, which in the normal course of things would be
      eliminated through washing or shedding, but which, unlike
      other wastes, was artificially trapped within the preputial
      space. Waste trapped under the foreskin could produce an
      added chemical irritation due to retained secretions
      constantly eroding the delicate mucous surfaces.<sup><a
      href="#n246">246</a></sup> Smegma was a "dirty
      substance...likely to produce bad odors [in the uncircumcised
      male]."<sup><a href="#n247">247</a></sup> It was "infectious
      material" and, as such, an agent in the spread of disease.
      <sup><a href="#n248"></a></sup> As Jonathan Hutchinson put
      it, the prepuce "constitutes a harbour [sic] for
      filth."<sup><a href="#n249">249</a></sup> Smegma, in short,
      was impure, polluting, and comparable to other polluting
      bodily wastes such as feces or urine.<sup><a
      href="#n250">250</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">As time went on, physicians attributed
      ever-greater polluting powers to smegma, in particular the
      view that it was carcinogenic.<sup><a
      href="#n251">251</a></sup> Circumcision advocates observed
      that Jewish men rarely contract penile cancer and concluded
      that the factor distinguishing Jews from others must be
      circumcision. And if smegma was carcinogenic for men, it had
      to be equally polluting for women. Jewish women were not
      prone to cervical cancer because their cervixes did not come
      into contact with smegma.<sup><a href="#n252"></a></sup> The
      preputial space, in short, was a "cesspool" for infectious
      agents.<sup><a href="#n253">253</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Advocates of circumcision did not claim that
      removal of the prepuce was the only way to control the
      buildup of pollutants. Regular genital hygiene could do the
      trick.<sup><a href="#n254">254</a></sup> However, the
      hygienic measures called for in the medical literature were
      heroic. Authoritative statements warned parents that the
      uncircumcised penis required "lifelong" hygienic care.<sup><a
      href="#n255">255</a></sup> The suggestion was that this part
      of the body was highly toxic (all external bodily parts
      require "lifelong" hygienic care, but medical societies don't
      issue grim warnings to this effect for the elbows or wrists).
      If hygienic measures were neglected, it was difficult to
      rectify the problem. As George M. Beard of Philadelphia
      observed, "the accumulations of smegma are in some cases
      enormous, and are sometimes as hard as boards."<sup><a
      href="#n256">256</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Parents often found the hygienic demands to
      be overwhelming. Mothers, for example, were warned to
      forcibly retract the foreskins of their sons nearly from
      birth.<sup><a href="#n257">257</a></sup> This caused natural
      concern because infant foreskins are rarely retractable, so
      that the mother's well-intentioned cleaning efforts could
      produce pain and bleeding. Even when easy retraction of the
      foreskin was achieved, parents probably tired of the
      incessant cleaning thought necessary to deter the buildup of
      smegma. Mothers also experienced discomfort at the handling
      of their sons' genitals entailed by the recommended hygienic
      regime.<sup><a href="#n258">258</a></sup> Given one
      experience with an uncircumcised boy, parents were likely to
      circumcise later-born boys and, assumedly, to advise friends
      to do likewise.<sup><a href="#n259">259</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">2. Health and Harm</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates also addressed the
      polarity between health and disease. They argued that
      circumcision was a means toward enhancing health and that
      lack of circumcision was, if not itself a disease, at least a
      precursor and fertile condition for the development of
      disease. Not only was the lack of circumcision conducive to
      masturbation and spermatorrhoea, but it also caused all sorts
      of other serious conditions: cancer, gangrene, nervous
      conditions, joint problems, and much else.<sup><a
      href="#n260">260</a></sup> The nearly universal consensus of
      informed opinion, at least in the English-speaking world,
      held that circumcision was conducive to health and the lack
      of circumcision carried significant risks of harm.</p>

      <p class="text1">3. Self and Other</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates drew on the polarity
      of self and other. An impediment to the acceptance of male
      genital surgery was the association of the ritual with Jewish
      religion and culture and, therefore, with a set of practices
      and beliefs which, although tolerated, were separate from the
      majority culture. If circumcision were seen as a Jewish
      ritual, it might be conceptualized by the majority culture as
      "other" and rejected for that reason. Recognizing this
      danger, circumcision advocates forthrightly addressed the
      Jewishness of circumcision. They stressed the Jewish roots of
      Christianity and praised rather than denigrated the Jewish
      way of life. Jonathan Hutchinson, for example, observed that
      "no one who has seen the superior cleanliness of a Hebrew
      penis can have avoided a very strong impression in favour
      [sic] of the removal of the foreskin."<sup><a
      href="#n261">261</a></sup> Echoing the theme, P.C. Remondino
      extolled Jews: their family structure is strong; they care
      for the aged and infirm; they contribute to the welfare of
      society; they rarely engage in criminality; and they are, in
      general, a remarkably long-lived and healthy people.<sup><a
      href="#n262">262</a></sup> To these virtues of Jews Remondino
      boldly contrasted the deficits of Christians. Family
      veneration and attachment are weaker among Christians than
      among Jews, he claimed, and even weaker among Christians than
      in the Oriental races.<sup><a href="#n263">263</a></sup> As
      for the English, despite claims of superiority, they were
      actually "in an acquired state of moral and physical
      degeneration."<sup><a href="#n264">264</a></sup> Remondino
      even questioned the authority of St. Paul to abolish
      circumcision, observing that the Apostle did not speak with
      the authority of a Disciple and that Paul's motives were more
      practical than spiritual.<sup><a href="#n265">265</a></sup>
      Jewish traditional views on circumcision were thereby
      rehabilitated.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates enlisted concepts of
      self and other to associate the circumcised phallus with
      civilization and the uncircumcised phallus with savagery.
      They pushed this line with an argument from evolution. The
      foreskin's "leathery pouch"<sup><a href="#n266">266</a></sup>
      once had utility as an aid to "primitive" man. <sup><a
      href="#n267"></a></sup> It protected naked men from briars,
      bark, bug bites, and attacks by "small aquatic lizards."
      <sup><a href="#n268">268</a></sup> The prepuce had long
      outlived its usefulness, however. Man had cleared away the
      brambles and thorns that had threatened the genitals of
      savages, and clothes protected the glans from whatever
      dangers remained. Thus, the prepuce was superseded:
      "environment and civilization have placed man in that
      position that he has no further use for this curious relic of
      a long-past barbaric age."<sup><a href="#n269">269</a></sup>
      By associating lack of circumcision with savagery, and
      circumcision with culture, advocates coded the circumcised
      condition as "self"&mdash;that is, partaking of civilized
      society&mdash;while relegating the uncircumcised state to the
      status of "other."</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates reinforced the view
      of the foreskin as "other" by portraying the organ as the
      enemy of the glans. The connections between prepuce and glans
      were referred to as "adhesions."<sup><a
      href="#n270"></a></sup> The suggestion was that the interface
      between foreskin and glans was something unnatural, a bond
      that should not be present in ordinary development and that
      must be broken by the doctor if it does not resolve
      spontaneously. <sup><a href="#n271"></a></sup> According to
      the metaphor, the prepuce clings to the glans and interferes
      with its natural functions. The prepuce and glans are not
      part of an organic whole, but rather adversaries working at
      cross-purposes. As between them, the prepuce represents the
      primitive forces that hold man back, the glans, the forces of
      development&mdash;forces that were consonant with the late
      Victorian era's self-concept as a progressive age looking
      forward to a bright and exciting future.<sup><a
      href="#n272"></a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">4. Natural and Unnatural</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates characterized the
      prepuce as unnatural. These norm entrepreneurs could not very
      well claim that the organ was itself unnatural, since it was
      self-evidently part of the human anatomy. The strategy was
      therefore to denigrate the prepuce as "rudimentary"<sup><a
      href="#n273"></a></sup> and "redundant," <sup><a
      href="#n274"></a></sup> a mere "appendage" or
      "appurtenance."<sup><a href="#n275"></a></sup> Students at
      leading medical schools were instructed that the prepuce was
      "tantamount to a minor birth defect."<sup><a
      href="#n276"></a></sup> Because the prepuce was superfluous,
      it was not "natural." Its removal would not affect bodily
      functions and thus would not detract from the human anatomy.
      Unlike other vestigial organs, which at least did no harm,
      the prepuce was dangerous and therefore doubly unnatural. As
      Remondino explained,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text2">the opponents of circumcision base much
          of their opposition [on] the fact that circumcision
          interferes with the natural condition of the parts. The
          question may well be asked, which of these two shaped
          glans [the glans of the circumcised and uncircumcised
          penis] is the natural product as nature intended it
          should be? It is a well-known fact that the ... glans
          penis will, within a week or two after its liberation
          from its fetters of preputial bands, assume its true
          shape. We may naturally inquire if nature made the glans
          of a certain shape, which seems to be the proper shape
          for copulative purposes, only to have the condition most
          effectually abolished by a constricting, unnatural band?
          <sup><a href="#n277">277</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Orificial surgeon G.A. Brown followed up the
      advantage of this argument with a compelling syllogism. If
      the prepuce were a natural organ, it would not cause disease.
      Yet the prepuce did cause disease. Ergo, the prepuce was
      unnatural. To argue otherwise was "absurd in the
      extreme."<sup><a href="#n278">278</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Some circumcision advocates went further
      than contending that the foreskin was a vestigial organ that
      had become dangerous to natural functioning. They denied the
      prepuce a role as an independent organ with its own identity
      and structure. Chicago physician C.B. Walls, for example,
      denigrated it as a "piece of tissue,"<sup><a
      href="#n279">279</a></sup> suggesting that it is simply a
      mass of undifferentiated flesh. If the prepuce is an
      accumulation of flesh, its removal could not affect the
      naturalness of the male body. Indeed, as "tissue," the
      prepuce was, at least implicitly, associated with other
      tissue masses, such as tumors or cysts, which while attached
      or embedded in the body, are unnatural rather than
      natural.</p>

      <p class="text1">Related to the idea of the unnatural prepuce
      was the connection between lack of circumcision and
      masturbation. Masturbation, in the view of the late
      nineteenth century, was prototypically unnatural. It was,
      indeed, a "sin against nature," as Victorian moralists never
      tired of pointing out.<sup><a href="#n280">280</a></sup> This
      unnatural aspect distinguished masturbation from coitus:
      although both caused loss of vital fluid, only masturbation
      debilitated the nervous system because intercourse was
      natural.<sup><a href="#n281">281</a></sup> Males who were not
      circumcised tended to masturbate.<sup><a
      href="#n282">282</a></sup> Thus lack of circumcision was
      unnatural. Circumcision, on the other hand, was conducive to
      natural functioning because it acted as a deterrent to the
      solitary vice.</p>

      <p class="text1">Once it took hold, the idea of circumcision
      being "natural" reinforced itself in a reflexive fashion.
      Circumcision became so familiar, so "normal," that it ceased
      even to be an issue. The category of "natural" is related to
      the concept of "routine." When a procedure becomes "routine,"
      it stops being questioned. Evidence that might indicate the
      need for questioning&mdash;for example, hemorrhage,
      infection, surgical errors and other difficulties&mdash;would
      not be considered a "problem." At the same time, the concept
      of the procedure as "routine" (i.e., natural) preconditioned
      the medical profession to accept the health benefits advanced
      for the procedure, such as prophylaxis against urinary tract
      infections, balanitis (localized infection of the glans) or
      penile or cervical cancer.<sup><a href="#n283">283</a></sup>
      Even baby doctor Benjamin Spock accepted the naturalness of
      circumcision, recommending the procedure in the 1957 and 1968
      editions of His treatise, Baby and Child Care, on the ground
      that an uncircumcised boy might not feel "regular."<sup><a
      href="#n284">284</a></sup> And these ideas are with us still.
      Despite some changes in attitudes, the popular view continues
      to be that the circumcised penis is normal and natural. As
      one new father said, "It's the natural thing" to circumcise a
      son.<sup><a href="#n285">285</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">5. Beauty and Deformity</p>

      <p class="text1">Advocates of circumcision also drew on the
      polarity of beauty and deformity. The strategy here was to
      portray the circumcised phallus as beautiful and the
      uncircumcised organ as ugly. P.C. Remondino, although
      speaking from the authority of a physician unconcerned with
      matters aesthetic, graphically depicted the deformities that
      the prepuce inflicted on the phallus. He explained that
      preputial tightness started a chain of unhappy events,
      involving the buildup of smegma, the irritation of the
      affected surfaces, inflammation, thickening, hardening, and
      loss of elasticity in the prepuce, and the formation of
      adhesions.<sup><a href="#n286">286</a></sup> The prepuce
      turned into an "unyielding tube" imprisoning the
      glans.<sup><a href="#n287">287</a></sup> The constricted
      glans, in turn, became "elongated, cyanosed, and
      hyperaesthetic; the meatus of the urethra [the opening at the
      tip of the penis] is congested and hypertrophied; the corona
      is undeveloped and often absent, the glans having, on the
      whole, the long-nosed, conical appearance of the head of a
      field mouse." <sup><a href="#n288">288</a></sup> In contrast
      to this unappealing image of the uncircumcised phallus,
      Remondino offered a positive view of its circumcised cousin.
      The head is shorter, the face flat and abrupt, and the
      meatus, instead of being at the end of a conical point, is
      situated on the smooth, rounded front of the glans, and does
      not differ in color from the covering of the glans itself...
      .Its topographical outline may be said to describe two
      opposite segments of a circle, as seen in the cuts
      representing the glans in its natural shape. The corona is
      prominent and well developed."<sup><a
      href="#n289">289</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Remondino was careful to disguise these
      aesthetic judgments in scientific jargon. Some authorities
      were not so inhibited. They directly pronounced the beauty of
      the circumcised phallus.<sup><a href="#n290">290</a></sup>
      Physician Willard Goodwin is a case in point. He argued that
      "circumcision is a beautification comparable to rhinoplasty
      [a nose job]."<sup><a href="#n291">291</a></sup> Goodwin
      praised the cosmetically-altered phallus because it "appears
      in its flaccid state as an erect uncircumcised organ&mdash;a
      beautiful instrument of precise intent."<sup><a
      href="#n292">292</a></sup> In contrast, by implication, the
      uncircumcised phallus was unattractive and in need of
      correction through plastic surgery.</p>

      <p class="text1">The negative image of the uncircumcised
      penis matched well with views on masturbation as conducive to
      deformity and ugliness. These were ubiquitous during the
      Victorian era. The masturbator was portrayed in the most
      pitiful and unflattering terms. His was a "low, mean look, a
      hang-dog expression; a pallid face; hollow, watery eyes;
      cold, moist hands; lustreless hair; constrained, embarrassed
      manner; drooping shoulders; a tendency toward twitching the
      muscles; frequent repetition of swallowing motions
      ..."<sup><a href="#n293">293</a></sup> Men or boys who
      refrained from masturbation, on the other hand, were depicted
      as paragons of grace and beauty. They radiated the "virile
      power of superb manhood" to which all right-thinking men
      aspired, and which sparked the interest of all young
      women.<sup><a href="#n294">294</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Particular attention focused on the
      deforming effects of masturbation on the genitals, which in
      masturbators displayed defects beyond those caused by the
      prepuce alone. In these pathetic souls, "the veins of the
      integumentary covering of the penis become very much enlarged
      and tortuous, and the skin itself becomes of a dull yellow
      color, with a tendency to wrinkle."<sup><a
      href="#n295">295</a></sup> The penis was likely to be thinner
      and smaller than usual, and could be elongated and cold to
      the touch.<sup><a href="#n296"></a></sup> The organ might be
      bent laterally, usually to the left.<sup><a
      href="#n297">297</a></sup> The testicles, too, suffered from
      the ill effects of masturbation. In a person of evil habits,
      the testicles were "soft and flabby"<sup><a
      href="#n298">299</a></sup> and the left hung much lower than
      the right.<sup><a href="#n299">299</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">As circumcision became established in
      American culture, images of the male body began to conceive
      of the phallus in its circumcised state. These images cannot
      generally be seen in fine art, where the male genitalia are
      ordinarily either not shown or displayed in such a way as to
      make it impossible to discern whether or not the subject is
      circumcised. Photography, however, took over the task of the
      representational portrayal of the male nude. Here we do see
      images of circumcised men.<sup><a href="#n300">300</a></sup>
      Many of these pictures were not widely distributed,
      circulating instead in an artistic and/or gay subculture; but
      the change in aesthetic attitudes seems to have filtered into
      the broader culture. By the 1970s, when graphic depictions of
      male nudity began to emerge from the shadows of pornography
      and censorship, the circumcised male phallus became
      normative. Presumably these magazines play to, as well as to
      some extent shape, popular aesthetic judgments. Some who
      worry about the appearance of their genitals have even had
      themselves circumcised for cosmetic reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n301">301</a></sup> It is hard to judge popular
      attitudes on the relative attractiveness of the circumcised
      and the uncircumcised phallus, although some evidence
      suggests that sexual partners may now prefer the intact
      organ.<sup><a href="#n302">302</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Meanwhile, artists such as Robert
      Mapplethorpe began to play off against the normativeness of
      the circumcised phallus. Several of Mapplethorpe's more
      controversial photographs graphically display men with
      extravagantly uncircumcised organs; part of the shock value
      of these works is the frank display of the phallus in its
      uncut state.<sup><a href="#n303">303</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">6. Male and Female</p>

      <p class="text1">Concepts of male and female were also
      implicated in the movement towards circumcision during the
      late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Victorian
      culture was obsessed with virility.<sup><a
      href="#n304">304</a></sup> Manhood could be lost most easily
      through seminal leakage. Thus, the narrative of the times
      equated masturbation and spermatorrhoea with lack of
      manliness. As the Victorian psychologist Henry Maudsley put
      it, in the masturbator "there is a want of manliness of
      appearance as of manliness of feeling."<sup><a
      href="#n305">305</a></sup> Such "degenerate beings," he
      added, are "very much as eunuchs are represented to
      be."<sup><a href="#n306">306</a></sup> To preserve manhood,
      it was essential to avoid seminal loss. Circumcision, as a
      treatment for masturbation and spermatorrhoea, thus became a
      source of virility.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision also preserved manhood by
      protecting against male infertility.<sup><a
      href="#n307">307</a></sup> P.C. Remondino explained that the
      prepuce could block the meatus, ballooning outward or forcing
      seminal fluid backward into the bladder. In such cases, the
      man would be "partly eunuchised by a constricted
      prepuce."<sup><a href="#n308">308</a></sup> Even if the
      prepuce did not interfere with seminal discharge, it could
      still inhibit conception. The prepuce could cause the glans
      to be long, pointy, conical, and deficient in a corona. All
      these conditions worked to deter conception: not only was the
      semen directed away from the cervix, but the lack of a corona
      eliminated the "valve action" that served to retain the semen
      in a proper location.<sup><a href="#n309">309</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce also threatened potency. A man
      who suffered from phimosis was likely to experience
      difficulties in obtaining an erection because of the
      adhesions between glans and prepuce.<sup><a
      href="#n310">310</a></sup> The results could be disastrous.
      A.W. Taylor, a New Jersey physician, phrased the matter with
      appropriate Victorian modesty, managed to interweave themes
      of pollution, masculinity, and anxiety about the welfare of
      the family. "Domestic infelicity," he said, is"often caused
      by an existing, and not understood, phimosis interfering with
      the proper performance of the marital functions... . I
      believe an examination and circumcision of the husband would
      often do more towards producing domestic harmony than the
      disgusting and prolonged divorce suits which drag their slimy
      length through our courts."<sup><a
      href="#n311">311</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce's threat to masculinity went
      beyond its deleterious effects on fertility and potency. It
      also threatened the virile organ in its entirety. A
      constricting foreskin created a risk that the penis would
      become infected and gangrenous, or that it would be stricken
      by cancer.<sup><a href="#n312">312</a></sup> Both of these
      conditions often required amputation.<sup><a
      href="#n313">313</a></sup> The pitiful victim would be
      "emasculated."<sup><a href="#n314">314</a></sup>
      Circumcision, protective as it was against gangrene and
      cancer, also helped ensure against this most serious loss of
      manly powers.</p>

      <p class="text1">7. Order and Chaos</p>

      <p class="text1">Notions of order and chaos played a role in
      the promotion of circumcision as a remedy. In part, the
      equation of the prepuce with disorder was carried out in the
      realm of anatomy. Physicians were trained to distinguish
      "disorders" from normal anatomical structures. Viewed from
      this perspective, the prepuce came to be conceived of as
      displaying massive tendencies towards disorder. It was too
      long, too narrow, "redundant," or adherent to the glans. By
      defining conditions for normalcy that few actual organs could
      satisfy, medical science identified a wide range of
      structures as disordered. The prepuce therefore came to
      appear, if not intrinsically disordered, at least as
      extraordinarily susceptible to abnormal development.<sup><a
      href="#n315">315</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Further, as we have already observed,<sup><a
      href="#n316">316</a></sup> before the late nineteenth
      century, the operation of circumcision was uncertain, messy,
      and painful&mdash;in short, chaotic. Circumcision advocates
      attempted to rectify this problem by means of education. As
      the century drew to a close, medical journals focused on
      illustrating or discussing techniques for
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n317">317</a></sup> Chaos began
      to subside as the profession developed protocols for the
      operation. By 1907, a physician could write, "circumcision
      [is] unhesitatingly undertaken by most general
      practitioners."<sup><a href="#n318">318</a></sup> Although
      this assessment may have been premature, it did presage a
      time, not many years hence, when circumcision would be a
      perfectly routine procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1">8. Good and Bad</p>

      <p class="text1">Promoters of circumcision frequently couched
      their arguments in moralistic terms. Here, the first order of
      business was to disparage the prepuce. Remondino cast the
      prepuce in the role of an "outlaw,"<sup><a
      href="#n319">319</a></sup> a "dark and mysterious"
      desperado.<sup><a href="#n320">320</a></sup> Similarly, Beard
      indicted the prepuce for plotting to murder the glans by
      strangulation.<sup><a href="#n321">321</a></sup> Placing this
      "diabolically-inclined criminal" <sup><a
      href="#n322">322</a></sup> on trial, Remondino empanelled
      himself and his readers as an "impartial jury" and pronounced
      a sentence of execution.<sup><a href="#n323">323</a></sup>
      Elsewhere, Remondino likened the prepuce to a voluptuary of
      the Roman Empire,<sup><a href="#n324">324</a></sup> a
      torturer of the Spanish Inquisition<sup><a
      href="#n325">325</a></sup> or a bully of the American
      frontier with a penchant for crushing testicles.<sup><a
      href="#n326">326</a></sup> These images conveyed the
      impression that the prepuce was itself an object of evil that
      richly deserved to be removed from the individual body, just
      as evil people must be eliminated from the body politic.</p>

      <p class="text1">In addition to blaming the prepuce, norm
      entrepreneurs pointed to the immorality of masturbation.
      Authorities of the Victorian period never tired of denouncing
      this habit and those who practiced it. The British physician
      Henry Maudsley decried its "utter moral perversion."<sup><a
      href="#n327">327</a></sup> In the United States, J.H. Kellogg
      condemned "the sin of self-pollution" as one of the vilest,
      the basest, and the most degrading that a human being can
      commit."<sup><a href="#n328">328</a></sup> American moralist
      and censor Anthony Comstock warned that masturbation "sears
      the conscience, hardens the heart, and damns the soul. It
      leads to lust and lust breeds unhallowed living, and sinks
      man, made in the image of God, below the level of the
      beasts."<sup><a href="#n329">329</a></sup> Popular
      terminology reinforced these views. Masturbation was the
      "solitary vice," and those who practiced it engaged in
      "self-abuse."<sup><a href="#n330">330</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Victorian authorities were not the first to
      stigmatize masturbation. The Catholic Church had condemned
      the practice for centuries, and masturbation had been under
      full-scale cultural attack since the 1700s.<sup><a
      href="#n331">331</a></sup> However, prior to Hutchinson's
      work connecting masturbation with preputial
      irritation,<sup><a href="#n332">332</a></sup> the attack on
      masturbation did not relate to circumcision. Once
      circumcision became accepted as an efficacious treatment for
      masturbation, the situation changed. Now the full force of
      the social abhorrence of masturbation could bolster the
      argument that circumcision was "good" because it deterred
      self-abuse, and that lack of circumcision was "bad" because
      the uncircumcised boy was likely to fall prey to the
      evil.</p>

      <p class="text1">9. True and False</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates promoted the
      procedure by emphasizing the degree to which it partook of
      knowledge rather than ignorance. The strategy here was
      two-fold, looking both to the wisdom of the ages and to
      cutting-edge scientific research.</p>

      <p class="text1">Advocates of the procedure rehabilitated the
      knowledge of Jewish sages, who had been eclipsed during most
      of the Christian period. The Jewish religion which these
      sages espoused was clear, simple, and unambiguous. For the
      Jew, said Remondino, "there is none of the gloomy, weird,
      mystical, mind-racking, ungodly theology that some of our
      creeds torture the poor brains of their professors
      with."<sup><a href="#n333">333</a></sup> The Jewish religion
      is "very philosophical and rational."<sup><a
      href="#n334">334</a></sup> Thus, traditional Jewish thinking
      on circumcision deserved to be treated with the highest
      degree of respect.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates also contended that
      the advantages of the procedure were demonstrated by recent
      medical and scientific discoveries. There was even a
      scholarly publication, the Journal of Orificial Surgery,
      devoted to extolling the virtues of circumcision and other
      surgeries in the genital area.<sup><a
      href="#n335">335</a></sup> Remondino couched his enormously
      erudite treatise in scientific language and included numerous
      footnotes and quotes from learned authorities.<sup><a
      href="#n336">336</a></sup> He drew on demographic data
      showing Jews to be healthier and longer-lived than
      Christians.<sup><a href="#n337">337</a></sup> Jews, he
      argued, had lower infant mortality and a greater resistance
      to diseases such as plague, consumption and syphilis. The
      most likely cause of these advantages was
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n338">338</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Moving beyond demographics, Remondino
      advanced other scientific reasons for considering the
      circumcised phallus superior to its uncircumcised cousin. He
      highlighted Sayre's work on circumcision and
      paralysis.<sup><a href="#n339">339</a></sup> He associated
      cancer of the penis with preputial adhesions.<sup><a
      href="#n340">340</a></sup> He touted medical research
      suggesting that circumcision cured enuresis and other urinary
      conditions.<sup><a href="#n341">341</a></sup> He discussed
      theories about the efficacy of circumcision at deterring
      masturbation and spermatorrhoea.<sup><a
      href="#n342">342</a></sup> He argued, in short, that the
      overwhelming consensus of advanced medical opinion viewed the
      prepuce as a potentially dangerous cause of a variety of
      frightening diseases and conditions.</p>

      <p class="text1">Remondino and his colleagues achieved an
      astonishing success in promoting circumcision within American
      culture. For much of the twentieth century, it appeared that
      their victory would be permanent. But as the following
      section demonstrates, predictions of lasting success may be
      premature.</p>

      <center>
        <p class="section"><i>A. Background</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Recently, in what appears to be a new stage
      in the evolution of cultural attitudes, circumcision rates in
      English-speaking countries have begun to fall. The rate in
      Great Britain is now only 5 to 6 percent.<sup><a
      href="#n343">343</a></sup> Even in the United States, which
      has long been the country most prone to circumcize its boys,
      the rate is dropping. Circumcision rates have been in a slow
      decline since their peak in the 1960s,<sup><a
      href="#n344">344</a></sup> with most recent estimates at
      around 60 percent.<sup><a href="#n345">345</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Reflecting these changes in American
      practices is a marked lack of consensus within the American
      medical establishment about the utility of routine newborn
      circumcision. The American Academy of Pediatrics' wavering
      course of authoritative recommendations is illustrative. In
      1971, the Academy concluded that routine circumcision of
      newborn infants lacked medical justification.<sup><a
      href="#n346">346</a></sup> The Academy reiterated this
      finding in 1975, stating not only that "there is no absolute
      medical indication for routine circumcision of the newborn,"
      but also that good hygiene "offers all the advantages of
      routine circumcision without the attendant surgical
      risk."<sup><a href="#n347">347</a></sup> In 1989, the Academy
      retreated, based on studies finding a correlation between
      lack of circumcision and urinary tract infections.<sup><a
      href="#n348">348</a></sup> More recently, in 1999, the
      Academy again reversed course, concluding that the health
      benefits of circumcision are not pronounced enough to warrant
      its "routine" use as a medical procedure, and that anesthesia
      should ordinarily be employed.<sup><a
      href="#n349">349</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Campaigning for the elimination of routine
      neonatal circumcision is a new breed of norm
      entrepreneurs.<sup><a href="#n350">350</a></sup>
      Anti-circumcision organizations operate both in the United
      States and in other countries.<sup><a
      href="#n351">351</a></sup> Although small in numbers, these
      groups are passionately committed to their view of
      circumcision as a mutilating and unnecessary operation. Like
      their predecessors who advocated circumcision, contemporary
      circumcision opponents attempt to manipulate basic categories
      and social polarities in order to impress their views on the
      broader culture.</p>

      <p class="text1">On the surface, it appears that these
      anti-circumcision activists are united by nothing more than
      their opposition to the procedure. In this respect they
      differ from the norm entrepreneurs who promoted circumcision
      during the late nineteenth century. As we have seen,<sup><a
      href="#n352">352</a></sup> the earlier breed of activists was
      associated with a social group&mdash;physicians&mdash;that
      existed independently of circumcision. In the case of today's
      anti-circumcision movement, it is difficult to find similar
      constituent groups organized for other purposes. Accordingly,
      it is somewhat hard to identify the underlying social
      anxieties, if any, which motivate the members of this
      movement.</p>

      <p class="text1">Nevertheless, some observations are
      possible. The anti-circumcision movement appears to reflect
      two broader social themes of contemporary American society.
      One is the concept of a childhood wound. A variety of social
      concerns and movements draw from this basic idea. Parental
      narcissism, emotional abuse, or distancing is enlisted to
      explain problems in a child's later life.<sup><a
      href="#n353">353</a></sup> The child suffers a "primal wound"
      which is so painful that he or she, in later life, will
      engage in dysfunctional or addictive behaviors as a way of
      avoiding the pain of the original trauma.<sup><a
      href="#n354">354</a></sup> Codependency (living through
      others) is a common sequel.<sup><a href="#n355">355</a></sup>
      Another version of the childhood wound in contemporary
      American culture is the concern about the effects of parental
      substance abuse.<sup><a href="#n356">356</a></sup> The "adult
      children of alcoholics" syndrome is now widely accepted, and
      support groups for individuals who suffer the after-effects
      of parental substance abuse (e.g., Alanon) function in cities
      across the country. Parental incest is also a major issue for
      contemporary culture.<sup><a href="#n357">357</a></sup> The
      notion of the "inner child" who can be recovered through
      therapy and liberated from the wounds of a dysfunctional or
      abusive upbringing is nearly ubiquitous in the self-help
      literature.<sup><a href="#n358">358</a></sup> The
      anti-circumcision movement finds a natural home within this
      broader social trend. Neonatal circumcision is, in a sense,
      the paradigmatic childhood wound. It is not only a wound to
      the psyche, but also a direct assault on the child's body.
      Whatever motivates the broader phenomenon of concern about
      childhood wounding also appears to play a role in stimulating
      concern about male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">The second theme one can detect in the
      contemporary anti-circumcision movement relates to issues of
      gender, masculinity, and feminism. It is men, after all, who
      are circumcised. For some men today, it seems that the
      condition of being circumcised symbolizes a sense of damage
      to their traditional role and status. In this respect, the
      campaign against circumcision shares common features with the
      contemporary "men's movement."<sup><a
      href="#n359">359</a></sup> There is currently a sense among
      men that masculinity is under siege. Men's traditional roles
      as heads of the family and breadwinners have been challenged
      by feminist gains, which have placed women in competition
      with men.<sup><a href="#n360">360</a></sup> For some men, the
      journey into adulthood has been disappointing. They do not
      feel needed or valued.<sup><a href="#n361">361</a></sup> This
      painful experience may be defined in terms of bodily imagery.
      For such men, circumcision can symbolize the existential
      experience: the mutilated phallus is a synecdoche for the
      male condition in general. Anxieties about gender relations
      can thus influence attitudes about circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">While these twin anxieties&mdash;the
      breakdown of the family and the loss of the traditional male
      role&mdash;may be experienced by people who self-identify as
      circumcision opponents, the concerns are broader. Many people
      who are not circumcision activists feel such anxieties.
      Circumcision opponents draw on these anxieties and thereby
      seek to mold social perceptions into a different set of
      values and beliefs regarding circumcision. Whether they will
      be successful or not remains to be seen.</p>

      <p class="text1">1. Purity and Pollution</p>

      <p class="text1">Today's circumcision opponents reverse the
      polarity of purity and pollution, arguing that the
      uncircumcised phallus is "pure" and that circumcision is
      polluting. With regard to masturbation and spermatorrhoea,
      the task becomes trivial because of current scientific
      knowledge and social attitudes. Masturbation and
      spermatorrhoea are accepted, albeit with some reservations,
      as natural and harmless outlets for sexual energies.<sup><a
      href="#n362">362</a></sup> Victorian views on this topic are
      dismissed as hysteria or delusion.<sup><a
      href="#n363">363</a></sup> Arguments in favor of circumcision
      to deter masturbation or wet dreams seem today like hokum.
      Even if circumcision were protective against seminal loss, it
      would not be purifying since the condition is no longer
      polluting.</p>

      <p class="text1">Anti-circumcision advocates contest the view
      that circumcision promotes purity by facilitating penile
      hygiene.<sup><a href="#n364">364</a></sup> They observe that
      care of the intact penis is simply a matter of keeping it
      clean. A little education, and some soap and water, can
      supply all the purification necessary from the standpoint of
      hygiene. Circumcision is therefore an inappropriate response
      to the problem.</p>

      <p class="text1">Anti-circumcision advocates also
      rehabilitate smegma.<sup><a href="#n365">365</a></sup>
      Undeterred by awkwardness, opponents of circumcision boldly
      promote the substance as pure rather than polluting. Far from
      being a form of bodily waste captured within the preputial
      space, smegma is presented as a kind of lotion that anoints
      the penis in a purifying bath. It is a "lubricant" that keeps
      the skin supple and facilitates sex.<sup><a
      href="#n366">366</a></sup> In addition, it contains valuable
      anti-bacterial and anti-viral agents.<sup><a
      href="#n367">367</a></sup> Viewed as a lubricant and
      anti-microbial agent, Smegma is not a polluting waste
      substance but a part of the body's own mechanism for
      self-regulation. In the words of Paul Fleiss, a prominent
      anti-circumcision spokesman, smegma is probably the most
      misunderstood, most unjustifiably maligned substance in
      nature. Smegma is clean, not dirty, and is beneficial and
      necessary."<sup><a href="#n368">368</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents of circumcision characterize the
      circumcised phallus as polluted. Circumcision complications
      are described in terms of defilement. Penises are displayed
      with gaping holes through which urine and semen spurt out in
      the wrong direction. They erupt in grotesque skin
      growths.<sup><a href="#n369">369</a></sup> They ooze with
      ulcerations, burn with infections, and rot with necrotizing
      fasciitis.<sup><a href="#n370">370</a></sup> Sometimes they
      disappear into the abdomen.<sup><a href="#n371">371</a></sup>
      They are sliced in half or burned off.<sup><a
      href="#n372">372</a></sup> Images of pollution are everywhere
      in this account.</p>

      <p class="text1">Even if the circumcision does not result in
      polluting complications, the operation still defiles.
      Anti-circumcision activist Paul Fleiss observes that the
      "artificially externalized glans and meatus of the
      circumcised penis are constantly exposed to abrasion and
      dirt, making the circumcised penis, in fact, more
      unclean."<sup><a href="#n373">373</a></sup> Along the same
      lines, the premise that the circumcised penis requires little
      or no care has recently been questioned. An article in the
      British Journal of Urology concluded that the circumcised
      penis actually requires more care during the first three
      years: circumcised boys were significantly more likely to
      have skin adhesions, irritated urinary openings, and
      inflammation of the glans than their uncircumcised
      peers.<sup><a href="#n374">374</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">2. Health and Harm</p>

      <p class="text1">Today's circumcision opponents have
      radically reconceived the meaning of the prepuce along the
      dimension of health and harm. Instead of seeing it as an
      unnecessary and dangerous appendage, they view it as a
      "vital, dynamic, essential component of the male
      body."<sup><a href="#n375">375</a></sup> Their argument in
      favor of the prepuce as friendly to physical health has three
      prongs: first, circumcision does not, in fact, promote
      health; second, circumcision itself is the cause of disease
      or harm; and third, the prepuce is a useful and
      health-enhancing organ.</p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents of circumcision observe that the
      principal diseases and conditions for which circumcision was
      recommended at the end of the nineteenth century turn out
      either not to be harmful, or, if harmful, to have nothing to
      do with circumcision. Masturbation went out of fashion as a
      "disease" after the Second World War, and in any event is not
      cured by circumcision.<sup><a href="#n376">376</a></sup> Nor,
      along the same lines, does circumcision deter promiscuity or
      risky sexual behavior.<sup><a href="#n377">377</a></sup>
      Circumcision appears to play no role in the occurrence of
      prostate cancer,<sup><a href="#n378">378</a></sup> cervical
      cancer,<sup><a href="#n379">379</a></sup> alcoholism,
      epilepsy, asthma, gout, rheumatism, curvature of the spine,
      headache, insanity, paralysis, crossed eyes, rectal prolapse,
      hydrocephalus, clubfoot, eczema, convulsions, neurasthenia or
      mental retardation.<sup><a href="#n380">380</a></sup> As to
      phimosis, or "tight foreskin,"<sup><a
      href="#n381">381</a></sup> the modern view is that the
      condition is rare in adults,<sup><a
      href="#n382">382</a></sup> and its diagnosis in children is
      usually nothing more than a misperception of the normal
      separation process between the prepuce and glans.<sup><a
      href="#n383">383</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">There remains some evidence that
      circumcision may play a role in preventing a number of
      conditions. Circumcised boys and men may be at lower risk of
      contacting balanitis (a minor infection of the glans),<sup><a
      href="#n384">384</a></sup> urinary tract infections <sup><a
      href="#n385">385</a></sup> and penile cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n386">386</a></sup> A few studies have suggested that
      circumcised men experience lower rates of sexually
      transmitted diseases,<sup><a href="#n387">387</a></sup>
      including HIV.<sup><a href="#n388">388</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision opponents discount these
      studies as weak or unproven and, therefore, insufficient to
      place circumcision in the social category of "health." They
      observe that balanitis is a minor infection with no serious
      health risks.<sup><a href="#n389">389</a></sup> As to urinary
      tract infections, they observe that the evidence for a
      correlation with circumcision is not unambiguous <sup><a
      href="#n390">390</a></sup> and may reflect socioeconomic
      variables.<sup><a href="#n391">391</a></sup> They note that
      urinary tract infections in boys are uncommon, whether or not
      the boy is circumcised, and observe that this condition can
      usually be treated with antibiotics.<sup><a
      href="#n392">392</a></sup> As to penile cancer,
      anti-circumcision advocates observe that the evidence is
      again ambiguous: penile cancer occurs in circumcised as well
      as uncircumcised men,<sup><a href="#n393">393</a></sup> is
      virtually absent in some countries with no tradition of
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n394">394</a></sup> and reflects
      other risk factors such as smoking and promiscuity.<sup><a
      href="#n395">395</a></sup> Cancer of the penis is exceedingly
      rare and does not pose a serious health risk to the male
      population in general.<sup><a href="#n396">396</a></sup>
      Because penile cancer is a form of skin cancer, it would not
      be surprising if it occurred more frequently in uncircumcised
      men, who have about a third more skin in the region than
      circumcised men.<sup><a href="#n397">397</a></sup> But the
      fact that circumcision removes tissue that may become
      cancerous is hardly an argument for the operation's
      performance on a prophylactic basis; otherwise, we might
      routinely remove breasts or noses that are subject to
      cancers. Moreover, penile cancer almost never affects
      children. It occurs in men who, if not circumcised as
      children, have the choice, as adults, whether to be
      circumcised or not. Leaving the circumcision decision up to
      the affected individual would appear to pose few increased
      risks.<sup><a href="#n398">398</a></sup> Anti-circumcision
      advocates maintain that the alleged correlation between
      sexually transmitted diseases and lack of circumcision is
      weak at best and possibly spurious.<sup><a
      href="#n399">399</a></sup> With respect to HIV, they
      challenge the strength of the correlation and observe that
      circumcision might actually increase HIV infection if
      circumcised men come to believe that other precautions are
      unnecessary.<sup><a href="#n400">400</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In addition to arguing that circumcision
      does little, if anything, to promote health, circumcision
      opponents highlight complications of the procedure, which
      range from the minor and common to the rare and
      catastrophic.<sup><a href="#n401">401</a></sup> These
      arguments are enlisted to move circumcision from neutral
      ground&mdash;that is, neither promoting nor harming
      health&mdash;to the position of being affirmatively
      dangerous. Circumcision trauma may impair
      psychological<sup><a href="#n402">402</a></sup> and
      intellectual<sup><a href="#n403">403</a></sup> development.
      Physical complications include hemorrhage,<sup><a
      href="#n404">404</a></sup> adhesions,<sup><a
      href="#n405">405</a></sup> skin bridges,<sup><a
      href="#n406">406</a></sup> skin tears,<sup><a
      href="#n407">407</a></sup> denudation,<sup><a
      href="#n408">408</a></sup> bivalved or grooved glans,<sup><a
      href="#n409">409</a></sup> fistulae,<sup><a
      href="#n410">410</a></sup> concealed penis,<sup><a
      href="#n411">411</a></sup> urinary blockage,<sup><a
      href="#n412">412</a></sup> ulceration,<sup><a
      href="#n413">413</a></sup> meatal stenosis,<sup><a
      href="#n414">414</a></sup> and infections,<sup><a
      href="#n415">415</a></sup> which may be severe.<sup><a
      href="#n416">416</a></sup> The physician may botch the
      procedure, injuring the glans<sup><a
      href="#n417">417</a></sup> or scrotum,<sup><a
      href="#n418">418</a></sup> amputating the glans<sup><a
      href="#n419">419</a></sup> or penis,<sup><a
      href="#n420">420</a></sup> or burning the penis off with
      electrosurgery.<sup><a href="#n421">421</a></sup> One boy was
      even reassigned as a girl after a circumcision that destroyed
      the penis.<sup><a href="#n422">422</a></sup> In extreme
      cases, circumcision kills.<sup><a href="#n423">423</a></sup>
      These complications occur even in Western societies, where
      circumcisions are performed with sterile instruments and
      usually under medical supervision. The situation is more
      serious in traditional cultures, where circumcisions are
      often performed in non-sterile conditions and without medical
      supervision.<sup><a href="#n424">424</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, anti-circumcision advocates argue
      that the prepuce itself enhances health. Some attribute
      disease-fighting functions to the prepuce, observing that it
      blocks entry of contaminants and secretes immunological
      agents.<sup><a href="#n425">425</a></sup> Recent discoveries
      that preputial skin can be used for grafting may further
      enhance the perceived health benefits of the intact prepuce.
      The foreskin may provide a reservoir of skin that can be used
      for repairs if a person suffers damage to the skin elsewhere
      in his body.<sup><a href="#n426">426</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">3. Self and Other</p>

      <p class="text1">The polarity between self and other is
      reversed in the contemporary anti-circumcision rhetoric.
      While the earlier generation of norm entrepreneurs had
      accommodated circumcision to the category of "self," the new
      anti-circumcision advocates dissociate circumcision from the
      culture's concept of its own identity. The strategy here is
      two-fold: first, to reconceive the prepuce as part of the
      self; and second, to undermine the religious prestige that
      has historically accompanied the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision advocates had denigrated the
      prepuce as an appendage, a redundancy, even a piece of
      "tissue" lacking in definite organic identity.<sup><a
      href="#n427">427</a></sup> In this way, the prepuce could be
      classified as extraneous to the organism, and therefore could
      be removed without detracting from the self. Circumcision
      opponents reverse these categorizations. The prepuce, in
      their view, is part of the self and cannot be discarded as an
      alien intruder into the human anatomy. It serves many useful
      functions and is an interesting and complex anatomical
      structure in its own right. It is to be compared with the
      eyelid, a "dynamic shielding layer that preserves the
      sensitivity of the eyeball,"<sup><a
      href="#n428">428</a></sup> which no one would consider
      excising in a routine operation.</p>

      <p class="text1">With respect to the health-enhancing
      functions of the prepuce, anti-circumcision advocates revive
      and renovate the early theory that it protects the glans. In
      this respect, they cleverly reverse the argument of the
      previous generation of norm entrepreneurs. Remondino and
      colleagues had claimed that the prepuce once served a
      valuable protective function, but that in modern times,
      clothing did a better job.<sup><a href="#n429">429</a></sup>
      The organ, accordingly, was superfluous. For today's
      opponents, on the other hand, the development of clothing
      makes It necessary for the prepuce to protect the glans. For
      the infant in diapers, the foreskin protects the glans from
      exposure to urine and feces. Gairdner observed as early as
      1949 that "it seems to be no accident that during the years
      when the child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed
      by the prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans
      becomes susceptible to injury from contact with sodden
      clothes or napkin."<sup><a href="#n430">430</a></sup> As the
      child becomes toilet trained, this protection is no longer
      necessary, and the prepuce separates naturally from the
      glans.<sup><a href="#n431">431</a></sup> This argument is
      difficult to couch in evolutionary terms, since the prepuce
      existed before diapers came on the scene, and indeed is
      present in other mammals that do not wear any clothes at all.
      Anti-circumcision advocates do not claim that the prepuce
      evolved to protect against diaper rash, but rather present
      this advantage as a sort of happy accident of anatomy.</p>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce is also said to enhance sexual
      pleasure. Without the protection of the foreskin, the glans
      hardens due to the circumcision trauma<sup><a
      href="#n432">432</a></sup> or subsequent chafing.<sup><a
      href="#n433">433</a></sup> With the prepuce in place, on the
      other hand, the glans retains its sensitivity, heightening
      sexual pleasure. Quite apart from its function in protecting
      the glans, the foreskin is itself endowed with an abundant
      nerve supply,<sup><a href="#n434">434</a></sup> making it an
      erogenous organ in its own right.<sup><a
      href="#n435">435</a></sup> Working together, the prepuce and
      glans offer additional sensations: the prepuce slides back
      and forth over the glans during foreplay and
      intercourse.<sup><a href="#n436">436</a></sup> The prepuce
      also assists the sexual performance of women and older
      people: because the shaft of the penis slides back and forth
      inside the prepuce during intercourse, the organ reduces
      problems of vaginal dryness or weak erections.<sup><a
      href="#n437">437</a></sup> Although the prepuce's
      contribution to sex is difficult to measure, some men who
      have been circumcised as adults testify to its
      virtues.<sup><a href="#n438">438</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Others hypothesize that the foreskin has
      survival value because it inhibits sexual behavior. According
      to one theory, the presence of phimosis and preputial
      adhesions in younger males deters intercourse by making
      erections difficult.<sup><a href="#n439">439</a></sup> Where
      these conditions exist, boys delay sexual activity, and hence
      parenting, until they are older and better able to provide
      for children. Thus, males with adherent foreskins were more
      likely to pass on their genes to succeeding generations
      because their offspring were more likely to survive.<sup><a
      href="#n440">440</a></sup> Another theory conjectures that
      circumcision effects neurological reorganization by raising
      the threshold of sexual excitability, making men more
      tractable and cooperative.<sup><a
      href="#n441">441</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In addition to stressing the prepuce's
      functionality, anti-circumcision advocates praise its
      anatomical form. Contrary to popular belief, the prepuce is
      not a small and insignificant bit of skin. It is richly
      endowed with nerves, blood vessels, glands, and interesting
      skin formations.<sup><a href="#n442">442</a></sup> It does
      not "strangle" or "imprison" the glans, as norm entrepreneurs
      of an earlier generation argued. Rather, it gives form to,
      and is in turn formed by, the other organ.</p>

      <p class="text1">The concept of the prepuce "adhering" to the
      glans, like a foreign body that holds the glans back from
      achieving its intended function, also receives criticism from
      circumcision opponents. The terminology of "adhesions"
      ignores the fact that the prepuce and the glans are not
      originally separate structures. In the fetus, the deep
      surface of the prepuce is continuous with the epidermis
      surrounding the glans.<sup><a href="#n443">443</a></sup> Only
      as the fetus develops does the prepuce begin to separate from
      the glans, creating the preputial space. However, the
      separation process is rarely complete at birth.<sup><a
      href="#n444">444</a></sup> Gairdner found that in four out of
      five newborns the prepuce is not retractable, and that even
      by age three, about 10 percent of boys have a non-retractable
      prepuce.<sup><a href="#n445">445</a></sup> The prepuce and
      glans are not separate structures working at cross purposes,
      as in the older account, but rather parts of a single organic
      structure that separate through a normal process as the child
      matures. Recently, the scientific rehabilitation of the
      prepuce has taken another step with the discovery that
      preputial tissue has unusually valuable qualities for the
      treatment of burns and wounds.<sup><a
      href="#n446">446</a></sup> Neonatal prepuce cells can be
      harvested and grown in a laboratory into sheets that can
      later be used to repair the injury without danger of
      rejection. This procedure is now under commercial
      development, although it has not yet been approved for
      clinical use.<sup><a href="#n447">447</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In addition to rehabilitating the prepuce,
      anti-circumcision advocates deal with the sensitive issue of
      religious circumcision. One finds no criticism of the Jewish
      rite of the bris, even among opponents of male genital
      surgery. However, anti-circumcision advocates undercut the
      religious justification for circumcision. They sharply
      distinguish religious from non-religious rationales for
      circumcision, point to the horrors of ritual circumcisions in
      Africa, and suggest that circumcision should be a matter of
      individual conscience. The core of their argument, in this
      respect, is that people who do not identify themselves as
      members of religions practicing circumcision should not
      undergo the procedure.<sup><a href="#n448">448</a></sup> Some
      anti-circumcision activists argue that medical circumcision
      in the United States is actually a "secularized religious
      practice."<sup><a href="#n449">449</a></sup> This impeaches
      the credibility of arguments favoring medical circumcision by
      suggesting that they are based on religious rather than
      scientific considerations. Someone who has no religious
      justification for circumcision should therefore classify the
      procedure as "other" rather than "self."</p>

      <p class="text1">Critics of ritual circumcision focus on
      Africa. Here, the rhetoric stresses the ritualistic and
      primitive elements of African circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n450">450</a></sup> In an article in the London Sunday
      Times, journalist Robert Block describes the ordeal of South
      African youths of the Xhosa tribe.<sup><a
      href="#n451">451</a></sup> Block relates that the young men
      had "fallen into the hands" of "bush surgeons" who "subjected
      them" to "crude" circumcisions to mark their coming of
      age.<sup><a href="#n452">452</a></sup> Playing to the theme
      of the victims' youthfulness, Block describes one boy "on the
      verge of tears" who just "wanted to be a man."<sup><a
      href="#n453">453</a></sup> The author describes the
      traditional ceremony as "inflicting" dozens of "horrific
      disfigurements" on boys every year as a result of botched
      procedures or infection.<sup><a href="#n454">454</a></sup>
      Others tell of a mass Xhosa circumcision in 1996, in which 34
      initiates died and 26 required plastic and reconstructive
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n455">455</a></sup> In the same region
      the previous year, there were 34 deaths, 13 penis mutilations
      and 743 hospitalizations for infection.<sup><a
      href="#n456">456</a></sup> These reports implicitly undercut
      the value of ritual circumcision in general. However, they
      are not so threatening to supporters of the religious ritual
      in the United States because these accounts deal with
      "tribal" societies of Africa, the classic cultural "other,"
      rather than the cosmopolitan West.</p>

      <p class="text1">Even Jewish circumcisions occasionally face
      criticism from Jews who feel discomfort with the traditional
      bris. A few Jews are beginning to question the
      practice,<sup><a href="#n457">458</a></sup> and Jewish
      alternatives to circumcision are publicized and endorsed in
      anti-circumcision circles.<sup><a href="#n458">458</a></sup>
      The suggestion is that circumcision, even for Jews, should be
      a matter of individual conscience. The debate over
      circumcision within the Jewish community is now sufficiently
      pronounced that mohelim express concern about Jews abandoning
      the ceremony for non-invasive procedures.<sup><a
      href="#n459">459</a></sup> Even for some Jews, circumcision
      can be separated, at least to an extent, from the core of
      personal and cultural identity, and thereby classified as
      alien.</p>

      <p class="text1">4. Natural and Unnatural</p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents of circumcision claim that the
      intact penis is natural and the circumcised penis is
      unnatural. The argument here is not difficult, given that the
      prepuce is self-evidently a natural part of the male anatomy.
      In fact, in the claims of today's anti-circumcision
      advocates, one hears echoes of arguments put forward during
      the nineteenth century by physicians skeptical of
      circumcision's remedial value. References to the
      unnaturalness of circumcision are ubiquitous in the
      contemporary literature. Non-circumcision is the natural
      state.<sup><a href="#n460">460</a></sup> The foreskin is
      "normal."<sup><a href="#n461">461</a></sup> Circumcision is
      "not natural."<sup><a href="#n462">462</a></sup> Circumcision
      "tampers with" the male genitals."<sup><a
      href="#n463">463</a></sup> It is a "violent transgression of
      the rights of humans to whole, intact bodies."<sup><a
      href="#n464">464</a></sup> In this rhetoric of the
      anti-circumcision movement, the attempt to move circumcision
      from the category of "natural" to that of "unnatural" is
      clear and unequivocal.</p>

      <p class="text1">5. Beauty and Deformity</p>

      <p class="text1">Anti-circumcision advocates reject the idea
      that the circumcised phallus is an ideal of beauty, or that
      the prepuce is unattractive.</p>

      <p class="text1">It is somewhat difficult to portray the male
      foreskin as intrinsically beautiful, at least by standards of
      Western culture. Circumcision opponents do not attempt this
      feat, but rather argue for a different sort of beauty. They
      point to the efficiency and utility of the prepuce's design,
      which involves it operating as an integrated whole with the
      glans and penile shaft. The prepuce is compared to the
      eyelid, another mucous-lined, protective skin covering that
      enjoys favorable aesthetic associations in Western
      culture.<sup><a href="#n465">465</a></sup> As an example of
      anatomical engineering, it is beautiful, even
      "wondrous."<sup><a href="#n466">466</a></sup> Together with
      the penile shaft, the prepuce is like a "rose bud," ready to
      "blossom when the time is right."<sup><a
      href="#n467">467</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">On the other hand, the circumcised phallus
      is deformed and unattractive. If the uncircumcised organ is a
      rosebud, its uncircumcised cousin is a rose that has been
      torn open before its time and spoiled.<sup><a
      href="#n468">468</a></sup> The glans are "denuded,"
      "keratinized," "dry and tough,"<sup><a
      href="#n469">469</a></sup> with a "dull, grayish, sclerotic
      appearance."<sup><a href="#n470">470</a></sup> Pieces of the
      glans may be torn off, leaving it "pitted and
      scarred."<sup><a href="#n471">471</a></sup> "Shreds of
      foreskin" adhere to it, forming tags and bridges of
      "dangling, displaced skin."<sup><a href="#n472">472</a></sup>
      The image is not pretty.</p>

      <p class="text1">The penile shaft is also disfigured. The
      operation leaves a "large circumferential surgical
      scar."<sup><a href="#n473">473</a></sup> Depending on the
      amount of skin cut off and how the scar forms, the penis may
      be "permanently twisted," and may "curve or bow during
      erection."<sup><a href="#n474">474</a></sup> The contraction
      of the scar tissue, moreover, may "pull the shaft into the
      abdomen, in effect shortening the penis or burying it
      completely."<sup><a href="#n475">475</a></sup> These images
      portray the circumcised organ as maimed, disfigured, and
      completely lacking in natural beauty.</p>

      <p class="text1">6. Male and Female</p>

      <p class="text1">Anti-circumcision advocates reverse the
      cultural polarity of male and female by arguing that
      circumcision, far from enhancing masculinity, actually
      impairs it. Here, horror stories about damage to the penis
      are utilized to suggest that the operation is, in fact, a
      form of emasculation. In the worst cases, the penis may be
      amputated or burned away, resulting in actual
      castration.<sup><a href="#n476">476</a></sup> The victims of
      such procedures are not only emasculated, but also, in some
      cases, feminized as well; they may be reassigned gender, with
      the remaining tissues from their ruined genitals surgically
      reformed into an artificial vagina.<sup><a
      href="#n477">477</a></sup> Even "successful" circumcisions,
      in the view of circumcision opponents, are emasculating.
      Circumcision is "penile reduction surgery."<sup><a
      href="#n478">478</a></sup> It robs a male of a large
      percentage of his penile skin.<sup><a
      href="#n479">479</a></sup> It also shortens the penis, by as
      much as 25 percent.<sup><a href="#n480">480</a></sup> It
      removes more than "3 feet of veins, arteries, and
      capillaries, 240 feet of nerves, and ... 20,000 nerve
      endings." <sup><a href="#n481">481</a></sup> And it destroys
      muscles, glands, mucous membrane, and epithelial
      tissue.<sup><a href="#n482">482</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">7. Order and Chaos</p>

      <p class="text1">Notions of order and chaos are enlisted in
      the contemporary campaign against circumcision. Advocates of
      neonatal circumcision rationalized it as a routine procedure,
      carried out on subjects who because of their extreme youth
      are unaware of their surroundings, unable to experience pain,
      and incapable of remembering experiences.<sup><a
      href="#n483">483</a></sup> However, recent studies indicate
      that newborns are sensitive to the pain of
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n484">484</a></sup> not only
      during the procedure itself but also for a considerable time
      thereafter.<sup><a href="#n485">485</a></sup> Notwithstanding
      the intense pain of the procedure, physicians continue to
      conduct the operation without anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="#n486">486</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The anti-circumcision movement has begun to
      develop its own narrative of the operation that suggests the
      chaos underlying the apparent orderliness of the procedure. A
      version of this narrative appeared in an article from Men's
      Health in 1998:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text2">The baby, J. Hernandez, is less than a
          day old ... tiny head still slightly misshapen, eyelids
          puffy, mouth half-open in sleep. The nurse has taken him
          from his mother and is carrying him to a side room in the
          pediatric ward. The nurse pops on a white heat lamp with
          her elbow, removes the child from a blue blanket, and
          lays him in a molded plastic form bolted to the counter.
          This bathtub-like shell is called a Circumstraint. There
          are indentations for the baby's arms and legs. The nurse
          binds Velcro straps around his limbs, bends the light
          over him and steps back. The baby is naked and
          spread-eagled, and he begins to cry... .</p>

          <p class="text2">The doctor enters the room, scrubs his
          hands in the sink, and snaps on plastic gloves. The nurse
          passes him a package, and he opens it on the counter
          beside the child. Inside are several large, light blue
          cloth napkins; some squares of gauze; a squeeze-tube of
          Betadin (an antiseptic ointment); and an assortment of
          stainless-steel utensils: a pair of scissors, two
          hemostats (small, needle-nose pliers), a heavy metal
          clamp attached to a hollow cone, a scalpel handle, and a
          scalpel in a sterile packet... . The doctor swabs the
          baby's testicles and penis with antiseptic-soaked gauze,
          then lays one cloth over his torso, another over his
          legs, and a third, with a small hole in the middle, over
          his genitals. He pops the tiny penis through the hole.
          The baby is still crying. The nurse mentions that babies
          feel safest in the fetal position. She says they hate
          having their arms held away from their bodies. The
          parents are not in the room. The nurse shuts the door...
          .</p>

          <p class="text2">The doctor snaps the scalpel blade onto
          the handle, then places it besides the baby. Lifting the
          hemostat, which resembles a sharp-tipped pair of pliers,
          he begins. Holding the penis in one hand, he moves the
          point of the hemostat through the hole at the end of the
          foreskin. The foreskin is tightly attached to the glans,
          like a fingernail to a finger. The doctor begins pushing
          the point between the foreskin and the glans. The
          operation is similar to running a razor blade underneath
          the fingernail. The baby bucks on the plastic form, in
          obvious pain... . The child struggles against the straps.
          The foreskin is attached firmly to the glans, and it's
          difficult to pry loose. The doctor scrapes the point of
          the hemostat in a circular motion around the glans,
          tearing the skin off the head of the penis. The child
          continues to buck on the plastic form. This is why the
          Circumstraint is bolted to the counter... . The foreskin
          is still attached to the glans and the doctor must rake
          the hemostat around the head of the penis several times.
          The baby is shrieking now, his face red, his eyes
          squeezed shut.</p>

          <p class="text2">The foreskin is finally separated from
          the glans. Using a second hemostat, the doctor runs the
          point up inside the foreskin, clamps it to constrict
          blood flow, moves the hemostat a quarter inch, takes up
          the scissors and slices the skin along the clamp line...
          . Suddenly the baby is quiet ... mouth open, but no
          sound; body rigid. The foreskin is splayed open and
          bleeding. The doctor tears a hole in the skin and forces
          a hollow cone up inside the foreskin. The baby begins
          screaming again, straining at the straps. The
          stainless-steel cone keeps the glans from being cut off.
          Using both hands, the doctor places a heavy clamp over
          the child's penis, which protrudes through a hole in the
          clamp. The doctor tightens the clamp, picks up the
          scalpel, and in one smooth, practiced motion circles it
          around the foreskin... . The foreskin is peeled away like
          the rind of an orange. The baby is still crying. After
          several minutes, the doctor removes the clamp, pops off
          his gloves, and leaves. The nurse quickly applies an
          antiseptic ointment and returns the trembling child to
          his parents.<sup><a href="#n487">487</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">In this narrative, we are situated outside
      the perspective of the doctor conducting the procedure. For
      the physician conducting the procedure, the matter is simply
      one of technique and routine. He is oblivious to the baby's
      cries, focusing instead on getting the job done in a
      professional manner. His embeddedness in the professional
      role is evidenced by the economy of effort he displays in
      manipulating the surgical implements, and the apparent sense
      of professional validation and power he feels when he "snaps
      on" the surgical gloves.</p>

      <p class="text1">Yet observed from without, the operation has
      all the elements of a ritual. It takes place in a ritually
      separated space, the "side room" of a pediatric ward. The
      physician wears specialized clothing set apart from the
      garments worn during everyday life. The tools of the ritual
      are laid out in a carefully specified order. His
      concentration is intense and focused. The practitioner's
      actions, and those of his ritual assistant, the nurse, are
      precise and scripted. The entire event is steeped in
      tradition, replicating thousands of other circumcisions
      extending back into medical time. The ritualistic quality of
      the event appears to be brought near the surface of the
      narrative because the observer who is recording the event has
      chosen a neutral stance that separates himself from
      involvement in the performative aspect of the ceremony.</p>

      <p class="text1">For the child who forms the subject of the
      ritual, the occasion appears in still a different light. Of
      all the participants, the child experiences life with the
      most intensity. He is only a few days old. For him, the event
      is one of unspeakable terror. He is ripped from the arms of
      his mother, removed to an unfamiliar place, strapped by
      wrists and ankles to a hard board, and assaulted by a
      stranger who cuts away one of the most sensitive parts of his
      body. he is portrayed as experiencing confusion, pain and
      terror. His cries, which have previously brought comfort from
      a loving mother or a sympathetic nurse, are simply ignored.
      His parents are nowhere to be found. Anxiety and betrayal
      replace the reassuring sense that the world is a safe and
      comfortable place. As one man put it, "imagine you have just
      gone through the most traumatic experience of your life,
      being held by your warm and cuddly mommy when someone whisks
      you away to be strapped naked to a board, and wants to cut
      you."<sup><a href="#n488">488</a></sup> The procedure, from
      the standpoint of the child, is portrayed as a terrifying
      descent into a chaotic hell of pain and confusion.
      Anti-circumcision advocates are adept at bringing out these
      chaotic elements in their narratives of neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">8. Good and Bad</p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents of circumcision reverse the
      polarity of good and bad, arguing that circumcision is bad
      and lack of circumcision is good. The old view that the lack
      of circumcision was bad depended on outdated notions of
      sexuality and disease. Masturbation is not an evil, and those
      who practice it are not indulging in sin. Thus even if
      circumcision were protective against masturbation, which it
      is not, it would not for that reason be "good."</p>

      <p class="text1">Conversely, today's opponents of
      circumcision emphasize that the procedure itself is bad. They
      point to the cruelty of the pain the infant experiences when
      a circumcision is performed without anesthetic.<sup><a
      href="#n489">489</a></sup> They observe that the procedure is
      performed on children who are incapable of giving informed
      consent.<sup><a href="#n490">490</a></sup> They equate it to
      a form of torture and claim that it violates the right to
      bodily integrity to which all children are entitled.<sup><a
      href="#n491">491</a></sup> And they compare the procedure to
      female genital mutilation, which is roundly and unequivocally
      condemned by Western authorities.<sup><a
      href="#n492">492</a></sup> The thrust of all these arguments
      is to demonstrate that the operation of circumcision is
      morally bad, and that the intact genitalia are good.</p>

      <p class="text1">9. True and False</p>

      <p class="text1">Opponents of circumcision claim the high
      ground with respect to knowledge and ignorance. They point to
      a "growing body of research" to show that circumcision, in
      fact, has potentially harmful psychological and physical
      effects.<sup><a href="#n493"></a></sup> To bolster their
      claim to superior scientific knowledge, anti-circumcision
      advocates include in their web pages bibliographies
      containing hundreds of studies of circumcision, all casting
      doubt on the efficacy of the procedure, raising questions
      about side effects, or highlighting the pain that infants
      experience when the operation is conducted without
      anesthetic.<sup><a href="#n494">494</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">These contemporary norm entrepreneurs
      explain the former scientific consensus in favor of
      circumcision as premised on "ignorance and false
      information."<sup><a href="#n495">495</a></sup> Physicians
      who promoted circumcision as a remedy for masturbation were
      "well meaning," but subsequent research has proven them to be
      mistaken.<sup><a href="#n496">496</a></sup> As "medical
      knowledge improves," the "harm done by circumcision is being
      recognized and accepted."<sup><a href="#n497">497</a></sup>
      Those who continue to support routine neonatal circumcision
      are mired in an outdated scientific model.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision opponents argue that ignorance
      and outright misinformation accompany the procedure. Parents,
      for example, display confusion about the operation.<sup><a
      href="#n498">498</a></sup> Some do not even understand what
      circumcision is. The reasons they give for consenting to the
      procedure reflect a mix of accurate information, outdated
      views, and outright superstition. They circumcise boys to
      reduce crying,<sup><a href="#n499">499</a></sup> prevent
      masturbation,<sup><a href="#n500">500</a></sup> promote
      hygiene,<sup><a href="#n501">501</a></sup> ward off
      infection,<sup><a href="#n502">502</a></sup> or deter
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n503">503</a></sup> The most important
      consideration is often the wish that the child should
      resemble his father and not suffer ridicule.<sup><a
      href="#n504">504</a></sup> Some of the more thoughtful
      studies of circumcision conclude that the principal element
      in the circumcision decision is cultural rather than
      medical.<sup><a href="#n505">505</a></sup> As one observer
      put it, "entrenched tradition of custom is probably the
      greatest obstacle faced by those who would decrease the
      number of circumcisions done in this country."<sup><a
      href="#n506">506</a></sup> Custom, however, is not knowledge,
      or at least not knowledge of the medical variety.
      Circumcision opponents highlight the cultural element in
      parental choice in order to disparage the claim that the
      operation is based on scientific knowledge rather than on
      ignorance, tradition, or superstition.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text1">This final section looks to the future. Will
      today's anti-circumcision advocates be effective at changing
      social and legal norms? The question requires prediction,
      always a dangerous enterprise, especially when the matter is
      as complex and controversial as genital surgery. However,
      some tentative observations are possible.</p>

      <p class="text1">First, it is probable that medical
      circumcision of boys, even in the United States, will soon no
      longer be normative. A growing body of medical research casts
      doubt on the medical benefits of the procedure while
      highlighting the pain a child experiences when it is
      performed without anesthesia. Circumcision opponents,
      although small in number, are vocal and active, and have been
      able to bring their message to the public in a variety of
      ways, such as holding conferences, publishing books, staging
      protests, and publishing data on the Internet.<sup><a
      href="#n507">507</a></sup> The circumcision rate is already
      dropping in the United States; in the Western states, it is
      already well below 50 percent.<sup><a
      href="#n508">508</a></sup> In countries such as England where
      circumcision was once common, the procedure is vanishing
      altogether except when performed for religious reasons. As
      fewer boys are circumcised, parents have less reason to fear
      that an uncircumcised boy will experience ridicule from his
      classmates. Indeed, at some point, which the United States is
      already approaching, the concern will reverse: parents will
      refrain from circumcising their boys out of fear that they
      will be mocked or ridiculed if they undergo the procedure. As
      one mother observed, "by the time my son [reaches puberty],
      half of the boys won't be circumcised either."<sup><a
      href="#n509">509</a></sup> Some parents have already made the
      switch between children, so that the older boy is circumcised
      and the younger one is not.<sup><a href="#n510">510</a></sup>
      Circumcision as a medical procedure, in short, appears to be
      headed the way of tonsillectomies and other once popular but
      now unfashionable surgical interventions. Like foot binding
      in China, a widespread social convention is likely to
      collapse as the culture reaches a "tipping point" and turns
      against the practice. In this respect, today's
      anti-circumcision advocates are likely to carry the day. Much
      more problematic is whether these advocates will be able to
      embody their beliefs in legal prohibitions that parallel the
      existing legal norms against female genital mutilation. In
      spite of the arguments by anti-circumcision advocates,
      Western culture does not view the male and female procedures
      as equivalent. Moreover, our culture's views on this matter
      are reinforced and magnified by powerful groups who oppose
      any equation between the two procedures&mdash;Jews and
      Muslims who cherish male circumcision as a precious cultural
      heritage, and opponents of female genital mutilation who do
      not want to dilute popular opposition to the female
      operation. These groups will exercise their influence over
      social meanings to prevent the sort of equation between the
      male and female procedures that might result in legislation
      outlawing male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">This does not mean that the law will remain
      entirely static either. As popular attitudes towards
      circumcision change, courts will likely view the procedure
      with less favoritism than they have shown heretofore.
      Unauthorized circumcisions are unlikely to escape legal
      sanction in the future, as they have in the past, on the
      ground that the operation was performed without malpractice.
      Courts are likely to insist on informed consent practices
      that equal those commonly used for other surgical procedures.
      And when damages are awarded, they are likely to be more
      substantial than awards in the past. In one area, in
      particular, the legal treatment of circumcision is likely to
      change: physicians' and hospitals' liability in connection
      with anesthesia. As we have seen, many studies find that
      infants feel pain and that circumcision is, in fact, quite
      painful.<sup><a href="#n511">511</a></sup> Investigators
      terminated a recent study of pain in circumcision on the
      ground that it would be unethical to continue, given the
      obvious fact that babies who were not anesthetized were
      suffering.<sup><a href="#n512">512</a></sup> So strong is
      this evidence that the American Academy of Pediatrics, in
      March 1999, recommended that all circumcisions be performed
      with anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n513">513</a></sup> Sooner or
      later(probably sooner) the standard of care for circumcisions
      will include the routine administration of anesthesia. A
      physician who fails to use anesthesia during a circumcision
      would then face exposure to malpractice liability. Moreover,
      the informed consent requirement will almost certainly evolve
      to include disclosure about the availability of anesthesia.
      Given recent studies and authoritative recommendations, it
      would appear foolhardy for a hospital not to disclose to
      parents that they have the option of instructing the
      physician to use anesthesia. Although it might appear that
      the liability risk here is small, a plaintiff's attorney
      could craft a class action against a major hospital on behalf
      of all boys who have been circumcised without anesthetic
      after some triggering event, such as the 1999 recommendation
      by the American Academy of Pediatrics. With a class action
      procedure, damages can rapidly magnify into substantial
      sums.</p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, what will be the culture's response
      to these changes along the polarities that have formed the
      conceptual basis of the analysis above? The most probable
      scenario is that the culture will revert to the attitudes it
      held toward male circumcision prior to the late nineteenth
      century. Circumcision, in other words, will not be viewed as
      pure or polluting, good or bad, true or false, male or
      female. The procedure probably will not be viewed as chaotic,
      both because the procedure is simple and relatively safe, and
      because the use of anesthetics is likely to become nearly
      universal. As it becomes increasingly uncommon, however,
      circumcision is likely to move in the direction of being
      thought of as alien, unnatural, and disfiguring. The practice
      of neonatal circumcision, meanwhile, may well take its place
      alongside other once popular medical procedures that have
      fallen into discredit or disuse.</p>

        <p class="section">C<span class="sc">ONCLUSION</span></p>

      <p class="text1">This article has examined the operation of
      law and culture in American society as it relates to the
      issue of male circumcision. What is remarkable here is not so
      much what the law has done to regulate the procedure, but
      rather what it has not done. One might expect that the
      infliction of painful, disfiguring, and possibly unnecessary
      surgeries on the bodies of innocent children would be a
      subject for legal concern. Yet, as we have seen, the law not
      only permits such an operations to take place but also
      affirmatively favors the procedure in a variety of ways. This
      legal approach might seem particularly surprising given the
      fact that the law powerfully condemns surgeries on girls that
      appear to be analogous in some respects to male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">The explanation for this puzzle lies in our
      culture. Cultural values, norms and beliefs heavily influence
      American laws on genital surgery. In particular, the
      culture's attitudes toward genital surgeries reflects
      underlying polarities that structure social reality. This
      article traced the evolution of those attitudes across
      several distinct phases. Traditionally, the culture viewed
      male circumcision as neutral along the dimensions of
      purity/pollution, male/female, good/bad, and true/false.
      However, the culture generally viewed circumcision as alien,
      unnatural, unhealthy, deforming, and chaotic. Because the
      values placed on circumcision were either negative or
      neutral, and because the culture did not practice
      circumcision, the effect of these cultural polarities was to
      deter Christians from using the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1">In the latter half of the nineteenth
      century, a group of norm entrepreneurs arose to promote
      circumcision as a desirable medical procedure. They claimed
      that the uncircumcised phallus was polluted, unhealthy,
      alien, unnatural, ugly, emasculated, chaotic, bad and false.
      The circumcised organ, in contrast, was given a positive
      value along each of these dimensions. These circumcision
      advocates succeeded brilliantly, first at establishing the
      legitimacy of the operation as a remedy for all sorts of
      diseases and conditions, and later at securing a place for
      the operation as a routine prophylactic procedure for newborn
      boys. Their success is probably due to the fact that
      circumcision offered the culture, and discrete sub-groups
      within it, an effective anxiety-management technique that
      avoided many of the difficulties encountered by the struggle
      against masturbation and spermatorrhoea.</p>

      <p class="text1">More recently, a new breed of activists has
      emerged, this time campaigning against routine neonatal
      circumcision. These norm entrepreneurs reverse the value
      structure of the earlier, pro-circumcision authorities. They
      describe the circumcised phallus as polluted, unhealthy,
      alien, unnatural, ugly, emasculated, chaotic, bad, and false,
      and they claim that opposite values attach to the intact
      phallus. Although few in number, these circumcision opponents
      are vocal and militant and have contributed to the
      discrediting of the operation in several countries where it
      was once popular. In the United States, circumcision is still
      normative, but the signs are that within a relatively short
      span of years, perhaps a generation, medical circumcision
      will be uncommon in the United States.</p>

      <p class="text1">Despite the likely reversal in practice,
      American culture has not accepted, and will probably never
      accept, the views of anti-circumcision advocates in full.
      While circumcision will no longer be normative, neither will
      it be condemned. The operation is too firmly embedded in
      American culture for that. Jews and others who view
      circumcision as a religious heritage will work to prevent a
      wholesale moral repudiation of the procedure, while feminists
      and human rights advocates will reject any attempt to equate
      male circumcision in the United States with female genital
      mutilation in Africa and the Middle East. Rather than
      repudiating the procedure out of hand, as today's
      anti-circumcision advocates would prefer, the culture is
      likely to revert to a posture similar to the one it occupied
      prior to the late nineteenth century, viewing circumcision
      with some suspicion but tolerating it where it occurs.</p>

      <p class="text1">The implications for the law are these. It
      is inconceivable, at least at present, that the United States
      will prohibit male circumcision as it has done with female
      genital mutilation, even if religious ceremonies are exempted
      from such a ban. However, the law is likely to change at the
      margin. Standards for informed consent are likely to toughen
      significantly, and the threat of damages for circumcisions
      performed without consent is likely to pose an increased risk
      for physicians and hospitals. Perhaps most immediately, it is
      likely that tort law will soon require that all circumcisions
      be performed with anesthesia, at least unless there are
      contra-indications in the patient's medical history. Not only
      will failing to provide anesthesia eventually constitute a
      form of malpractice in its own right, but, more immediately,
      hospitals will face exposure to liability if they do not
      include information about the availability of anesthesia in
      the consent-to-surgery forms they distribute to the patients'
      guardians.</p>

      <p class="text1">Overall, this paper has attempted to
      demonstrate that law and culture are not distinct spheres of
      social action. Law IS culture. In the area of circumcision,
      we observe the impact of cultural forces quite clearly, but
      the point is general. All forms of law are cultural
      artifacts. A challenge for future research is to tease out
      the cultural elements in other legal rules, practices and
      institutions.</p>

      The connection between culture and law is explored to some
      extent in the Law and Literature movement, which relates
      literary texts to law. Law and Society studies also relate
      culture to law by emphasizing law's relationship with broader
      cultural phenomena. The recent interest in "norms" among
      legal scholars has a strong cultural element. See generally,
      e.g., Robert Ellickson, Order Without Law: How Neighbors
      Settle Disputes (1991) (outlines theory using informal and
      formal norm study to define human activity that falls within
      &mdash;and beyond&mdash;the scope of the law.); Geoffrey P.
      Miller, The Song of Deborah: A Legal-Economic Analysis, 144
      U. Pa. L. Rev. 2293 (1996) (exploring the role of the Song of
      Deborah in norm-creating and norm-enforcing in ancient
      Israel); Cass R. Sunstein, Social Norms and Social Rules, 96
      Colum. L. Rev. 903 (1996) (suggesting norm management as an
      important strategy for accomplishing the objectives of law);
      Richard H. McAdams, The Origin, Development and Regulation of
      Norms, 96 Mich. L. Rev. 338 (1997) (advocating the use of
      norms in economic analysis of the law); Lisa Bernstein,
      Social Norms and Default Rule Analysis, 3 S. Cal. Interdisc.
      L.J. 59 (1993) (arguing social norms directly relevant to
      default rules analysis); Eric A. Posner, Law, Economics, and
      Inefficient Norms, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1697 (1996) (analyzing
      norm efficiency and suggesting state rules more efficient
      than group norms); Lawrence Lessig, Social Meaning and Social
      Norms, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2181 (1996) (urging consideration
      of cultural context, in addition to action, in social norm
      analysis). A few constitutional law scholars also examine the
      importance of culture in their disciplines. See, e.g., Paul
      W. Kahn, The Cultural Study of Law: Reconstructing Legal
      Scholarship 1 (1999) ("The culture of the law's rule needs to
      be studied in the same way as other cultures."); David A.J.
      Richards, Women, Gays, and the Constitution: The Grounds for
      Feminism and Gay Rights in Culture and Law 149-155 (1998)
      (describing the women's suffrage movement leaders as working
      within "conventional gender roles, shaped...by highly
      contingent cultural factors" to accomplish legal
      reform.).<br />

      For anthropological studies emphasizing the importance of
      polarities in the organization of various cultures, see,

      Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of
      Pollution and Taboo (1966); Robert Hertz, The Pre-eminence of
      the Right Hand: A Study of Religious Polarity, in Right &amp;
      Left: Essays on Dual Symbolic Classification 13-14 (Rodney
      Needham, ed., 1973). These writers vary to some extent in the
      degree to which they believe that the polarities have
      cross-cultural universality, but all accept the basic idea
      that societies tend to organize their models of the world in
      terms of polar oppositions.<br />

       target="_blank">18 U.S.C. 116</a> (2001). This statute
      provides that "whoever knowingly circumcises, excises, or

      labia minora or clitoris of another person who has not

      some cultures, genital alteration of males is performed
      symbolically, without any actual damage to the virile member.
      For example, among the Nive of the South Pacific, the
      practitioner "performs a mimic operation on his own finger."
      See Rosemary Romberg, Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma 3
      (1985). When converts join an Islamic sect in Mysore, a betel
      leaf is substituted for the foreskin and excised. See
      id.<br />
      <a id="n70"
      name="n70"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.
      Incision, or cutting of the foreskin without removal of
      tissue, is attested among peoples of East Africa, Asia, and
      the Pacific Islands. See James DeMeo, <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/demeo.html"
      target="_blank">The Geography of Male and Female Genital
      Mutilations</a>, <i>in</i> Sexual Mutilations: A Human
      Tragedy 1, 3 (George C. Denniston and Marilyn Fayre Milos
      eds., 1997). The depth and length of the cut varies from
      culture to culture, ranging from a small wound to a deep gash
      that exposes the glans but does not remove the foreskin. See
      id. For a detailed anthropological study of incision among
      one culture, see Ian Hogbin, The Island of Menstruating Men:
      Religion in Wogeo, New Guinea 88-92, 102-03, 120-21 (1970).
      Closer to full circumcision is the practice attested in
      Ancient Egypt, where priests and other men of elite status
      would slit the foreskin to let it hang free, but not remove
      it. See Robert G. Hall, Circumcision, in I Anchor Bible
      Dictionary 1025 (David Noel Freedman, ed., 1992). More
      extreme forms of incision involve cuts along the top or
      bottom of the penile shaft. Australian tribes practiced
      sub-incision, in which the urethra is laid open from the
      meatus (the opening at the tip of the penis) back to the
      junction with the scrotum. See Bruno Bettelheim, Symbolic
      Wounds: Puberty Rites and the Envious Male 14 (author's note
      citing studies by Spencer and Gillen) (1954). In Polynesia,
      some cultures practice super-incision in which the prepuce is
      cut longitudinally from the upper surface back to the pubic
      region. See 3 Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics 659-60 (J.
      Hasting ed. 1951).<br />

      ancient Greeks valued the prepuce because it covered the
      glans, which modesty required to be shielded from public
      view. See Gollaher, supra <a href="#n19">note 19</a>, at 14;
      Hall, supra <a href="#n70">note 70</a>, at 1027. If the
      foreskin was too short, so that some of the glans was
      visible, Greek men would resort to epispasm, the practice of
      artificially lengthening the foreskin by hanging a weight
      from the organ. Jews suffering persecution under Antiochus IV
      (168 BCE) attempted to reverse their circumcisions by means
      of a weight known as the <i>pondus judaeus</i>. See Dirk
      Schultheiss et al., <a
      href="/library/restoration/schultheiss/">Uncircumcision: A
      Historical Review of Preputial Restoration</a>, 101 Plastic
      &amp; Reconstructive Surgery 1990, 1991 (1998). Jews
      suffering persecution by Romans around the time of the Bar
      Kokhba revolt, in 132 C.E., followed suit. Gollaher, supra <a
      href="#n19">note 19</a>, at 16. Similar efforts occurred
      during the Nazi persecution. Schultheiss et al., supra, at
      1994-95. A modern version of epispasm, sometimes known as
      "uncircumcision," is practiced today by men who want to
      revert to the "intact" state. See Willard E. Goodwin, <a
      href="/library/restoration/goodwin1/">Uncircumcision: A
      Technique for Plastic Reconstruction of a Prepuce After
      Circumcision</a>, 144 J. Urology 1203, 1203 (1990); M.J.

      <a id="n74"

      men secured the foreskin in place with a pin (<i>fibula</i>).
      Hall, supra <a href="#n70">note 70</a>, at 1027. The term
      "infibulation," used to describe the Greek practices, is now
      defined as a "process of fastening" such as the sewing
      together of the foreskin over the glans of the penis. See
      Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 989 (18th ed. 1997).
      Infibulation could be accomplished by transfixing the prepuce
      with a ring of gold, silver or iron or by sewing the foreskin
      together with sutures. See Peter Charles Remondino, History
      of Circumcision from the Earliest Times to the Present 48
      (1891). Similar practices are attested among some South
      American tribes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="notes">men wear just a waist string to which is
        attached the tied outstretched foreskin of the penis. If
        this minimal attire accidentally unties, the owner
        immediately must refasten it. Even during combat, a man
        will stop fighting to retie his foreskin lest the head of
        his penis becomes an object of public display. While
        bathing, foreskins have to be untied and retied under
        water, discretely avoiding any chance that others may see
        one's glans.</p>

      Magazine of the American Scene 24 (1998).<br />
       In other cultures, infibulation guarded against sexual
      arousal. The procedure was a popular lust-inhibiting device
      among early Christian monks and other ascetics, who would
      sometimes compete over who had the most extreme arrangement.
      During the nineteenth century, infibulation found a new
      popularity among men who wanted to protect themselves against
      masturbatory impulses or nocturnal emissions. See, e.g.,
      Louis Bauer, Infibulation as a Remedy for Epilepsy and
      Seminal Losses, 6 St. Louis Clinical Rec. 163, 163-65
      (1879).<br />

      Victorian medicine devised a variety of techniques for
      mutilating or otherwise affecting penile structure. One of
      the principal targets was the urethra. Nineteenth century
      physicians often recommended passing a "bougie"&mdash;a long,
      narrow steel rod&mdash;up the urethral canal, cauterizing the
      urethra, prostate and seminal vesicles with silver nitrate in
      order to prevent the production and loss of sperm. See
      Frederick Hodges, A Short History of the Institutionalization
      of Involuntary Sexual Mutilation in the United States,
      <i>in</i> Sexual Mutilations: A Human Tragedy 17, 19 (George
      C. Denniston &amp; Marilyn Fayre Milos, eds., 1997); The term
      is from the French "bougie," or candle, see Taber's
      Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, supra <a href="#n74">note
      74</a>, at 253; Arthur N. Gilbert, Doctor, Patient, and
      Onanist Diseases in the Nineteenth Century, J. of the Hist.

      Results, and Complications 154-55 (1881) (describing
      successful, although agonizing, bougie treatment for
      spermatorrhoea). In cases of persistent masturbation the
      spine and genitals would be cauterized. See Rene A. Spitz,
      Authority and Masturbation: Some Remarks on a Bibliographical
      Investigation, 9 Y.B. Psychoanalysis 113, 123 (1953).<br />

      Castration has served numerous cultural purposes. Among the
      Hottentots, one testicle was removed as part of an infancy
      ritual. See Felix Bryk, Sex &amp; Circumcision: A Study of
      Phallic Worship and Mutilation in Men and Women 123-24
      (1967). In many cultures, victorious soldiers cut off the
      male members of defeated foes as a way of demonstrating
      ferocity and humiliating enemies. See P.C. Remondino, supra
      <a href="#n74">note 74</a>, at 28-29 (1891). Boys would also
      be castrated in order to convert them into eunuchs. In the
      Middle East, eunuchs served in harems as guardians of a
      chief's wives. In China, they served as civil servants. See
      Cathy Joseph, Compassionate Accountability: An Embodied
      Consideration of Female Genital Mutilation, 24 J.
      Psychohistory 2, 10 (1996). In Europe, they were valued for
      the purity of their voices, especially for ecclesiastical
      music; even up to the end of the eighteenth century,
      thousands of boys were castrated each year in order to supply
      the choirs of European churches. See Didier Diers &amp;
      Xavier Valla, <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/diers.html"
      target="_blank">The Skoptzy: The Russian Sect of the
      Castrated</a>, in Sexual Mutilations: A Human Tragedy 63,
      63-66 (George C. Denniston and Marilyn Fayre Milos, eds.,
      1997). Castration was also used as a mark of religious fervor
      and devotion. Origen, a father of the Christian Church
      castrated himself, and 72 eunuchs have been beatified. See
      id. at 63. In Russia, a sect of castrated men, the Skoptzy,
      flourished in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
      claiming as many as 10,000 members in the mid-nineteenth
      century. See id. at 64. Resort to castration as a mark of
      religious fervor has not disappeared from Western culture: in
      1997, members of an American flying saucer cult castrated
      themselves before committing mass suicide. See John Lang,
      Cult Deaths Remain a Mystery, Detroit News, Mar. 26, 1998, at
      A12. Castration could also be enlisted as a means of treating
      medical conditions. Not a few nineteenth century physicians
      recommended it as a remedy for otherwise intractable cases.
      See, e.g., H.C. Sharp, The Severing of the Vasa Deferentia
      and its Relation to the Neuropsychopathic Constitution, 75
      N.Y. Med. J., 411, 413 (1902) (Superintendent of the Kansas
      Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth castrated 47 of his
      inmates, claiming a marked physical and mental improvement in
      consequence, including one case in which the patient could be
      discharged.) In India, more than 50,000 castrated males and
      hermaphrodites, the <i>hijras</i>, still operate at the
      fringes of society, living largely through extortion and
      prostitution. See Zia Jaffrey, The Invisibles: A Tale of the
      Eunuchs of India 39-41 (1996). In the United States,
      "chemical castration," in the form of drug treatments that
      destroy sexual capacities, is touted in some quarters as a
      treatment for repeat sex offenders. See, e.g., Philip J.
      Henderson, Section 645 of the California Penal Code:
      California's "Chemical Castration" Law&mdash;A Panacea or
      Cruel and Unusual Punishment?, 32 U.S.F.L. Rev. 653 (1998)
      (discussing chemical castration as a violation of the Eighth
      Amendment). Castration is also employed these days as part of
      gender reassignment surgery for men, with some of the penile
      tissue being reconstructed into a surgically-created vagina.
      See, e.g., J.Rehman &amp; A. Melman, Formation of Neoclitoris
      from Glans Penis by Reduction of Gensplasty with Preservation
      of Neurovascular Bundle in Male-to-Female Gender Surgery:
      Functional and Cosmetic Outcome, 161 J. of Urology 200,
      200-06 (1999).<br />
      <a id="n78"
      name="n78"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Even
      when castration is not actually performed, it may be feared.
      Freud's theory of neurosis is premised on genital mutilation
      &mdash;the fear of castration at the hands of fathers that
      boys supposedly experience during the fourth or fifth year of
      life. See Sigmund Freud, The Passing of the Oedipus-Complex
      [1924], <i>in</i> Sexuality and the Psychology of Love 166
      (Philip Rieff ed., 1963).<br />
      <a id="n79"
      name="n79"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. See
      Ira M. Rutkow, Surgery: An Illustrated History 17 (1993)
      (beginnings of circumcision operation are "clothed in
      mystery."). Gollaher reports that mummies from as early as
      4000 BCE show signs of circumcision. See Gollaher, supra <a

      <a id="n80"
      name="n80"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The
      Bible's reference to "knives of flint" used for the
      circumcision may imply that the procedure originated prior to
      the time when metal substituted for stone in cutting
      implements. See <a

      was the view of the twelfth-century Jewish scholar and
      physician Maimonides. See Moses Maimonides, <a
      href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">Guide for the
      Perplexed</a> 594 (1963) (referring to "the issue of semen"
      as "disgusting" and "unclean"). According to Maimonides,
      circumcision would reduce the sexual urge (and assumedly the
      production of semen) Id. at 609.<br />

      Analysis of Circumcision Among Two West Central African
      Tribes, 13 African Social Res. 187, 192 (1972) (uncircumcised
      boy referred to as <i>wunabulakatooka</i>, "one who lacks
      whiteness or purity.").<br />

      Philo, the Jewish Platonist of the first century of the
      Common Era, held this view, observing that circumcision
      contributed to the "excision of the pleasures which delude
      the mind; for since of all the delights which pleasure can
      afford, the association of man with woman is the most
      exquisite, it seemed good to the lawgivers to mutiliate the
      organ which he ministers to such connections; by which rite
      they signified figuratively the excision of all superfluous
      and excessive pleasure, not indeed, of one only, but of all
      others whatever, through that one which is the most imperious
      of all." Philo, De Specialibus Legibus 1.9, in The Works of
      Philo 534 (C.D. Yonge, trans.,1993). See also John M. G.
      Barclay, Paul and Philo on Circumcision: Romans 2.25-9 in
      Social and Cultural Context, 44 New Testament Studies, 536,
      536-56 (1998) (outlining Philo's treatment of circumcision).
      Maimonides observes that one of its objects is to "bring
      about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the
      organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and
      the organ be in as quiet a state as possible... . Violent
      concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are
      diminished." Maimonides, supra <a href="#n115">note 115</a>,

      Among the Komo of the Congo, for example, the term for the

      of the infant Jesus could, it was said, render barren women
      fertile and ensure a healthy delivery to boot. Henry V,
      victor at the famous battle of Agincourt, commandeered the
      object from one abbey to promote the birth of an heir to the
      throne of England and France, apparently causing considerable
      consternation among the monks because of fears that the
      precious piece of flesh would not be returned. All worked out
      for the best, however. The relic proved efficacious at
      producing an heir, and a grateful Henry not only returned the
      object but also built a shrine. See Remondino, supra <a
      href="#n74">note 74</a>, at 71. Other claimants to the title
      of the holy prepuce had an equally exciting history. The
      prepuce given by Charlemagne to the Abbey of Charroux in 783
      disappeared during the period of Huguenot control in the
      sixteenth century, but turned up in a abbey wall
      approximately 300 years later. It was entrusted to the
      Ursuline Sisters, who were apparently deemed more responsible
      caretakers than the Huguenots. See id. at 72.<br />

      Based on a study in Los Angeles, Dunn and Buell estimated

      Non-western cultures that practice circumcision also use
      concepts of purity and pollution to emphasize the value of
      genital cutting. Among the Ndembu of northwestern Zambia, for
      example, the glans of an uncircumcised boy is regarded as
      "wet and filthy." See Turner, supra <a href="#n8">note 8</a>,
      at 17. On the other hand, the circumcised penis is seen as
      "dry" and hence highly auspicious and desirable. Id.<br />

      Kistler, a Los Angeles physician, observed in 1910 that
      notwithstanding the simplicity of the procedure, circumcision
      were "bunglingly done in many instances." "Many a surgeon,"
      he said, "has lost his best clients, and likewise many a good
      prospect has gone glimmering because of the unfortunate
      outcome of this little operation." S.L. Kistler, Rapid
      Bloodless Circumcision, 54 JAMA 1782, 1782-83 (1910).<br />

      Lewis Sayre had his failures. He circumcised dozens of boys
      at a New York idiot's asylum, hoping that the operation would
      cure their dementia, but no patient recovered enough to be
      discharged. See Gollaher, supra <a href="#n19">note 19</a>,

      Orificial surgeon C.B. Walls highlighted this concern in an
      article published in 1896-97. See generally C.B. Walls,
      Circumcision: Is it a Fad?, 5 J. Orificial Surgery 504
      (1896-97). Walls warned that if circumcision is deferred
      until a boy was in school, he was likely to encounter "evil
      influences, which he may not overcome during the remainder of
      his life, for, in the majority of cases, it is during the
      school period that the masturbation habit is acquired." Id.
      at 510. Circumcision performed after the habit was acquired
      could mitigate the effects of the disease, but might not cure
      the habit. Id. at 511. Thus, Walls concluded, it was
      preferable for the operation to be performed on a young
      child, "because of the benefits derived&mdash;the various
      conditions and diseases which it avoids to those who have the
      matter attended to early." Id. at 509-10.<br />

      Circumcision tends to follow class, ethnic, and national
      lines. In Britain, Gairdner observed in 1949 that
      circumcision was much more common among boys of the upper
      classes than among lower class boys. Douglas Gairdner, <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">The Fate of the Foreskin: A
      Study of Circumcision</a>, 2 Brit. Med. J. 1433, 1433-37
      (1949) (citing one study of boys entering university which
      found that 84 percent of students coming from the "best-known
      public schools" were circumcised, whereas only 50 percent of
      students coming from grammar or secondary schools were
      circumcised). In the United States, circumcision appears to
      be more prevalent in higher socio-economic groups. For
      example, Laumann et al.'s study found a strong positive
      correlation between circumcision and mother's educational
      level. Edward O. Laumann, et al., <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/">Circumcision in the United
      States: Prevalence, Prophylactic Effects, and Sexual
      Practice</a>, 277 JAMA 1052, 1054 (1997). The demographics of
      circumcision have not been fully studied. Indeed, in a 1997
      survey article, Laumann et al. concluded that "beyond limited
      records on historical circumcision rates, very little is
      known regarding how the practice is distributed across
      various groups and strata of Americans." Id. at 1052. Some
      information is available, however. In the United States, it
      is European Americans who are most likely to be circumcised.
      The circumcision rate for African Americans is only half the
      rate for whites, and the rate for Hispanics is only one-third
      the European American rate. Id. at 1053. For similar findings
      on lower circumcision rates for non-European Americans, see

      St. J. Med. 243, 244 (1990) (lower rates among Hispanic and
      Asian population). There is also a significant disparity
      across the country, with Western states showing low
      circumcision rates (around 36 percent) compared with the rest
      of the country. See Ian Ith, A Sensitive Decision: Parents

      Leitch estimated in 1970 that 69-97% of all boys and men in
      the United States had been circumcised, compared with 70% in
      Victoria, Australia, 48% in Kingston General Hospital,
      Canada, and 24% in the UK. See I. O. W. Leitch, <a

      <a id="n220"

      role. See Alain Bottero, Consumption by Semen Loss in India

      "Orificial surgeons" specialized on surgery on the prepuce,
      clitoris and rectum, and which published its own professional
      journal from 1890 to 1925. Members of this school
      enthusiastically recommended circumcision both for girls and
      for boys. See Alex Comfort, The Anxiety Makers: Some Curious
      Preoccupations of the Medical Profession 104, (1967) ("Though

      only is masturbation now considered a natural activity rather
      than a disease, but the effect of circumcision on
      masturbation appears to be opposite to what the nineteenth
      century writers believed: men who are circumcised are more,
      not less, likely to masturbate than men who are not
      circumcised. See Laumann et al., supra <a href="#n214">note
      214</a>, at 1055. (stating that 47 percent of the circumcised
      respondents reported masturbating at least once a month, as
      compared with 34 percent of their uncircumcised peers).<br />
      <a id="n377"
      name="n377"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;377.
      Circumcised men actually engage in more elaborate sexual
      practices than uncircumcised men. See id. They are more
      likely than uncircumcised men to engage in high-risk sexual
      behaviors such as anal intercourse and active or passive
      homosexual oral sex. See P.M. Fleiss, et al., <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">Immunological Functions
      of the Human Prepuce</a>, 74 Sexually Transmitted Infections
      364, 365 (1998) hereinafter "Immunological Functions"].
      Laumann et al. also found a small, but significant, negative
      correlation between circumcision and sexual dysfunction,
      especially in older men. Laumann et al., supra <a
      href="#n214">note 214</a>, at 1054.<br />

      Circumcision, <i>in</i> Sexual Mutilations: A Human Tragedy
      85, 97 (George C. Denniston and Marilyn Fayre Milos, eds.,
      1997). The theory that smegma is carcinogenic also led to the
      belief that circumcision prevented cancer of the cervix in
      the partner of a circumcised man. Id. Again, the evidence for
      this was largely drawn from the low incidence of cervical
      cancer in Jewish women. See &Oslash;ster, supra <a
      href="#n220">note 220</a>, at 200. This theory has been
      discredited. See Milton Terris et al., Relation of
      Circumcision to Cancer of the Cervix, 117 Am. J. Obstetrics
      &amp; Gynecology 1056, 1056-66 (1973).<br />

      <a id="n381"
      name="n381"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;381. This
      was one of the most frequent diagnoses indicating the need
      for circumcision. For example, a study of 140 infants
      circumcised in a British hospital in 1983 found that
      "congenital phimosis" was the reason for circumcision in 74
      cases and "secondary phimosis" was the reason in 38 cases. D.

      (skin layer) between prepuce and glans separates gradually
      and spontaneously during the course of childhood, resulting
      in complete separation in nearly all boys by age 17 if left
      undisturbed. See &Oslash;ster, supra <a href="#n220">note

      Balanitis is defined as "an inflammation of the skin covering
      the glans penis." Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 193
      (18th ed. 1997). Although often thought to occur only in
      uncircumcised boys, Van Howe's study found that in children
      under three years old balanitis was more prevalent in
      circumcised boys. Van Howe, supra <a href="#n344">note
      344</a>, at 776. Balanitis is a minor infection, easily
      treated with improved hygiene or topical medication, and is
      fairly uncommon (it occurs in up to 4% of uncircumcised
      boys). Rowena Hitchcock, <a

      Wiswell, Smith and Bass examined a cohort of 5,261 infants
      and found a higher incidence of urinary tract infections
      among uncircumcised males (4.12%) than among circumcised
      males (0.21%). See Thomas E. Wiswell et al., Decreased
      Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections in Circumcised Male
      Infants, 75Pediatrics 901, 902 (1985). A later study by
      Wiswell and colleagues examined records of over 200,000 boys
      born at U.S. armed forces hospitals between 1975 and 1979,
      and found that uncircumcised boys experienced urinary tract
      infections at a ten-fold higher rate than circumcised boys
      (1.03% compared with 0.10%). Thomas E. Wiswell et al.,

      Circumcision is more common in wealthier families, which
      presumably have better access to health care, proper
      nutrition, and other benefits that increase health in
      general. Moreover, the incidence of urinary tract infections
      in uncircumcised boys may reflect the colonization of
      hospital wards by bacteria of non-maternal origin, to which
      the newborn has no immunity&mdash;a function of hospital
      conditions that could be controlled by other means, such as
      rooming-in of mother and baby. See Jan Winberg et al., <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/winberg-bollgren/">The Prepuce: A
      Mistake of Nature?</a>, The Lancet 598, 598-99 (1989). In
      another study indicating the importance of sociological
      considerations, Goldman and colleagues found a high incidence
      of urinary tract infections in Israeli children undergoing
      ritual circumcision; they demonstrate that urinary tract
      infections are common at least in one cohort of circumcised
      boys. See Michael Goldman et al., <a

      name="n394"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;394. The
      influence of other variables is suggested by the fact that
      the incidence of carcinoma of the penis in the U.S., where
      most men are circumcised, is actually higher than in
      countries such as Denmark and Japan, where circumcisions are
      rare. See Morten Frisch et al., <a

      David Grimes, a circumcision opponent, puts it, "The
      application of crushing clamps and excision of penile tissue
      ... probably do little to engender a trusting, congenial
      relationship with the infant's new surroundings." Grimes,
      supra <a href="#n271">note 271</a>, at 127-28. Circumcision
      seems well calculated to evoke castration anxiety in the
      infant. As G. Cansever puts it, "Circumcision is perceived by
      the child as an aggressive attack upon his body, which
      damaged, mutilated, and, in some cases, totally destroyed
      him. The feeling of "I am now castrated' seems to prevail in
      the psychic world of the child. As a result he feels
      inadequate, helpless, and functions less efficiently." Gocke
      Cansever, <a href="/library/psych/cansever/">Psychological
      Effects of Circumcision</a>, 38 Brit. J. Med. Psychol. 321,
      328 (1965). David M. Levy, in a study of a somewhat older
      child, observed that "immediately after the anesthesia wore
      off, he said over and over, "They cut my penis. I wish I were
      dead.' The rest of the day the patient never left his
      mother's side. Thereafter his previous temper tantrums
      developed into destructive rages. During the treatment he
      played numerous killing games, in which his father was the
      principal victim. The operation represented a castration by
      his father." David M. Levy, Psychic Trauma of Operations in
      Children, 69 Am. J. of Diseases of Children 7, 10

      Cansever's study of twelve Turkish boys who were circumcised
      between ages 4 and 7 found a significant reduction in IQ
      scores, as measured by the Goodenough Draw-a-man Test, after
      the procedure. Cansever, supra <a href="#n402">note 402</a>
      at 321-322. Cansever also found that the Draw-a-man Test
      signaled that after circumcision, a child's body image
      appeared to shrink in consequence of a feeling of having been
      "cut." Id. Overall, Cansever found that "following
      circumcision, the ego weakens under the impact of the
      experience, is unable to cope efficiently and adaptively with
      the trauma and the instinctual drives, as well as the
      anxieties initiated." Id. at 328.<br />

      Circumcision is a fairly bloody procedure, because the
      prepuce must be separated from the glans and then excised.
      Patel's study found slight to moderate bleeding in 35% of the
      cases studied. See Patel, supra <a href="#n251">note 251</a>,
      at 577 tbl. 11. The rate of hemorrhage is difficult to
      determine precisely because it depends on the diagnostic
      criteria employed. See Williams &amp; Kapila, supra <a
      href="#n343">note 343</a>, at 1231. Studies report that
      circumcision results in hemorrhage complication in up to 2
      percent of the time. John Denton et al., Circumcision
      Complication: Reaction to Treatment of Local Hemorrhage with
      Topical Epinephrine in High Concentration, 17 Clinical
      Pediatrics 285, 285 (1978). In addition, hemorrhaging
      occasionally requires hospitalization, see Metcalf et al.,
      supra <a href="#n214">note 214</a>, at 577, and the use of
      electrosurgical diathermy for coagulating vessels can cause
      accidents, including, in a few cases, complete ablation of
      the penis. Williams &amp; Kapila, supra <a href="#n343">note

      fair number of cases, eight percent in Metcalf's sample, the
      foreskin left from circumcision adheres to the glans,
      resulting in the accumulation of smegma under the adhesion.
      Metcalf et al., supra <a href="#n214">note 214</a>, at
      578.<br />
      <a id="n406"
      name="n406"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;406. Skin
      bridges occur when the left over foreskin fuses with the
      glans. See George T. Klauber &amp; James Boyle, Preputial
      Skin-Bridging: omplication of Circumcision, 3 Urology 722,
      722-23 (1974). These typically need to be lysed by a
      pediatrician in a corrective procedure. Van Howe's study
      found that 25.6 percent of the circumcised boys under three
      years old experienced adhesions and 4.1 percent had a skin
      bridge. See Van Howe, supra <a href="#n344">note 344</a>, at

      <a id="n407"

      too much skin is removed during circumcision, there may not
      be enough left after puberty to cover the penis during an
      erection without tearing the skin. See John Money &amp;

      thought to result from damage to the urethral wall, either as
      a result of an improperly placed suture or because of
      improper operation of the Plastibell device or the Gomco
      clamp. See Williams &amp; Kapila, supra <a href="#n343">note

      as a result of inadvertent injury to the penis. See Rudolph

      renal impairment . See Julian D. Eason et al., <a
      href="/library/complications/eason/" target="_blank">Male
      Ritual Circumcision Resulting in Acute Renal Failure</a>, 309

      and Hyponatraemia, 154 European J. Pediatrics 314, 314-15
      (1995). This can result from an over-tight dressing being
      applied to the glans after circumcision, and appears to
      happen most frequently in Jewish ritual circumcisions, in
      which the mohel applies a tight dressing to the wound. See,
      e.g., J.C. Craig et al., Acute Obstructive Uropathy: A Rare
      Complication of Circumcision, 153 European J. Pediatrics 369,
      369-71 (1994). In one case, a botched circumcision blocked
      the urinary tract at the meatus and diverted the urinary
      stream into the child's pelvis. See Randall G. Fisher,
      Plastibell Circumcision: A Novel Complication, 133 J.
      Pediatrics 468, 468 (1998).<br />

      After circumcision, the exposed glans of the penis may be
      irritated by the ammonia of wet diapers, leading to
      ulceration. In one survey of 100 male infants who underwent
      circumcision at Kingston General Hospital in Ontario, 31
      percent of neonates suffered meatal ulceration after
      circumcision. Patel, supra <a href="#n251">note 251</a>, at
      577. Most cases were mild, but one case caused severe
      discomfort. Id.<br />
      <a id="n414"
      name="n414"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;414.
      Meatal stenosis is a blockage of the meatus, or tip of the
      urethra with the resulting impairment of urinary flow. See R.
      Persad et al., <a
      href="/library/complications/persad/">Clinical Presentation
      and Pathophysiology of Meatal Stenosis Following
      Circumcision</a>, 75 Brit. J. Urology 91, 91-93 (1995).
      Meatal stenosis occurs nearly entirely in circumcised boys,
      and may require surgical revision. Id. Patel's survey found
      meatal stenosis in 8% of the subjects, often in association
      with meatal ulceration. Patel, supra <a href="#n251">note
      251</a>, at 577.<br />
      <a id="n415"
      name="n415"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;415. Like
      other operations, circumcisions result in infections.
      Different infection rates have been reported; a recent survey
      concluded that some type of infection occurs in about ten
      percent of the cases. See Williams &amp; Kapila, supra <a
      href="#n343">note 343</a>, at 1233. Most infections following
      circumcision are mild and only one case in Patel's study of
      100 infants required antibiotic treatment. See Patel, supra
      <a href="#n251">note 251</a>, at 577. At least one study
      suggests that cirucumcision may increase risk of staph
      infection in newborn boys. See Robert W. Enzenauer et al., <a

      such case received widespread publicity in 1997. See, e.g., A
      Tragedy Yields Insight into Gender, Newsweek, Mar. 24, 1997,
      at 66. During a circumcision at eight months of age performed
      in the late 1960s, a surgeon accidentally cut off most of a
      boy's penis. Id. The boy's parents were persuaded by an
      eminent sex researcher, John Money, to have him surgically
      converted into a "girl" by means of the creation of a vagina
      from his remaining penile tissue and hormone therapy. By the
      time he reached age 12, he had reportedly accepted his life
      as a woman&mdash;a result that was widely viewed as
      confirming the view of gender as socially rather than
      biologically constructed. In 1997, however, a report in the
      Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine described how
      "Joan" never did adjust to life as a girl, and at age 14
      decided to switch back to being a boy, which was successfully
      accomplished by means of male hormone injections, mastectomy,
      and phalloplasty. Milton Diamond &amp; H. Keith Sigmundson,

      actual incidence of life-threatening complications is
      difficult to assess because, when a child dies or becomes
      gravely ill as a complication of circumcision, the matter is
      likely to be settled quickly out of court by the doctor's or
      hospital's insurance carrier. Reports of life-threatening
      complications do appear from time to time, however. See,
      e.g., Circumcision Fix Leads To Tot's Death, Oct. 21, 1998,
      at B03; Houston Anesthesiologist Resigns After Boy's Death,
      11 Lawsuits, Austin American-Statesman, Aug. 20, 1995, at B5;

      circumcision and was eventually left with profound mental
      retardation as well as cerebral palsy and blindness); Baby
      Bled to Death After Circumcision, Orlando Sentinel, June 26,
      1993, at B4. In 1998, a 3-week old boy experienced a blockage
      in his urethra from a circumcision; when he went back into
      surgery to repair the problem, he had an allergic reaction to
      the anesthetic and died in hospital. See James F. McCarty,
      Coroner Calls Anesthesia Death Unpreventable, Cleveland Plain
      Dealer, Nov. 19, 1998, at 1B. The risk of death from
      circumcision is very small, however. See Harold Speert,
      Circumcision of the Newborn: An Appraisal of its Present
      Status, 2 Obstetr Gynecol 164, 170-71 (1953).<br />

      e.g., Immunological Functions, supra <a href="#n377">note
      377</a>, at 364. The thesis that the prepuce offers
      immunological protection is supported by studies showing that
      during infancy circumcised children are more prone to penile
      infections than uncircumcised children. See D.M. Fergusson et
      al., <a href="">Circumcision and Penile Problems: An 8-Year
      Longitudinal Study</a>, 81 Pediatrics 537, 537-541 (1988);

      An immunological role for the prepuce is also suggested by
      evidence that uncircumcised men appear to have a lower rate
      of some sexually transmitted diseased than their circumcised
      peers. See Immunological Functions, supra <a

      similar to that of the skin of the penis as a whole. See J.P.
      Taylor et al., supra <a href="#n434">note 434</a>. In this
      respect, the prepuce contrasts with the glans, which in fact
      is insensitive to light, touch, heat, cold, and pinprick, and
      which is one of the few areas of the body which enjoys
      nothing beyond primitive sensory modalities such as deep
      pressure or pain. Id.; Immunological Functions, supra <a

      Until recently, most doctors believed that the newborn was
      not capable of feeling pain because of the immaturity of its
      nervous system. See K.J.S. Anand &amp; P.R. Hickey, <a
      href="/library/pain/anand/">Pain and its Effects in the Human
      Neonate and Fetus</a>, 317 New Eng. J. Med. 1321, 1321-29
      (1987). Moreover, because infants may not be able to remember
      painful experiences, they were not thought capable of
      interpreting pain in a manner similar to adults. See id.
      Infants were also thought to have a high pain threshold
      because this would protect them from the pain of childbirth.
      See id.<br />
      <a id="n484"
      name="n484"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;484.
      Numerous studies have documented that newborns do feel pain,
      and have shown, in particular, that circumcision causes
      intense pain to the neonate. See, e.g., Janice Lander et al.,
      <a href="/library/pain/lander/">Comparison of Ring Block,
      Dorsal Penile Nerve Block, and Topical Anesthesia for
      Neonatal Circumcision: A Randomized Controlled Trial</a>, 278
      JAMA, 2157 (1997) ("without exception, newborns in this study
      who did not receive an anesthetic suffered great distress
      during and following the circumcision, and ... were exposed
      to unnecessary risk"); Fran Lang Porter et al., <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/4/626"
       target="_blank">Pain and Pain Management in Newborn Infants:
      a Survey of Physicians and Nurses</a>, 100 Pediatrics 626
      (1997); John W. Scanlon, Appreciating Neonatal Pain, 38
      Advances in Pediatrics 317-33 (1991). The presence of pain
      during circumcision is inferred from physiological changes,
      such as increases in heart rate and blood pressure, or
      changes in crying behavior. See Paul S. Williamson &amp;
      Marvel L. Williamson, <a
      href="/library/pain/williamson/">Physiologic Stress Reduction
      by a Local Anesthetic During Newborn Circumcision</a>, 71
      Pediatrics 36, 36-40 (1983); Richard. L. Holve et al.,

      Infant Pain Response, 22 Clinical Pediatrics 813, 813-18
      (1983); Fran Lang Porter et al., 57 Child Dev. 790, 790-802
      (1986). Both serum cortisal and cortisone levels rise after
      circumcision, see Luther M. Talbert, <a
      href="/library/pain/talbert/">Adrenal Cortical Response to
      Circumcision in the Neonate</a>, 48 Obstetrics &amp;
      Gynecology 208, 208-10 (1976), while transcutaneous oxygen
      tension falls dramatically, see David J. Rawlings et al., <a
      href="/library/pain/rawlings1/">The Effect of Circumcision
      Upon Transcutaneous P02 in Term Infants</a>, 134 Am. J.Dis.
      of Childhood 676, 676-78 (1980). Local anesthesia prevents or
      reduces the physiological changes associated with pain in
      circumcision. See Newborn Circumcision, 71 Pediatrics 36-40
      (1983); In one recent study, the investigators terminated the
      research because they believed it was unethical to continue
      to subject test subjects to the pain of circumcision without
      anesthesia. Janice Lander et al., supra at 157-62
      (1997).<br />
      <a id="n485"
      name="n485"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;485. Pain
      from circumcision is not just a temporary or fleeting
      phenomenon. Rather, it seems to affect a newborn's pain
      response over a substantial period. See Suzanne Dixon et al.,
      Behavioral Effects of Circumcision With and Without
      Anesthesia, 5 J. Dev. Behavioral Pediatrics 246, 246-50
      (1984). A double blind study using the Brazelton Neonatal
      Behavioral Assessment Scale found that 90 percent of
      circumcised neonates had changed behavioral states for more
      than 22 hours after the procedure, as compared with only 16
      percent of uncircumcised infants. See Richard E. Marshall et
      al., <a href="/library/birth/marshall1/">Circumcision I:
      Effects upon Newborn Behavior</a>, 3 Infant Behavior &amp;
      Dev. 1, 1-14 (1980). Anna Taddio and her colleagues studied
      the effect of circumcision on pain response of infants during
      subsequent routine vaccination, finding that circumcised boys
      had significantly longer crying bouts and higher pain scores"
      during routine vaccinations at four to six months. Anna
      Taddio et al., <a href="/library/pain/taddio2/">Effect of
      Neonatal Circumcision on Pain Response During Subsequent
      Routine Vaccination</a>, 349 The Lancet 599, 599-603 (1997).
      Their research suggests that neonatal circumcision has
      long-range psychological effects similar in some respects to
      post-traumatic stress disorder. See Robert S. Van Howe,
      Neonatal Circumcision, 349 The Lancet 1257, 1257 (1997).
      Circumcision may also affect other behavioral patterns in the
      newborn. For example, after circumcision infants feed less
      frequently and are less available for interactions with their
      mothers. See Richard E. Marshall et al., at 1-14; Suzanne
      Dixon et al., supra at 246-50; Robert N. Emde et al., <a
      href="/library/pain/taddio2/">Stress and Neonatal Sleep</a>,
      33 Psychosomatic Med. 491, 491-97 (1971). The deterioration
      in the ability to breast-feed may contribute to frustration
      in mother-child interactions or to breast-feeding failure.
      See Cynthia R. Howard, <a
      href="/library/pain/howard/">Acetaminophen Analgesia in
      Neonatal Circumcision: The Effect on Pain</a>, 93 Pediatrics
      641, 641-46 (1994).<br />

      the lack of anesthesia in circumcision, see, e.g., Anna

      supra <a href="#n483">note 483</a>, at 1321-29 (1987). While
      the principal reason for dispensing with anesthesia in
      newborn circumcisions appears to be the belief that the
      patients cannot feel pain, considerations of economics and
      convenience may also play a role: dispensing with anesthetics
      saves money, and the physician does not have to wait to
      perform the operation until the anesthetic has taken hold.
      See E.O. Horger, Local Anesthesia for Infants Undergoing
      Circumcision (Letter), 279 JAMA 1169, 1169 (1998)(physicians
      resist giving anesthesia for circumcision because of a belief
      that it slows down the procedure). The leading anesthetics
      for circumcision are a topical anesthetic cream and types of
      penile nerve block. See, e.g., Meggan Butler-O'Hara et al.,
      <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/4/e5"
       target="_blank">Analgesia for Neonatal Circumcision: A
      Randomized Controlled Trial of EMLA Cream Versus Dorsal
      Penile Nerve Block</a>, 101 Pediatrics E5 (1998) (abstract);
      Janice Lander et al., <a
      href="/library/pain/lander/">Comparison of Ring Block, Dorsal
      Penile Nerve Block, and Topical Anesthesia for Neonatal
      Circumcision: A Randomized Controlled Trial</a>, 278 JAMA
      2157, 2157-62 (1997). Even the use of analgesia, however,
      would not prevent newborns from experiencing pain from
      circumcision. Anesthetics reduce, but probably do not
      eliminate, pain from the procedure. See Paul M. Fleiss,
      Circumcision, 345 The Lancet 927, 927 (1995). Moreover, the
      effects of the recommended anesthetics are short-term; while
      they may blunt the pain of the separation of the prepuce from
      the glans and the severing of the prepuce from the penis,
      they have no efficacy against the pain the infant experiences
      during the healing of the wound, especially if the area is
      abraded by contact with diapers after the surgery. See John
      Warren, Circumcision, 345 The Lancet 927, 927 (1995). In
      1999, recognizing the impact of these studies, the American
      Association of Pediatrics recommended that all circumcisions
      be performed with anesthesia. See American Academy of
      Pediatrics, Task Force on Circumcision, <a
