      European Convention on Human Rights and/or the UN Convention
      on the Rights of the Child&mdash;must provide effective
      deterrents to ensure that the rights of children under
      Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to
      freedom from torture, inhumane, or degrading treatment are
      not violated by private individuals. This is believed to be
      relevant to the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of

    <p class="justify"><br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">PROCEDURE</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The case was referred to the Court by
    the European Commission of Human Rights (&ldquo;the
    Commission&rdquo;) on 27 October 1997, within the three-month
    period laid down by Article 32 &sect; 1 and Article 47 of the
    Convention. It originated in an application (no. 25599/94)
    against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
    Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a
    British national, &ldquo;A.&rdquo;, on 15 July 1994. The
    applicant asked the Court not to reveal his
    identity.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission's request referred to Articles 44
    and 48 and the declaration whereby the United Kingdom
    recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article
    46). The object of the &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
     request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of
    the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its
    obligations under Articles 3, 8, 13 and 14 of the
    Convention.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the enquiry made in
    accordance with Rule 33 &sect; 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the
    applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings
    and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule
    30).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber to be constituted
    included <i>ex officio</i> Sir John Freeland, the elected judge
    of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr
    R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 &sect; 4 (b)).
    On 28&nbsp;November 1997, in the presence of the Registrar, Mr
    Ryssdal drew by lot the names of the other seven members,
    namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Russo, Mrs E. Palm,
    Mr&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Makarczyk, Mr&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Kuris, Mr J.
    Casadevall and Mr V. Toumanov (Article&nbsp;43 <i>in fine</i>
    of the Convention and Rule 21 &sect; 5). Subsequently
    Mr&nbsp;R. Bernhardt, who had been elected President of the
    Court, replaced Mr&nbsp;Ryssdal, who had died (Rule&nbsp;21
    &sect; 6, second sub-paragraph).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;As President of the Chamber at that
    time (Rule 21 &sect; 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the
    Registrar, had consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom
    Government (&ldquo;the Government&rdquo;), the applicant's
    lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation
    of the proceedings (Rules 37 &sect; 1 and 38). Pursuant to the
    order made in consequence, the Registrar received the
    applicant's and the Government's memorials on 27 February and
    4&nbsp;March&nbsp;1998 respectively.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Makarczyk was unable to take part
    in the further consideration of the case and was therefore
    replaced by Mr P. van Dijk, substitute judge (Rules 22 &sect; 1
    and 24 &sect; 1).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the President's
    decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights
    Building, Strasbourg, on 22 June 1998. The Court had held a
    preparatory meeting beforehand.</font>&nbsp;<br />

    I.&nbsp;the CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant is a British citizen,
    born in 1984.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1990 he and his brother were placed on the
    local child protection register because of &ldquo;known
    physical abuse&rdquo;. The cohabitant of the boys' mother was
    given a police caution after he admitted hitting A. with a
    cane. Both boys were removed from the child protection register
    in November&nbsp;1991. The cohabitant subsequently married the
    applicant's mother and became his stepfather.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1993, the head teacher at
    A.'s school reported to the local Social Services Department
    that A.'s brother had disclosed that A. was being hit with a
    stick by his stepfather. The stepfather was arrested on
    5&nbsp;February 1993 and released on bail the next
    day.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5 February 1993 the applicant was
    examined by a consultant paediatrician, who found the following
    marks on his body, <i>inter alia</i>: (1) a fresh red linear
    bruise on the back of the right thigh, consistent with a blow
    from a garden cane, probably within the preceding twenty-four
    hours; (2) a double linear bruise on the back of the left calf,
    consistent with two separate blows given some time before the
    first injury; (3) two lines on the back of the left thigh,
    probably caused by two blows inflicted one or two days
    previously; (4) three linear bruises on the right bottom,
    consistent with three blows, possibly given at different times
    and up to one week old; (5) a fading linear bruise, probably
    several days old.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The paediatrician considered that the bruising was
    consistent with the use of a garden cane applied with
    considerable force on more than one occasion.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
     10.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stepfather was charged with assault
    occasioning actual bodily harm and tried in February 1994. It
    was not disputed by the defence that the stepfather had caned
    the boy on a number of occasions, but it was argued that this
    had been necessary and reasonable since A. was a difficult boy
    who did not respond to parental or school
    discipline.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In summing up, the judge advised the jury on the
    law as follows:</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
    &nbsp;&ldquo;... What is it the prosecution must prove? If a
    man deliberately and unjustifiably hits another and causes some
    bodily injury, bruising or swelling will do, he is guilty of
    actual bodily harm. What does &lsquo;unjustifiably' mean in the
    context of this case? It is a perfectly good defence that the
    alleged assault was merely the correcting of a child by its
    parent, in this case the stepfather, provided that the
    correction be moderate in the manner, the instrument and the
    quantity of it. Or, put another way, reasonable. It is not for
    the defendant to prove it was lawful correction. It is for the
    prosecution to prove it was not.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
    &nbsp;This case is not about whether you should punish a very
    difficult boy. It is about whether what was done here was
    reasonable or not and you must judge that...&rdquo;</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury found by a majority verdict
    that the applicant's stepfather was not guilty of assault
    occasioning actual bodily harm.</font></p>

    harm&rdquo; contrary to section 47 of the Offences against the
    Person Act 1861, as amended. An &ldquo;assault&rdquo;, for the
    purposes of this section, includes an act by which a person
    intentionally or recklessly inflicts personal violence upon
    another. &ldquo;Actual bodily harm&rdquo; includes any hurt or
    injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of
    the victim; the hurt or injury need not be permanent but must
    be more than transitory or trifling. The maximum penalty on
    conviction is five years' imprisonment.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is an offence under
    section 1(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to
    assault or ill-treat a child in a manner likely to cause him
    unnecessary suffering or injury to health. The maximum penalty
    on conviction is ten years' imprisonment.</font></p>

     14.&nbsp;&nbsp;In criminal proceedings for the assault of a
    child, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to satisfy the
    jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>inter alia</i> that the
    assault did not constitute lawful punishment.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Parents or other persons <i>in loco parentis</i>
    are protected by the law if they administer punishment which is
    moderate and reasonable in the circumstances. The concept of
    &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; permits the courts to apply
    standards prevailing in contemporary society with regard to the
    physical punishment of children.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;Corporal punishment of a child by a teacher cannot be
    justified if the punishment is inhuman or degrading. In
    determining whether punishment is inhuman or degrading, regard
    is to be had to &ldquo;all the circumstances of the case,
    including the reason for giving it, how soon after the event it
    is given, its nature, the manner and circumstances in which it
    is given, the persons involved and its mental and physical
    effects&rdquo; (section 47(1)(a) and (b) of the Education (no.
    2) Act 1986, as amended by section 293 of the Education Act
    1993).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical assault is actionable as a
    form of trespass to the person, giving the aggrieved party the
    right to recovery of damages. In civil proceedings for assault,
    whilst the elements of the tort are the same as those of the
    criminal offence, the burden of proof of establishing that
    punishment was reasonable is on the defendant, on the balance

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp;A. applied to the Commission on 15
    July 1994. He complained that the State had failed to protect
    him from ill-treatment by his step-father, in violation of
    Articles 3 and/or 8 of the Convention; that he had been denied
    a remedy for these complaints in violation of Article 13; and
    that the domestic law on assault discriminated against
    children, in violation of Article 14 in conjunction with
    Articles 3 and 8.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission declared the
    application (no. 25599/94) admissible on 9 September 1996. In
    its report of 18 September 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the
    opinion that there had been a violation of Article 3
    (unanimously); that it was not necessary to consider the
    complaint under Article 8 (sixteen votes to one); that there
    had been no violation of Article&nbsp;13 (unanimously) and that
    it was not necessary to consider the &nbsp;<br />

    COURT</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;18.&nbsp;&nbsp;In their memorial and at the
    hearing, the Government accepted the reasoning and the
    conclusion of the Commission that there had been a violation of
    Article 3. However, they asked the Court to confine itself to
    considering the facts of the case without making any general
    statement about the corporal punishment of children.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant asked the Court to find violations of
    Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and to confirm that national
    law should not condone directly or by implication any level of
    deliberate violence to children.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">AS TO THE LAW</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    I.&nbsp;ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE
    CONVENTION</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;19.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant asked the Court to
    find a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, which
    provides:</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
    &nbsp;&ldquo;No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman
    or degrading treatment or punishment.&rdquo;</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Commission and the Government accepted
    that there had been a violation of Article 3. Despite this, the
    Court considers it necessary to examine itself the issues in
    this case (see, for example, the Findlay v. the United Kingdom
    judgment of 25 February 1997, <i>Reports of Judgments and
    Decisions</i> 1997-I, p. 263). As is its usual practice, the
    Court will limit examination to the specific facts of the case
    before it.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court recalls that ill-treatment
    must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within
    the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is
    relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such
    as the nature and context of the treatment, its duration, its
    physical and mental &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
     effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of
    health of the victim (see the Costello-Roberts v. the United
    Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1993, Series A no. 247-C, p. 59,
    &sect; 30).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;21.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court recalls that the
    applicant, who was then nine years old, was found by the
    consultant paediatrician who examined him to have been beaten
    with a garden cane which had been applied with considerable
    force on more than one occasion (see paragraph 9
    above).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Court considers that treatment of this kind
    reaches the level of severity prohibited by Article
    3.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;22.&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains to be determined whether
    the State should be held responsible, under Article 3, for the
    beating of the applicant by his stepfather.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">The Court considers that the
    obligation on the High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of
    the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction
    the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken
    together with Article 3, requires States to take measures
    designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction
    are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment
    or punishment, including such ill-treatment administered by
    private individuals</span> (see, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the
    H.L.R. v. France judgment of 29 April 1997, <i>Reports</i>
    1997-III, p. 758, &sect; 40). <span class="yellow">Children and
    other vulnerable individuals, in particular, are entitled to
    State protection, in the form of effective deterrence, against
    such serious breaches of personal integrity</span> (see, <i>
    mutatis mutandis</i>, the X and Y v. the Netherlands judgment
    of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, pp. 11&ndash;13,
    &sect;&sect; 21&ndash;27; the Stubbings and Others v. the
    United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, <i>Reports</i>
    1996-IV, p. 1505, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;62&ndash;64; and also the
    United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Articles
    19 and 37).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;23.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court recalls that under English
    law it is a defence to a charge of assault on a child that the
    treatment in question amounted to &ldquo;reasonable
    chastisement&rdquo; (see paragraph 14 above). The burden of
    proof is on the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable
    doubt that the assault went beyond the limits of lawful
    punishment. In the present case, despite the fact that the
    applicant had been subjected to treatment of sufficient
    severity to fall within the scope of Article 3, the jury
    acquitted his stepfather, who had administered the treatment
    (see paragraphs 10&ndash;11 above).</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court's view, the law did not
    provide adequate protection to the applicant against treatment
    or punishment contrary to Article 3. Indeed, the Government
    have accepted that this law currently fails to provide adequate
    protection to children and should be amended.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances of the present case, the
    failure to provide adequate protection constitutes a violation
    of Article 3 of the Convention.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">II.&nbsp;ALLEGED
    VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8 of the Convention provides
    as follows:</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
    &nbsp;&ldquo;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has the right to respect
    for his private &hellip; life&hellip;</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
    &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no interference by a public
    authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in
    accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic
    society in the interests of national security, public safety or
    the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of
    disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or
    for the protection of the rights and freedoms of
    others.&rdquo;</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;26.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission concluded that, given
    its finding of a violation of Article 3, it was not necessary
    to consider the issues under Article 8. The Government asked
    the Court also to take this approach.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;27.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his memorial to the Court, the
    applicant submitted that, if the Court were to find a violation
    of Article 3, he would not pursue his complaint under Article
    8. However, at the hearing before the Court, he contended that,
    in the light of the Government's memorial and their proposals
    for legislative change, it was necessary for the Court to rule
    under Article 8 in order to provide guidance to the Government
    and protection for children against all forms of deliberate
    violence.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;28.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court recalls that it has found
    a violation of Article 3 in the present case. In these
    circumstances it is not necessary to examine whether the
    inadequacy of the legal protection provided to A. against the
    ill-treatment that he suffered also breached his right to
    respect for private life under Article 8.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">III.&nbsp;ALLEGED

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;29.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant accepted the
    Commission's finding of no violation of Article 13 of the
    Convention and did not pursue his complaint under
    Article&nbsp;14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with
    Articles 3 and/or 8.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;30.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, it is not
    necessary for the Court to consider these
    complaints.</font></p>

    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">IV.&nbsp;APPLICATION OF
    ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;31.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant claimed just
    satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention, which
    provides:</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
    &nbsp;&ldquo;If the Court finds that a decision or a measure
    taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High
    Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with
    the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the
    internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation
    to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure,
    the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just
    satisfaction to the injured party.&rdquo;</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>A.&nbsp;Non-pecuniary
    damage</b></font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;32.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant sought compensation
    for the grave physical abuse which he had suffered at the hands
    of his stepfather. He pointed out that, because of the
    inadequacy of English law, he had also had to endure the trauma
    of criminal proceedings which resulted in the acquittal of his
    stepfather. At the hearing before the Court, his representative
    suggested that 15,000 pounds sterling (GBP) would be an
    appropriate sum by way of compensation.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;33.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the hearing before the
    Court, the Government had informed the applicant that they
    accepted the Commission's finding of violation of Article 3 and
    undertook to amend domestic law. In addition, they had offered
    the applicant an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of GBP 10,000.
    At the hearing before the Court, however, they submitted that,
    in the light of their undertaking to amend the law, a finding
    of a breach would be adequate just satisfaction.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;34.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court considers that, in the
    circumstances of the case, the applicant should be awarded GBP
    10,000 in respect of compensation for non-pecuniary
    damage.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><br />

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;35.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant claimed legal costs
    and expenses totalling GBP&nbsp;48,450.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;36.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government submitted that, in
    view of their admission of a violation of Article 3 and offer
    of settlement, the applicant should not receive any legal costs
    in respect of the proceedings before the Court. In any event,
    they considered that the hourly rates charged by his
    representatives and the number of hours charged were excessive
    and should be reduced.</font></p>

    <p class="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;37.&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the limited number of
    issues raised by the case and the absence of any detailed
    breakdown of the costs claimed, the Court considers the sum
    requested by the applicant to be excessive (see, for example,
    the Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 September 1997,
    <i>Reports</i> 1997-V, p. 1856, &sect; 66). Making its
    assessment on an equitable basis, it awards GBP 20,000 in
    respect of costs and expenses, less the amounts received by way
    of legal aid from the Council of Europe, but together with any
    value-added tax which may be payable.</font></p>
