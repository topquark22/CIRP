      <h3>A Few Brief Extracts:</h3>

      <p><b>Chapter 6, Section E, subsections 5.30-6.25.</b></p>

      <h3 align="center">Circumcision and Genital Mutilation</h3>

      <p>"The basic right to bodily integrity which everyone
      possesses under the English common law means that any
      unlawful interference in this right amounts to an assault or
      battery, at the very least, and might in appropriate
      circumstances entail the statutory offence of grievous bodily
      harm. The question raised in cases of circumcision, excision
      or infibulation is whether the operation can be justified as
      constituting lawful as opposed to unlawful interference with
      this right."</p>

      <p>"...although the matter is not entirely free from doubt,
      it seems that a parent may equally authorise a
      non-therapeutic operation, provided it is not actively
      against the child's interests. This would appear to have been
      the basis upon which the vast majority of male infants have
      been circumcised in this country with impunity from time
      immemorial.[sic]"</p>

      <p>"It thus appears that, at common law, while the
      circumcision of male infants here is lawful, provided that
      parental consent has been given, no amount of parental
      agreement or support can legitimise the circumcision,
      excision or infibulation of a young girl in this country,
      unless the operation is for therapeutic purposes."</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This text is at least 20 years
      old. Since the time of writing, medical science has developed
      a substantial amount of evidence that circumcision is indeed
      actively against a child's best interest. Moreover, courts
      have developed new limitations on parental rights to consent
      to non-therapeutic procedures. Therefore, Dr. Poulter's
      conditions, under which infant circumcision would be lawful,
      may no longer be satisfied. Moreover, the <a
