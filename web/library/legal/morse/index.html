      <h1 align="center">Ritual Circumcision</h1>

      <p class="init"><font size="6">R</font>itual circumcision
      take place for male Jewish children on the eighth day of
      life, although the procedure may be postponed indefinitely
      for reasons of health. The circumcision is performed by a
      mohel in accordance with Jewish religious requirements.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Hospital Need Not Admit All Mohels<br />
      to Perform Circumcisions</h4>

      <p class="text">In <i>Zlotowitz and Agadath Hamohalim of
      Greater New York, Inc. vs. Jewish Hospital</i> (84 NYS2d 61)
      decided by the Supreme Court of New York in 1948, Aaron
      Zlotowitz was a rabbi qualified to act as a mohel, and the
      corporate plaintiff was a membership corporation composed of
      mohels. The hospital refused to permit Rabbi Zlotowitz to
      perform circumcisions at the hospital, despite the fact that
      Rabbi Zlotowitz and other members of the corporate plaintiff
      were requested by the parents of male children to circumcise
      their children.</p>

      <p class="text">Rabbi Zlotowitz and the corporate plaintiff
      alleged that the hospital by its conduct deprived them and
      the parents of their constitutional rights. They specified
      the rights as follows: (1) The right to freedom of worship;
      the right to pursue freely freely their religious beliefs;
      the right of Jewish parents to designate a mohel of their own
      choosing; the right to perform religious acts and rites
      without interference; (2) The First and Fourteenth Amendments
      to the Constitution of the United States; Article I, section
      3, of the Constitution of the State of New York; and (3) The
      Civil Rights Law, section 40.</p>

      <p class="text">The New York Supreme Court held that the
      constitutional rights sought to be vindicated rested upon
      provisions limiting the powers of government, both federal
      and state. The First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
      Constitution of the United States, insofar as they relate to
      religion, proscribe governmental action, according to the
      court. The same is true, the court ruled, as to the relevant
      provisions of Article I of the Constitution of the State of
      New York. The court declared, "The said provisions of the
      constitutions have no application to 'private conduct' of the
      kind and character here involved."</p>

      <p class="text">Acknowledging the necessity for predicating
      their claim on an act of omission or commission by the
      government, federal or state, Rabbi Zlotowitz and the
      corporate plaintiff asserted that the hospital was a
      government agency "insofar as the performance of ritual
      circumcision in its premises is concerned." The court
      stated:</p>

      <p class="text"><small>It may be that in certain respects the
      defendant performs government functions, particularly in
      respect of free patients. In all other respects, however, the
      defendant is a private corporation. . . . As a private
      corporation, the defendant is not within the ambit of the
      constitutional provisions relied on. In not aspect of the
      case is the defendant the agency of the State of New York in
      respect of religious matters.</small></p>

      <p>The court concluded:</p>

      <p class="text"><small>Section 40 of the Civil Rights Law
      does not support this action because the plaintiffs have not
      been denied admission to the defendant's hospital on account
      of "race, creed or color." It is clear that the defendant
      does permit circumcision, in accordance with the Jewish faith
      to be performed on the premises.</small></p>

      <p class="text">On appeal, the decision was affirmed in 1950
      by the Court of Appeals of New York (100 NYS2d 226).</p>

      <h4 align="center">Do Parents have Legally Protected
      Interest?</h4>

      <p class="text">In <i>Kalina vs General Hospital of the City
      of Syracuse and Akyuz</i> (220 NYS2d 733) decided in 1961 by
      the Supreme Court of New York, a son was born to the
      plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Kalina, in the defendant
      hospital. At the time of birth the parents gave notice to the
      hospital that the baby was to ritually circumcised on his
      eight day by a mohel. Instead, the son was unceremoniously
      circumcised on the fourth day by a physician, the defendat
      Haluk Engin Akyuz. MD. The parents sued "to recover damages
      for violation of the plaintiffs' relgious beliefs and rights"
      and "for mental pain and suffering sustained as a result of
      an assault and battery upon the plaintiffs' son."</p>

      <p class="text">The New York Supreme Court held that the
      pleadings were insufficient because the plaintiffs, apart
      from their status as representatives of their son, did not
      have a legally protected interest under these circumstances.
      According to the court, the conduct of the hospital and Dr.
      Akyuz, if a wrong in relation to the son, was not a wrong in
      relation to the plaintiffs who were remote from the event.
      The court observed:</p>

      <p class="text"><small>Rights are not abstractions but exist
      only correlatively with duties. Everyone who has been damaged
      by an interruption in the expected tenor of his life does not
      have a cause of action. The law demands that the equation be
      balanced; that the damaged plaintiff be able to point the
      finger of responsibility at a defendant owing not a general
      duty to society, but a specific duty to him.</small></p>

      <p>The court declared:</p>

      <p class="text"><small>The defendants here in accepting a
      relationship with the son assumed the risk of liability for a
      tortious performance to him. They did not assume any
      liability that their acts might violate the personal
      sensibilities of others, be they the son's parents, his
      coreligionists or the community at large.</small></p>

      <p class="text">In referring to the plaintiffs' quest to
      obtain damages "for the plaintiffs' mental pain and suffering
      resulting from the assault on their son," the court stated,
      "Such damages are recoverable only by him who is assaulted."
      The parents' rights in a suit for injuries to the child are
      restricted to a suit for the loss of the child's services and
      for medica attendance and expenses. Mental suffering caused
      by the child's illness is not recoverable. The rule (in New
      York, going back to 1896) that their can be no recovery for
      injuries caused by fright was expressly overruled in New York
      in 1961. The court deemed it the intention behind the change
      to "realistically enlarge the damage claim of one <i>acted
      against</i>. It did not intend to provide a cause for action
      for interested bystanders hitherto excluded [italics
      added].</p>

      <p class="text">The parents also argued that the hospital and
      Dr. Akyuz had duties imposed on them by the Civil Rights Law
      and by Article I, section 3 of the Constitution of the State
      of New York. The court concluded that this argument was
      "without merit" saying: "There is no section of the Civil
      Rights law germane to this issue. The Constitution expreses
      limitations on the power of the state and is not applicable
      here." (A similar argument was advanced by the plaintiffs and
      rejected by the court in the <i>Zlotowitz</i> case.)</p>

      <h4 align="center">Is Circumcision by a Mohel Practicing
      Medicine?</h4>

      <p class="text">The practice of medicine is defined by
      statute in New York, for example, as follows:</p>

      <p class="text"><small><i>A person practices medicine within
      the meaning of this article, except as hereinafter stated,
      who holds himself out as being able to</i> diagnose, treat,
      <i>operate</i> or prescribe <i>for any</i> human disease,
      pain, injury, deformity or <i>physical condition, and who
      shall either offer or undertake, by any means or method
      to</i> diagnose, treat, <i>operate</i> or prescribe <i>for
      any</i> human disease, pain injury deformity or <i>physical
      condition</i> (NY Education Law, sec 6501).</small></p>

      <p class="text">However, a cognate New York statute provides,
      "This article shall not be construed to affect or prevent the
      following: . . .The practice of religious tenets of any
      church" (NY Education Law, sec 6512).</p>

      <p class="text">In a case involving the foregoing exception
      and not concerning but broad enough to cover, the situation
      whereby a ritual circumcision is performed by a mohel,
      <i>People vs Cole</i> (113 NE 790, 794, 795 [1916]), the
      Court of Appeals of the State of New York said, "The
      religious tenets of a church must be practices in good faith
      to come within the exception." Obviously, no one will doubt
      that mohels in performing ritual circumcisions are practicing
      their religious tenets in good faith. The court
      continued:</p>

      <p class="text"><small>When a person claims to be practicing
      the religious tenets of a church, particularly where
      compensation is taken therefor and the practice is apart from
      a church edifice or the sanctity of the home of the applicant
      [in the case of the Mohel the place where the circumcision is
      usually performed is usually the hospital]. the question of
      whether such person is within the exception should be left to
      a jury as a question of fact.</small></p>

      <p class="text">However, it would not be a question of fact
      in the case of the mohel, as compensation as such is not
      taken for ritual circumcision. The foregoing language of the
      New York Court of Appeals was referred to with approval by
      the New York Attorney General in two informal statements
      issued by that state official (NY Op Atty Gen, 1934, 51 St
      Dept 119, 129).</p>

      <p class="text">In <i>People vs. Vogelgesang</i> (116 NE 977,
      978, [1917]), Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, speaking for the
      Court of Appeals of New York, in referring to this exception,
      said, "The tenets to which it accords freedom, alike of
      practice and of profession, are not merely the tenets, but
      the religious tenets, of a church." It is obvious that ritual
      circumcision represents a religious tenet of the Jewish
      faith. In <i>People vs Wendel</i> (68 NYS2d 267, 270) the
      Kings County (New York) Court said in 1946, reiterated:</p>

      <p class="text"><small>The religious tenets of a church must
      be practiced in good faith to come within the exception; that
      is, the tenets of a church are the beliefs, the doctrines and
      the creeds of the church. A person should not be allowed to
      assume to practice the tenets of any church as a shield to
      cover a business undertaking.</small></p>

      <p class="text">It is equally obvious that mohels do not
      perform ritual circumcisions "as a shield to cover a business
      undertaking." The <i>Wendel</i> decision was affirmed on
      appeal the following year by the Appellate Division of the
      Supreme Court of New York (75 NYS2d 302).
