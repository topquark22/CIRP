<H2 ALIGN= CENTER>Circumcised Boys May Sue</H2><P>

   Circumcision may violate baby boys's human rights and circumcised boys
may be able to sue doctors and parents for their circumcision.<P>

   Neville Turner, Professor of Law at Melbourne's Monash University and
president of Oz Child, is calling for Australia-wide legislation banning
circumcision.<P>

   "Doctors and nurses who perform circumcision on infants relying on the
consent of parents are taking a grave risk," he warns.<P>

   "For if it is ultimately declared to be a void consent, them it will
have constituted an assault, and they could be civilly and criminally
liable."<P>

   Professor Turner explains circumcision is contrary to article 24(3) of
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which maintains
"States parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a
view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of
children."<P>

   The procedure is unnecessary, painful, dangerous and barbarous,"
Professor Turner says.<P>

   "How can people perform this on little children who are screaming?"<P>

   The ethical consequences of male circumcision are highlighted in a
<A HREF="/library/general/warren1/">letter</A> in the latest edition of the British Medical Journal from 20
circumcised men claiming circumcision harmed them and it violates their
human rights.<P>

   The men write "the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
states that children have rights to self determination, dignity, respect,
integrity and non-interference and the right to make informed personal
decisions."<P>

   "Unnecessary circumcision violates these rights."<P>

   The men also cite the European charter for children in hospital which
states that every child must be protected from unnecessary medical
treatment.<P>

   The Queensland Law Reform Commission's 1993 <A HREF="/library/legal/QLRC/">research paper</A> on
circumcision confirms the possibility of circumcised boys suing doctors and
parents.<P>

   It finds that on a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of
the Queensland Criminal Code, routine circumcision would be regarded as a
criminal act."<P>

   "Consent by parents to the procedure may be invalid in light of the
common laws restrictions on the ability of parents to consent to
non-therapeutic treatment of children."

   The paper states a child's ability to sue for circumcision "would ... be
dependent on the absence of real consent."<P>

   Professor Turner says a High Court case ruling in 1992 (re Marion) -
that parents do not have the right to authorise non-therapeutic,
irreversible operations for their child - could possible be applied to male
circumcision.<P>

   The High Court ruled that parents of an intellectually handicapped child
do not have the right to consent to the child's sterilisation, and only the
Family Court of Australia can consent to to such operations (except in NSW
and SA where special procedures apply).<P>

   Even though the High Court case concerns only sterilisation, Professor
Turner says "there are plenty of comments in the judgement to suggest the
same principle could extend to other operations not designed to preserve a
child's health."<P>

   Professor Peter Phelan, President of the <A HREF="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian College of
Paediatrics</A>, released a statement earlier this month acknowledging the
potential legal and human rights implications of male circumcision but he
refused to condemn or support the procedure.<P>

   Dr Keith Woollard, chairman of the <A HREF="/library/statements/ama2/">AMA</A>'s ethics committee has "no doubt"
male circumcision is a growing legal and ethical problem.<P>

   "Having looked at both sides of the argument, my own view is that there
not sufficient evidence to justify it as a routine surgical procedure on
otherwise healthy people.<P>

   "The QLD Law Reform Commission report raised the possibility of men
suing their doctors and parents for their circumcision.  If the medical
profession believes there are no good medical implications for this
procedure, then where is the legal basis for doing it?"<P>

   Dr Woollard says there has been an enormous shift in the number of boys
circumcised today compared with decades ago when it was the norm.<P>

   It is believed around 40 per cent of boys were circumcised in Australia
in 1980.  Today, less than 20 per cent are circumcised.<P>

   "The medical profession themselves have walked away from it.  Dr
Woollard says.<P>

   According to Professor Turner "there is evidence that many men suffer
negative psychological effects and possibly long lasting psychological
damage."<P>

   Male circumcision is still commonly practised by Muslim and Jewish
communities.<P>

   But Dr. Woollard cautions the debate "mustn't degenerate into some sort
of criticism of Jewish and Muslim faiths."<P>

   It is only when it is performed for non-religious reasons that we need
to be discussing it at the moment, he says.<P>

   The 20 men urge British Paediatric urologists to produce guidelines
advising how foreskin problems can be managed.<P>

   "Preferably," they write, "circumcision should not be done until the
patient or adult is old enough to understand what is intended; then he has
a right to a full, illustrated explanation of the nature of the operation
and the reasons for it in advance, with the opportunity to ask questions,
and help in coming to terms with the  alteration of his anatomy
afterwards."<P>

<h4>Foreskin's future: to cut or not to cut</h4><P>
The case for:
<UL>
<LI>a reduced incidence of urinary tract infections in infants.  Such infections are rare.
<LI>Lower incidence of sexually transmitted diseases.  Dr Woollard says
    there is evidence in overseas societies, particularly in Africa, of
    lower instances of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV in
    circumcised men.
<LI>There is no evidence in Australia that is the case, he says.
<LI>It is believed that this is simply a function of personal hygiene -
    in situations where personal hygiene is adequate the foreskin is not
      risk factor for sexually transmitted diseases.
<LI>Reduced cancer of the foreskin.  Cancer of the foreskin is extremely
      uncommon.  "It is a bit like advocating mastectomy because some women
      might get breast cancer", Dr Woollard says.</ul>
The case against:<ul>
<LI>Circumcision can cause death from bleeding.  "This is extremely rare."
<LI>Anaesthetic risks.
<LI>It is painful and is still routinely performed without anaesthetic.
<LI>It has little or no medical benefit.
<LI>Slight risk of damage to the penis.  According to Professor Turner
    "there is a case in NSW where a child who went in for a circumcision
     was castrated."
<LI>The foreskin serves some useful function.  According to Dr Woollard
      this has been argued in the US and Great Britain.</ul>
