      <p class="text"><i>The scope, weight, and assignment of
      parental rights have been the focus of much debate among
      legal commentators. These commentators generally have assumed
      that parents should have some rights in connection with the
      raising of their children. Rarely have commentators offered
      justifications for attributing rights to persons as parents,
      and when they have done so they have failed to subject those
      justifications to close scrutiny. This article takes the
      novel approach of challenging parental rights in their
      entirety. The author explores the fundamental questions of
      what it means to say that individuals have rights as parents,
      and whether it is legitimate to to do so. In defining
      existing parental rights, the Article focuses on parental
      rights in religious contexts, because it is in this arena
      that the notion of parental rights takes its strongest form.
      The author contrasts parental rights with other individual
      rights that receive protection under our legal system. He
      concludes that the claim that parents should have
      child-rearing rights is inconsistent with certain principles
      underlying all other individual rights recognized in our
      society. After demonstrating this theoretical shortcoming of
      the notion of parental rights, the Article challenges the
      soundness of the commonly advanced justifications of
      parenting rights. The author concludes that all the proffered
      justifications for parents' rights are unsound and recommends
      a substantial revision of the law governing child-rearing.
      The author proposes that children's rights rather than
      parents' rights serve as the basis for protecting the legal
      interests of children. The law should confer on parents only
      a child-rearing privilege, limited to actions that do not
      harm the child's interests. Such a privilege, coupled with a
      broader set of children's rights, satifies parents legitimate
      interests in child-rearing while providing children with a
      more appropriate level of protection than they receive under
      the current legal approach.</i></p>

      <p class="heading">I<small>NTRODUCTION</small></p>

      <p class="text">Parent's rights play a prominent role in any
      discussion of the law relating to child-rearing. For those
      who would like to have the State use its power and resources
      to improve the lives of children, parental rights constitute
      the greatest legal obstacle to government intervention to
      protect children from harmful parenting practices and to
      state efforts to assume greater authority over the care and
      education of children. Legal commentators, whatever their
      views on the proper distribution of child-rearing authority
      between parents and the State, universally assume that
      parents should have some rights with respect to the raising
      of their children.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> They debate
      only what the scope of those rights should be,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> how to balance them against state
      interests or children's interests and rights,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,</a></sup> who should have them,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> and when people who have them should
      lose all or some of them.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Those who do pause to consider why parents
      should have any child-rearing rights at all uniformly point
      to justifications that they believe to be compelling, but
      fail to subject those supposed justications to careful
      scrutiny. The usual justifications for parental rights fall
      into three categories, based on the interests they invoke: 1)
      children's interests in intimate relationships and in
      receiving care from those who know them best and care most
      about them; 2) parents interests in intimate relationships
      and in molding a new life in accordance with their ideals;
      and 3) society's interests in pluralism and in the family as
      an essential building block of democratic culture.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">This article takes a step back from debates
      over the scope, balancing, and attribution of parental rights
      to ask at a fundamental level what it means to say that
      individuals have rights as parents, and whether it is
      legitimate to do so. As as starting point, I closely examine
      judicial treatment of parental child-rearing rights and
      contrast this with judicial treatment of other legal rights.
      Through this analysis, it becomes apparent that the claim
      that parents should have child-rearing <i>rights</i>--rather
      than simply being <i>permitted</i> to perform parental duties
      and to make certain decisions on a child's behalf in
      accordance with the <i>child's</i> rights--is inconsistent
      with principles deeply embedded in our law and morality.
      Specificaly, there is in our legal culture an inherent
      limitation on the permissible scope of individual rights,
      confining them to protection of a right-holder's personal
      autonomy and <i>self</i>-determination. This limitation on
      legal rights embodies the moral precept that no individual is
      <i>entitled</i> to control the life of another person, free
      from outside interference, no matter how intimate the
      relationship between them, and particularly not in ways
      inimical to the other person's temporal interests.</p>

      <p class="text">The incongruity between parents' rights and
      established principles regarding the nature and inherent
      limitations of individual rights compels us to seek other
      moral and/or legal principles to support and legitimize this
      anomalous set of rights. Absent such justification, we might
      be forced to conclude that parents' rights, like the plenary
      rights of husbands over their wives in an earlier age,
      ultimately rest on nothing more than the ability of the
      politically more powerful class of persons to enshrine in the
      law their domination of a politically less powerful class,
      and on an outmoded view that members of the subordinated
      group are not persons in their own right. Thus, after
      demonstrating the theoretical difficulties associated with
      the notion of parent's rights, this article challenges the
      empirical and normative premises underlying the
      justifications typically offered in support of parental
      rights, and the reasoning that proceeds from these
      premises.</p>

      <p class="text">Concluding from this analysis that all of the
      proffered justifications for parent's rights are in fact
      unsound, I recommend a substantial revision of the law
      pertaining to child-rearing. I propose that children's
      rights, rather than parent's rights, be the legal basis for
      protecting the interests of children.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> I propose further that the law confer
      on parents simply a child-rearing <i>privilege</i>, limited
      in its scope to actions and decisions not inconsistent with
      the child's temporal interests. Such a privilege, coupled
      with a broader set of chidren's rights, is sufficient to
      satisfy parent's legitimate interests in
      child-rearing.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">As this proposal suggests in making the case
      against parental rights, I draw importantly on the
      distinction between a right and a privilege. In doing so, I
      follow Wesley Hohfeld's seminal work on the description of
      legal relations.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Hohfeld urged
      the legal community to confine the use the term "right" to
      what he called "claims," which entail corresponding duties in
      other persons of non-interference (a negative claim) or
      assistance (a positive claim). Thus a parent has a "negative
      claim-right" against the State with respect to a given action
      when the State is under a duty owed to the parent not to
      interfere with the parents performance of that action. A
      parent has a "positive claim-right" against the State when
      the State is under a duty owed to the parent not to interfere
      with the parent's performance of that action. A parent has a
      "positive claim-right" against the State when the State is
      under a duty owed to the parentto provide some form of
      assistance to the parent. The parental rights of primary
      concern in this Article are parents' negative claim-rights
      against state interference in their child-rearing practices
      and decision making.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Hohfeld rejected the use of the term "right"
      to refer to what he called a "privilege," which is simply the
      absence of any duty to refrain from a given activity. If, for
      example, I allow my neighhbor to borrow my shovel, she then
      enjoys a privilege to take and use it; she is no longer under
      a duty to me not to take and use my shovel. This privilege
      does not entail any claim against me should I interfere in
      her use of the shovel or take it away from her.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Similarly, a parental privilege,
      unaccompanied by any parental rights, would merely legally
      <i>permit</i> parents to engage in the types of behavior
      normally associated with child-rearing, e.g., housing,
      feeding, clothing, teaching, or disciplining a child. It
      would thus exempt parents from certain duties with respect to
      children generally.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The
      privilege would not give parents themselves any legal claims
      agaist state efforts to restrict their behavior or decision
      making authority. Under the legal regime I propose, such
      claims would repose only in the child. Parents would be
      authorized to act as agents for the child and to assert the
      child's rights against inappropriate state interference with
      child rearing practices. From a moral perspective, a parental
      privilege would not convey or reflect a sense of entitlement
      to direct a child's life, but instead would represent a
      benefit contingent upon the fulfillment of attendant
      responsibilities.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">It is important to recognize that this
      alternative approach would <i>not</i> entail doing away with
      the institution of the family in favor of colectivized
      child-rearing.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Nor would it
      transfer to the State vastly greater control over
      child-rearing or enable the state to intervene whenever
      social workers think a parent is performing less than
      optimally.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Finally, the
      elimination of parental rights would not entail the
      "liberation" of children from all parental governance and
      discipline. If it is true, as virtually everyone believes,
      that children require some governance and discipline for
      healthy development, it would be senseless and improper to
      attribute to children rights against all forms of parental
      control, or to exclude appropriate discipline from the scope
      of duties parents owe to their children.</p>

      <p class="text">Abrogating parents' rights would, however
      subtantially alter the way that courts analyze conflicts
      between parents and the larger community over child-rearing.
      Rather than balancing parents' rights against state interests
      in the care and education of children, as presently occurs,
      judges would decide these conflicts solely on the basis of
      children's welfare interests. Doing so would be likely, in
      turn to alter the precise limits of parental freedom and
      authority and to shift the boundary between permissible and
      impermissible state interventions.</p>

      <p class="text">Under this approach, a community seeking to
      restrict parents' child-rearing freedom or authority would
      not need to argue that the interests of the child and of the
      rest of society outweigh the rights of the parents in a given
      case. Rather the State would only need to argue that the harm
      to the child that non-intervention would allow is greater
      than the harm to the child that intervention would cause. The
      latter approach is likely to be more successful in protecting
      the interests of the child than the current approach.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">This Article focuses in the first instance on
      parental rights in religious contexts--that is, in situations
      where parents' religious beliefs shape their child-rearing
      preferences. It is in this context that the principal aspects
      of parent-state conflicts over child-rearing take on their
      most extreme form. Many people, including judges, find
      parents' claims to exclusive child-rearing authority to be
      motivated by religious belief. State child welfare laws
      accord particular deference to parents' religiously motivated
      child-rearing decisions.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      Moreover, the societal values of pluralism and state
      neutrality toward differing belief systems are most clearly
      at issue in the free exercise context. Focusing on situations
      that put these considerations into sharpest relief helps to
      draw out the moral implications of the notion of parent's
      rights.</p>

      <p class="text">Part I of this Article therefore concerns
      "parental free exercise rights"--rights predicated on
      religious belief enjoyed only by parents in the context of
      child-rearing. Parents may calim these rights when state
      child welfare laws or schooling policies conflict with their
      religiously grounded preferences regarding the care and
      education of their children. The courts have interpreted
      parental rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First
      Amendment to extend the child rearing authority and
      independence of parents beyond what which they enjoy under
      the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This
      means that in most cases courts have been unwilling to allow
      either the States' determination or their own judgment of a
      child's best interests to supplant parental free exercise
      rights. Indeed, only when accorded decisive weight to
      parental free exercise rights would threaten the child with
      death or grievious bodily injury or would result in the child
      receiving a grossly inadequate education will the State
      prevail under the current legal regime.</p>

      <p class="text">Part II explains why ascribing special rights
      to persons as parents is anomalous within our legal system.
      Providing for such rights implicitly endorses the proposition
      that one person may be entitled to the control, use, or
      direct the life-course of another, non-consenting person, and
      may assert on his own behalf a valid legal claim against any
      third party interference in the exercise of that control.
      Judicial interpretation of constitutional rights in the
      parenting context is unique in this regard, and fundamentally
      at odds with other, well-established constitutional and
      common-law principles.</p>

      <p class="text">Even if they accept the conclusions of Part
      II, defenders of parental rights might contend that there are
      very good reasons for treating children differently from
      adults, and for creating an exception in the parenting
      context to general principles regarding rights.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> In Part III, therefore, I consider a
      number of potential justifications for parental rights.
      Ultimately, each is deficicent, particularly in regard to
      parental rights under the Free exercise Clause.
      Justifications based on the necessity of protecting
      children's interests are logically flawed, because a more
      appropriaet approach is available--namely ascribing <i>to
      children</i> any rights necessary to protect their important
      interests. Justifications based on parents' interests or on
      societal interests, such as pluralism and the preservation of
      traditional communities, are morally flawed because, they
      implicitly adopt an instrumental view of children, treating
      them as mere means to the furtherance of other persons'
      ends.</p>

      <p class="text">Two final points about methodology deserve
      mention. First, in discussing interests and rights, I treat
      them as attaching to individuals, rather than attaching to
      relationships as unitary entitities. This is consistent with
      the way the courts generally interpret rights and construe
      interests in the context of parent-state conflicts over
      child-rearing, as well as in other contexts involving
      intimate relationships, such as marriage. It is also the most
      sensible approach, given the undeniable fact that a parent
      and a child are two non-identical persons whose interests at
      any point in their relationship may differ and even conflict.
      This individual-oriented approach to discussing interests and
      rights in no way denies, however, that the interests of
      parent and child are ordinarily consistent with one another
      and are, in fact, largely interdependent. Nor is it
      inconsistent with an understanding that familial
      relationships constitute a large part of the self-conception
      of young children.</p>

      <p class="text">Second, the most objectionable aspect of the
      court's construction of parents' rights is the extension of
      those rights in some cases to entitle parents to treat
      children in ways contrary to the children's temporal
      interests. The solution offered in this Article is to
      dispense with the notion of parental rights altogether. an
      alternative way to counter this phenomenon would be simply to
      argue that courts should narrow the scope of parental rights.
      However, merely narrowing the scope of parental rights would
      not cure two problems: first, inherent in the very notion of
      parental child-rearing rights is a morally dubious notion of
      parental entitlement; and second, becaues the rhetorical
      power of parental claims to child-rearing rights, judges
      would be unlikely in practice to contain those rights without
      carefully defined limits. Continuing to focus on parental
      claims would in all likelihood continue to distract judges
      from the interests of children, which should be the primary
      focus in any dispute concerning child-rearing.</p>

      presents Dr. Dwyer's conclusion below.]</i></font></p>

      <p class="heading">C<small>ONCLUSION</small></p>

      <p class="text">Consideration of judicial interpretations of
      rights in numerous contexts has revealed that the notion of
      parental rights is inconsistent with well-established legal
      principles. Rights protect only a right-holder's own person
      and property. No one should possess a <i>right</i> to control
      the life of another person no matter what reasons, religious
      or otherwise, he might have for wanting to do so. Children
      are persons, intimately bound up with but nevertheless
      distinct from their parents. Supposed justification for
      parents' rights based on the interest of children, on the
      interests of parents, or on the interests of society simply
      do not withstand scrutiny.</p>

      <p class="text">These findings compel the conclusion that
      parental child-rearing rights are illegitimate. A better
      regime would simply grant parents a legal privilege to care
      for and make decisions on behalf of their children in ways
      that are not contrary to the children's temporal interests.
      Children themselves should possess whatever rights are
      necessary to protect their fundamental interest in an
      intimate, continuous relationship with their parents. This
      includes the right to be insulated from any state
      interference that is not in the children's interests.</p>

      <p class="text">Courts should acknowledge the illegitimacy of
      the parents' rights doctrine and decline to recognize claims
      of parental rights in the future. The evolution of our social
      attitudes toward, and legal treatment of, children in recent
      decades would afford the Supreme Court an adequate rationale
      for departing from the rule of <i>stare decisis</i><sup><a
      href="#n302">302</a></sup> and for overruling <i>Yoder</i>
      and <i>Pierce</i> to abolish parental child-rearing rights.
      Subsequently, courts would decide cases involving disputes
      between parents and the State over child-rearing practices
      based on the interests and rights of the children involved.
      This approach would encourage a more appropriate social and
      legal understanding of parenthood as a privilege conditioned
      on a parent's willingness to operate within limits defined by
      temporal well-being of her children. It would also foster
      recognition that children are distinct persons deserving of
      respect equal to that accorded adults, and not merely means
      to the fulfillment of parents' life-purposes.</p>

      This Article deals exclusively with child-rearing
      rights--rights to direct the life of a child in one's
      custody--which are distinct from child-bearing rights--rights
      to conceive and give birth to a child. The latter raise
      discrete issues in addition to some of those discussed below
      in relation to child-rearing rights. <i>See e.g.</i> Onora
      O'Neill, <i>Begetting, Bearing, and Rearing, in</i>
      H<span>AVING</span> C<span>HILDREN:</span>

      O'Neill &amp; William Ruddick eds., 1979 [hereinafter
      H<span>AVING</span> C<span>HILDREN</span>]. Custody rights
      also differ somewhat from child-rearing rights. Custody
      rights concern entitlement to engage in particulary practices
      or to make particular decisions regarding a child's
      upbringing. Custody rights are often at issue in divorces and
      in abuse or neglect proceedings. They are also at issue when
      biological parents seek to reclaim children from adoptive
      parents, as happened recently in highly publicized cases in
      Iowa, Illinois, and Florida. <i>See infra</i> note 20. The
      arguments of this Article apply equally against claims of

      but these are becoming increasingly less common and are "not
      very well received today," McCarthy, <i>supra</i> at 984. I
      do not directly address natural law arguments in this
      Article, but I do consider whether states should give
      deference to parents' religious views of their parental role.
      Nor do I directly address the view that children are the
      property of their parents. Almost no one seriously maintains
      this position today, although the language of some court
      decisions may still reflect such a view. William Ruddick,
      <i>Parents and Life Prospects, in</i> H<span>AVING</span>

      7. Among the most important of these interests is a child's
      interest in enjoying an intimate relationship with her
      parents, free from any state intervention that would entail
      greater costs than benefits for the child. It is widely
      believed that state intrusion into the family in and of
      itself takes as significant psychological and emotional toll
      on the child. Goldstein, Freud, and Solnit emphasized this
      consideration in their influential work on legal advocacy on
      behalf of children. Joseph Goldstein et al., Before the Best
      Interests of the Child (1979). Other scholars have contended
      that these writers overstated and failed to support
      adequately their concern about state intervention. <i>See,
      e.g.</i>, Marsha Garrison, <i>Child Welfare Decisionmaking:
      In Search of the Least Drastic Alternative</i>, 75
      G<span>EO</span>. L. J. 1745, 1762-66 (1987); Michael S.
      Wald, <i>Thinking About Public Policy Toward Abuse and
      Neglect of Children: A Review of</i> Before The Best
      Interests of the Child, 78 M<span>ICH</span>. L.
      R<span>EV</span>. 645, 666-71 (1980); <i>See also</i> Juditth
      G. McMuller, <i>Privacy, Family Autonomy, and the Maltreated
      Child</i>, 75 M<span>ARQ</span>. L. R<span>EV</span>. 569,
      589-92 (1992) (citing evidence of correlation between family
      isolation from the community and child abuse). In addition,
      little if any consideration or study has been given to the
      possibly benificial effects of state intervention on the
      parent child relationship--for example, greater respect by
      parents for the children in their care and a greater
      appreciation by both parents and children that parents are
      not entitled to do whatever they want to their children. This
      Article assumes that state intervention in the family is
      potentially costly for children, and this too must be
      considered in deciding whether the State should intervene to
      protect a child from harmful parental practices and
      decisions.<br />

      8. Part III suggests a principled means for distinguishing
      between legitimate parental interests and morally
      illegitimate parental desires. In brief, the former are
      consistent with the child's temporal interests, while the
      latter entail the sacrifice of the child's temporoal
      interests in order to satisfy the parent's wishes. Parts II
      and III demonstrate that even legitimate parental interests
      cannot properly give rise to parental child-rearing
      rights.<br />

      10. Judges and to a much greater extent, the general public
      sometimes use the term "right" very loosely to refer to
      anything that a person is not prohibited from doing (i.e.,
      privileges) as well as to refer to Hohfeldian claim-rights.
      As the analysis below reveals, the "rights" that the courts
      have accorded parents clearly include claim-rights and not
      merely privileges to carry out parenting responsibilities,
      there would be less reason to object to the concept. However,
      insofar as the term "right" conveys a sense of entitlement,
      its use would remain morally problematic in connection with
      child-rearing authority. <i>See</i> discussion <i>infra</i>
      Part II.<br />
      <a id="n11" name="n11" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      11. A few additional terms also warrant clanification. The
      term "liberty" frequently appears in consitutional
      interpretation. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Thornburg v. American
      College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/476/747.html">476 U.S.
      747</a>, 793 n.2 (1986) (White J., dissenting) ("[P]arents
      have fundamental liberty to make decisions with respect to
      the upbringing of their children.") <i>overruled in
      nonrelevant part by</i> <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/505/833.html">Planned
      Parenthood v. Casey</a>, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992); Estelle v.
      Williams, <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/425/501.html.">425 U.S. 501,
      503 (1976)</a> (noting that the "right to a fair trial is a
      fundamental liberty"); Zemel v. Rusk, <a

      (1976) ("[T]he fact that a liberty cannot be inhibited
      without due process of law does not mean that it can under no
      circumstances be inhibited."). Judith Jarvis Thompson
      explains that what we commonly mean by a "liberty" is a
      combination of a privilege and a negative claim right.
      J<span>UDITH</span> J<span>ARVIS</span> T<span>HOMSON</span>,
      T<span>HE</span> R<span>EALM OF</span> R<span>IGHTS</span>
      53-54 (1990). Thomson criticizes Hohfeld's characterization
      of a liberty as identical to a privilege, based on the
      implausibility of thinking that when we say someone possesses
      a liberty to do something, such as travel to another state,
      all we mean to say is that that person is under no duty to
      travel to the other state. We also mean, Thompson insists,
      that other persons are "under a duty toward him not to
      interfere with his doing of it in some appropriately chosen
      set of ways." <i>Id</i>. Thus, for example, if a parent has
      no legal duty to refrain from teaching his child creationism,
      and the State has a duty not to interfere with his doing so,
      then the parents possess a liberty to teach his child
      creationism.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hohfeld termed a "power"
      the legal authority to modify, waive or abolish a claim-right
      or privilege. One exercises a power by, for example releasing
      a party from a contractual obligation and thereby abolishing
      one's claim-right against that party. An "immunity," on the
      other hand, is a protection against someone else changing the
      nature of one's own claim-rights or privileges. The First
      Amendment, for example, accords individuals an immunity which
      prevents Congress from abolishing their liberty to practice
      their religion.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, packages of
      claim-rights, privileges, powers, and/or immunties will often
      attach to persons with respect to a given activity. For
      example, typically, when a person possesses a claim-right
      against others interfering in their duty to refrain from that
      act--and she may also enjoy the power to waive that
      claim-right and an immunity against others extinguishing the
      claim-right and privilege. For simplicity of exposition, the
      term "right" is sometimes used in this Article to refer
      generically to such packages that have a claim-right at their
      core.<br />
      <a id="n12" name="n12" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      12. These duties are embodied in laws such as those
      prohibiting kidnapping. In the present legal environment,
      such duties also arise as the corollary to the exclusive
      right of parents to perform child-rearing functions free from
      interference by other adults. In the legal regime advocated
      here, these duties would instead be a corollary to the rights
      of children to be under the continuous care of a parent, free
      from interference by other adults.<br />
      <a id="n13" name="n13" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      13. In this light, a parent's role would be analogous to that
      of a lawyer appointed to represent a child in legal
      proceedings, such as a custody dispute. The lawyer enjoys the
      privilege of directing a certain aspect of the child's
      life--namely, the child's participation as an interested
      party in the legal proceedings by virtue of representing the
      child, never her own. There are obvious and important
      differences between the parent-child relationship and an
      attorney-client relationship, but the distinctive features of
      the parent child relationship constitute no justification for
      attributing rights to parents. <i>See</i> discussion
      <i>infra</i> Part III.<br />
      <a id="n14" name="n14" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      14. Analogously, the fact that lawyers appointed to represent
      children do not possess a right to represent those children
      does not render the practice of child advocacy impossible or
      unstable. We impute to the children a positive claim-right to
      legal representation and a negative claim-right against third
      party interference in that legal reprentation.<br />
      <a id="n15" name="n15" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      15. For an argument that the threshold of state intervention
      should be quite high even from an exclusively child-centered
      perspective, see Michael Wald, <i>State Intervention on
      Behalf of "Neglected" Children: A Seach for Realistic
      Standards</i>, 27 S<span>TAN</span>. L. R<span>EV</span>. 985
      (1975).<br />
      <a id="n16" name="n16" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      16. Consider for example, a child in need of surgery to
      correct a non life-threatening physical deformity, but who
      parents object to the procedure on religious grounds. A court
      faced only with weighing the cost and benefits <i>to the
      child</i> might well conclude that the benefits of living a
      normal healthy life outweigh the costs to the child, if any,
      which might arise from her parent's frustration, resentment
      toward the rest of society, and anxiety about their own
      salvation or that of the child. On the other hand, when
      courts have in similar cases balanced the State's interests
      in the child's welfare against the constitutionally protected
      rights of her parents, they have often concluded that the
      parents' rights trump the State's interests. <i>See</i>
      discussion <i>infra</i> notes 108-14 and accompanying
      text.<br />
      <a id="n17" name="n17" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      17. Judicial and legislative deference to parents' alleged
      rights is certainly not limited, however, to the context of
      religiously motivated child-rearing. <i>See</i> discussion

      of parents' rights, but endorsed and them nonetheless. <i>See

      Infants, Their Parents and the State, Part II</i>, 4
