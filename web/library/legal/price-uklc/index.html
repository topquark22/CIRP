      <h2><a id="intro" name="intro"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

      <p>The function of the criminal law "is to preserve public
      order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is
      offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards
      against exploitation and corruption of others, particularly
      those who are specially vulnerable because they are young,
      weak in body or mind, inexperienced, or in a state of special
      physical, official or economic dependence" <sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>`Circumcision is not an operation to be undertaken lightly
      and if it is to be performed in Great Britain it is probably
      best performed in a hospital environment, in an older child
      as a general anaesthetic day-case' <sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>This paper intends to examine the issue of nontherapeutic
      male circumcision, in the light of the Law Commission's
      Consultation Paper No 139 (`The Consultation Paper'), and its
      lawfulness for ritual and nontherapeutic reasons. By
      `non-therapeutic' is meant any circumcision which is not to
      treat an existing disease process or bodily abnormality; a
      circumcision is a form of proper procedure only where there
      is a disease process or abnormality and treatment by other
      conservative methods is, or on genuine medical grounds is
      considered to be, medically inappropriate and/or less
      invasive treatments have been tried but have failed. [See
      also in <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">Secretary, Dept. of Health and Community
      Services v. JWB and SMB</a> <i>per</i> Brennan J 2A]</p>

      <p>This paper does not seek to comment on the Consultation
      Paper generally; nor does the paper seek to comment on
      Appendix C of the Consultation Paper, which discusses certain
      philosophical issues, except that the continuing lack of a
      rigorously thought-through philosophical position is a clear
      defect in the Consultation Paper.</p>

      <p>Further, it would be inappropriate for this paper to
      rehearse in any great detail the reasons why male
      circumcision medically cannot properly be regarded as
      harmless; that is dealt with fully by others elsewhere. This
      paper will simply and briefly describe the 3 areas where
      medical studies have demonstrated harm, give some sample
      references to medical papers by way of illustration only and
      will proceed on the basis that the contention in the paper
      that it is `generally accepted that the removal of the
      foreskin of the penis has little, if any, effect on a man's
      ability to enjoy sexual intercourse, and this act is not,
      therefore, regarded as mutilation' is wholly false: and from
      that position, to examine the legal consequences that flow
      therefrom.</p>

      <p>It has been thought right to touch on the burden of proof
      which, it is suggested, lies on those who would continue this
      procedure; and, in view of dispute as to whether or not
      circumcision is a mutilation to give some illustrative
      definitions of that word. Equally, because of the antiquity
      of the practice, the religious and tribal overtones to it,
      and the myths that have grown up around it-not least from the
      `masturbation-phobia' of the 19th century to the
      pseudo-science of more recent years - it seems right to
      devote some space in this paper to an examination of this
      history of this procedure.</p>

      <h3>1.1 Burden of Proof</h3>

      <p>The general rule is that he who avers, proves.</p>

      <p>Circumcision involves the amputation of a body part; when
      done for ritual, cultural or social reasons, the part
      amputated is healthy flesh from the healthy organ of a
      healthy male and those who say that it is proper to do it,
      and would do it to another without that other's consent, are
      required to justify the alleged propriety and to justify this
      interference with the bodily integrity and functioning of
      that other.</p>

      <p>The specific assertions usually made are that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The foreskin is without function and/or value.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Circumcision is painless in infancy.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Circumcision is a minor procedure of no, or minimal,
        risk.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Circumcision is of no ill-effect.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Circumcision has little, if any, effect on a man's
        sexual function and/or pleasure.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Circumcision is not mutilating.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Circumcision can offer prophylactic benefits.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>Non-therapeutic circumcision is lawful</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is not for those who would have children left intact
      and uncircumcised to demonstrate that circumcision is
      damaging (and unless required for clear therapeutic reasons,
      unjustifiable); although, were it to be wrongly suggested
      that the burden were so laid on them, it is suggested that
      this paper has discharged that burden.</p>

      <p>Rather it is clearly for the circumcisers, not least in
      the light of mainstream medical knowledge and current legal
      concepts, to make good their general and specific assertions,
      by careful and rigorous evidence, arguments and refutation of
      the medical and legal position. Mere repetition of these
      assertions, as in the Consultation Paper, particularly in
      paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2, are valueless. Mere assertion that
      ritual circumcision is seen as a religious duty is equally
      valueless in discharging the burden of proof: it may provide
      a reason but does not provide a justification, or in other
      words it may explain but does not excuse.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Mutilation</h3>

      <p>The use of the word `mutilate' or `mutilation' to describe
      circumcision is hotly opposed by those who circumcise for
      non-therapeutic reasons; hence also the defensive,
      medically-refuted and incorrect assertion (`incorrect' since
      it takes no account of the facts nor of the definition of the
      word `mutilate') at the end of the second sentence of
      paragraph 9.2 of the Consultation Paper.</p>

      <p>"Language often reveals more about ourselves than we
      intend and our choice of words can show the way we humans
      idealise things that we might otherwise see in a different
      light. The stunted deformed feet that resulted from
      foot-binding of Chinese girls were called `Golden Lotuses'
      and were considered highly attractive and desirable. Their
      counterpart --normal feet -- were seen as gross and ugly.
      Similarly, <i>The Layman's Guide to the Covenant of
      Circumcision</i> [by Rabbi Jacob Schechet] calls circumcision
      the `Golden Circle'" and "...a rabbi writing of his own
      struggle between protective parental instinct and the
      cultural mandate to circumcise his newborn son refers to the
      intact penis with its foreskin as a `stopped-up dullness'"
      quoted by Boyd <sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>The use of the concept of mutilate/mutilation in
      connection with circumcision is resisted both by those who
      wish to continue the practice; and by many circumcised men,
      for whom the process of denial of their own damage is
      fragile, so as to cope with the destabilising effect on
      themselves and others of a description of such accuracy and
      directness. The resulting contortions to avoid such
      uncomfortable words and/or to re-define them in an attempt to
      exclude circumcision are worthy of Humpty Dumpty.</p>

      <p>Yet the word `mutilation' as defined in its ordinary
      sense, as well as by medical dictionaries, is wholly apt to
      describe the result of this procedure. Thus:</p>

      <p><b>Mutilate</b></p>

      <p>`1. To deprive (a person or animal) of a limb or some
      principal organ of the body; to cut off or otherwise destroy
      the use of (a limb or organ)</p>

      <p>`2. To render (a thing, esp. a record , book etc.)
      imperfect by cutting off or destroying a part.' <i>Oxford
      English Dictionary</i> OUP 1971.</p>

      <p>`Injure, make imperfect or inefficient, by depriving of a
      part.' <i>The Pocket Oxford Dictionary</i> (4th Edition 1942,
      revised 1946)</p>

      <p>`Implies the cutting off or removal of a part essential to
      completeness, not only of a person but also of a thing, and
      to his or its perfection, beauty, entirety or fulfilment of
      function.' <i>Webster's New Dictionary of Synonyms: a
      Dictionary of Discriminated Synonyms and Analogous and
      Contrasted Words</i> (1968)</p>

      <p><b>Mutilation</b></p>

      <p>`1. The action of depriving (a person or animal ) of a
      limb or of the use of a limb; the excision or maiming (of a
      limb or bodily organ).</p>

      <p>`2. The action of rendering (a thing) imperfect by
      excision or destruction of one or more of its parts.'
      <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> OUP 1971.</p>

      <p>`Disfigurement or injury by removal or destruction of any
      conspicuous or essential part of the body.' <i>Stedman's
      Medical Dictionary</i> (26th Edition) 1995</p>

      <p>`The act of depriving an individual of a limb, member, or
      any other important part; deprival of an organ; severe
      disfigurement.' <i>Dorland's Illustrated Medical
      Dictionary</i> (28th Edition) 1994</p>

      <p>`Maiming; the act of removing or destroying a conspicuous
      or essential part or organ.' <i>Taber's Cyclopedic Medical
      Dictionary</i> (17th Edition) 1993</p>

      <h3>1.3 Hippocratic oath</h3>

      <p>Given that many circumcisions are performed by doctors and
      also given that, even though the Oath may not now be formally
      administered, its priciples are as applicable today as ever,
      both to doctors and all others performing surgery or medical
      treatment on another, it is appropriate to cite an extract
      from the <a href="/library/ethics/hippocrates/">Hippocratic
      Oath</a><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>:</p>

      <p>"The regimen I adopt shall be for the benefit of my
      patients according to my ability and judgement, and not for
      their hurt or for any wrong....Whatsoever house I enter,
      there will I go for the benefit of the sick, refraining from
      all wrongdoing or corruption."</p>

      <h2><a id="phys" name="phys"></a>2. The Physical Effects of
      Circumcision</h2>

      <p>Typically and incorrectly, male circumcision has been seen
      in the past by the lay public, as `a minor snip', and so
      described by many especially in popular magazines; the
      foreskin is variously described as `a vestigial piece of
      skin' or `redundant'.</p>

      <p>Whilst circumcision is not now routinely carried out in
      Britain for non-religious reasons, as it used to be from the
      19th century until circa 1950, there are still those who wish
      to perform it on their children for non-ritual reasons and
      from time to time there are calls for its wider use: thus,
      Beth Raleigh in <i>Your Sex Organs, 40 Fascinating Facts</i>
      (August 1994 SHE) when she wrote that neonatal circumcision
      "can have health benefits."</p>

      <p>Or it is seen a procedure conducted by Jews on the 8th day
      after birth or by Muslims and members of some other
      religions/ethnic groups as a slightly odd but essentially
      harmless ritual.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to obtain exact figures for the number of
      circumcisions performed each year in Britain.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/general/gordon/">Gordon and
      Collin</a><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> say that nearly 7%
      of boys in Britain will be circumcised by age 15, and they
      suggest that this number is well in excess of those for whom
      medical reasons demand circumcision (they suggest that the
      proper number will be between 1% and 2%). By contrast,
      Finland manages to circumcise only 6 per 100,000 males (a
      figure of 0.006%).</p>

      <p>According to the NHS Executive<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup>, the figures for operations on the
      prepuce are:</p>

      <p>1991/92: 36,644</p>

      <p>1992/93: 37,586</p>

      <p>1993/94: 36,403</p>

      <p>These figures will however only include procedures carried
      out in hospital, and will exclude those performed outside
      hospital either privately and/or by General Practitioners;
      they will however include a number of circumcisions done for
      purely ritual reasons.</p>

      <p>According to a discussion, earlier this year, on BBC2's
      Newsnight some 30,000 ritual circumcisions are done each
      year; whilst some of these will be included in the NHS
      figures, some will represent additional circumcisions. What
      one can say, with confidence, is that the vast bulk of the
      circumcisions will be for non-therapeutic reasons (as
      defined) and will be well in excess of 36,000 and may
      approach 67,000 each year.</p>

      <p>Whatever the reason for its being done, it is popularly
      seen (vide the populist and unsupported remark in paragraph
      9.2 of the Consultation Paper) as having few risks or
      ill-effects for the male and, by some, as offering a range of
      medical benefits, the breadth of whose claims and whose
      persistence in the face of medical refutation is a
      demonstration that strong and hidden forces are at work. That
      in the neonate it is usually performed without anaesthesia
      raises no eyebrows, since the traditional thinking was, and
      still is, that the neonate does not feel pain.</p>

      <p>Circumcision, as is now well recognised by doctors, has
      three main areas of physical harm, which, in brief are:</p>

      <h3>2.1 Pain:</h3>

      <p>Circumcision is very painful and increasingly, despite the
      inherent risks of any anaesthesia, doctors performing
      neonatal circumcision now give some form of anaesthesia;
      however, the Jewish Bris Milah and, in many cases, Muslim
      circumcisions are carried out without anaesthesia.</p>

      <p>For most of this century, the bulk of medical literature
      stated that newborn boys were insensitive to pain and would
      not, therefore, need risky anaesthesia for circumcision.
      "This myth was based on the fact that much of the peripheral
      nervous system has still to develop the myelin that insulates
      the nerve fibres, hence the inability of newborns to
      co-ordinate muscle movement etc. Without myelin, the fibres
      concerned are unable to pass integrated or high level
      messages. It is extraordinary that medically trained
      professionals could not recall that all pain messages are
      carried by thin unmyelinated fibres of the pain and
      temperature tracts that are unrelated to the myelinated motor
      and discriminatory sensation pathways. Far from being
      incomplete in their development at birth, the pain pathways
      are probably the most developed peripheral neural
      tracts."<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p>Remarks such as: `He slept through the whole thing' are
      often used. What is seen as `sleeping through' the procedure
      is however a form of shock or semi-coma from the trauma. Dr
      Justin Coll, infant psychologist and Professor in Chief of
      Child and Adolescent Psychology at the University of
      California, is quoted in Romberg <i>Circumcision: The Painful
      Dilemma</i>, as saying: that infants being circumcised `can
      lapse into a semi-coma' which is an `abnormal state in the
      newborn'.</p>

      <p>Dalens <sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> writes: "Pain in
      paediatrics has long been underestimated. The numerous
      scientific studies carried out during the last decade show
      that its existence can no longer be doubted: in fact, pain
      already exists during the neonatal period, and probably
      throughout the last trimester of gestation as well. Pain
      pathways mature during the embryonic period and peripheral
      receptors develop between the 7th and 20th week [of
      gestation]. Spinal roots and nerves are completely
      differentiated before the second month [of gestation].
      Assessing pain, already a difficult task in the adult, is all
      the more so in children because of lesser verbal
      communicative capabilities, difficulty in handling abstract
      concepts, lack of experience of painful stimuli to make
      comparisons, and ignorance of their body image. [In
      diagnosing pain] behavioural tests remain the mainstay until
      the prepubertal period."</p>

      <p>Because of the danger of administering general anaesthesia
      to babies under 6 months of age, and the pain and risks of
      tissue damage of administering local anaesthetics to the
      penis, circumcisions in this age group are still mostly
      performed without any anaesthesia to this day. Parents are
      not usually told that their sons will go through this
      agony.</p>

      <p>"There is no doubt that circumcisions are painful for the
      baby. Indeed, circumcision has become a model for the
      analysis of pain and stress responses in the newborn. Not
      only does the unanesthetized newborn cry vigorously, tremble,
      and, in some cases, become mildly cyanotic because of
      prolonged crying, but other stress-related physiological
      reactions have also been demonstrated, including dramatic
      changes in heart and respiratory rates and in transcutaneous
      oxygen and plasma cortisol levels.": H.J. Stang <i>et
      al</i><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/pain/taddio/">Taddio <i>et
      al</i></a>.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> studied the
      effects of neonatal circumcision pain on later sensitivity to
      pain. They found that the effects of this pain were
      detectable in later childhood; but then arrived at the
      incorrect conclusion that, instead of not circumcising, there
      should be pain-relief given for circumcisions.</p>

      <p>Dr R Van Howe writes:<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The work of Gunnar,<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
          Marshall<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>, and
          others,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> show that the
          behaviour and physiologic responses to neonatal
          circumcision have been well established. Although a few
          physicians such as Weiss<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
          claim the newborn does not experience pain, most informed
          physicians now agree that neonatal circumcision is
          painful and recommend local anesthetic for the procedure.
          Performing this extremely painful procedure without
          anesthetic has allowed researchers to study the
          parameters of extreme pain in experiments that would not
          have been allowed on laboratory animals.</p>

          <p>"Using routine, unanesthetized circumcision as a model
          of stress, Porter et al. were able to examine the
          relation between cry acoustics and vagal tone in 49 (32
          experimental; 17 control) 1 to 2-day-old, full-term
          normal, healthy newborns during the preoperative,
          surgical, and postoperative periods. Vagal tone was
          significantly reduced during the severe stress of
          circumcision. These reductions were paralleled by
          significant increases in the pitch of the infants'
          cries.</p>

          <p>In addition, individual differences in vagal tone
          measured prior to circumcision surgery were predictive of
          the physiological and acoustic reactivity to subsequent
          stress.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

          <p>"Two studies by Marchette's group looked at
          non-medical nursing interventions to alleviate the pain
          associated with circumcision. In the first, neonates were
          randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: 18
          infants received routine care, 15 infants had music
          played, and 15 infants had a tape of intrauterine sounds
          played. During circumcision, monitors measured cardiac
          rate, rhythm, blood pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen.
          Pain was measured by analysis of videotaped facial
          expressions. The mean heart rate was above normal limits
          during all steps of the circumcision for the control
          group and during some of the steps for the other two
          groups. Analysis of the facial expressions showed that
          all three groups expressed pain much more than any other
          emotion during the procedure. Unfortunately, the two
          interventions were unable to offset the effects of
          circumcision pain.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

          <p>"The second study assessed the effectiveness of some
          noninvasive pain reduction interventions in 121 neonates
          undergoing unanesthetized circumcision. Subjects were
          randomly assigned to one of six groups: classical music,
          intrauterine sounds, pacifier, music and pacifier,
          intrauterine sounds and pacifier, or no interventions
          used while heart rate, rhythm, dysrhythmias, blood
          pressure, transcutaneous oxygen, rate pressure product,
          and behavioral state were measured during 14 circumcision
          steps. Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of
          the systolic blood pressures, 30% of the diastolic blood
          pressures, and 81% of the transcutaneous pO<sub>2</sub>
          pressures were abnormal. Again, few significant

          "Many myths about pain in children have been discredited.
          One myth was the belief that very young infants do not
          have the neurologic capacity to experience pain.
          Neuroanatomical studies, however, have shown that by 29
          weeks of gestation, pain pathways and the cortical and
          subcortical centers involved in the perception of pain
          are well developed, as are the neurologic systems for the
          transmission and modulation of painful sensations <sup><a
          href="#n23">23</a></sup>. Behavioral<sup><a
          href="#n24">24 25</a></sup> and physiologic<sup><a
          href="#n26">26</a></sup> studies have shown that even
          very young infants respond to painful stimuli. Premature
          infants undergoing surgery with minimal anesthesia, which
          was once standard practice, have significantly higher
          stress responses (by hormonal and metabolic measures) and
          significantly higher rates of complications and mortality
          than those given deeper anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n27">27
          28</a></sup><br />
          <br />
           

          <p>"A related misunderstanding is the belief that even if
          very young children experience pain, they have no memory
          of it, and therefore it has no lasting effect. However,
          recent studies have concluded that pain and distress,
          such as those associated with circumcision, can endure in
          memory, resulting, for example, in disturbances of
          feeding, sleeping, and the stability of the state of
          arousal <sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>. Preliminary
          data even suggest that early experiences of pain may
          produce permanent structural and functional
          reorganization of developing nociceptive neural pathways,
          which in turn may affect future experiences of pain
          <sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup>.</p>

          <p>"Another belief that has been dispelled is that
          children's pain cannot be measured accurately. Pain in
          children can be assessed through physiologic indicators,
          systematic observation of behavior, and reports by the
          children themselves <sup><a

      <h3>2.2 Risks:</h3>

      <p>Circumcision is a procedure which carries risks which have
      been described as high as some 50%; of course, if the
      inevitable diminution of sexual function is counted as a
      complication (as would seem to be wholly sensible a course),
      then the complication rate is 100%. It is far from easy to
      obtain definitive figures for the rate of complications as
      conventionally defined.</p>

      <p>When the United Kingdom medical profession and the NHS
      decided to abolish routine circumcision after the publication
      of Gairdner's <a href="/library/general/gairdner/">landmark
      paper</a> in 1949 [op. cit. at n 78], one of the reasons
      cited was the high death rate: this ranged from 10-19 per
      annum nationally in circumcised boys under 5 years of age in
      a country that did not perform wholesale circumcision (e.g.
      during the same period as these death rate figures, one
      representative city had a circumcision rate of only 5-8%).
      Because most of the deaths following circumcision result from
      conditions secondary to the surgery (e.g. infection or
      haemorrhage) the records kept have usually shown the actual
      mortal condition rather than the primary medical event that
      induced it. So it is not surprising that a number of reviews
      of the procedure have remarked on the difficulty in obtaining
      realistic mortality rates.</p>

      <p>As <a href="/library/general/gellis1/">Gellis</a><sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup> has more recently observed:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "It is an incontestable fact at this point that there are
          more deaths each year from complications of circumcision
          than from cancer of the penis."
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Illingworth in his standard textbook has noted:<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Most practising paediatricians have seen unfortunate
          consequences from the operation of circumcision, and seen
          or personally heard of death directly resulting from it."
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The Journal of Urology (Baltimore) puts the figure for the
      risk of complications at 1.5% to 15%.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>

      <p><a href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/">Williams
      and Kapila</a><sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> offer a
      `realistic figure of 2% to 10%'. However, they also comment
      that the incidence of meatal ulceration following
      circumcision is from 8% to 20% which would seem to suggest
      that their rate of complications is on the low side. They
      write: "Meatal stenosis is generally a direct consequence of
      circumcision that is seldom encountered in uncircumcised men;
      meatal calibre is known to be greater in uncircumcised
      individuals. The incidence of meatal ulceration is from 8 to
      20 per cent....Meatal stenosis following circumcision has
      been advanced as a cause of recurrent pyelonephritis and
      obstructive uropathy, for which meatotomy is
      curative."<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup>.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/procedure/patel/">Patel</a>'s<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> is the only longitudinal study
      beyond the first few months which studied the true extent of
      complications; as many of the complications arise in later
      years, his are the most reliable as shown by the high figures
      he obtained. He reported a rate of 24% of serious
      complications.</p>

      <p>Apart from the problems of differing and varying
      diagnostic criteria employed, there are indications that
      complications and mishaps are being misreported or not
      reported at all. The Editorial comment<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> in 1996 <i>British Journal of
      Urology</i>, commenting on a case report by Neulander and
      others, which describes an amputation of the distal penile
      glans following ritual circumcision as a `rare complication',
      observes: "The authors report what they describe as a rare
      complication....Fistula formation, lymphoedema and iatrogenic
      hypospadias have all been reported. Most amputations are
      almost certainly not reported. I have seen half a penis
      amputated in a 4-year-old boy during a ritual Muslim
      circumcision. The penis was left by the General Practitioner
      surgeon in the waste-paper basket of his surgery."</p>

      <h3>2.3 Dysfunction:</h3>

      <p>The victim (to use the Commission's own word, which here
      seems wholly apposite) will suffer from inevitable deficits,
      viz:</p>

      <h4>2.3.1</h4>

      <p>Removal of the prepuce removes specialised tissue and
      nerves designed for sexual pleasure. <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor et al</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> write:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"clearly, the penis is a complex organ with many
          different parts, each specialized for a specific role.
          The prepuce provides a large and important platform for
          several nerves and nerve endings. The innervation of the
          outer skin of the prepuce is impressive <sup><a
          href="#n67">67</a></sup>; its sensitivity to light touch
          and pain are similar to that of the skin of the penis as
          a whole. The glans. by contrast, is insensitive to light
          touch, heat, cold <sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> and,
          as far as the authors are aware, to pin-prick. Le Gros
          Clark <sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup> noted that the
          glans penis is one of the few areas on the body that
          enjoys nothing beyond primitive sensory modalities."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This insensitivity elicited the comment<sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup> "that the glans penis has been
      documented to have unusually low (emphasis added) sensitivity
      (high threshold) to mechanical stimulation. Von Frey<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> found that the only the portion of
      human skin less sensitive to mechanical stimulation was a
      callus on the sole of the foot.</p>

      <h4>2.3.2</h4>

      <p>The loss of some one-third (or an area in the adult of
      some 15 square inches) of penile skin, removes the skin
      within which the penis should move during intercourse and
      masturbation, producing a feeling of `tightness' during an
      erection.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Like many boys of my generation in Britain, I was
          circumcised in infancy by a doctor. I grew up knowing
          that something had been removed from my penis as my older
          brother was intact, but was told that this did not
          matter. The glans was always uncomfortable when rubbed by
          clothing throughout childhood and on into adult life, so
          that I always looked for tight supportive underwear to
          minimise friction. The discomfort was poorly localised,
          and it is only recently that I have realised that my
          intolerance of boxer shorts was the direct result of
          circumcision.</p>

          <p>"The shaft skin was very tight during erection, though
          I never thought of this as abnormal as I had nothing to
          compare with. Masturbation was often accompanied by
          laceration of the skin, so that I learnt to masturbate
          wearing a condom. I married 25 years ago and at first
          there were problems of dyspareunia from time to time
          which we attributed to vaginal dryness, as I considered
          myself normal. We overcame this by use of artificial
          lubricants. As time went on we explored ways of
          maximising our sexual enjoyment. I observed that there
          was remarkably little sensitivity in the glans, the skin
          of which seemed to thicken with advancing years. I
          remarked on this to my wife, who thought it strange. It
          was when I observed that the most sensitive part of my
          penis was the skin between the circumcision scar and the
          glans, that I began to realise for the first time how
          much I had been harmed by circumcision. This skin was the
          remnant of the inner lining of the foreskin, the
          remainder of which had of course been amputated. I
          assumed there was nothing whatever to be done about this
          tragedy, and I resolved to make the most of what was
          left"<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>All too often, however, considerably more skin than that
      is removed; and losses of 60%+ of the total penile skin are
      far from uncommon.</p>

      <h4>2.3.3</h4>

      <p>The glans is exposed to daily assaults and trauma from
      infections, urine and faeces in the nappies and to life-long
      abrasion from clothing; and becomes dry, wrinkled and covered
      with a layer of keratin (or, as some have described it,
      becomes `cornified')and insensitive and able to tolerate
      touch which an intact man cannot. As such it is wholly unlike
      the glans of an intact man whose glans is smooth, glistening
      and sensitive to touch. <a

      Bigelow</a><sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> write:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Bigelow The Joy of Uncircumcising<sup><a
          href="#n74">74</a></sup> reports that the prepuce has
          four functions. Firstly, it is itself sensitive due to
          the nerve endings on its inner surface, which become
          exposed during sexual arousal. Secondly, it protects the
          glans.<br />
          <br />
           

          <p>"The protected glans remains soft, moist and sensitive
          throughout life, but the exposed glans of the circumcised
          male becomes increasingly thickened and desensitised.
          Were this not so it would be impossible for a circumcised
          man to tolerate the abrasion of clothing on the exposed
          glans. Thirdly, the mobile sheath of skin on the intact
          penis allows the prepuce to slide back and forth over the
          glans during foreplay and intercourse. Ritter calls this
          action `the pleasure dynamic'. Fourthly, it provides
          slack skin on the shaft of the erect penis allowing it to
          glide within its own sheath of skin during intercourse.
          This provides for more enjoyable intercourse for both
          partners and avoids problems with vaginal dryness."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Others too have earlier described the prepuce as one of
      the most sensitive parts of the penis and its potential for
      enhancing sensation during sexual intercourse; and the
      development on the exposed glans of dermal layers up to 12
      times the skin thickness, which has been described as the
      formation of a cornified layer-an additional outer covering
      of compressed dead cells which as a result of this
      `scarification' process may render the penis less
      sensitive.<sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup></p>

      <p>All too often, one hears supporters of circumcision
      claiming that they have not been harmed, that their sexual
      life is unimpaired and, even, that they `could not cope with
      any more sensitivity'. No one would claim that circumcision
      renders the man incapable of procreation. Rather the analogy
      is of a person blinded at birth in one eye: he can still see
      and in most respects lead, with his remaining vision, a
      useful and functional life; but what he cannot know, and can
      never experience, is the function and quality of life with
      binocular vision &mdash;those of us with full vision can only
      feel pity, and sorrow, for his loss even whilst we might
      commend his ability to cope with his disability. Further,
      that some circumcised men, being unaware of the diminution of
      sexual pleasure which they have suffered, are content with
      the what remains of their sexual pleasure is neither
      convincing as to there being no losses, nor an argument for
      imposing those on another.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/general/gairdner/">Douglas
      Gairdner</a><sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup> wrote of the
      function of the prepuce:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigial
          structure devoid of function. However, it seems to be no
          accident that during the years when the child is
          incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the
          prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans
          becomes susceptible to injury from contact with sodden
          clothes or napkin. Meatal ulcer is almost confined to
          circumcised male infants, and is only occasionally seen
          in the uncircumcised child when the prepuce happens to be
          unusually lax and the glans consequently exposed (Freud,
          1947).</p>

          <p>"There remain a number of more or less trivial factors
          which are sometimes mentioned as reasons why infant
          circumcision is desirable: difficulties in keeping the
          uncircumcised parts clean, or the supposed aesthetic or
          erotic superiority of the shorn member. In order to
          fulfil the intention of this paper an inquiry on these
          points should have been made amongst a group of
          uncircumcised men. This was not attempted, although with
          regard to the last two of the factors mentioned it should
          be stated that whenever the subject has been broached in
          male company those still in possession of their foreskin
          have been forward in their insistence that any
          differences which may exist in such matters operate
          emphatically to their own advantage.</p>

          <p>"Moreover, if there were sensible disadvantages in
          being uncircumcised, one would expect that the fathers of
          candidates for circumcision would sometimes register
          their feelings in the matter. Yet in interviewing the
          parents of several hundred infants referred for
          circumcision I have met but one father who wished his son
          circumcised because of his disagreeable experience of the
          uncircumcised state. The rest of the fathers were equally
          indifferent about the matter whether they themselves had
          been circumcised or not. Indeed, so little did the
          father's personal experience seem important that
          one&shy;quarter of the mothers did not even know whether
          their husbands were or were not circumcised. These facts
          provide some evidence that few uncircumcised men have
          cause to regret their state."</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"The glans belongs to the group of special sense
          organs. It is almost insensitive to light touch, has no
          appreciation of heat and cold, and interprets painful
          stimuli (such as a pinprick) only as a vaguely unpleasant
          contact; ..... The preservation, undulled and
          undiminished, of this special sense that the glans can
          receive some sexual sensations], and the guarding of the
          mucous membrane in which it resides from constant
          exposure and a dulling of its sensibility, is of
          paramount importance ..... A second less important
          function is in the act of coitus itself. The erect
          uncircumcised penis enters the vagina without effort or
          at any rate without friction, the prepuce unfolding as
          the penis advances and each part of it remaining in
          contact with successive areas of the vaginal walls, till
          finally the uncovered glans lies at the cervix. The
          circumcised penis, deprived of this self-tracking
          mechanism, is introduced to the accompaniment of friction
          between penile skin and vaginal mucous membrane. it is
          the difference between slipping the foot into a sock that
          has been rolled up and one that is held open by the top.
          The human foreskin, then, is neither vestigial nor
          useless. It is part of the normal mechanism of
          reproduction, and without it sexual desire is to some
          extent blunted, and the performance of the sexual act -at
          any rate the first act of coitus between the virgin male
          and the virgin female &mdash; made more difficult. .....
          Apart from those evil results which are due to imperfect
          workmanship, there are the fairly common minor troubles
          that follow because a stupid and unnecessary operation
          has been done, a normal mechanism has been destroyed, and
          a delicate surface has been exposed to the air and to
          friction 4 or 5 years before it should be exposed. Eczema
          of the glans and meatus is not rare in the newly
          circumcised infant; it needs careful treatment with
          ointment and sometimes leads to scarring and narrowing of
          the meatus. These are the facts....the medicine of the
          jungle and the witch-doctor, the teaching of the Bible
          and the Koran, the traditional science of the midwife,
          the health visitor, and the Home Medical Dictionary, are
          all against us....Nonetheless, let us keep our own
          sanity. When we meet those who advocate this mutilation,
          let us ask them why they do it and again why: they have
          seldom asked themselves. When we meet a young mother
          whose mind is her own and not someone else's gramophone
          record, let us ask her if she thinks it likely that
          Nature would bring 1000 English children into the world
          every day, well formed in all respects except this one;
          if it is not more likely that Nature is right and the
          folk-medicine that tries to improve on her is
          wrong......let us not commit the sin against the Holy

      <h2><a id="claim" name="claim"></a>3. Claimed Benefits</h2>

      <p>Even discounting the `anti-masturbatory' reason, discussed
      below, for circumcision (and the so-called hygiene grounds,
      which for the Victorians carried the message of moral
      cleanliness) and which became disproved by circumcised boys
      who still masturbated, the claims for benefits for
      circumcision other than as a religious or ritual observance
      are as myriad as they are discredited. Thus, for example, the
      claim of hygiene in the sense that the word is understood
      to-day as referring to bodily cleanliness and cited by the
      Commission, is disproved even by the pro-circumcision biased
      Task Force on circumcision of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics in 1989.<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup></p>

      <p>The claims still often (indeed, one might almost say
      invariably) made by circumcisers as benefit(s) flowing from
      circumcision include the following:</p>

      <p>- Hygiene.</p>

      <p>- Prevention of phimosis and paraphimosis</p>

      <p>- Prevention of balanoposthitis and balanitis).</p>

      <p>- Prevention of cervical and penile cancers.</p>

      <p>- `Better done at birth than later'</p>

      <h3>3.1 Hygiene</h3>

      <p>This is still the most persistent of the myths that
      surround circumcision; indeed it is the prime reason why
      Muslims feel compelled to circumcise. Yet the American
      Academy of Pediatrics' own Task Force on circumcision (op.
      cit.) has, notwithstanding a pro-circumcision bias, concluded
      that ordinary and regular washing serves just as well as
      circumcision. Thus: "It is particularly important that
      uncircumcised boys be taught careful penile cleansing. As the
      boy grows, cleansing of the distal portion of the penis is
      facilitated by gently, never forcibly, retracting the
      foreskin only to the point where resistance is met. Full
      retraction may not be achieved until age 3 years or
      older."</p>

      <p>Dr Terry Russell<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup>, an
      Australian general practitioner, is typical of the muddled,
      emotive, un-researched and wholly unthought-out advocate of
      circumcision for `hygiene' reasons: "What man after a night
      of passion is going to perform penile hygiene before rolling
      over and snoring the night away (with pathogenic organisms
      multiplying in the warm moist environment under the
      prepuce)": to which one can only say that there is no
      evidence educed of `pathogenic organisms' and that the woman,
      who is just as likely to `roll over and snore the night away'
      will have her, much more convoluted, internal and thus
      retentive, genitals bathed in her and her partner's fluids.
      Further, the argument for the ease of cleaning claimed for
      male circumcision has not lead to demands in any civilised
      country for excision of the clitoral hood and the labia in
      infant girls (who, despite also producing smegma) are relied
      upon to wash.</p>

      <p>Van Howe (op. cit. at n8) observes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"If left alone, the micro-environment of the preputial
          space maintains a delicate pH and bacterial balance. If
          disturbed through retraction or `cleaning', friendly
          bacteria are killed, and more aggressive pathogens are
          free to colonize mucosal tears and, potentially, the
          urinary tract itself. It has also been established that
          soap will dry out the preputial mucosa leading to
          inflammation and infections such as balanoposthitis and
          recurrent balanitis<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup>." He
          also observes: "The importance of this advice [against
          forcible retraction by parents and doctors] cannot be
          over-emphasized. The experience of the author has been
          the same as Watson's,<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup>
          namely, every intact boy that I have seen with
          complications (i.e. phimosis, urinary tract infection,
          balantitis) have all had their foreskins prematurely and
          forcibly retracted by a physician or had the parents
          forcibly retract the child's foreskin at the physician's
          insistence."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Kayaba et al.<sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup> found the
      same: infection of or under the prepuce was not a function of
      unretractability of the prepuce, but rather of poor hygiene.
      They found in a study of 608 boys that none were type V under
      the age of 1 and that the numbers of a Type V prepuce
      increased with age; the incidence of balanoposthitis was only
      1.5% and 7 boys were aged 1 to 5 years (and the infection,
      they suggested, owed more to poor penile hygiene than a
      foreskin).</p>

      <h3>3.2 Prevention of phimosis and paraphimosis</h3>

      <p>Of course, without a foreskin the chances of phimosis (a
      narrowing or stenosis of the foreskin which prevents full
      retraction of the foreskin) are either reduced (van Howe has
      described finding phimosis in circumcised boys) or
      eliminated: one might equally say that amputation of the toes
      will eliminate the chances of athlete's foot &mdash; yet no
      one seriously would propose that as a method of prevention
      and treatment is by less invasive means when and as needed.
      Yet what is clear is that, particularly in the United States
      but also in Britain, phimosis is `diagnosed' when it is
      simply not present: The penis develops with the glans `fused'
      to the foreskin and few boys will have a free and retractile
      foreskin at birth: separation occurs over the following
      years, but whilst many will have achieved this by age 5, some
      will not until as late as age 17. It is a misdiagnosis,
      suggestive of a fundamental ignorance of the basic anatomy,
      and development. of the boy's penis to diagnose phimosis in a
      young child; yet the usual `justification' in the United
      States for, and the reason given for a claim on health
      insurers, routine neonatal circumcision is phimosis (usually
      coupled with the comment `redundant foreskin'). <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster's
      observations</a><sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup> for older
      boys in a Danish population, where circumcision is rarely
      practised, showed that non-retractability is found in 8% of
      6-7 year-olds, in 6% between 8 and 11 years, 3% at 12-13, and
      only 1% at age 14-17. He also showed that preputial adhesions
      decreased with advancing age in the boys in the study, so
      that these were present in 63% of 6-7 year-olds, but only 3%
      of 16-17 year-olds. More recently <a
      href="/library/normal/kayaba/">Kayaba et al</a>. (op. cit.)
      have found the same; and they conclude that: "We agree with
      Wallerstein that in the absence of emergency medical problems
      the prepuce of infants should remain uncircumcised.
      CONCLUSIONS In most male individuals preputial separation
      continues until adolescence, presumably to protect the
      immature glans penis. Physicians as well as parents should be
      familiar with the biological role and natural development of
      the prepuce. Whilst surgery must be considered in the
      presence of paraphimosis or dysuria associated with phimosis,
      few boys require circumcision until adolescence when the only
      reason for this procedure is poor preputial
      retractability."</p>

      <p>Where there is genuine phimosis or paraphimosis, then
      recent work has indicated that treatment with steroid creams
      or preputioplasty can treat the problem in the bulk of cases,
      thus saving the foreskin with its nerves and other
      functions<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup>; apart from boys
      suffering from the rare condition of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans, the prepuce is usually saveable.</p>

      <h3>3.3 Prevention of cervical and penile cancers.</h3>

      <p>The claims of a reduction, or even hints of the
      elimination, of cancers of the cervix and penis (a disease of
      a tiny number of elderly men) have been discredited; Denmark
      and Japan, mainly uncircumcised countries, have a lower rate
      than the United States and, to put the disease in
      perspective, some 9,600 men die annually in Britain of cancer
      of the prostate. In view of the continuation, despite clear
      refutation in the medical literature, as to these claims, it
      is worth quoting from a <a
      href="/library/statements/letters/1996-02_ACS/">letter</a> to
      Dr Peter Rappo, of the American Academy of Pediatrics, dated
      16 Feb 1996 and from Drs Hugh Singleton and Clark Heath, the
      National Vice President and Vice President, of the American
      Cancer Society:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"...we would like to discourage the American Academy
          of Pediatrics from promoting routine circumcision as a
          preventative measure for penile and cervical cancer.
          Research suggesting a pattern in the circumcision status
          of partners of women with cervical cancer is
          methodologically flawed, outdated, and has not been taken
          seriously in the medical community for decades. Penile
          cancer rates in countries which do not practice
          circumcision are lower than those found in the United
          States. Fatalities caused by circumcision accidents may
          approximate the mortality rate from penile cancer."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>3.4 `Better done at birth than later'</h3>

      <p>The incidence of problems involving the prepuce is low: as
      has been discussed, the incidence of true phimosis is</p>

      <p>low, and certainly under 2% &mdash;- and probably of the
      order of 1% or less: Finland circumcises at the rate of 6 per
      100,000 (or 0.00006%)<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup>. An
      adult, or even an older boy will be able to understand why,
      assuming that more conservative and less invasively
      mutilating treatments have not worked, it is necessary to
      suffer this; he will be old enough (in his adolescence or
      older) to have anaesthesia and post-operative analgesia; his
      synechia will be wholly or largely dissolved (thus avoiding
      the stripping of them with trauma and subsequent scarring of
      the glans and resulting further loss of sensitivity); and his
      penis will be grown enough for a careful and calculated
      amputation to be made thus avoiding extra disfigurement,
      rather than the guess-work for an infant penis; and healing
      is usually uneventful. The claims that circumcision "hurts
      more in later life" are made, usually, by those circumcised
      ritually at birth or early childhood who therefore do not
      know from personal experience what they are talking about and
      who offer, as usual, not one scrap of evidence in support of
      their claims.</p>

      <p>To the `traditional' and well-debunked claims, the
      following `new', and equally unscientific, candidates have
      recently emerged:--</p>

      <h3>3.5 Prevention of sexually transmitted diseases</h3>

      <p>Now, perhaps as a measure of the desperation of
      circumcision's supporters to find a reason to continue, it is
      suggested as a preventive against UTIs, AIDS and other
      sexually transmitted diseases (on the basis, according to
      some US doctors,<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup> that the
      keratinised layer on the glans acted as a form of condom!).
      If that were indeed so then one would not expect to find
      rates of HIV infection in the USA, a mainly circumcised
      population, some 8 times that of Britain and the rest of
      mainly uncircumcised Europe, and on a level with Sub-Saharan
      Africa.<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup></p>

      <p>The `best' that the American Academy of Pediatrics could
      come up with in their Task Force report (op. cit.) was:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Evidence regarding the relationship of circumcision
          to sexually transmitted diseases is conflicting. Early
          series indicated a higher risk of gonococcal and
          nonspecific urethritis in uncircumcised men, whereas one
          recent study shows no difference in the incidence of
          gonorrhoea and a higher incidence of nonspecific
          urethritis in circumcised men. Although published reports
          suggest that chancroid, syphilis, human papillomavirus,
          and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection are more
          frequent in uncircumcised men, methodologic problems
          render these reports inconclusive."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Van Howe (op.cit. at n8) concludes, after an exhaustive
      review of the literature:</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p>Indeed, it has been suggested by some that the circumcised
      male, lacking the natural mobility of skin afforded by the
      foreskin and lacking the sensitivity both of which makes
      intercourse such a labour for the circumcised, might be more
      vulnerable to tears in the penile skin than the
      uncircumcised; thus giving a readier access to the HIV virus
      and other pathogens; but no real research seems to have been
      conducted to test this theory.</p>

      <h3>3.6 Prevention of urinary tract infections</h3>

      <p>The work relied upon for this latest `scare-tactic' by
      circumcisers is that of Wiswell, a US Army doctor. Yet the
      American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force concluded:<sup><a
      href="#n88">88</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          <br />
           "In another army hospital study, infants were examined
          in the first month of life and it was concluded that the
          high incidence of urinary tract infection in
          uncircumcised boys was accompanied by a similarly
          increased incidence of other significant infection,
          including bacteremia and meningitis; however, the authors
          of that study did not distinguish between bacteriuria
          secondary to septicemia and primary urinary tract
          infection. Still another recent army hospital study lends
          support to a 1986 hypothesis that circumcision prevents
          preputial bacterial colonization and thus protects male
          infants against urinary tract infection. <b>It should be
          noted that these studies in army hospitals are
          retrospective in design and may have methodologic flaws.
          For example, they do not include all boys born in any
          single cohort or those treated as outpatients, so the
          study population may have been influenced by selection
          bias</b>." [emphasis added].<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Wiswell's work has been the subject of trenchant criticism
      by others, such as Altschul<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup>
      and by van Howe (op. cit. at n8). Kayaba et al. (op. cit.)
      found not a single case of urinary tract infection and
      conclude that reduction of urinary tract infection (and there
      is doubt as to the efficacy of circumcision to achieve this
      anyway) "is not a decisive reason for justifying
      indiscriminate neonatal circumcision"; Dr van Howe comments
      on this in a private communication: "The fact that no urinary
      tract infections were seen is extremely important. When
      compared to Wiswell's studies there is a significantly lower
      incidence of UTI in this study (Fisher's exact test ranges
      between 0.001 to 0.000000031 depending on which Wiswell study
      is looked at). This study is another in a long line that has
      failed to confirm Wiswell's dramatic and unreproducible
      finding. Adding to the importance of this finding is that
      this study was prospective which is much more powerful than
      Wiswell's cursory chart reviews ..... actually Wiswell
      couldn't even reproduce his own results. The rate of UTI's in
      his first two reports differed significantly with the first
      study having a higher rate (odds ratio = 2.34, 95% confidence
      interval = 1.04 - 5.26)."</p>

      <h3>3.7 `Benefits': Conclusion</h3>

      <p>It is unnecessary here, given that the Commission do not
      offer it as a reason for proposing that ritual circumcision
      be regularised and given that the medical consensus in
      Britain and the rest of the non-circumcising world (some 85%
      of the world's men are blissfully uncircumcised) is that
      there are no real benefits to routine neonatal circumcision,
      to refute those claims at any great length: those who require
      further detail are directed, as a start-point, to the work of
      Dr R Van Howe (op.cit. at n8) and to the paper by Williams
      and Kapila (op.cit. at n32) and the papers there cited.</p>

      <h2><a id="sacr" name="sacr"></a>4. The sacrificial origin of
      circumcision</h2>

      <p>Initiation rites, usually involving the infliction of pain
      and the scarifying of the body, or the deformation of body
      parts or the excision of flesh were, and remain, not uncommon
      in primitive societies. It would not be unreasonable to see
      them as a mark, and a test, both of the victim's ability to
      withstand pain (and thus prove himself as a staunch warrior)
      and/or as a method whereby the tribe asserted itself and its
      powers over the individual. It is inappropriate here to
      examine in detail the motivation for such practices; but it
      is wholly appropriate to bear the nature and history of such
      mutilations in mind when considering the legality of
      circumcision, especially in the last years of the 20th
      century.</p>

      <p>J. Henry C. Simes<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup> wrote in
      1890:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The mutilation of the genitals among the various
          savage tribes of the world presents a strange and
          unaccountable practice of human ideas, which one is not
          able to reconcile with any reasoning power. Why such
          customs should be in vogue none can tell at the present
          time; but we must suppose that at some period they had
          their significance, which in the course of ages has been
          lost, and the practice has been handed down from
          generation to generation."</p>

          "The origins of circumcision are lost in antiquity. Male
          circumcision is depicted in Egyptian tombs 5,000 years
          ago, while Gairdner (op. cit. at n 78) refers to evidence
          that it has its origins long before this in prehistory up
          to 15,000 years ago.<br />
          <br />
           

          <p>"We do not know with certainty why this procedure was
          carried out, but many writers have suggested that it was
          a sacrificial rite. No doubt human sacrifice was
          widespread, and it seems likely that substitutes for this
          practice included the sacrifice of domestic animals and
          mutilations of the human body, of which circumcision is
          just one example. Circumcision would usually have been
          carried out as an initiation ordeal at about the time of
          puberty, but there was a tendency for the age at which it
          was performed to shift earlier, so that Jewish ritual
          circumcision has been carried out on the eighth day of
          life since biblical times.</p>

          <p>"Ritual circumcision is particularly popular and
          widespread geographically. An important aspect of
          sacrifice is the shedding of blood, and circumcision is a
          notoriously bloody operation, and even in modern surgical
          conditions haemorrhage can be a problem. A rate of up to
          2% is reported by Denton<sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup>,
          sometimes requiring blood transfusion. <a
          href="/library/general/gellis1/">Gellis</a><sup><a
          href="#n93">93</a></sup> reported that there were more
          deaths in the USA from the complications of circumcision
          than from carcinoma of the penis. One can only guess what
          the mortality from haemorrhage and infections might be in
          primitive or ancient communities.</p>

          <p>"Another aspect of sacrifice is that the object which
          is forfeited should be valuable. The greater the value of
          the object sacrificed, the more worthy the sacrifice.
          This should make us wonder what are the value and
          function of the prepuce. If it were just a useless flap
          of skin, it would not be much of a sacrifice, and one
          might just as well shave off one's beard or cut one's
          toenails. The prepuce plays a major role in ensuring the
          sensitivity of the penis during sexual acts and
          circumcision greatly reduces the possibilities of
          pleasurable sensations. This makes it an ideal
          sacrificial object, as the circumcised male is able to
          function normally in society and to procreate, but
          suffers permanent impairment of sexual enjoyment and
          bears a visible, life-long reminder of his
          sacrifice."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>According to Philo circumcision was for</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"the excision of passions, which bind the mind. For
          since among all passions that of intercourse between man
          and woman is the greatest, the lawgivers have commended
          [sic] that the instrument, which serves this intercourse
          be mutilated, pointing out, that these powerful passions
          must be bridled, and thinking not only this, but all
          passions would be controlled through this one."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Indeed, after the passage in Genesis Chapter 17 as to
      circumcision, there is then the passage in Genesis Chapter 22
      of the sacrifice demanded by God, even though then stayed, of
      Isaac; the connection between these two requests, and the
      value of that which was required to be sacrificed, is
      clear.</p>

          <p>"Some anthropologists also speculate how or if the
          tradition of male circumcision, the removal of the
          prepuce, is related to the cutting off the entire penis
          which was offered as a sacrifice to the
          gods...Circumcision of both boys and girls came into
          fashion long before Islam, and was practised in many

          Abyssians (Ethiopians) have practised circumcision of
          boys and girls (at a much younger age than the typical
          puberty rites of Sub-Saharan Africans) from pre-historic
          times....It is stated that both the Jews and the Arabs
          learned circumcision in Egypt, rather than vice versa.
          The rule in the Middle East, as well as in Sub-Saharan
          Africa, is that a boy cannot get married unless he is
          ...circumcised...excision [in females]...is practised to
          affirm the sex of the individual because it is believed
          that the clitoris represents a male element in a female,
          and that the prepuce of the penis represents femininity
          in a boy. Hence, the girls are excised and the boys

      <h2><a id="jew" name="jew"></a>5. Jewish circumcision</h2>

      <p>In Genesis Chapter 17, verses 10 to 14, God is said to
      have commanded Abraham to circumcise himself and all males in
      his household as a sign of the covenant between him and God.
      In Leviticus Chapter 12 verse 3, it is written:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
          circumcised."
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      See also I Sam 18:25 for another, undeniably primitive,
      reason for circumcision, quoted by Szasz<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup>.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>Szasz also (op.cit.) observes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The roots of both RNC [`Routine Neonatal
          Circumcision'] and anti-masturbatory measures lie in
          Jewish law, which recognises the legitimacy of erotic
          pleasure associated with sexual intercourse, provided
          that the act is marital-genital congress between a Jewish
          man and a Jewish woman. Every other sexual act is
          strictly prohibited. Masturbation is condemned
          unequivocally both in the Talmud and in extraTalmudic
          literature. The Zohar (an authoritative commentary on the
          Pentateuch) calls masturbation `a sin more serious than
          all the sins of the Torah' (Feldman D M: 1968: <i>Birth
          Control in Jewish Law: Marital Relations, Contraception,
          and Abortion as Set Forth in the Classical Texts of
          Jewish Law</i> p114)....Recognising the obvious
          connections between touching the penis and sexual
          arousal, Jewish law `definitely prohibits touching one's
          genitals --the unmarried man never, and the married man
          only in connection with urination' (Epstein L M: 1967
          <i>Sex Laws and Customs in Judaism</i> p137) When an
          Orthodox Jewish father bladder trains his son, he
          admonishes him: `Without hands! Better a bad aim than a
          bad habit.'"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The form of the circumcision originally practised by Jews
      was a much less invasive procedure than the Bris (or Brit)
      Milah of to-day, which (in its radical excision of the penile
      skin) is the form also adopted by circumcisions performed by
      doctors: only the very tip of the prepuce was removed, thus
      preserving the frenulum and most of the prepuce with its
      nerves and its coverage of much of the glans; indeed it seems
      possible that in some instances only a token `cut' or drawing
      of blood was deemed necessary. With such `minor' excision it
      was not difficult for a man circumcised in this way to pull
      and retain the remnants of his prepuce over the glans so as
      to appear to be uncircumcised. Since the ancient Greeks (who
      were naked for sporting activities and exercise) found the
      sight of the uncovered glans to be offensive and obscene
      during exercise, Jews who wanted to take part in sports with
      uncircumcised Greeks adopted this method of `un-circumcision'
      and this method could be used in any situation where the
      Jewish man wished to conceal the physical mark of his
      Jewishness. It is a method adopted by Jews whenever they have
      wished to conceal their Jewishness, as for example during the
      Holocaust (powerfully demonstrated in the film Europa Europa)
      and broadly speaking it is the foundation of the non-surgical
      method of foreskin restoration described by Bigelow in his
      book, <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising</i> (op. cit.). The need
      for many men to-day, some of whom are circumcised Jews, to
      follow the lengthy and often uncomfortable technique to
      restore just a tiny bit of the function of the foreskin lost
      in circumcision is evidence of their realisation of the
      damage caused by their circumcision.</p>

      <p>In or about 140 AD, the more radical form of circumcision,
      the pariah (or periah) was introduced: its radical tearing
      off the lining of the prepuce of the glans and, with a
      sharpened fingernail or thumbnail, the removal of all the
      mucous tissue that comprises the inner lining of the prepuce
      and amputation of the whole prepuce made it impossible for a
      man thus circumcised to re-cover his glans, since there was
      insufficient penile skin left. It is this form which has been
      used since then by Jews and is the model for the modern
      non-ritual circumcision which also involves radical
      amputation after the forcible breaking-down of the synechia
      between prepuce and glans penis.</p>

      <p>The loss of sexual pleasure of the circumcised man and the
      measure of the sacrifice imposed on the ritually circumcised
      boy has been well-known for many centuries (albeit that the
      recent trend is for circumcisers to feel impelled to deny
      that loss in order to defend their behaviour).</p>

      <p>Thus, Moses Maimonides (1135-1204 AD.), a noted Jewish
      rabbi, sage and doctor of his time, wrote:<sup><a
      href="#n96">96</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"As regards circumcision, I think that one of its
          objects is to limit sexual intercourse, and to weaken the
          organ of generation as far as possible, and thus cause
          man to be moderate. Some people believe that circumcision
          is to remove a defect in man's formation; but every one
          can easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient
          so as to require external completion, especially as the
          use of the fore-skin to that organ is evident? This
          commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a
          deficient physical creation, but as a means for
          perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The bodily injury
          caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it
          does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it
          destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply
          counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that
          circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and
          sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment; the organ
          necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is
          deprived of its covering from the beginning. Our Sages
          (Beresh. Rabba, c. 80) say distinctly: It is hard for a
          woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse,
          to separate from him. This is, as I believe, the best
          reason for the commandment concerning circumcision. And
          who was the first to perform this commandment? Abraham,
          our father! of whom it is well known how he feared sin;
          it is described by our Sages in reference to the words,
          `Behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look
          upon' (Gen. xii.II).</p>

          <p>"This law can only be kept and perpetuated in its
          perfection, if circumcision is performed when the child
          is very young, and this for three good reasons. First, if
          the operation were postponed till the boy had grown up,
          he would perhaps not submit to it. Secondly, the young
          child has not much pain, because the skin is tender, and
          the imagination weak; for grown-up persons are in dread
          and fear of things which they imagine as coming, some
          time before these actually occur. Thirdly, when a child
          is very young, the parents do not think much of him;
          because the image of the child, that leads the parents to
          love him, has not yet taken a firm root in their minds.
          That image becomes stronger by the continual sight; it
          grows with the development of the child, and later on the
          image begins again to decrease and to vanish. The
          parents' love for a new-born child is not as great as it
          is when the child is one year old. The feeling and love
          of the father for the child would have led him to neglect
          the law if he were allowed to wait two or three years,
          whilst shortly after birth the image is very weak in the
          mind of the parent, especially of the father who is
          responsible for the execution of this commandment. The
          circumcision must take place on the eighth day (Lev. xii.
          3), because all living beings are after birth, within the
          first seven days, very weak and exceedingly tender, as if
          they were still in the womb of their mother; not until
          the eighth day can they be counted among those that enjoy
          the light of the world. That this is also the case with
          beasts may be inferred from the words of Scripture:
          `Seven days shall it be under the dam' (Lev. xxii. 27),
          as if it had no vitality before the end of that period.
          In the same manner man is circumcised after the
          completion of seven days. The period has been fixed, and
          has not been left to everybody's judgement.</p>

          <p>"The precepts of this class include also the lesson
          that we must not injure in any way the organs of
          generation in living beings (ibid. xxii. 24). The lesson
          is based on the principle of "righteous statutes and
          judgements" (Deut. iv. 8); we must keep in everything the
          golden mean; we must not be excessive in love, but must
          not suppress it entirely; for the Law commands, `Be
          fruitful, and multiply' (Gen. i. 22). The organ is
          weakened by circumcision, but not destroyed by the
          operation. The natural faculty is left in full force, but
          is guarded against excess. It is prohibited for an
          Israelite `that is wounded in the stones, or hath his
          privy member cut off' (Deut. xxiii. 2), to marry an
          Israelitish woman; because the sexual intercourse is of
          no use and of no purpose; and that marriage would be a
          source of ruin to her, and to him who would claim her.
          This is very clear."</p>

      <p>But one must realise that, according to Jewish belief, one

          tremor from him, I pushed down slightly harder on the
          knees. The action seemed to comfort him. He stopped
          crying. He became calm. It was almost as if he trusted
          us....Dr Cohen gathered Julius's foreskin between his
          fingers, pulled it away, and his sad little glans was
          exposed....I heard the sound of Dr Cohen's breathing, and
          then I heard the sound of scissors tearing through skin.
          And then, a moment later, the horrible scream that Julius
          made of utter, excruciating pain....Supposedly,
          circumcised penises have 30 per cent less sensitivity
          than uncircumcised ones....God is perfect, man cannot be,
          so let us blemish our synagogue floors and mutilate our
          sons to prove it. I still don't believe in God. And if I
          have another son I am sure that he will be circumcised
          too."</p>

      <p>One can only ask why? Why this mutilation, of his son, by
      a man who does not believe in God, and thus for whom the
      `religious duty' can have no meaning; when the child cannot
      become Jewish by so doing it (or less Jewish by not doing it)
      and thus `cultural identity' seems meaningless; when he does
      not claim any medical benefits for doing it; and he accepts
      that it is painful, and damaging to penile sensitivity?</p>

      <p>By way of contrast, there are Jews for whom the Bris Milah
      is unacceptable:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"According to Jewish law, it is forbidden to cause
          tsa'ar ba'alei chaim, or pain of living things. Even the
          necessary causing of pain is considered cruel in Judaism.
          Jewish law even prohibits the pairing up of a small and a
          large animal for plowing in case the asymmetry causes the
          littler one discomfort. Clearly, concern over the pain of
          others has strong Judaic roots.</p>

          <p>"What about the concern that circumcision involves the
          surgical alteration of a perfectly natural God-given part
          of the body? This concern, too, stems from Jewish
          thought. Westerners generally find the bodily mutilation
          practised in other cultures to be deeply distasteful.
          This distaste is based on the Hebrew Bible's denouncement
          of pagan practices such as tattooing and cutting the
          flesh.</p>

          <p>"There is also the risk of serious complications, and
          even death, from circumcision. No matter how small these
          risks are, they must be considered. Now, even this
          concern is an echo of Jewish law. Judaism regards life as
          infinitely sacred and gives it precedence over all
          else.</p>

          <p>"Accordingly, Jewish law tells us that any medical
          procedure involving even the possibility of risk to life
          must be viewed as dangerous and is, therefore, strictly
          forbidden. Thus, the risk of circumcision is not just a
          medical concern, but a Jewish one.</p>

          <p>"Thousands of Jews today are questioning circumcision.
          Some are deciding not to circumcise their infant sons. By
          my estimates, American Rabbis are getting at least 3,000
          calls each year from parents who are in conflict with the
          rite."<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup></p>

          <p>"Judaism is a tremendously rich pro-survival religion
          that, through persistent mistreatment and misinformation,
          is still widely misunderstood. However, the mistakes that
          it carries within it, such as the ritual of circumcision,
          called Brit Milah, should not be considered any
          differently than in society in general, no matter how
          essentially important to the Jewish culture it is seen.
          Circumcision is child abuse. It is medically unnecessary.
          It is nothing short of a traumatic way to introduce a
          newborn male into the world and into the Jewish
          community. The centuries of a covenant with God has
          produced great denial in viewing the very real pain of
          the newborn. From the start it relegates females as being
          less important than males as historically there has been
          no equivalent ceremony to welcome the newborn Jewish
          female baby.</p>

          <p>"Make no mistake about it, young people do not ask for
          and react sharply to the imposition of adult values on
          them and their bodies. Expecting nothing short of a
          complete and exuberant welcome into their world, the pain
          of the tools used by the Mohel, or the doctor, is a rude
          shock not readily forgotten by the newborn with an
          already developed nervous system and a brilliant
          mind."<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup></p>

      <h2><a id="mus" name="mus"></a>6. Muslim circumcision</h2>

      <p>For Muslims, it is by no means clear that, as often
      asserted and cited by the Commission in footnote 3 to Part IX
      of the Consultation Paper, circumcision is regarded as a
      fundamental and required rite.</p>

      <p>The reason for its performance seems to be that Abraham
      was revered and that if he circumcised himself then that was
      a reason for its performance by Muslims; it also seems that
      the requirement for cleanliness before prayer was a factor
      (though no reason seems to have been advanced for not using
      water, as with other body parts; and seemingly no difficulty
      is seen with the propriety of prayers from boys uncircumcised
      until late childhood/teenage years).</p>

      <p>Dr S N Kahn states in <i>The Islamic Viewpoint</i>:<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Circumcision, encouraged in Islam and widely practised
          by Muslims, is a tradition of the Prophet and an
          important ritual" (emphasis added).

      </blockquote>

      <p>Ritual circumcision has also been discussed by <a
      href="/library/cultural/aldeeb1/">Dr Sami Aldeeb
      Abu-Sahlieh</a>.<sup><a href="#n101">101</a></sup> Although
      he deals rather more with female circumcision, his analysis
      of the mind-process behind both forms (i.e. male and female
      circumcision) is illuminating. He writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Circumcision as a sign of alliance can only be found
          in two other passages of the Bible. Elsewhere, it is more
          narrative: King Saul demanded one hundred Philistine
          foreskins from David, before he gave his consent to David
          marrying his daughter Mikal: "David.... thought it was a
          good deal in order to become the king's son in law... He
          went to war...He killed 200 Philistine men, brought back
          their foreskins, counted them in front of the king....So
          Saul...had to admit that Jehovah was on David's side."
          This interpretation of the Koranic verses with reference
          to the Bible is considered abusive by Imam Mahmud Shaltut
          (israf fil-istidlal). What is more, this textual argument
          based on Jewish law concerns male circumcision only, not
          female circumcision that the Bible does not mention and
          that the Jews do not practice (Falachas excepted).
          Al-Sukkari answers that, according to Ibn Hagar, the Jews
          used to circumcise both sexes, which is why he rejects
          male and female circumcision on the 7th [sic] day, so as
          not to look like them. Even the authentic Bible - today's
          one is considered falsified does not contain any text
          related to female circumcision. Nonetheless, the Muslims
          must practice it, if the Muslim law makes provision for
          it.</p>

          <p>"The Sunnah: We will try here to glean, from the works
          of contemporary Arab authors, the different sayings of
          Mohammed related to male and female circumcision. The
          most often mentioned narration reports a debate between
          Mohammed and Um Habibah (or Um Tatiyyah). This woman,
          known as an exciser of female slaves, was one of a group
          of women who had immigrated with Mohammed. Having seen
          her, Mohammed asked her if she kept practising her
          profession. She answered affirmatively adding: "unless it
          is forbidden and you order me to stop doing it." Mohammed
          replied: "Yes, it is allowed. Come closer so I can teach
          you: if you cut, do not overdo it (la tanhaki), because
          it brings more radiance to the face (ashraq) and it is
          more pleasant (ahza) for the husband." According to
          others, he said: "Cut slightly and do not overdo it
          (ashimmi wa-la tanhaki), because it is more pleasant
          (ahza) for the woman and better (ahab, from other sources
          abha) for the husband." We shall hereinafter refer to
          this narration as the exciser's narration. - Mohammed
          said: "Circumcision is a sunnah for the men and makrumah
          for the women." The term sunnah here means that it is
          conform to the tradition of Mohammed himself, or simply a
          custom at the time of Mohammed. The term makrumah is far
          from clear but we can translate it into a honorable deed.
          - Speaking to the Ansars' wives, Mohammed said: "Cut
          slightly without exaggeration (ikhtafidna wa-la
          tanhikna), because it is more pleasant(ahza) for your
          husbands." - Someone came to Mohammed and became a
          convert before him. Mohammed told him: "Shave off your
          unbeliever's hair and be circumcised." - Mohammed said:
          "Let him who becomes a Muslim be circumcised, even if he
          is old." - One asked Mohammed if an uncircumcised man
          could go to pilgrimage. He answered: "Not as long as he
          is not circumcised." - Mohammed said: "Five norms define
          fitrah: shaving of the pubis, circumcision, moustache
          trimming, armpit depilation and nail clipping." Other
          narrations name ten norms amongst which circumcision is
          always mentioned. The norms of fitrah are believed to be
          those taught by God to His creation. The man in pursuit
          of perfection must conform to those norms. They are not
          compulsory, but simply advisable (mandubah), except for
          circumcision which is mandatory. Based on these premises,
          Al-Sukkari believes Adam to have been the first
          circumcised man. His descendants having neglected their
          obligation, it was reconfirmed to Abraham and his
          descendants. Thus circumcision would be the sign which
          would differentiate the believer from the
          non-believer."</p>

      <h3>6.1 Muslim circumcision procedures.</h3>

      <p>Whilst the Jews circumcise, in accordance with their
      beliefs, on the 8th day of life, Muslims often delay
      circumcision until later in childhood: sometimes as late as
      the onset of puberty or even mid-teens or before marriage.
      The effect on such a boy of this amputation, without
      anaesthesia, particularly after the onset of puberty requires
      little imagination. Further, given that there is not a need,
      as with Judaism, to circumcise on a set day, there is no
      reason why the decision cannot be left to the boy himself
      when he is old enough to form his own independent view as to
      his belief-systems and his own body, when the procedure can
      be performed under suitable conditions and on an adult organ
      when the amount to be amputated can be the more accurately
      assessed. It is hard to resist the thought that the reason
      that it is typically performed in early childhood is because
      the child is at that age very much in the power of the
      parents and unable to resist this mutilation.</p>

      <p>The form of Muslim circumcision has been described by
      Wilfred Thesiger in his book <i>Arabian Sands</i>, first
      published by Longmans in 1959, and describing his travels in
      Arabia from 1945 onwards. He writes of meeting a Salim bin
      Turkia whose 15 year-old had `a curious cockscomb of hair, a
      sign that he was still uncircumcised'. Later, he writes of
      one his companions, bin Kabina aged about 16: although
      Thesiger says that circumcision is `usually performed on a
      child about the age of seven', he describes the haggard
      appearance of bin Kabina who tells him of his recent
      circumcision 3 months earlier. Thesiger also describes some
      of the features of this procedure: often the flayed member
      was then `kippered' for several days thereafter by being held
      in the smoke from a fire and sometimes mutilations such as
      `the flaying circumcision' were carried out, in which the
      skin was removed from the navel down to the inside of the
      thighs.</p>

      <p>Although the flaying circumcision in the sense described
      by Thesiger has been banned in Arab countries, very radical
      circumcision, involving the removal of much of the penile
      skin was practised in the southern parts of Oman as late as
      the 1970s.</p>

      <p>In an article The Knife-edge of Manhood, the circumcision
      of 7 year-olds in Istambul is described and
      photographed<sup><a href="#n102">102</a></sup> The
      circumciser, Kemal Ozkan, claims to have done as many as 2000
      circumcisions in a day, and is reported as being a local
      celebrity and featuring in tourist guidebooks to the city of
      Istanbul; according to him the ideal age is between 5 and 9
      but that age is, see for example <a
      href="/library/psych/cansever/">Cansever</a><sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup>, the age when procedures on the
      boy's genitals is likely to cause great mental trauma. As <a
      href="/library/psych/freud/">Anna Freud</a> observed:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Ever since the discovery of the castration complex
          analysts have had ample opportunity in their therapeutic
          work to study the impact of surgical operations, on
          normal and abnormal development. By now it is common
          knowledge that surgical interference with the child's
          body may serve as the focal point for the activation,
          reactivation, grouping and rationalization of ideas of
          being attacked, overwhelmed and (or) castrated. The
          surgeon's action, from minor surgery to major operations,
          is interpreted by the child in terms of his level of
          instinct development, or in regressive terms. What the
          experience means in his life, therefore does not depend
          on the type or seriousness of the operation but on the
          type and depth of the fantasies aroused by it. If, for
          example, the child's fantasies are concerned with his
          aggression against the mother projected on to her person,
          the operation is experienced as a retaliatory attack made
          by the mother on the inside of the child's body (Melanie
          Klein); or the operation may be used to represent the
          child's sadistic conception of what takes place between
          the parents in intercourse, with the child in the role of
          the passive sexual partner; or the operation is
          experienced as a mutilation, i. e., as punishment for
          exhibitionistic desires, for aggressive penis envy, above
          all for masturbatory practices and oedipal
          jealousies."<sup><a href="#n104">104</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The boys sit on a merry-go-round and are spun around;
      Ozkan stops the wheel to select the next boy for
      circumcision. One 7 year-old is quoted as saying "If you
      don't cut, I'll give you double the money that my father is
      paying you": his plea is ignored, his penis is grabbed and,
      after the circumcision, he is handed to his mother and the
      wheel spins again whilst Ozkan sharpens his knife for the
      next victim.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"One of [the ceremonial initiates among the elders]
          lies on his back on the ground, the boy lying upward upon
          him and pinioned in a locked embrace. Another holds down
          the boy's legs. A third does the actual cutting. In
          ancient times a stone knife was used. Today the
          instrument is a razor blade. The cutting is more likely
          to be a series of dissection movements. The boy may cry
          out with the pain. Immediately the foreskin is removed,
          the men in charge carry the boy into the bush nearby
          where he is passed through the smoke of a fire for
          spiritual cleansing. The bleeding of his penis is stopped
          by cauterising with a piece of hot charcoal and the
          application of hot, wet leaves....The meaning of the
          ceremony is, like the origin of circumcision itself, lost
          in the unrecorded annals of prehistory. My own
          theoretical guess is that it represents a substitute for,
          and an attenuation of, human sacrifice."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Meggit<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup> writes of the
      circumcision, performed between the age of 11 and 13:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The rite of circumcision and its attendant ceremonies
          firmly and unequivocally establish a youth's status in
          Walbiri society. Should he fail to pass through these
          rites, he may not enter into his father's lodge, he may
          not participate in religious ceremonies, he cannot
          acquire a marriage line, he cannot legitimately obtain a
          wife; in short, he cannot become a social person."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>He notes, at page 253, that "The Walbiri explicitly equate
      circumcision with ritual killing"; and at page 261 describes
      the procedure as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"A brother seizes the novice and places him face
          upward on the table, with his feet toward the fire.
          Another brother straddles him and presses his pubes
          against the lad's face to silent his cries, while a third
          grips his legs. a brother holds the shaft of the boy's
          penis, in order to protect `the inside bone' from injury;
          one of the circumcisers stretches the foreskin several
          inches, and another cuts it off with two or three quick
          slices."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Subincision, although abandoned in a number of
      communities, is performed by the Walbiri at age 17 and is
      described by Meggit at page 265 as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"To the accompaniment of loud chanting by the company,
          the man deftly slices open the youth's penis from the
          meatus to a point about an inch along the urethra."</p>

      <p>Cawte,<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup> in a remark which
      seems unacceptably insensitive, writes that "Subincision is
      another matter; this is going a little too far for European
      tastes; a subincised man makes a mess by spraying rather than
      squirting in toilets and urinals" (emphasis added). That this
      brutal further mutilation is described merely as "going a
      little too far for European tastes" and that the only
      disbenefit seemingly is that the victim makes a mess during
      urination is a telling demonstration of the mind-set towards
      genital mutilation as a whole and male circumcision and other
      male genital mutilations.</p>

      <h2><a id="origin" name="origin"></a>8. The origins of modern
      non-ritual circumcision</h2>

      <p>It is important, in considering the whole issue of
      circumcision and its legality, to have firmly at the front of
      one's mind the primitive tribal origins and barbarity of the
      ritual and the abuse from it of the victim; despite attempts
      to sanitise the ritual, to divorce it from its origins in
      human sacrifice and to cloak it in `acceptably' religious
      demands.</p>

      <h3>8.1 Masturbation cure</h3>

      <p>It is commonly accepted that Victorian Britain was deeply
      troubled by sexual matters; and that the paterfamilias was
      seen as an all-powerful figure. Further, women and children
      were seen as the property of the man: to do what the man
      deemed right for himself and/or to serve the man's desires
      and purposes. The treatment of women and children in
      Victorian Britain was barbarous, cruel and beyond the
      comprehension of modern society; child labour and child
      prostitution were commonplace. Sexual hypocrisy was rife.</p>

      <p>In particular, the unwillingness to face sexuality in
      women was seen in the denial/refusal to admit that women were
      capable of feeling sexual pleasure (or at least that one's
      wife was so `unrefined' so to feel) or to experience orgasm;
      equally, the sexual pleasure from masturbation by boys was
      also seen as deeply unhealthy, unclean in the moral sense,
      and impure; it was often called the `solitary vice'.
      Masturbation was seen as a cause of a wide variety of
      illnesses from mental illhealth, epilepsy, alcoholism and a
      host of other ailments; and if that were right then it seemed
      desirable to take any steps to curb this `vice'. Thus, in the
      mid-1800s it was thought that circumcision would help stop
      boys masturbating.</p>

      <p>Whether it was thought that the deprivation of sensation
      and also of the skin comfortably to erect into, and
      masturbate with, was the cure for masturbation, or that that
      it was that the mere act and intense pain of circumcision
      would be a sign of the `inherent dangers' of sex and sexual
      pleasure (certainly the dangers of such expression outside
      the sanctity of marriage) is not clear.</p>

      <p>It seems that Money, writing in 1887 in <i>Treatment of
      Disease in Children</i>, considered that the pain, on-going
      if possible, was desirable:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Whether masturbation is a cause of epilepsy is
          doubted. But there can be no doubt of its injurious
          effect ..... Circumcision should always be practised. It
          may be necessary to make the genital area so sore by
          blistering fluids that pain results from attempts to rub
          the part."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Probably, both strands of thinking were present at the
      same time. What does seem clear is that the effect of
      circumcision on the ability to enjoy sexual activities was
      recognised by the Victorians, as it had been by
      Maimonides.</p>

      <p>The Victorians were well aware of the Jewish circumcision,
      (indeed, in the Christian calendar, there is the Feast of the
      Circumcision of Christ), as well as Muslim circumcision and
      circumcision carried out in other parts of the world such as
      Africa and the Australian aboriginals. Clearly, circumcision
      did not prevent these men from being able to procreate and it
      would appear that it was but a small step to conclude that
      circumcision would have no harmful effects if done on British
      boys. Thus, they espoused an amputation which whilst curbing
      sexual pleasure would not prevent procreation and would, it
      was thought, stop what was seen as the deeply damaging
      `self-abuse' of masturbation and would thereby prevent the
      onset of dreadful illnesses.</p>

      <p>The same masturbation-phobia also drove the introduction
      of routine neonatal circumcision in 19th century United
      States of America (a country where such circumcisions were
      some 85% in the 1970s and which, although the rates are now
      declining especially in the western states, still account for
      more than 50% of boys).</p>

      <p>As Frederick Hodges, the medical historian, has written,
      involuntary circumcision was introduced and enforced in
      America as a way of surgically desensitizing and denuding the
      penis in order to make masturbation theoretically impossible.
      The vast majority of original circumcisionists were, as they
      were in Victorian Britain, Christians who had of course never
      themselves, been circumcised. They knew exactly what the
      effects of circumcision would be. They could well imagine the
      destruction circumcision would cause to sexual sensation and
      function when it was forced on boys and men who had been
      caught masturbating. Adults who had been convicted of
      masturbation were regularly incarcerated in lunatic asylums
      and subjected to castration, circumcision and electric
      shock.</p>

      <p>The medical history of circumcision in the United states
      is discussed by <a href="/library/history/gollaher/">David L.
      Gollaher</a><sup><a href="#n108">108</a></sup> who
      writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "The medical history of circumcision in the United States
          properly begins in 1870. Dr. Lewis A. Sayre published a
          paper in which he sought to show that a range of wellnigh
          miraculous cures were effected by circumcision."<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Other important US doctors who promoted circumcision as an
      anti-masturbatory procedure in the 1870s were Abraham Jacobi
      and M.J. Moses. Dr Jacobi (1830-1919) was the president and
      founder of the American Pediatric Society, the first Chairman
      of the Section on Diseases of Children of the American
      Medical Association, President of the New York State Medical
      Society, President of the New York Academy of Medicine, and
      President of the Association of American Physicians. Both
      Jacobi and Moses claimed that Jews were immune to
      masturbation solely because they were circumcised. They were
      cited as authorities by medical writers for the next few
      decades. Both claimed that nonJews were especially prone to
      masturbation and to the horrible diseases that resulted from
      masturbation solely because they had foreskins. Jacobi
      produced many "studies" to prove this, and to "prove" that
      the male foreskin caused epilepsy, paralysis, malnutrition,
      hysteria, and other nervous disorders.<sup><a
      href="#n109">109</a></sup></p>

      <p>In 1871, Dr. Moses wrote<sup><a
      href="#n110">110</a></sup>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"As an Israelite, I desire to ventilate the subject,
          and, as a physician, have chosen the medium of a medical
          journal, that I may not be trammelled in my expressions,
          as I necessarily would be were I confined to the pages of
          an ordinary paper...I refer to masturbation as one of the
          effects of a long prepuce; not that this vice is entirely
          absent in those who have undergone circumcision, though I
          never saw an instance in a Jewish child of very tender
          years, except as the result of association with children
          whose covered glans have naturally impelled them to the
          habit."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is quite clear from context that the title word
      `Hygienic' had, in the United States of that time as with
      Victorian Britain, a different meaning than it does today. At
      this time, circumcisers used words such as hygiene to denote
      moral hygiene, not personal hygiene. Circumcisers likewise
      used the term sanitary to denote moral purity, and not
      absence of germs or dirt. By manipulating the meaning of
      words in a fashion presaging the "New-Speak" of Orwell's
      classic, 1984, circumcisers pathologized normal functions:
      erotic sensitivity was redefined as "irritation."; orgasm was
      redefined as "convulsions."</p>

      <p>Jonathan Hutchinson, who was President of the Royal
      College of Surgeons of England in 1889, wrote in 1891 a paper
      on circumcision as a preventive of masturbation, in which he
      not only advocated circumcision for the treatment and
      prevention of this "shameful habit", but also proposed
      that</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "&mdash;if public opinion permitted their adoption
          &mdash; measures more radical than circumcision would be
          a true kindness."<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In 1914, Dr. Abraham Wolbarst<sup><a
      href="#n111">111</a></sup> wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"It is generally accepted that irritation derived from
          a tight prepuce may be followed by nervous phenomena,
          among these being convulsions and outbreaks resembling
          epilepsy. It is therefore not at all improbable that in
          many infants who die in convulsions the real cause of
          death is a long or tight prepuce. In a case reported by
          A.H. Baker of Elmira, N.Y., repeated attacks of
          epileptiform convulsions occurred in a boy aged 5. It was
          found that there was an adherent prepuce with marked
          adhesions. After the child was circumcised the
          convulsions ceased and have not since recurred... We
          safely conclude that circumcision is to be regarded as a
          powerful prophylactic against masturbation and other
          reflex neuroses that result from preputial
          irritation."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>8.2 `Hygiene and Prevention'</h3>

      <p>That circumcision was of no effect in preventing
      masturbation became self-evident: circumcised boys have the
      same urge to masturbate as their intact brothers and will do
      so, notwithstanding that for them it will be, as with sexual
      intercourse, a pale shadow of the pleasure that should have
      been theirs by birthright. But the motivations to continue to
      circumcise required the invention by circumcisers of a
      variety of pseudo-medical `rationales' for continuing to
      circumcise: first by claims of cleanliness, then the
      reduction/prevention of diseases such as cancers of the
      cervix and penis to claims that circumcision will reduce the
      incidence of UTIs, AIDS and other sexually transmitted
      diseases. These false claims have been discussed above; but
      the increasingly desperate efforts by circumcisers to find a
      benefit and/or a medical rationale for their mutilation of
      others, as each claimed `benefit' is refuted, leads one to
      ponder at the psycho-pathology of these people involved and
      certainly to wonder at their efforts to read/read with an
      open-mind the range of medical literature which gives the lie
      to their claims.</p>

      <h3>8.3 Modern circumcision - an eye-witness account</h3>

      <p>Although, except for ritual circumcisions, neonatal
      circumcisions have been largely abandoned in Britain, in
      America, where neonatal circumcisions are a lucrative source
      of medical income and where from a peak of nearly 90% of all
      neonate boys to a current figure of some 59%, routine
      neonatal circumcisions are still, in the teeth of medical
      studies, a societal commonplace encouraged by those doctors
      who profit from the fees (typically $200 per neonatal
      circumcision). Marilyn Fayre Milos, an American Registered
      Nurse, whose experiences of witnessing neonatal circumcision
      impelled her to abandon her nursing career and courageously
      to speak out against this barbarity, has written
      movingly<sup><a href="#n112">112</a></sup>. Apart from minor
      differences of technique (the mohel does not employ a probe
      but uses a sharpened finger-nail to rip asunder and then to
      strip fully the glans-preputial adhesions and does not use a
      clamp to crush the foreskin so as to control bleeding before
      amputation) the result is much the same as at a Bris
      Milah.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"We students filed into the newborn nursery to find a
          baby strapped spread-eagle to a plastic board on a
          counter top across the room. he was struggling against
          his restraints -- tugging, whimpering, and then crying
          helplessly. no one was tending the infant, but when I
          asked my instructor if I could comfort him, she said
          `Wait until the doctor gets here'. I wondered how a
          teacher of the healing arts could watch someone suffer
          and not offer assistance. I wondered about the doctor's
          power which could intimidate others from following
          protective instincts. When he did arrive, I immediately
          asked the doctor if I could help the baby. he told me to
          put my finger into the baby's mouth; I did, and the baby
          sucked. I stoked his little head and spoke softly to him.
          he began to relax, and was momentarily quiet.</p>

          <p>"The silence was soon broken by a piercing scream
          &mdash; the baby's reaction to having his penis pinched
          and crushed as the doctor attached the clamp to his
          penis. The shriek intensified when the doctor inserted an
          instrument between the foreskin and the glans, tearing
          the two structures apart.....The baby started shaking his
          head back and forth -- the only part of his body free to
          move -- as the doctor used another clamp to crush the
          foreskin length-wise, where he then cut. This made the
          opening of the foreskin large enough to insert a
          circumcision instrument, the device used to protect the
          glans from being severed during the surgery.</p>

          <p>"The baby began to gasp and choke, breathless from his
          shrill, continuous screams. How could anyone say that
          circumcision is painless when the suffering is so
          obvious? My bottom lip began to quiver, tears filled my
          eyes and spilled over, I found my own sobs difficult to
          contain. How much longer could this go on?</p>

          <p>"During the next stage of surgery, the doctor crushed
          the foreskin against the circumcision instrument and
          finally amputated it. The baby was limp, exhausted,
          spent.</p>

          <p>"I had not been prepared, nothing could have prepared
          me. for this experience. To see a part of this baby's
          penis being cut off -- without an anesthetic -- was
          devastating. But even more shocking was the doctor's
          comment, barely audible several octaves below the
          piercing screams of the baby: `There's no medical reason
          for doing this.' I couldn't believe my own ears, my knees
          became weak, and I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't
          believe that medical professionals, dedicated to helping
          and healing, could inflict such unnecessary pain and
          anguish on innocent babies."</p>

      Cries: It's a Boy, by Victor Schonfeld, which dealt with

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The last but one [circumcision] that I did, the
          parents were telling me that before the circumcision the
          baby was very fractious and was always crying at night
          and very unsettled, and the night after the brit was
          done, the baby spent a quiet night, he's sticking to a
          three-, three-and-a-half, four-hour feeding routine, so
          they were quite delighted it could be done."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Dr. Adrian Lloyd Thomas, Pediatrician (in response to
      being asked about circumcision without anesthesia):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"You can see there a very definite response from the
          baby as soon the forceps are applied to the foreskin. The
          baby is holding his breath, shivering. Infants having an
          operation may actually experience more pain than adults
          do having the same procedure, and the reason for this is
          that the control mechanisms, particularly in the spinal
          cord, which are highly developed to damp down and
          suppress pain in a mature adult nervous system, are not
          so well developed in the small baby. So, the pain signals
          travel through uncontrolled, unsuppressed....I think it
          would be unwise to draw that conclusion [that the baby
          stopped crying because the pain was over]. I'd more
          prefer to think that the experience had been so
          overwhelming that the baby can't...put up a fight
          anymore....My personal feeling as a pediatric anesthetist
          is that it is not ethical to perform circumcisions
          without some form of topical anesthesia."</p>

      <p>Narrator:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"...the British medical consensus is that newborn
          circumcision is not medically warranted, that the baby
          has been made to give up a protective covering of
          erogenous tissue, and that the glans of his penis, an
          internal organ biologically, will now be exposed."</p>

          start facing forwards so it describes a sort of corkscrew
          twist to the left....There is an interweaving of the
          physical mutilation which I've had to live with for
          nearly 50 years as well as the awareness that I have been

      <p>It is hard not to wonder at the effect of childhood
      circumcision on the victim; and at the deep and hidden
      motives driving those who would perpetuate the practice of
      circumcision for other than the treatment of a disease
      process. Thus, Ritter<sup><a href="#n113">113</a></sup>
      writes about the practice of routine neonatal circumcision in
      the USA by doctors, but whose words seem apt to describe all
      those who circumcise:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The worst thing about circumcision is that it
          produces circumcisers. There is a segment of physicians
          who have the psychic compulsion to circumcise so they
          themselves do not feel genitally inferior or
          different."</p>

      <h3>9.1 The Perpetrators</h3>

      <p>In looking at circumcision and the calls for it to
      continue into the 21st century, it is necessary to consider
      the mind-set of those who continue to perform this mutilating
      ritual, and to consider the extent that they suffer from some
      form of psychosexual sickness in their need to mutilate the
      sexual organ of a boy.</p>

      <p>Woodmansey wrote in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in
      1965:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Something must be done to help the parents who show
          such an irrational need .... Consider asking a colleague
          whose job is to help people with their emotional problems
          to try to discover and alleviate the parents' underlying
          difficulties, which not only impel them to demand this
          operation but which, if not adequately dealt with, may
          perpetuate difficulties in the parent-child relationship
          with the risk of later psychiatric illness in the
          child... This important kind of work can and should be
          undertaken by the medical social workers in a general or
          children's hospital, provided that they receive suitable
          psychiatric support."<sup><a
          href="#n114">114</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"But the mohel with whom I had worked countless times
          suddenly handed me the knife. He pointed to my squirming
          son, whose hands and legs were tied to the board. The
          foreskin had been pulled up over the glans of the penis
          and was now protruding through a narrow slit of the
          small, stainless steel clamp....'It's the greatest honor
          a father can have,' he added....There is no greater
          primal anger than that caused by seeing another male in
          carnal contact with your wife, in this case the physical
          intimacy of mother and son. And there is no greater
          primal envy than that caused by looking down at the
          person who was brought into the world specifically to be
          your survivor....The breast provides, but the knife
          protects. It channels the father's natural anger and
          jealousy into one controlled cut. He takes off one small
          part in order to preserve -- and love -- the whole....No
          father should be denied this experience, even
          vicariously, of inflicting upon his child a ritualized
          blow so intense as to make him both shake and recoil."

      <p>Ilene Gelbaum, an American midwife with certifications to
      permit her to perform circumcisions stated: "it really is a
      touching, moving, spine-tingling thing that I participate in
      as a service to the community"<sup><a
      href="#n115">115</a></sup>; one can but speculate what Freud
      might have said about her motivation for, and the
      `spine-tingling' devotion to, such as task.</p>

      <p>The well-known psychological defence mechanisms of denial,
      of rationalisation and of cognitive dissonance would appear
      to be at work in the continuation of the behaviour-patterns
      of circumcisers. `Denial' is the process whereby an
      individual distorts his/her perception of an event so as to
      avoid having to think about it; thus, despite the clear
      medical evidence of the pain of circumcision, many still deny
      that the circumcised infant has pain or any harmful sequelae
      from, and following as a result of, the circumcision. Also of
      note is evidence that a surprising number of American men
      were unaware, at a conscious level, of being circumcised or
      that their penis carried a scar from the amputation.
      Lilienfeld<sup><a href="#n116">116</a></sup> reported that in
      1958 34.4% were unaware of their circumcision status; a
      figure which accorded with that found by Schlossberger<sup><a
      href="#n117">117</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>`Cognitive dissonance' is the process whereby individuals
      seek to maintain harmony between or among various aspects of
      an issue at the cognitive level: <i>Awakenings</i><sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup> observes that circumcised men who
      have complained to doctors about being circumcised, have
      experienced anger from the doctors to whom they have
      spoken.</p>

      <p>As <i>Awakenings</i> observes: "Why anger?" Given the very
      high rate of circumcision in the USA, they comment: "Is it
      perhaps that a doctor cannot allow himself to be sympathetic
      to a male who says that he has been harmed by an act which
      the doctor's own profession has performed for the man's own
      good? Such dissonance may well cause a doctor to lash out in
      anger."</p>

      <p>This might well account for the seeming inability of some
      doctors to listen to the evidence from their own peers which
      undermines their existing prejudices and mind-set: thus an
      article in the <i>New York Times</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup> dealing with circumcision, quotes
      Dr. Terry Hejsle, director of pediatric urology at Columbia
      College of Physicians and Surgeons, on the specialised
      pleasure receptors of the prepuce (as shown by Taylor et al
      in The prepuce: specialized mucosa of the penis and its loss
      to circumcision --op.cit) "How do they know that?" asks
      Hejsle.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "The neuroreceptors are in the glans, not in the hood."
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      This remark says much about Dr. Hejsle; and nothing about the
      structure and function of the prepuce and the mechanisms of
      male sexual pleasure.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>The <i>New York Times</i> article also quotes from a Dr.
      Yehuda Nir (a psychoanalyst who was formerly head of child
      psychiatry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York)
      that</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"he hasn't observed circumcision trauma. `The only
          thing men are concerned about with regard to the penis is
          its size.'"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Again, that says more about Dr Nir, his attitudes and his
      mental processes than about the reality of the harm of
      circumcision; even on his facile level, it is self-evident
      that men often have concerns about their penis and its
      functioning other than that of simple size.</p>

      <p>As <i>Awakenings</i> (op. cit. at n 106) remarks:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"With enough coping mechanisms at his/her disposal,
          the typical circumcised survivor can be comfortably
          insulated from the painful facts and feelings about
          genital mutilation. After examination of the same coping
          mechanisms of the surrounding culture, one finds that the
          majority of those in societies that practice childhood
          genital mutilation remain blind to this maltreatment of
          children....Dr Ervin Staub, psychology professor at the
          University of Massachusetts, who has studied and written
          extensively on the behavior of bystanders, states: `We
          downplay our own reactions and convince ourselves that
          what we initially thought was abusive behavior really
          wasn't that bad after all'. He calls this extremely
          common phenomenon `pluralistic ignorance'."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The person, be he physician or otherwise, who agrees to
      circumcise another is complying with a request to inflict
      pain on that other human being. Where the procedure is
      required by medical necessity, then it will (or ought to be)
      done under anaesthesia and the disease justifies the
      resulting pain and loss. Where it is not for genuine
      therapeutic reasons, then one is reminded of the noteable
      studies by Professor Stanley Milgram at Yale
      University<sup><a href="#n120">120</a></sup> to see how far
      ordinary people would be prepared to go in obeying a command
      to inflict pain on another person. Most subjects obeyed the
      command to inflict electrical shocks (to a confederate who
      unbeknownst to the subject, in reality, received no shock) to
      and beyond a level believed by the subject to represent
      danger to life. Further, Milgram found that a subject could
      be induced through group pressure to inflict greater harm on
      the victim than the subject did when he or she were
      alone.</p>

      <h3>9.2 The Victims</h3>

      <p>It has, however, to be admitted that there is a paucity of
      studies of the psychological effects of male circumcision on
      the victim. Perhaps this is due in large part to an
      unwillingness by doctors who are themselves circumcised
      and/or who have grown up and received their medical education
      in a society, such as America, where routine neonatal
      circumcision has been common, to accept the possibility of
      damage from the procedure; and thus to carry out proper
      studies. Dr Nir's stance would lend weight to that stance;
      and the processes of `denial' and/or `cognitive dissonance'
      operate for all caught up in whatever capacity in this
      mutilation.</p>

      <p>Such work as seems to exist is related to the more general
      effect of childhood experiences on the personality. But there
      has been some work done.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/psych/cansever/">Cansever</a>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Summary. In order to evaluate the psychological
          effects of circumcision, a small study was arranged in
          which twelve children, from average and low socioeconomic
          level, were given Goodenough and DAM test, CAT, Rorschach
          and two sets of stories, prior to the operation and
          following it. The results of the tests showed that
          circumcision, performed around the phallic stage is
          perceived by the child as an act of aggression and
          castration. It has detrimental effects on the child's
          functioning and adaptation, particularly on his ego
          strength. By weakening the controlling and defensive
          mechanisms of the ego, and initiating regression, it
          loosens the previously hidden fears, anxieties, and
          instinctual impulses, and renders a feeling of reality to
          them. What is expressed following the operation is
          primitive, archaic and unsocialized in character. As a
          defensive control and protection against the surge of the
          instinctual forces coming from within and the threats
          coming from outside, the ego of the child seeks safety in
          total withdrawal, this isolates and insulates itself from
          disturbing stimuli. The results of the study raised some
          questions concerning certain psychoanalytic formulations,
          for which further research was suggested."</p>

          adolescents who are subjected to ritual genital
          mutilations has a profound effect upon the brain and
          later behaviors". He continues that this pain "limits and

          mother is truly complicit, as in giving permission for
          unanesthetised surgery (i.e. circumcision) the perception
          of the infant of her culpability and willingness to have
          him harmed is indelibly emplaced. The consequences for

          <p>"309.89 Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [`PTSD'</p>

          <p>"The essential feature of this disorder is the
          development of characteristic symptoms following a
          psychologically distressing event that is outside the
          range of usual human experience (i.e., outside the range
          of such common experience as simple bereavement, chronic
          illness, business losses, and marital conflict). The
          stressor producing this syndrome would be markedly
          stressing to almost anyone, and is usually experienced
          with intense fear, terror and helplessness. The
          characteristic symptoms involve re-experiencing the

      </blockquote>

      <p>The trauma, both physical and mental, of non-therapeutic,
      but especially neonatal, circumcision would suggest that
      victims of circumcision might appropriately be followed up
      for signs of PSTD and other psychological sequelae. Dr
      Goldman, a psychologist, in a timely and thoughtful book
      detailing the psychological damage of circumcision, concludes
      that there is a causal link between circumcision and
      PTSD<sup><a href="#n128">128</a></sup></p>

      <p>Dr Frederick Leboyer has said:<sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup> "No-one is aware of the deep
      implications and life-lasting effect [of circumcision]. The
      torture is experienced in a state of total helplessness which
      makes it even more frightening and unbearable." Further, he
      writes: "All that takes place in the first days of life on
      the emotional level shapes the pattern of all future
      reactions. How could a being aggressed in this way, while
      totally helpless, develop into a relaxed, trusting
      person?'</p>

      <h2><a id="fgm" name="fgm"></a>10. Female Circumcision</h2>

      <p>Female circumcision has been specifically made an offence
      in Britain by the <a
      href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/statutes/pfca85.htm"
       target="_blank">Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act
      1985</a>. Section 1 provides:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Subject to section 2 below , it shall be an offence
          for any person-</p>

          <p>(a) to excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the
          whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or
          clitoris".</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In section 2, after exempting from the ambit of section 1
      operations required for the physical or mental health of the
      girl, the Act in section 2(2) provides:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"(2) In determining for the purposes of this section
          whether an operation is necessary for the mental health
          of a person, no account shall be taken of the effect on
          that person of any belief on the part of that or any
          other person that the operation is required as a matter
          of custom or ritual."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Whilst such legislation might not, strictly, have been
      necessary, in view of the legislation in respect of offences
      against the person and child-protection legislation, it
      introduces a specific prohibition that any non-therapeutic
      interference with the female genitals was an offence,
      notwithstanding cultural/religious pressures.</p>

      <p>In some respects (that is, in the extent of the anatomy
      mutilated), female circumcision differs from male
      circumcision: although it can take the form of the removal
      only of the clitoral hood (the analogue of the male prepuce),
      it typically involves more radical excision such as
      amputation of the clitoris, excision of the labia and
      infibulation. What it shares with its male counterpart is the
      alteration of the genitals and a resulting dysfunction.</p>

      <p>What is instructive is to examine comments and
      rationalisations made to justify female circumcision, quoted
      by Hanny Lightfoot-Klein<sup><a href="#n130">130</a></sup>;
      again, those comments find echo in remarks made by
      circumcised men, and those who would continue the practice of
      non-therapeutic male circumcision, to the point that all that
      is required is to change the gender in the remarks:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"With the older woman there is often the element of:
          `it was done to me, why should it not be done to the
          young girls?' They (parents) do not want her to suffer
          the stigma of being different from other girls. She goes
          through a stage of reappraisal of the situation, and
          comes to accept that what has been done to her is in her
          best interest".</p>

          <p>"Of course, none of us is happy about it, but we can
          live with it, as long as there are no serious medical
          complications."</p>

          <p>"She claims that there was no pain. The only pain she
          recalls was at attempting to pass urine after the
          operation. She says she has had `no problems at all'</p>

          <p>because of her circumcision, and is very happy about
          it. She feels that circumcision is a good practice".</p>

          <p>"She says that she thinks pharaonic circumcision is a
          good practice, and feels she has lost nothing by her own
          circumcision".</p>

      <p>Whilst the Act may not have entirely eliminated female
      circumcision from Britain, it has deprived it of any shred of
      acceptability in the population as a whole. But in so doing,
      it has done a grave disservice to boys, by permitting a
      distinction to be sought between it and its male counterpart
      (with the suggestion that in the male the practice is,
      medical evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, somehow
      acceptable in a way that female circumcision is now not so
      regarded). The Act does however give an answer to those who
      would claim, as it was claimed for female circumcision, that
      male circumcision is so culturally-embedded that a ban would
      be ineffective and ignored; even if the Act has not wholly
      eliminated female circumcision in this country, it has
      provided a sign that such practices are no longer to be
      tolerated in a modern and civilised society.</p>

      <h2><a id="com" name="com"></a>11. Circumcision and the
      Common Law</h2>

      <p>In paragraph 9.1 of the Consultation Paper, the Commission
      says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The leading cases refer only to tattooing,
          ear-piercing and ritual circumcision as exceptions to the
          general rule..... and because the law is clear, statute
          has introduced some controls designed to ensure that most
          of these practices are carried out safely and
          hygienically."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is a wholly misleading statement: the only leading
      case which refers to ritual circumcision is Lord Templeman's,
      arguably obiter, remark in <i>Brown</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n132">132</a></sup> <i>Adesayna</i> can hardly be
      described as a `leading case (and its reference to ritual
      circumcision is clearly obiter). The law appears to have
      introduced no controls in respect of the performance of
      ritual circumcision, let alone any to control the safety and
      hygiene of the procedure.</p>

      <p>The Commission's apparent reliance, for its proposition
      that ritual circumcision is lawful at common law, on the
      cases of <i>Coney</i>,<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup>
      <i>Donovan</i>,<sup><a href="#n134">134</a></sup>
      <i>Adesanya</i>,<sup><a href="#n135">135</a></sup>
      <i>Attorney-General's Reference</i> (No 6 of 80)<sup><a
      href="#n136">136</a></sup> and <i>Brown</i> (op.cit. at n
      147)seems unconvincing. <i>Coney</i>, <i>Donovan</i> and
      <i>A-G's Reference</i> (No 6 of 80) are all silent as to male
      circumcision and simply refer to the existence of certain
      exceptions to the general prohibition on the consensual
      infliction of bodily injury; it is submitted that, on their
      own, they cannot be said to carry forward the Commission's
      proposition as to the lawfulness of ritual circumcision.</p>

      <p>In <i>Adesayna</i>, a case at the Central Criminal Court,
      Judge King-Hamilton QC is reported as having said that the
      potential for serious injury, as part of the ritual
      scarification of the cheeks of two boys by their mother, was
      great because of the danger that the slightest move of the
      head might lead to injury to the eye, in distinction, he
      considered, from the `accepted practices of ear-piercing and
      ritual circumcision'. That these remarks are ill-considered
      is clear, since there is an obvious difference between
      piercing an ear-lobe and amputating a prepuce; and even in
      1974 there were enough indications in the medical literature
      of the harm from neonatal circumcision. If the risk of
      serious injury were indeed properly to be the criterion, then
      the risks of circumcision ought to have been considered,
      since these can extend to loss of all or part of the penis,
      and even death. One has to doubt the extent that argument was
      adduced in respect of circumcision; and thus consider whether
      the remark, which certainly seems obiter, was also per
      incuriam. Indeed, there is an argument that, unattractive as
      the ritual scarification of the body of a child might appear
      (as it clearly did so appear to Judge King-Hamilton QC), it
      is in essence far less unacceptable than ritual circumcision:
      unlike circumcision, it amputates no flesh and causes no loss
      of function.</p>

      <p>Whilst Lord Templeman, in <i>Brown</i>, does list ritual
      circumcision as one of the lawful inflictions of bodily harm,
      he is the only one to do so; although male circumcision was
      touched on in argument by Counsel for some of the Appellants,
      the report does not suggest that the issue of ritual male
      circumcision was fully or properly argued before the House;
      and further it seems appropriate to regard the listing of an
      number of activities which might be said to be lawful as
      unnecessary for the majority view on the question in the
      certificate, and thus obiter. The question concerned the
      issue of consent as a defence to charges arising out of
      sado-masochistic injuries and, as all were agreed, whether
      those injuries arising from that type of behaviour were, or
      were as a matter of policy, to be regarded as being within
      the permitted exceptions.</p>

      <p>There has been a surprising paucity of thoughtful analysis
      of the practice of male circumcision by academic legal
      writers: such mention as there is tends to the brief and
      dogmatic, which is more often than not based on express or
      implicit views of the physical effects.</p>

      <p>Typical of the `brief and dogmatic' school of
      unsubstantiated assertion is Glanville Williams. In
      <i>Consent and Public Policy</i><sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup> he makes the proper objection to
      the passage in <i>R v. Donovan</i>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>" If an act is criminal in the sense of being in
          itself a criminal act, it is plain that it cannot be
          rendered lawful because the person to whom detriment is
          done consents to it. No person can license another to
          commit a crime. So far as the criminal law is concerned,
          therefore, where the act charged is in itself unlawful,
          it can never be necessary to prove absence of consent on
          the part of the person wronged in order to obtain the
          conviction of the wrongdoer. There are, however, many
          acts in themselves harmless and lawful which become
          unlawful only if they are done without the consent of the
          person affected."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Glanville Williams rightly says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          " This passage is open to the obvious objection that it
          is nothing more than a tautology....The Court then
          proceeded to say that, `as a general rule...it is
          unlawful to beat another person..... where the infliction
          of bodily harm is a probable consequence'. For this
          proposition no authority was offered...that [the issue
          before the court] was not well decided merely by an
          unsupported assertion that the act was unlawful."<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>One can only agree with his comments. It is thus
      regrettable that in the next passage, dealing with surgical
      operations, he falls into the very same trap of the
      unsupported assertion that he previously castigated:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"What is to be said of such operations as ritual
          circumcision, or cosmetic skin-grafting? They cause at
          least temporary pain and discomfort, and they are not
          necessary for reasons of health. It would be obviously
          absurd to conclude that they are illegal" (emphasis
          added).</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      Even granting that he appeared to be in considerable
      ignorance of the medical facts which were available even in
      1962 as to the risks and damage of male circumcision, and
      unaware of the potential health benefits of therapeutic
      cosmetic surgery, there is nothing which supports his
      conclusion, far less making it `obviously absurd' to question
      the legality of ritually circumcising an unconsenting baby.
      The best that he can offer is that "Circumcision of Jewish
      infants might be upheld on grounds of religious toleration":
      note, however, the cautious `might' which sits oddly with his
      previous bold and unsupported assertion. Further, Glanville
      Williams, as does the Law Commission, fails to draw the
      necessary and proper distinctions between acts where the
      victim consents for himself, and those where (as in
      circumcision) the assault is assented to by a person other
      than the victim particularly where there is no temporal
      benefit and considerable harm; nor (though here is not the
      place to examine cosmetic surgery) does he or the Commission
      consider the distinction between cosmetic surgery (at least
      on a child as opposed to an adult) for the correction of some
      defect or malfunction of birth and/or the alleviation of the
      effects of injury or previous treatment and the
      ablation/amputation of functional flesh from a healthy
      child.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>A more populist analysis is to be found in Brazier;<sup><a
      href="#n138">138</a></sup> this manages to combine ignorance
      of the medical facts and literature with scant thought to the
      legal issues:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Medical opinion on male circumcision is divided.
          Until recently many doctors regarded it as rarely
          medically indicated. Now it seems circumcision provides
          some protection against venereal disease, at any rate for
          the circumcised man's partner! Male circumcision is a
          matter of medical debate. For Jewish and Muslim parents
          it is an article of faith. The child suffers momentary
          pain. Although medical opinion may not necessarily regard
          it as positively beneficial, it is in no way medically
          harmful if properly performed. The community as a whole
          regards it as a decision for the infant's parents."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Since, as has already been demonstrated, the benefits have
      been shown by medical studies not to exist (even ignoring
      that medical opinion used to believe that there were benefits
      but does not now consider that to be so; even ignoring the
      obvious conflict in her remark that `circumcision provides
      some protection against venereal disease' with `medical
      opinion may not necessarily regard it as positively
      beneficial) and given the error of her assertion, again as
      medically demonstrated, as to the lack of harm, her comments
      are unworthy of serious attention.</p>

      <p>Mr Sebastian Poulter comes closest to a proper analysis of
      male circumcision in academic writing, albeit that his
      writing is flawed by a misunderstanding of the effect of the
      medical studies on pain, risks and inevitable losses and
      damage. He writes<sup><a href="#n139">139</a></sup> that
      tattooing and scarification are not legal, citing for
      scarification <i>Adesanya</i>; and making for both practices
      the point that the child might come to regret the permanent
      body alteration (and the other reasons for the enactment of
      the Tattooing of Minors Act 1969). On policy considerations
      he observes that there might be two objections raised: first
      that "they may occasionally be dangerous when performed by an
      unqualified person, possibly resulting in serious injury...
      or leading to an infection. The second is that where the
      marks are designed to be permanent, they may later come to be
      resented by the child when he has grown up..... and if their
      original purpose later seems to him to be misguided or
      irrelevant." Indeed he quotes, with what seems approval, the
      remark in Adesanya that "You and others who come to this
      country must realise that our laws must be obeyed....[I]t
      cannot be stressed too strongly that any further
      offences...in pursuance of tribal traditions in Nigeria or
      other parts of Africa.... can only result in
      prosecution...... Others have been warned".</p>

      <p>Neither the judge in those remarks, nor indeed Poulter,
      seem to have realised fully the incongruity of condemnation
      of tribal traditions of `Nigeria or other parts of Africa'
      whilst not condemning the, essentially tribal, traditions of
      Judaism and Islam.</p>

      <p>In relation to male circumcision, Poulter writes, at
      paragraph 6.26,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"In this country the circumcision of young boys has
          been a legitimate and accepted surgical operation
          [emphasis added] for very many years. As a routine
          procedure (as opposed to a religious rite) it has
          admittedly declined considerably in popularity during the
          course of this century, from around a third of all boys
          in the 1930s to about 6% today. The current view of the
          medical profession here now generally seems to be that
          there is no rational justification for mass circumcision
          since the risks to health and hygiene of not being
          circumcised are minimal.... In England ritual
          circumcision of male infants is usually performed in the
          case of Jews by mohlim, who are primarily religious
          functionaries albeit highly trained..... Provided the
          proper standards of care are adhered to there is normally
          no danger of harm to the infant, apart from a short
          period of pain in cases where no anaesthetic is used.
          Complications can obviously arise occasionally both from
          the use of an anaesthetic on a very young child and from
          intense and prolonged crying followed by vomiting and
          loss of breathing where it is not used. However, longterm
          harmful consequences appear to be minimal and there are
          greater hazards in performing the operation on adult men.
          Few criticisms of the current situation are ever
          made."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Once again, remove the medical misunderstandings (for
      which see sections 2 and 3 above) and the practice becomes
      starkly abusive in its pain, which pace Poulter and others,
      is not of a short period and not without longterm
      consequences, in its risks as shown by medical studies and in
      those studies' demonstration of deep, inevitable and
      irreparable loss and dysfunction. It is also of interest that
      he sees the practice of male circumcision as a surgical (i.e.
      a medical) procedure; and presumably its exemption from the
      general prohibition on infliction of harm as principally
      flowing from that.</p>

      <p>Indeed, in paragraph 6.27, Poulter rightly observes, as a
      ground for opposing female circumcision, that "a major
      consequence of the operation is that the sexual enjoyment of
      the woman concerned is inevitably gravely impaired in an
      irreversible manner"; the same goes for circumcised males,
      even when the process of denial by the circumcised and the
      circumcisers will not allow them to face that demonstrated
      fact.</p>

      <p>Poulter continues in paragraph 6.28:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The basic right to bodily integrity which everyone
          possesses under the English common law means that any
          interference with this right amounts to an assault or
          battery....The question raised in cases of circumcision,
          excision or infibulation is whether the operation can be
          justified as constituting lawful as opposed to unlawful
          interference with this right...."</p>
        </blockquote>

      <p>Pausing there, it is noteworthy that Poulter groups male
      circumcision with the forms of female genital mutilation.</p>

      <p>He continues:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Although there are no precedents in this field to rely
          on there would appear to be three possible grounds upon
          which a defence of lawfulness might succeed at common
          law. The first is that the procedure is therapeutic. If
          this can be established a parent can validly consent to
          it on behalf of a child who is too young to understand
          what is being done. It would appear unlikely that this
          line of defence could generally succeed other than in
          comparatively rare instances of physical defect or
          abnormality. Second, although the matter is not entirely
          free from doubt, it seems that a parent may equally
          validly authorise a non-therapeutic operation, provided
          it is not actively against his child's interests. This
          would appear to have been the basis upon which the vast
          majority of male infants have been circumcised in this
          country with impunity from time immemorial. There is no
          need under this heading for the parent to establish that
          the operation is positively beneficial for the child,
          merely that he was acting reasonably in authorising it.
          Third, it has been tentatively suggested that a parent
          may even authorise something that is against his child's
          interests if it is compensated by sufficient advantage to
          others and is not seriously detrimental to the child.
          This exception is particularly apposite for establishing
          the legitimacy of transplant operations which directly
          benefit patients in pressing need (e.g. a brother or
          sister). It seems extremely unlikely that it could
          justify the more remote and controversial benefit of
          satisfying a deeply-felt community attachment to
          traditional customs. Moreover, to the extent that female
          circumcision, excision and infibulation are in fact
          mutilations and hence seriously detrimental to the child
          the defence would be ruled out in any case."<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Poulter concludes that male circumcision is lawful; but
      this can only be so if he is correct both as to his analysis
      of the legal right of a parent to assent to an assault to the
      bodily integrity of his child for nontherapeutic grounds
      (i.e. his grounds 2 and 3) and on the correctness of his view
      that male circumcision is harmless and is not in medical
      terms and its consequences to the victim to be equated with
      female circumcision. The correctness of his view of parental
      consent seems open to doubt in view of <i>Gillick</i>;<sup><a
      href="#n140">140</a></sup> but even if he were correct, the
      medical evidence of harm defeats his conclusion for his
      `ground' 2, and the more so for `ground' 3 given his comment
      on the unavailability of the defence for the performance of
      `traditional customs'.</p>

      <p>It is also an interesting observation that Poulter quotes
      in footnote 6 to this paragraph, Granville Williams'
      observation<sup><a href="#n141">141</a></sup> to the effect
      that for `grounds' 2 and 3 parental consent would be
      insufficient if the child was old enough to understand what
      was involved and was either left uninformed or actually
      withheld his consent. Why should it be acceptable to perform
      circumcision on a newborn who is wholly vulnerable, but not
      on an unconsenting older child? Perhaps, the advice of
      Maimonides (op.cit. above) is apposite here:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"This law can only be kept and perpetuated in its
          perfection, if circumcision is performed when the child
          is very young, and this for three good reasons. First, if
          the operation were postponed till the boy had grown up,
          he would perhaps not submit to it. Secondly, the young
          child has not much pain, because the skin is tender, and
          the imagination weak; for grown-up persons are in dread
          and fear of things which they imagine as coming, some
          time before these actually occur. Thirdly, when a child
          is very young, the parents do not think much of him;
          because the image of the child, that leads the parents to
          love him, has not yet taken a firm root in their
          minds."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The Commission's claim, and those academic and other
      writers who claim likewise, that male circumcision `is lawful
      under English common law' (for which not one scrap of
      authority for this proposition is offered) is not supported
      by the Queensland Law Reform Commission ("QLRC") whose <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">research paper</a> of December
      1993<sup><a href="#n142">142</a></sup> on the circumcision of
      male infants made no such claim for the legality at common
      law for male infant circumcision, despite the majority of
      Australian males' being circumcised by the 1960s (and a
      current rate of male circumcision of between 25% and 35%,
      notwithstanding a decline in the numbers of neonatal
      circumcisions since the 1960s). The QLRC states that in
      Queensland a person can consent to what would otherwise be a
      simple assault but consent does not remove criminal
      responsibility for more serious injuries such as wounding.
      They discuss the `medical exemption' in the Criminal Code
      section 282 (which permits surgical operations on a person
      "...if the performance of the operation is reasonable having
      regard to the patient's state at the time and to all the
      circumstances of the case"); and the issue of `real' consent
      as a defence. At page 14 they state that: "In the absence of
      `real' consent, circumcision of male infants would fall
      within the definition of assault under section 245 of the
      Queensland Criminal Code. It might also be an offence
      endangering life or health. A number of criminal offences may
      be committed depending on the circumstances of the case, such
      as..[and the QLRC then discuss offences ranging from causing
      grievous bodily harm to unlawful wounding".</p>

      <p>In concluding, page 17, that "Whether or not circumcision
      would be for the benefit of the particular child and whether
      or not it would be reasonable having regard to the child's
      state at the time and to all the circumstances of the case
      would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis", it is
      clear that the QLRC regard the permissibility of male
      neonatal circumcision on the basis of the `medical exemption'
      rather than some rule of common law and/or that it is a
      free-standing and independent exception to the general
      prohibition of the consensual infliction of injury. The
      limits on parental consent are discussed: at page 38 the QLRC
      states: "The common law operating in Queensland appears to be
      that if a young person is unable , through lack of maturity
      or other disability, to give effective consent to a proposed
      procedure and if the nature of the proposed treatment is
      invasive, irreversible and major surgery and for
      nontherapeutic purposes, then court approval is required
      before such treatment can proceed. The court will not approve
      the treatment unless it is necessary and in the young
      person's best interests [the QLRC cite the High Court of
      Australia in Secretary, Dept. of Health and Community
      Services v. JWB and SMB:<sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup> [
      <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">175 CLR 218</a> Marion's Case]. They comment
      that "The basis of this attitude is the respect which must be
      paid to an individual's bodily integrity....Unless there are
      immediate health benefits to a particular child from
      circumcision, it is unlikely that the procedure itself could
      be considered as therapeutic....The circumcision is invasive,
      irreversible and major. It involves the removal of an
      otherwise healthy organ part. It has serious attendant
      risks....On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions
      of the Queensland Criminal Code, routine circumcision of a
      male infant could be regarded as a criminal act. Further,
      consent by parents to the procedure being performed may be
      invalid in the light of the common law's restrictions on the
      ability of parents to consent to the nontherapeutic treatment
      of children".</p>

      <p>It is clear, however, that the QLRC have misunderstood the
      gravamen of the objection to circumcision by stating that it
      is based on `human rights and preservation of bodily
      integrity grounds'. The objection is not one of `human rights
      and preservation of bodily integrity grounds' simplicter, but
      rather that the resulting severe dysfunction, and the
      associated pain and risks, make the invasion of bodily
      integrity and the breach of a range of the child's human
      rights particularly grave. In suggesting that tribal/cultural
      assimilation might offer a basis for concluding that the
      procedure might still be regarded as beneficial to the child,
      the QLRC make no mention of the inevitable dysfunction that
      results from any circumcision: thus their conclusion as to
      the possible outcome of the application of the principles of
      <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">175 CLR 218</a> Marion's case to infant
      circumcision is defective. What is clear, however, is that
      the QLRC paper of some 41 pages and some 13 pages of
      appendices is, despite its flaws, a more serious attempt to
      examine the issue than the perfunctory treatment of the
      Consultation Paper; and gives no support to a claim of
      legitimacy of nontherapeutic circumcision at common law.</p>

      <h2><a id="oapa" name="oapa"></a>12. Offences Against the
      Person: the current view</h2>

      <p>The Law Commission's difficulties with the law on offences
      against the person must find an echo with practitioners; and
      Lord Lowry, in <i>R v. Brown</i>, at p248C adopts the Law
      Commission's words from the Commission's Consultation Paper
      No 122 (at paragraph 7.4) as to the untidy state of the law
      flowing from the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
      Whilst, for much of the time, the unclarity of the law does
      not cause great practical difficulties, the lack of a
      coherent framework can, for example as with the activities
      the subject of R v. Brown, give rise to confusion. In the
      Consultation Paper, the Law Commission deals with a range of
      behaviour where it might be said that consent renders, or
      might be said to render, the application of force to another
      as lawful: these range from activities which most would
      regard as wholly proper, such as medical treatment, through
      sports of various forms to the bizarre and often distasteful
      such as genital piercing and sadomasochistic behaviour.</p>

      <p>The current view is found expressed in <i>Collins v.
      Wilcock</i><sup><a href="#n144">144</a></sup> where Robert
      Goff LJ said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"the fundamental principle, plain and incontestable,
          is that every person's body is inviolate. It has long
          been established that any touching of another person,
          however slight, may amount to a battery. So Holt CJ held
          in <i>Cole v. Turner</i> (1704) 6 Mod. 149 that `the
          least touching of another in anger is a battery.' The
          breadth of the principle reflects the fundamental nature
          of the interest so protected. As Blackstone wrote in his
          Commentaries, 17th ed. (1830) vol. 3, p 120: `the law
          cannot draw the line between different degrees of
          violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and
          lowest stage of it; every man's person being sacred, and
          no other having a right to meddle with it, in any the
          slightest manner.' The effect is that everybody is
          protected not only against physical injury but against
          any form of physical molestation. But so widely drawn a
          principle must inevitably be subject to exceptions. For
          example, children may be subjected to reasonable
          punishment; people may be subjected to the lawful
          exercise of the power of arrest and reasonable force may
          be used in selfdefence or for the prevention of crime.
          But, apart from these special instances where the control
          or constraint is lawful, a broader exception has been
          created to allow for the exigencies of everyday life.
          Generally speaking, consent is a defence to battery; and
          most of the physical contacts of ordinary life are not
          actionable because they are impliedly consented to by all
          who move in society and so expose themselves to the risk
          of bodily contact. So nobody can complain of the jostling
          which is inevitable from his presence in, for example, a
          supermarket, an underground station or a busy
          street....Although such cases are regarded as examples of
          implied consent, it is more common nowadays to treat them
          as falling within a general exception embracing all
          physical contact which is generally acceptable in the
          ordinary conduct of daily life. We observe that, although
          in the past it has sometimes been stated that a battery
          is only committed where the action is `angry, revengeful,
          rude or insolent' (see Hawkins, <i>Pleas of the
          Crown</i>, 8th ed. (1824), vol 1, c15, section 2), we
          think that nowadays it is more realistic, and indeed more
          accurate, to state the broad underlying principle,
          subject to the broad exception."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Lord Lane CJ in <i>Attorney-General's Reference</i> (No 6
      of 80) said at page 718 that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"We think that it can be taken as a starting point
          that it is an essential element of an assault that the
          act is done contrary to the will and without the consent
          of the victim; and doubtless for this reason that the
          burden lies on the prosecution to negative consent.
          Ordinarily, then, if the victim consents, the assailant
          is not guilty."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>But, at page 719, Lord Lane then spoke of a need for a
      "partly new approach":</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The answer to this question [at what point does the
          public interest require the court to hold otherwise?] in
          our judgment, is that it is not in the public interest
          that people should try to cause, or should cause, each
          other actual bodily harm for no good reason. Minor
          struggles are another matter. So, in our judgment, it is
          immaterial whether the act occurs in private or public;
          it is an assault if actual bodily harm is intended and/or
          is caused. This means that most fights will be unlawful
          regardless of consent. Nothing which we have said is
          intended to cast doubt upon the accepted legality of
          properly conducted games and sports, lawful chastisement
          or correction, reasonable surgical interference,
          dangerous exhibitions, etc. These apparent exceptions can
          be justified as involving the exercise of a legal right,
          in the case of chastisement or correction, or as needed
          in the public interest, in the other cases." As Lord
          Lowry put it in <i>R v. Brown</i> at p254D, when
          commenting on this passage, Lord Lane's proposition was
          "that it was not in the public interest that people
          should try to cause, or should cause, each other actual
          bodily harm for no good reason and that it is an assault
          if actual bodily harm is caused (except for good
          reason)."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As Lord Lowry made it clear in <i>Brown</i>, at p255C,
      Lord Lane's words were intended, as Lord Lane himself made
      clear in the Court of Appeal in the <i>Brown</i> case [1992
      QB 491, 500] to be of general application and not to some
      special factual situation.</p>

      <p>There is nothing in these extracts to give any comfort to
      circumcisers: all assaults which inflict actual bodily harm
      are illegal unless they form one of the categories of
      exception which were and continue to be regarded as such.</p>

      <h3>12.1 R v. Brown</h3>

      <p>Despite some earlier authority that consent could afford a
      defence to the infliction of injuries, the majority in
      <i>Brown</i> held that, certain exceptions aside, consent
      would not operate in law to excuse the infliction of injuries
      of actual bodily harm, or higher.</p>

      <p>In considering the certified question, the majority were
      clearly affected by their personal repulsion at the
      activities of the Appellants; thus it is difficult to find a
      rational basis for a decision which would, seemingly, permit
      genital piercing for reasons of vanity and perceived cosmetic
      reasons but not the self-same act when done to satisfy the
      sexual passions of the actor and the wholly- consenting and
      more than willing recipient. Some of the alleged ill-effects
      of sado-masochistic acts, see for example Lord Templeman at
      p. 236B-F are as applicable to cosmetic genital piercings and
      also to ritual circumcisions (especially those performed by
      laymen in ordinary premises or houses).</p>

      <p>Lord Templeman in <i>Brown</i> at p231D says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"In some circumstances violence is not punishable
          under the criminal law. When no actual bodily harm is
          caused, the consent of the person affected precludes him
          from complaining. There can be no conviction for the
          summary offence of common assault if the victim has
          consented to the assault. Even when violence is
          intentionally inflicted and results in actual bodily
          harm, wounding or serious bodily harm the accused is
          entitled to be acquitted if the injury was a foreseeable
          incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured
          was participating. Surgery involves intentional violence
          resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm but
          surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities carried on
          with the consent by or on behalf of the injured person
          have been accepted as lawful notwithstanding that they
          involve actual bodily harm. Ritual circumcision,
          tattooing, ear-piercing and violent sports including
          boxing are lawful activities."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As Lord Templeman observed, at p231F, some activities
      which were once thought of as legal, ceased to be regarded as
      such: "In earlier days some other forms of violence were
      lawful and when they ceased to be lawful they were tolerated
      until well into the 19th century. Duelling and fighting were
      at first lawful and then tolerated provided the protagonists
      were voluntary participants".</p>

      <p>Despite Lord Templeman's comments as to what he describes
      as `lawful activities', which are in their enumeration
      arguably obiter, it is clear that the class of force which
      might be applied, notwithstanding the level of injury
      inflicted or risked, is not static: changes in society and
      its culture, appreciation of the consequences of an activity
      and/or of its resulting harm would all call for a
      re-examination of the appropriateness of the continuation of
      the exemption hitherto assumed to apply to a particular
      activity.</p>

      <p>Lord Jauncey's list of permissible exceptions to the
      general rule prohibiting assaults which inflicted bodily harm
      was rather more limited than that of Lord Templeman: at p
      242, Lord Jauncey, discussing <i>R v. Donovan</i> [1934]2 KB
      498, says that Swift J considered the exceptions to the
      general rule that an act likely or intended to cause bodily
      harm is an unlawful act: such exceptions included:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"friendly contests with cudgels, foils or wrestling
          which were capable of causing bodily harm, rough and
          undisciplined sports or play where there was no anger and
          no intention to cause bodily harm and reasonable
          chastisement by a parent or a person in loco parentis. He
          might also have added necessary surgery."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Later, Lord Jauncey, at p244H to 245A, said that the line
      to be drawn between those acts where the victim's consent
      would provide a defence and those where it would not lay
      between common assaults and assaults occasioning actual
      bodily harm within section 47 of the Offences Against the
      Person Act, or an offence under section 20 of that Act,
      "unless the circumstances fall within one of the wellknown
      exceptions such as organised sporting contests and games,
      parental chastisement or reasonable surgery."</p>

      <p>According to the majority view, circumcision would,
      notwithstanding consent, be unlawful unless it formed a
      current part of the group of exceptions to the general
      principle.</p>

      <p>Lord Mustill, whilst dissenting on the answer to the
      certified question and adopting a somewhat different approach
      to the majority, found himself forced to look empirically at
      certain situations where injury was caused. He found himself
      unable to maintain the `intellectually neat' method, as being
      too simple, at p258G to 259C, describing a spectrum of force
      at some point on which "consent ordinarily ceases to be an
      answer to a prosecution", and conducted an analysis of the
      activities where consent might operate to excuse the actor.
      Non-therapeutic male circumcision is not raised by him as one
      of those categories; and in the course of that examination,
      at p 261C, Lord Mustill makes the point that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Nor has it been questioned on the argument of the
          present appeal that someone who inflicts serious harm,
          because (for example) he is inspired by a belief in the
          efficacy of a pseudo-medical treatment, or acts in
          conformity with some extreme religious tenet, is guilty
          of an offence notwithstanding that he is inspired only by
          a desire to do the best he can for the recipient".</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>These words of Lord Mustill, in the light of the severe
      damage caused by male circumcision demonstrated by the
      medical literature, seem wholly apposite to, and supportive
      of a prosecution of, non-therapeutic circumcision.</p>

      <h2><a id="kids" name="kids"></a>13. Child Protection</h2>

      <p>Whatever might have been the position under common law and
      even if (which, in terms of an independent, freestanding
      exemption from the general rule is very far from clear) male
      circumcision was in earlier days lawful at common law, it is
      necessary to consider whether that position survives to-day,
      given that circumcision involves the application of force to
      the victim which would found an assault. Equally, since it
      involves the amputation of the prepuce, it encompasses a
      wound for section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act,
      1861, and, it is suggested in the light of current medical
      knowledge, constitutes `grievous bodily harm' for the
      purposes of that Act. The lawfulness of its continuation
      must, at the least as is confirmed by the Commission's wish
      to place the issue (as it is put) beyond doubt, be highly
      questionable.</p>

      <p>Although the Commission has chosen to discuss
      circumcision, and in particular ritual circumcision, as part
      of the role of consent in the criminal law, the reality is
      that the victim of ritual or routine infant circumcision
      never gives his consent; indeed his consent is never sought
      since, ex hypothesi, he is too young even to speak. The
      procedure ought, thus, to be considered within the general
      framework of assent on behalf of another, and within the
      limits on that process of assent. The self-authorising
      `assent' which is given is a far cry from consent in the
      strict sense; and is as rational a stance as allowing a
      person, in retaliation for some slight or other harm, to
      authorise himself to kill, or maim or seriously injure the
      person who has offended him.</p>

      <p>In section 1(1) Children and Young Persons Act 1933,
      quoted in note 19 to paragraph 11.8 of the Consultation
      Paper, a person who `wilfully assaults' a child or `causes or
      procures him to be assaulted..... in a manner likely to cause
      him unnecessary suffering or injury to health' (emphasis
      added) shall commit an offence.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to see how this provision does not apply
      to any non-therapeutic male circumcision: the act is done
      intentionally and thus wilfully; it causes unnecessary
      suffering and injures the full and healthy sexual functioning
      of the penis.</p>

      <p>It is accepted that there appears to be no reported case
      where a prosecution has been mounted under this section in
      relation to a circumcision, but that may owe more to an
      untutored perception of the reality of the harm caused and a
      reluctance by victims to complain at something done in early
      infancy, not least when its performance had religious
      overtones.</p>

      <h3>13.1 Paramouncy of welfare of child</h3>

      <p>The origins of the protection of the child go back to
      early days; and its modern expression in this century
      reflects that tradition, as well as a more enlightened view
      as to children, their needs and vulnerabilities; and is given
      express protection by statute.</p>

      <p>In <i>Re Z</i> (a minor) (freedom of publication)<sup><a
      href="#n145">145</a></sup> the historical nature of the
      court's jurisdiction was discussed and the exercise of that
      jurisdiction considered. As the headnote has it:</p>

      <p>"Held (1) Although the wardship or inherent jurisdiction
      of the court to protect minors whose interests were at risk
      of harm was in theory unlimited, in practice the court would
      decline to exercise those powers where for example the
      freedom of publication was the prevailing interest and the
      material to be published was only indirectly referable to the
      child. The court would however exercise that jurisdiction
      where the material to be published was directed at the child
      or to an aspect of the child's upbringing by his parents or
      others who cared for him in circumstances where that
      publicity was inimicable to his welfare. In that situation,
      the central issue before the court related to the manner of
      the child's upbringing and, in accordance with s 1(1)a of the
      <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/"
      target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a> [Section 1(1), so far
      as material, provides: When a court determines any question
      with respect to(a) the upbringing of a child, the child's
      welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration], the
      child's welfare was the court's paramount consideration and
      prevailed over the interest in the freedom of publication
      (see p 977 d to p 978 c, p 985 j and p 986 h j, post); <i>Re
      X</i> (a minor) (wardship: restriction on publication) [1975]
      1 All ER 697, R v Central Independent Television plc [1994] 3
      All ER 641, X CC v A [1985] 1 All ER 53 and Re W (a minor)
      (wardship: freedom of publication) [1992] 1 All ER 794
      applied.</p>

      <p>"(2) The disclosure by a parent of confidential
      information relating to a child was an exercise of parental
      responsibility within the meaning of s 3(1)b of the 1989 Act
      which the court was empowered to restrain by means of a
      prohibited steps order under s 8 of the Act. In considering
      whether certain steps should by taken by a parent in meeting
      his parental responsibility the court was determining a
      question with respect to the upbringing of the child and, as
      such, s1(1) of the 1989 Act applied to make the welfare of
      the child the court's paramount consideration. The court was
      therefore under a duty to exercise its own judgment as to
      where the child's welfare lay and could refuse to permit a
      parent's exercise of parental responsibility even though it
      was bona fide and reasonable if it was contrary to the
      child's best interests (see p 979 j, p 980 d f, p 981 e, p
      983 d, p 984 b, p 985 j and p 986 j to p 987 a, post).</p>

      <p>"3) In the circumstances, the mother's placement of the
      child at the institute was a proper discharge of her parental
      responsibility to secure her child's medical and educational
      advancement and her decision to waive the confidentiality
      which the child would otherwise enjoy in respect of those
      matters and to permit her to appear in the documentary was
      clearly an exercise of that responsibility. In being asked to
      decide whether the child should take part in the programme
      the court was determining a question with respect to her
      upbringing and, accordingly, s1 of the 1989 Act applied to
      make the child's welfare the paramount consideration. On that
      approach, the judge was correct in his conclusion that,
      notwithstanding the fundamental importance of the freedom of
      publication of information, the welfare of the child would be
      harmed and not advanced by her participation in the making
      and publication of the programme and that she should continue
      to enjoy the protection against publicity which the
      injunctions gave her. It followed that the appeal would be
      dismissed (see p 980 e, p 981 d, p984 f g, p 985 g to j and p
      987 a b, post)."</p>

      <p>Ward LJ in his judgment has a helpful review of the
      protective jurisdiction of the courts in the course of which
      he gives what he describes as a test for the exercise of
      discretion. It is clear that he sees two situations: one
      where the upbringing of a child is concerned, where statute
      requires that the interests of the child are paramount; and
      situations concerning the welfare of the child where the
      child's interests might (but not `must') have to be
      subordinated to over-riding interests.</p>

      <p>"2. When welfare dominates the decision</p>

      <p>The child's welfare shall be the court's paramount
      consideration when the court determines any question with
      respect to the upbringing of the child: s1(1) of the 1989
      Act. That means:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"' When all the relevant facts, relationships, claims
          and wishes of parents, risks, choices and other
          circumstances are taken into account and weighed, the
          course to be followed will be that which is most in the
          interests of the child's welfare'" (See J v C [1969] 1
          All ER 788 at 821, [1970] AC 668 at 710-711 per Lord
          MacDermott.)</p>

          <p>"....It is not always not easy to decide when a
          question of upbringing is being determined.</p>

          <p>"....In my judgment a question of upbringing is
          determined whenever the central issue before the court is
          one which relates to how the child is being reared. If
          the matter before the court requires the determination of
          any question which is to be characterised as one with
          respect to the upbringing of the child, then the child's
          welfare is the court's paramount consideration and
          welfare prevails over the freedom for publication."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The question as to the culture, religion or ethos in which
      the child is to live and within which to grow, as well as the
      alteration of child's body, is clearly an issue of the
      `upbringing' of that child and as such firmly within s. 1 of
      the <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/"
      target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a>, (and thus the child's
      interests are of paramount consideration); but even if these
      matters were to be regarded as simply `welfare', there would
      still have to be a balancing of competing claims (and a
      balancing which would have to have regard to the requirements
      that expression of freedoms find proper limits when they harm
      or deprive others of their freedoms).</p>

      <p>As Lord Scarman says in <i>Gillick v West Norfolk and
      Wisbech Area Health Authority</i> [1985] <a
      href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/cases/853_0402.htm"

          protection of the person and property of the child.</p>

          <p>"Giving consent to medical treatment of a child is a
          clear incident of parental responsibility arising from
          the duty to protect the child. Arranging for education
          commensurate with the child's intellectual needs and
          abilities is a further incident of the parental
          responsibility which arises from the duty of the parent
          to secure the child's education."</p>

      <h3>13.2 Children Act 1989</h3>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/"
      target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a> is the current
      statutory mechanism for, and expression of, the need to give
      full protection to the interests of this vulnerable group in
      society; and provides in section 1 that the welfare of the
      child is paramount:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"When a court determines any question with respect to

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>13.3 Parental consent</h3>

      <p>Although capacity to consent receives some attention in
      the Consultation Paper, and the circumstances when it might
      be invalid and/or vitiated discussed, the question of consent
      by a person with capacity to consent for a person under
      disability really only rises in the Consultation Paper in
      relation to medical treatment and, in paragraph 11.4 is
      touched on in respect of the issue of lawful correction. Yet
      the very nature of ritual circumcision is that it is
      performed on a child either shortly after birth, or at a time
      before puberty; and the `consent' is given, since the victim
      will legally lack the capacity to give his own consent, by
      another person. It is submitted that Professor David Feldman,
      whose response to the first consultation paper is touched on
      at paragraph 3.25 of the Consultation Paper is correct when
      he is quoted as suggesting that "a parent's consent to the
      ritual, non-therapeutic, circumcision of a child may amount
      to a form of inhuman treatment contained in Article 3 [of the
      European Convention on Human Rights]". But it is submitted
      that he is wrong, both in domestic and international law,
      that "it was assumed that the parent's consent to the
      practice will generally be sufficient to prevent the
      circumcision from constituting a criminal act". (See also the
      discussion of the position in Queensland[146 and below).</p>

      <h4>13.3.1 Medical treatment generally</h4>

      <p>At paragraph 8.23, the Commission touches on the issue
      that the treatment be for the patient's benefit, remarking
      that "this is a requirement that needs very careful
      consideration" and citing Denning LJ as he then was in
      <i>Bravery v Bravery</i><sup><a href="#n147">147</a></sup>
      that the medical exemption did not extend to treatment
      carried out with "consent but without just cause and
      excuse".</p>

      <p>The Commission's own stance is far from clear here but
      would appear to be that there should be no need to
      demonstrate that the operation was, in order to enjoy the
      'medical exemption' from criminal liability, in the patient's
      best interest. In paragraphs 8.31 - 8.48, certain areas of
      medical intervention are discussed, such as abortion, sex
      reassignment and clinical trials, but the question is here
      and elsewhere ducked as to whether there might, or ought to,
      be circumstances when the clear lack of benefit to the
      patient vitiates any apparent consent given by a proxy and
      renders the treatment criminal.</p>

      <p>There are clearly issues of public policy here which
      deserved, but do not receive, discussion in the context of
      the Consultation Paper. There can be little doubt that a
      doctor who performs an operation on a patient, particularly
      one involving significant risk and inevitable loss of
      function, without any therapeutic benefit rightly risks a
      civil claim for damages as well as stricture from his
      professional body.</p>

      <p>Further, is it so unreasonable to demand that before he
      enjoys the protection of the exemption from the ordinary
      provisions of the criminal law, the doctor be able to show
      that there was at least an arguable claim that his procedure
      had some benefit? Certainly the lack of such a benefit, when
      the nature of the doctor-patient relationship of trust and
      the need for the consent to have some basis of prior
      information (as to the need for, the risks, and possible
      outcome, of the operation together with some discussion as
      appropriate of other treatments), might well be a factor when
      considering the legality of medical treatment.</p>

      <p>Even if the Commission's view is appropriate in relation
      to the treatment of adults, whose maturity and ability to
      balance risks against perceived benefits (even benefits which
      are not medical in the strict use of that term) might justify
      it, it is far from being either reasonable or indeed in line
      with current ideas of parental duties, the obligations of
      child-protection and child welfare.</p>

      <p>Quite apart from the provisions of child-protection
      legislation touched on above, where consent is sought from a
      parent for the medical treatment of a child there is, quite
      apart from any requirement of medical ethics and good
      practice, a growing awareness of, and a body of statute and
      case law supporting the proposition that there is, a need to
      demonstrate that the treatment is in the child's best
      interest (or, at least, to put it at its lowest, that the
      treatment is not inimical to the child's interests and
      welfare).</p>

      <p>Where the child is suffering from a disease process then
      the benefit for the child itself from appropriate medical
      treatment will not be difficult to find; where healthy and
      highly important flesh is amputated from the healthy organ
      (with resulting grave dysfunction) of a healthy child for no
      reason than ritual then the onus is on those who would
      conduct this mutilation to justify their action against the
      background of the general law, and to demonstrate that their
      actions are lawful, that the mutilation is in the best
      interests of the child and that it does not expose him to
      `unnecessary suffering or injury to health'.</p>

      <p>The proposals for medical treatment set out at paragraph
      8.50 et seq of the Consultation Paper, and in particular
      paragraph 8.50(2), would appear to exclude doctors who
      perform male non-therapeutic circumcisions from enjoying the
      `medical exemption': it would fit none of the categories of
      medical treatment set out in paragraph 8.50(2)(b). Thus the
      doctor who performed a nontherapeutic circumcision would
      appear to be as vulnerable to criminal charges as a mohel or
      other lay circumciser.</p>

      <p>Even if there is no strict requirement in general terms
      for consent under English law for medical treatment to be on
      the basis of fully informed consent, as contrasted with the
      position in other jurisdictions, nor that there be a general
      need to demonstrate the benefit to the patient, the tendency
      is for consent to be more informed than in earlier days, and
      for benefit to be sought: it would be bizarre if medical
      treatment should, whether as a result of developments in the
      law or otherwise, be more protective than the protection
      afforded to a child who is seen as a candidate for ritual
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4>13.3.2 The Australian view</h4>

      <p>In Consent to Medical treatment of Young People, (op.cit
      at note 161) the Queensland Law Reform Commission (`QLRC')
      discuses issues which are central to male child circumcision,
      but ignored wholly by the Commission in the Consultation
      Paper. They suggest that `health-care' for an adult be:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"....any treatment, service or procedure-</p>

          <p>(a) to maintain, diagnose or treat the adult's
          physical</p>

          <p>or mental condition; and</p>

          <p>(b) carried out by, or under the supervision of, a
          health care provider";</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      and they suggest that such a definition be used for
      considering the treatment of children. The QLRC remark that
      in British Colombia, Canada, in section 16(1) Infants Act
      1992 health care is defined as meaning `anything that is done
      for a therapeutic, preventive, palliative, diagnostic,
      cosmetic or other health related purpose'.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>It is clear that the Law Commission in the Consultation
      Paper have assumed that parents have a right under English
      law (purportedly unlimited, it would seem) to consent to the
      genital mutilation of their male children, particularly for
      ritual reasons; in so assuming, the Law Commission harks back
      to the standards of Victorian Britain and its erroneous view
      that a father enjoyed what were in effect almost unlimited
      rights over his children; and this view is depressingly
      familiar to those who read the contributions from lay
      American parents in the Internet discussions on neonatal
      circumcision where it is frequently stated that parents have
      the unfettered right to authorise circumcision of their
      neonate boys.</p>

      <p>In those circumstances, a brief reminder of the correct
      legal position would appear to be apposite. As the QLRC
      states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The common law does not confer upon parents rights
          over their children....However, it does impose certain
          duties upon parents relating to the maintenance and
          support of their children.</p>

          <p>"The position at common law is that parents are the
          natural guardians and custodians of their child and as
          such have various duties, powers and responsibilities in
          relation to the child, including the power to consent to
          medical treatment on behalf of the child....In Secretary,
          Dept. of Health and Community Services v. JWB and SMB:
          1992 175 CLR 218 [Marion's case] at 278, Justice Brennan
          has described the parental power as follows:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><small>"The responsibilities and powers of parents
              extend to the physical, mental, moral, educational
              and general welfare of the child....They extend to
              every aspect of the child's life. Limits on parental
              authority are imposed by the operation of the general
              law, by statutory limitations or by the independence
              which children are entitled to assert, without
              extra-familial pressure, as they mature. Within these
              limits, the parents' responsibilities and powers may
              be exercised for what they see as the welfare of
              their children.'"</small></p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The QLRC continue with the observation by Justice McHugh
      in <i>Marion's case</i>, that if as part of such parental
      obligations, "parents were under a specific duty to provide
      medical treatment for their children, then the necessary
      corollary would be a power of parents to consent to medical
      treatment as deriving from that duty; but in common law there
      appears to be no such duty on parents (perhaps because of the
      then nature of medical treatment, and the status of doctors,
      in previous centuries when the common law was developing)."
      Despite legislation making it an offence, in certain
      circumstances, to neglect to provide medical treatment,
      Justice McHugh concluded that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"[N]othing in the terms of this legislation nor in the
          implied duties which they impose give any ground for
          concluding that parents have a general power to consent
          to the medical treatment of their children. None of this
          legislation , for example, provides, even by implication,
          a duty to provide cosmetic surgery or treatment. At most,
          the legislation imposes a duty on parents not to neglect
          to provide necessary medical treatment for their
          child."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The QLRC discusses the several limitations on a parent's
      power to consent to the treatment of children, thus:</p>

      <p>- No right to absolute control.</p>

      <p>The perceived right of control, of the father, in the 19th
      and early 20th centuries has been severely diminished over
      the last 150 years. Thus, in addition to child protection
      legislation, there has been an increasing recognition of the
      child as an individual in its own right and, as noted in
      Marion's case, "The overriding criterion of the child's best
      interest is itself a limit on parental power"; a view which
      finds support in <i>Gillick's</i> case. Justice McHugh, in <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">175 CLR 218</a> Marion's case, concluded
      that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Modern case law makes it impossible, therefore, to
          assert that parents have a natural right of almost
          absolute control over the person, education, conduct and
          property of their children. Consequently, the power of
          parents to consent to medical treatment and surgical
          procedures in respect of their children can no longer be
          regarded as existing as an incident or corollary of such
          a right."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>- The power must be exercised in the best interests of the
      child.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"A parent has no authority to consent to the medical
          treatment of his or her child unless it is in the best
          interests of the child. This is because implicit in
          parental consent is understood to be the determination of
          what is best for the welfare of the child [ <a
          href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
           target="_blank">175 CLR 218</a> Marion's case at p240].
          If a parent purports to consent to a treatment which is
          not in the best interests of the child, the consent is of
          no effect and any person acting on such consent would be
          guilty of assault if any physical interference is
          involved. Notably, what is in the best interests of a
          child is a matter to be determined objectively" (emphasis
          added).</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>- The power is exercised in the course of a fiduciary
      relationship.</p>

      <p>Fiduciary relationships have been described as those of
      trust and confidence. Justice Mason in <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/156clr41.html"
       target="_blank">Hospital Products Ltd v. United States
      Surgical Corporation</a><sup><a
      href="#n148">148</a></sup>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on
          behalf of or in the interests of another person in the
          exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the
          interests of that other person in a legal or practical
          sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore
          one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to
          exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that
          other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by
          the fiduciary of his person."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Further:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"It is partly because the fiduciary's exercise of the
          power or discretion can adversely affect the interests of
          the person to whom the duty is owed and because the
          latter is at the mercy of the former that the fiduciary
          comes under a duty to exercise his power or discretion in
          the interests of the person to whom it is owed."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Where there is, or might be, conflict between interests of
      the parent and those of the child, Justice McHugh observed,
      in Marion's case:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"No doubt in most cases of medical treatment or
          surgery, no conflict will arise between the interests of
          the parents and those of the child. In other cases , the
          risk of conflict may be so slight or theoretical that it
          can be disregarded. but in some cases&mdash;and claims
          that an abortion or sterilisation is in the best
          interests of a child are likely to be among them&mdash;a
          conflict between the interests of the parents and the
          child may arise. In such a case, the application of
          established and fundamental principle will deny the right
          of the parents to consent to the operation or treatment.
          If an operation or treatment is to be performed or
          carried out in such a case, only a court of general
          jurisdiction exercising the parens patriae
          jurisdiction.....can authorise the operation or
          treatment."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As the QLRC properly concludes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"It might be asserted that what is in the parents' or
          family's best interests would automatically be in the
          child's best interests. This does not always follow --in
          all cases the best interests of the young person must be
          considered and not merely assumed."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The position in Queensland (and thus, since Marion's case
      was a High Court decision, in Australia as a whole) is that
      the best interests of the child must be foundation for any
      decision in relation to that child; and that the test, it is
      suggested, an objective one. Health care treatment, that is
      an operation or treatment which is required for therapeutic
      reasons, will ordinarily be care to which parents can
      consent; as containing, having balanced the therapeutic
      benefit against the risks, clear and objective evidence of
      being in the child's best interests. Non-therapeutic
      procedures cannot contain such clear and objective evidence
      and/or the situation is one where there is a conflict or risk
      of conflict between the competing interests of parents and
      child; and thus the authority of the court must be sought if
      the procedure is to be carried out. Further, it is clear that
      each case must be considered on an individual basis and the
      position of each child decided on a case-by-case
      consideration, rather than any blanket condonation either
      generally or, more offensively, to a particular group, for a
      particular practice. The test to be applied, as to whether
      court authority is required is, as indicated by Marion's
      case, that the non-therapeutic procedure involves:</p>

      <p>- Invasive, irreversible and major surgery.</p>

      <p>- Significant risk of making the wrong decision either as
      to a child's present or future capacity to consent or about
      what are the best interests of a child who cannot consent</p>

      <p>- Consequences of a wrong decision which are particularly
      grave.</p>

      <p>As the QLRC made clear in its paper on infant male
      circumcision, non-therapeutic circumcision meets those
      criteria for referral to the court for approval.</p>

      <h4>13.3.3 The American view</h4>

      <p>As regards the United States of America, which are common
      law jurisdictions, Dr R Van Howe (op. cit. at n8), wrote in
      respect of the legal position as regards parental consent in
      the United States of America:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Re Phillip B.<sup><a href="#n149">149</a></sup>
          The California Court of Appeal ruled that parental
          autonomy is not absolute. In Little v Little a 14 year
          old mentally incompetent but otherwise perfectly healthy,
          daughter applied (through a guardian ad litem ) for an
          order authorizing her mother to consent to the removal of
          a kidney from the her body, for the purpose of
          transplanting the kidney into her brother who was
          suffering from endstage renal disease. A Texas Court of
          Appeal said `No'. `Significantly, however, for our
          purposes, this power of parents ...to consent to surgical
          intrusions upon the person of the minor...is limited to
          the power to consent to medical treatment.'<sup><a
          href="#n150">150</a></sup> <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>
          defines medical treatment as `a broad term covering all
          steps taken to effect a cure of any injury or disease:
          the word including examination and diagnosis as well as
          application of remedies.'<sup><a
          href="#n151">151</a></sup> To date, all courts have held
          that surgical removal of any normal healthy,
          non-diseased, uninjured part of the body is not
          `treatment.'</p>

          <p>"In a similar transplantation case, a Louisiana Court
          of Appeal ruled that surgery could not take place and the
          Court owed `protection to a minor's right to be free in
          his person from bodily intrusion to the extent of the
          loss of an organ unless such loss be in the best interest
          of the minor.'<sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup>
          Likewise, the ruling in <i><a
          href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/406/205.html"
          target="_blank">Wisconsin v Yoder</a></i> subjects
          parental duty and right to limitations `if it appears
          that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or
          safety of the child, or have potential for significant
          social burdens.'<sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup></p>

          <p>"Following in kind, <i>Kate's School v Department of
          Health</i> limited a parents' right to prescribe their
          treatment of choice for their mentally retarded
          children.<sup><a href="#n154">154</a></sup></p>

          <p>"In <i>Valerie N. v Valerie N</i>. the California
          Supreme Court found that the parents as `conservators,
          were not entitled to have conservatee, who was unable to
          consent to sterilization, sterilized inasmuch as there
          was neither evidence of necessity ... nor sufficient
          evidence that less intrusive means ... were not presently
          available to conservatee.' The Court further held ` ...
          as to those medical procedures permitted after court
          authorization the Legislature has required a judicial
          determination that the condition of the conservatee
          require the recommended course of medical treatment.' The
          Court also found it is necessary to `preserve the right
          ... to be free of intrusive medical and surgical
          procedures.'<sup><a href="#n155">155</a></sup></p>

          <p>"In <i><a
          href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html"
          target="_blank">Prince v Massachusetts</a></i>, The
          United States Supreme Court ruled that `parents may be
          free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow
          they are free ... to make martyrs of their children
          before they have reached the age of full and legal
          discretion when they can make that choice for
          themselves.'<sup><a href="#n156">156</a></sup>"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Dr. Carson Strong,<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup>
      writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"....The first view emphasizes the patient's status as
          a person. According to the first view, respect for
          persons requires that the lives and bodies of persons be
          inviolable. Decisions should be firmly guided by concerns
          such as respect for life, preservation of the physical
          integrity of the body, and respect for the reproductive
          capacities of people. Thus, it is central to this view
          that respect for persons be secured by adherence to
          certain rules designed to protect the inviolateness of
          persons. These rules include the following:....and the
          physical integrity of the body should be preserved. This
          view appropriately can be referred to as the
          `inviolability-of-persons' view."</p>

          <p>And "By contrast, the second approach might be called
          a `beneficence-centered' view. It follows the important
          ethical principle that when a patient's wishes are
          unknown, surrogate decision-making should be guided by
          the patient's well-being. In the beneficence-centered
          view, decisions should be individualized to the specific
          patient's needs, rather than based on firm rules."</p>

          <p>"When a family member serving as surrogate decision
          maker is not acting on the basis of one of these
          `legitimate' standards [substitute judgement standard or
          the best interests standard] (for example, when the
          surrogate weighs family interests against patient
          interests), any decision made on behalf of the patient
          may be questioned, and initiatives taken to replace the
          surrogate decisionmaker...."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Ruth Macklin<sup><a href="#n158">158</a></sup>, makes the
      point that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Despite the recent decline in the use of the best
          interest standard for incompetent adult patients, that
          standard has prevailed in medical situations where the
          patients are children....The once simple picture of
          parents as the sole and proper decision maker for their
          children has been altered by a number of different
          developments. One is the rise of the children's-right and
          children's-liberation movements, leading to a call for
          increased decision-making autonomy for adolescents and
          even younger children. A related development is the idea
          that children need advocates to speak on their behalf
          when parents decide or act wrongly."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has considered<sup><a
      href="#n159">159</a></sup> the ethical problem of consent by
      parents to the medical treatment of children. Whilst far from
      being without flaws, the <a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/">statement</a> does highlight
      (even if it then somewhat ducks) the central problem of
      tension between the parents' wishes and the best interests of
      the child.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Thus `proxy consent' poses serious problems for
          pediatric health care providers. Such providers have
          legal and ethical duties to their child patients to
          render competent medical care based on what the patient
          needs, not what someone else expresses. Although impasses
          regarding the interests of minors and the expressed
          wishes of their parents or guardians are rare, the
          pediatrician's responsibilities to his or her patient
          exist independent of parental desires or proxy
          consent.[citing: Weir<sup><a

      <h3>13.3.4 Consent to Treatment of Children in English
      Law</h3>

      <h4>13.3.4.1 S v. S, W v. Official Solicitor</h4>

      <p>In <i>S v. S</i>, <i>W v. Official Solicitor</i><sup><a
      href="#n161">161</a></sup> Lord MacDermott said, in a useful
      comment as to the paramouncy of the interests of the
      child:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"On the authorities that I have seen to date, one
          should look at what are the paramount interests of the
          child; other interests are subordinate, unless they
          either coincide with them or unless there is some
          exceptional reason for giving effect to them."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The conclusion was in that case that some procedures
      (there the taking of a blood sample to resolve a paternity
      question) could be permitted on the basis of a lower test
      than the best interests of the child, namely that it would be
      permitted if it caused no harm to the child.</p>

      <h4>13.3.4.2 Gillick</h4>

      <p>In <a
      href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/cases/853_0402.htm"
       target="_blank"><i>Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area
      Health Authority</i></a><sup><a href="#n162">162</a></sup>
      Lord Fraser said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"It was, I think, accepted both by Mrs Gillick and by
          the DHSS, and in any event I hold, that parental rights
          to control a child do not exist for the benefit of the
          parent. They exist for the benefit of the child and they
          are justified only in so far as they enable the parent to
          perform his duties towards the child, and towards other
          children in the family. If necessary, this proposition
          can be supported by reference to Blackstone's
          Commentaries (1 Bl Com (17th edn, 1830) 452), where he
          wrote: `The power of parents over their children is
          derived from their duty'....Once the rule of the parents'
          absolute authority over minor children is abandoned, the
          solution to the problem in this appeal can no longer be
          found by referring to rigid parental rights at any
          particular age. <b>The solution depends on a judgment of
          what is best for the welfare of the particular
          child.</b>" (emphasis added).</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Lord Scarman also said in <i>Gillick</i>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Parental rights clearly do exist, and they do not
          wholly disappear until the age of majority. Parental
          rights relate to both the person and the property of the
          child: custody, care and control of the person and
          guardianship of the property of the child. But the common
          law has never treated such rights as sovereign or beyond
          review and control. Nor has our law ever treated the
          child as other than a person with capacities and rights
          recognised by law. (emphasis added) The principle of the
          law, as I shall endeavour to show, is that parental
          rights are derived from parental duty and exist only so
          long as they are needed for the protection of the person
          and property of the child...when a court has before it a
          question as to the care and upbringing of a child it must
          treat the welfare of the child as the paramount
          consideration in determining the order to be made. There
          is here a principle which limits and governs the exercise
          of parental rights of custody, care and control. It is a
          principle perfectly consistent with the law's recognition
          of the parent as the natural guardian of the child; but
          it is also a warning that parental right must be
          exercised in accordance with the welfare principle and
          can be challenged, even overridden, if it be not."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <h3>13.3.5 Discussion</h3>

      <p>The approaches to medical interventions involving children
      are discussed by Ms Linda Delany.<sup><a
      href="#n163">163</a></sup> Those who would apply to all
      non-therapeutic circumcisions a different and/or lower level
      of protection of the child than either of those identified by
      Ms Delany must clearly articulate this: demonstrating why
      such a differing approach is necessary, proper and justified
      against general legal principles and civilised legal
      norms.</p>

      <p>The factual situation being discussed by Ms Delany is the
      practice of requiring a child to donate an organ or bodily
      material for the benefit of another, such as a transplant to
      a seriously-ill sibling; whilst these procedures may often
      involve the reduction in function (at least potentially, as
      where one of two kidneys is donated) they may also merely
      involve the loss of body fluids which the donor will restore
      naturally.</p>

      <p>As Ms Delany observes, there is the approach, wholly
      consistent with the line of the <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/"
      target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a>, of the House of Lords
      in <i>Gillick</i> where a medical procedure is permitted only
      (my emphasis) if it serves the best interests of the child
      who undergoes it. The second, stemming from <i>S v. S</i>,
      <i>W v. Official Solicitor</i><sup><a
      href="#n164">164</a></sup> accepts that parents can give
      valid consent to treatments which are not "against the
      interests of the child"</p>

      <p>Applying, however, either approach to non-therapeutic
      circumcision (where the loss and risks are significant, where
      there is no recipient to benefit and where, at best, the
      `benefit' to the victim is an intangible and somewhat
      question-begging cultural identity) would lead to the
      conclusion that a parent is not able to give valid and
      effective consent to a non-therapeutic circumcision: since
      the medical literature makes it clear that such amputations
      are harmful of the victim, consent could not validly be given
      under the test in <i>S v. S</i>, nor, a fortiori, under the
      <i>Gillick</i> test where the procedure is allowed only if it
      is in the child's best interests.</p>

      <p>Perhaps in looking at the limits now being laid on
      parental consent to operations on their children, and on the
      impact of religious views on the decision to inflict ritual
      circumcision on a child, it might be illuminating to consider
      the words of Lord Donaldson MR in <i>Re T</i><sup><a
      href="#n165">165</a></sup> dealing with the question whether
      a Jehovah's Witness had given a valid direction that she did
      not wish to receive a blood transfusion. Did she really mean
      what she said, or had her mind and will been over-borne by
      others? He said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"In considering the effect of outside influences, two
          aspects can be of crucial importance. First, the strength
          of will of the patient....Second, the relationship of the
          `persuader' to the patient may be of crucial importance.
          The influence of parents on their children or of one
          spouse on the other can be, but is by no means
          necessarily, much stronger than would be the case in
          other relationships.</p>

          <p>"Persuasion based on religious beliefs can also be
          much more compelling and the fact that arguments are
          being deployed by someone in a very close relationship
          with the patient will give them added force and should
          alert the doctors to the possibility-no more-that the
          patient's capacity or will to decide has been overborne.
          In other words the patient may not mean what he

      <p>There are those, circumcised at birth for solely societal

      to religions, such as (it is understood) Hinduism and
      Buddhism, have been impeded by the tenets of those religions
      that the loss of body parts is wrong unless required for
      compelling medical reasons. The decision, taken for, and
      imposed upon, them in early life as to the cultural/religious
      identity they were to follow has deprived them of the

          rights for children. Adults are happy to discuss the
          first two kinds:</p>

          <p>" rights to resources and care - good hospital care,
          food, warmth, safety, parent's loving care;</p>

          <p>" rights to protection from harm - from neglect and
          abuse, fear, pain and loneliness, from too many medical
          interventions or the neglect of being denied necessary
          medical treatment. However, many are uneasy about the

          <p>" rights to self-determination, dignity, respect,
          integrity, non-interference, the right to make informed

          care and protection under the heading of children's
          welfare or interests, but do not need to use rights
          language to promote these benefits. The right to chose is
          a crucial part of being a right-holder. Alice Miller, the
          Swiss psychoanalyst, has shown<sup><a

          cruel, child-rearing illustrate differences between

      <p>The `NHS: The Patient's Charter -- Services for Children'
      (Apr 1996) follows these concepts; if (and experience with
      the Citizen's Charter to date generally does not inspire
      confidence) the guidelines are properly and fully applied, it
      would not be within the Charter for any nontherapeutic
      circumcision to be performed in an NHS hospital. The Charter
      makes it clear (page 2) that the care is owed to the child,
      who must (page 13) be given an explanation of the treatment
      proposed (including benefits, risks and alternatives) and the
      child's emotional and developmental needs will be taken into
      account. None of these admirable aims can be other than
      flouted if a boy is circumcised by a doctor (no matter
      whether he purports to be acting in a medical or religious
      capacity) at the request of the parents for a non-therapeutic

      moral integrity.</p>

      <p>In paragraph 3.22, Article 9 ECHR is set out in full:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,
          conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to
          change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone
          or in community with others and in public or private, to
          manifest his religion or belief, worship, teaching,
          practice and observance.</p>

          <p>(2) Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs
          shall be subject only to such limitations as are
          prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
          society in the interests of public safety, for the
          protection of public order, health or morals, or for the
          protection of the rights and freedom of others.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In Articles 8 and 9 there is a need for a balancing act
      between the individual's freedoms and the necessary
      restrictions on them as required for a number of public
      policy reasons, one of the more important of which is the
      need to ensure that another's freedoms are not thereby
      infringed. As is noted in paragraph 3.23, Article 9 ECHR thus
      draws a distinction between the right to freedom of thought
      etc and the right to manifest one's religion or beliefs.: as
      the Commission observes, it is necessary to consider not only
      whether a restriction of a particular religious practice
      infringes Article 9(1) but also whether such restriction can
      be justified under Article 9(2). See also Article 14 UN
      Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

      <p>Given the individual's right, Article 8 ECHR, to bodily
      integrity and the limitation on the manifestation of a
      religious practice under Article 9(2), given also the loss of
      bodily integrity, the pain (which falls within the
      prohibition of inhuman treatment in Article 3 ECHR), the
      risks and inevitable dysfunction of male ritual circumcision,
      it hard to see how the practice of the ritual can be
      permitted to continue given the medically demonstrated risks
      and dysfunction. The claim in the name of freedom of religion
      for the continuation of this ritual cannot be accepted: the
      restriction on this practice is justified, not only by
      Article 9(2) but also by Articles 3 and 8 ECHR.</p>

      <h2><a id="god" name="god"></a>16. The religious demands</h2>

      <p>Inherent difficulties in the freedom of religious thought
      and the restrictions that might have to be placed as a matter
      of public policy on the practice of certain aspects of
      religion are touched on in Part III and also in Part IX.</p>

      <p>It is clear that the Commission, in dealing with the
      question of ritual male circumcision has been heavily
      influenced by the fact that it is practised by Jews and
      Muslims: in paragraph 9.2, it is described as being insisted
      on by Islamic and Jewish law (see also n.2 to that
      paragraph); even if that be so (and it is far from certain
      that it is so), there is no reason (other than perhaps a
      wholly misplaced `political correctness') for the
      difficulties both legally and morally in such a practice
      being ignored. Indeed, on the basis of the Commission's own
      proposals (see paragraph 9.27 and Part XVI paragraph 36)
      circumcision in the name of any other religion or by any
      other cultural group would not enjoy the proposed exemption.
      The proposed exemption would apply solely to Jewish and
      Muslim circumcisions, which prompts the question `Why?': is
      it that the procedure is recognised as harmful and thus must
      be confined to these two religions only as a special
      exception, in which case where is the discussion of this, or
      is this an inadvertent omission based on a wholly
      inadequately thought-out position? Whichever the reason, the
      Commission's treatment is unacceptable both as it stands and
      as a matter of principle and public policy.</p>

      <p>The Commission does discuss, in somewhat superficial
      terms, the issues of human rights in the context of other
      consensual assaults on a person; indeed the tension inherent
      in the freedom of religious thought and the restrictions that
      might have to be placed as a matter of public policy on the
      practice of certain aspects of religion are touched on in
      Part III and also in Part IX. That these discussions might
      have any bearing on the practice of a religious/ritual
      mutilation either seem never to have occurred to the
      Commission or, perhaps, the Commission felt that the practice
      would inevitably be seen as offending against the fundamental
      human rights of the non-consenting victim if it were
      discussed and decided to duck the issue. This omission of any
      discussion of the religious and cultural dimensions of ritual
      circumcision in a consultation paper such as this is not
      acceptable.</p>

      <p>It would seem that the Commission's stance is driven by
      two factors: a wish to preserve what it sees as `traditional'
      and a perceived need to placate (at any cost?) the Jews and
      Muslims (but not seemingly any other group who circumcise for
      ritual reasons). These factors appear to have produced a
      treatment of ritual male circumcision which is misleading to
      the point of dishonesty, which dismisses the matter in a
      scant few lines and which avoids any discussion of the real
      issues (perhaps because to discuss them would be clearly to
      demonstrate the unacceptability and unlawfulness of the
      practice).</p>

      <p>As for the argument of tradition, the words of Oliver
      Wendell Holmes seem apposite:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "[I]t is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of
          law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry
          IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which
          it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule
          persists from blind imitation of the past"<sup><a
          href="#n170">170</a></sup>.
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      Further, in relation to ritual male circumcision at least,
      the Commission's philosophical position would seem to be one
      of `Legal Moralism'; and the discussion of that stance, and
      the criticisms of it by Mr Roberts in Appendix C of the
      Consultation Paper are apt.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>Professor Dwyer<sup><a href="#n171">171</a></sup>
      convincingly argues that the view that parents have rights
      over their children is incorrect and untenable: the rights
      reside in the children with the parents acting as agents for
      the children to enforce those rights. Dwyer is writing from a
      culture and a constitution which sets great store on freedom
      from state interference and on religious freedom, to the
      point, he argues, that the correct position has been blurred.
      In suggesting as he does, Dwyer echoes English law as to the
      nature of the parent-child relationship.</p>

      <p>He takes as his basis that the rights given by the
      American Constitution are granted to an individual for him to
      determine his own affairs; the right to determine the affairs
      of another is not a general right, even where decisions are
      taken for an incompetent adult, and he argues that dicta
      suggesting that this right to determine the affairs of
      another exists, exceptionally, in relation to the parent and
      child is flawed. He sees similarities in the concept of the
      claimed rights of parents over their children (their claimed
      `other-determining right') with slavery which is prohibited
      by virtue of the 13th Amendment to the American Constitution
      [Amendment XIII Section 1: `Neither slavery nor involuntary
      servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party
      shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United
      States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction']. He
      cites Armer and Widawsky<sup><a href="#n172">172</a></sup>
      defining slavery as a "power relation of domination,
      degradation, and subservience, in which human beings are
      treated as chattel, not persons."</p>

      <p><a href="/library/legal/dwyer2/">Dwyer</a> makes the point
      (in terms that also made by the Queensland Law Reform
      Commission, supra) that "it is not self-evident that a
      connection exists between parents' religious beliefs and
      children's interests"; it would be necessary to have to
      demonstrate this connection "in order, it would seem, to
      justify the Supreme Court's determination that parents should
      have greater rights of control over their children's lives
      when parental preferences regarding the upbringing of
      children arise from religious rather than secular beliefs. It
      is necessary to show that the very fact of adhering to a
      religion -- any religion -- whose tenets include preferred
      modes of parenting makes a parent better able or more
      disposed to further the temporal interests of the child"; and
      he makes the point that `temporal' interests are all that the
      State can properly concern itself with.</p>

      <p>Further, he observes that "it is very odd to tie one
      person's rights to another person's interests. In our legal
      culture, rights ordinarily protect the rightholder's
      interests, not the interests of other persons. Thus, it is
      fitting to ask why, if what we are most concerned with is
      protecting children's interests, we do not grant children
      themselves the rights necessary to protect those interests.
      Why, instead, do we rely on the conceptually awkward notion
      of parent's rights?"</p>

      <p>As Dwyer says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "...even if it does on the whole further parents'
          interests to possess rights to direct their children's
          lives in ways that are harmful to the children, the state
          should deem such interests illegitimate and refuse to
          give them precedence over the interests of children. The
          problem with such `interests' is that they entail
          treating children instrumentally, using children in ways
          that sacrifice their welfare interests in order to
          further the ulterior interests of parents"; and "This is
          true whether the parents' motives are self-regarding or
          solely concerned with the wellbeing of the child (e.g. if
          the parents believe they are sacrificing the child's
          temporal interests in order to further the child's
          spiritual interests). If state decision-makers themselves
          believe certain parenting practices or decisions to be
          harmful for a child, then their advocating parental
          rights to undertake those practices or decisions
          necessarily means that they are willing to accept the
          sacrifice of the child's interest for the sake of
          satisfying the parents. The reluctance of liberals in
          particular to take a stand against religiously motivated
          parenting of which they personally disapprove is, I
          believe, due largely to their believing that liberal
          values of tolerance and respect for diverse ideological
          views require the state to defer to the viewpoint of the
          parents in determining whether particular parenting
          practices should be permissible. This might be a
          defensible position from which to determine the
          permissibility of what individuals do to themselves or
          what consenting adults do to each other. However, it is a
          mistake in the case of children, who are not the same
          persons as their parents, nor, in general, consenting
          participants in the religious practices of their parents.
          Liberals should instead view the childrearing behaviors
          of parents the same way they view actions affecting any
          other non-consenting persons.......we do not simply give
          people rights to use other, non-consenting persons as
          instruments for the advancement of their own interests.
          Nor do we permit people to inflict what a majority of the
          community considers to be harm on other, nonconsenting
          persons, regardless of their motivations for doing
          so."<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Dwyer concludes that his analysis shows that "none of the
      interests that may be bound up in the conflict between
      parents and the State over the appropriate forms of
      childrearing supports the perpetuation of parents' rights.
      Objections to state interventions that would be detrimental
      to the well-being of a child can stand entirely on an
      assertion of the child's rights. Parents' rights are
      necessary only to ward off state interventions that would on
      the whole enhance a child's well-being. That aim is
      illegitimate because it entails a willingness to sacrifice
      the welfare interests of children in order to advance
      uncertain (given the possible long-term harm to the
      parent/child relationship discussed above) and, in any event,
      non fundamental interests of parents or of other members of
      society. We do not allow adults to be treated as mere
      instruments for the achievement of others' ends, and we
      should not allow children to be treated in this way
      either."</p>

      <p><a href="/library/legal/brigman/">Professor Brigman</a>,
      some 10 years earlier, argued that circumcision was a form of
      child abuse<sup><a href="#n173">173</a></sup>. He too argues
      that the US courts are entitled to intervene in family life
      and/or religious practice when, as it was put in <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/406/205.html"
      target="_blank">Wisconsin v. Yoder</a>, (op.cit at n.167)
      "...it appears that parental decisions will jeopardise the
      health or safety of the child, or have a potential for
      significant social burdens." In considering the religious
      basis of ritual circumcision he starts with the US Supreme
      Court decision of Reynolds v. United States<sup><a
      href="#n174">174</a></sup> (involving the prosecution of a
      Mormon for bigamy) where the Court distinguished between
      religious beliefs and religious practices and ruled that
      while the government could not interfere with religious
      beliefs, it could limit practices performed in the name of
      religion that were harmful to society. To do otherwise,
      according to the Court, would be to "make the professed
      doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the
      land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law
      unto himself."</p>

      <h2><a id="cult" name="cult"></a>17. The cultural claim</h2>

      <p>In paragraph 9.13 et seq religious and cultural practices
      are discussed and the case of <i>Adesayna</i> summarised. In
      (1975) 24 ICLQ 136 Mr Sebastian Poulter, in supporting the
      correctness of the <i>Adesayna</i> decision, suggested (see
      also the Consultation Paper paragraph 9.15) that possible
      reasons in addition to the judge's were: the thinking behind
      the Tattooing of Minors Act 1969; the increasing inobservance
      of the ritual in Nigeria which made special treatment of the
      ritual in England and Wales less acceptable; and the need to
      apply the criminal law equally to everyone.</p>

      <p>According to paragraph 9.16, Mr Poulter changed his mind
      some 12 years later, in <i>Ethnic Minority Customs, English
      Law and Human Rights</i><sup><a href="#n175">175</a></sup>.
      The discussion of Mr Poulter's views in paragraph 9.17 et seq
      gives a somewhat misleading impression of his views, however.
      What Mr Poulter suggests is that, whilst it might be
      appropriate to allow some tolerance to minorities, there are
      limits on that tolerance. These he suggests, pace note 48 to
      paragraph 9.18, are to be found in the need to recognise the
      freedoms of others. He writes that claims based on religious
      or cultural freedom which violate other's fundamental rights
      "must clearly fail.....any custom which denies another person
      the right to life (e.g. human sacrifice) or involves cruel,
      inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (e.g. physical
      mutilation of wrongdoers or female circumcision) is bound to
      be denied recognition." Thus, contrary to the impression
      given by footnote 48, female circumcision is mentioned as but
      one example of practices which go beyond the proper
      limits.</p>

      <p>Mr Poulter continues that the claim for religious freedom
      may be rejected on the basis of the various limited grounds,
      e.g public order or public safety. "Similarly if it could be
      scientifically proved that the Jewish and Muslim methods of
      slaughter involved greater suffering than pre-stunning there
      might be a case for arguing that the special religious
      exemption (in s.36(2) Slaughterhouses Act 1974) should be
      repealed on the ground that causing unnecessary suffering
      offends against current notions of public morality."</p>

      <p>There is nothing in Mr Poulter's article which would
      support the notion that he would place a higher value on the
      prevention of cruelty to animals than he would to the
      prevention of cruelty, risks and dysfunction to children. Mr
      Poulter is thus a great deal less permissive than the
      Consultation Paper would suggest: whilst there are some
      differences between male and female circumcision, the pain is
      broadly the same, the loss of sexual function exists in both
      (even though the loss may be greater in the female because of
      the greater excision of flesh typically performed) and both
      involve involuntary loss on the part of the victim of bodily
      integrity, cruel and inhuman treatment, and permanent
      disfigurement: all these are violations of the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of the unconsenting victim.</p>

      <p>One can perhaps predict an argument from those who would
      circumcise as a matter of ritual or custom that the child
      `benefits' from a procedure which marks him as a member of a
      race, group, tribe, sect or religion; and that continuing
      observance of the religious demands of ritual mutilation form
      an important bond both of the group itself and of the child
      to the group. An alternative argument might be advanced that
      in addition to `group identity' from circumcision, there is
      the danger that if a infant is not circumcised in accordance
      with the dictats of the parental culture and/or religion that
      child might suffer rejection by the family and/or there might
      be tensions within the family arising from the child's intact
      status. The objections to these arguments include that a
      family or group which is so insecure and disturbed as to
      place no value on the child as an individual and which
      regards the child as no more than a possession, apt to be
      subjected to genital mutilation, is likely already to be
      dysfunctional in the broadest sense.</p>

      <p>Ritual circumcision is to ignore both the pain and harm of
      the procedure and that it is inflicted upon a child whose
      fundamental human rights are over-ridden, and whose freedom
      to chose in adult life his own belief-systems has been
      impaired; and they would trade an inevitable sexual
      dysfunction for the possible avoidance of damage stemming
      from their own inability to cope with the consequences of
      according their children full legal rights. Those who would
      try to argue for the continuation of this ritual mutilation
      do so as parti pris and can derive no support from the
      medical evidence nor from academics such as Mr Poulter and
      (seemingly) Professor Feldman<sup><a

      <h2><a id="real" name="real"></a>18. The reality of male
      circumcision and the Consultation Paper's proposals</h2>

      <p>The Commission's view, in paragraph 9.1, as to the alleged
      clarity of the law concerning ritual circumcision, (echoed in
      paragraph 9.2: "Male circumcision is lawful under English
      common law") is undermined by the Consultation Paper itself.
      If the law were indeed as clear as the Commission would have
      us believe, then it is curious that ACPO saw a need, as
      reported in paragraph 9.2, to "make the position entirely
      clear"; it is also of note that reference is made to
      "formulating rules as to the nature of the consent given by
      the victim and the limits and the circumstances in which
      consent is legally effective." Ex hypothesi, the victim does
      not, and cannot consent, because he is an infant or young
      child; parents purport to assent on his behalf, but that is
      not the same. Further, the limits etc of consent, as
      suggested by ACPO, are not touched on in relation to ritual
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The Commission's proposition is further undermined by the
      last sentence of paragraph 9.2. The Commission's proposal
      (see paragraph 8.50) is that the `medical exemption' be
      confined to a `duly registered medical practitioner'. If the
      law were `clear', as alleged by the Commission, and ritual
      circumcision were lawful at common law (and the inference
      that the reader of the Consultation Paper is invited to draw
      is that it is so lawful as an exception in its own right
      rather than as a feature of a medical procedure), then the
      alleged lawfulness would continue and it would be irrelevant
      whether the operator was a duly registered medical
      practitioner, capable of benefiting from the `medical
      exemption', or not. Further, it would not be necessary to
      "put the lawfulness of ritual male circumcision beyond any
      doubt" (as suggested in paragraph 9.27) if the legal position
      were in truth as stated by the Commission in paragraphs 9.1
      and 9.2.</p>

      <p>Ritual circumcision is (apart from medical treatment to a
      person unable to consent for himself, and lawful correction)
      a situation where the victim is not consenting for himself to
      the infliction of violence upon his person. The person
      purporting to consent on behalf of the circumcised victim is
      either the person inflicting the violence or the person who,
      in the words of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933,
      `causes or procures him to be assaulted..... in a manner
      likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to
      health'. It thus seems wholly inappropriate to deal with
      ritual circumcision in a paper dealing with situations where
      the victim has consented for himself to the infliction upon
      his own body of injury; the considerable confusion of thought
      in the Consultation Paper would have been avoided had the
      issues of medical treatment (particularly for those
      incompetent to consent), lawful correction and nontherapeutic
      circumcision been dealt with as quite different and separate
      questions. Indeed, it is hard to resist the suspicion that
      the inclusion of ritual circumcision in the Consultation
      Paper was an attempt slip through and/or pass off as
      legitimate a practice, which causes grave damage and is a
      breach of civilised legal norms, under cover of a
      liberalisation generally of the law on the infliction of
      relatively minor and essentially self-authorised
      injuries.</p>

      <p>Medical treatment can be seen as having as its essential
      end-aim the cure and/or prevention of a disease process; and
      it is that purpose which justifies its being done even to the
      point of considerable mutilation. Sports (where the
      participants are, of course, volunteers) can, of course be
      the source of serious injuries, but the more usual cuts,
      scrapes and bruises are, typically, minor and quick to heal
      with no lasting long-term effects; and the benefits of
      exercise can be seen as justifying the risk of injury.
      Equally, parental correction tends inflict more pain than
      damage and, it is a commonplace to state (but see Lord
      Mustill in <i>Brown</i> at p267A),that it must not "go too
      far" and must be "for the purpose of correction and not the
      gratification of passion or rage." If it goes too far then
      the courts can and do intervene. Indeed, it is ironic that
      the principle of physical correction of children is
      increasingly coming under attack, both domestically and
      internationally; but the far graver, and irreparable damage
      of circumcision, attracts only a perfunctory mention by the
      Consultation Paper.</p>

      <p>Even if (which is doubted) the Commission is correct in
      stating that circumcision has been lawful at common law (and
      that on the basis of only two cases where mention of it was
      probably obiter), it is perhaps not too fanciful to see the
      attitude to circumcision as stemming from its historical
      perspective. Originally it was practised in Britain only by
      Jews, who were historically seen in Britain as an alien group
      not wholly under the law and its protection (as with the laws
      against usury) and Muslims. Thus the Jewish and Muslim ritual
      mutilation of their infant boys could be seen as not having
      an impact on society as a whole. Further, given that there is
      no requirement for a professional qualification for the
      performing of a surgical intervention, might not the
      non-prosecution of ritual circumcision also have flowed from
      its quasi `surgical and medical' connotations, particularly
      when wrongly it was seen as having few disadvantages, rather
      than from its being an exempted procedure in its own
      right.</p>

      <p>Certainly, in the 19th century, circumcision acquired the
      pseudo-medical justification as being preventive of
      masturbation (and the illness thought to follow from
      masturbation); and, thus, any more recent general tolerance
      of circumcision can be seen as deriving from the latitude
      accorded medical treatment (be it the Victorian rationale or
      the equally medically-discredited claims of more recent
      years), rather than compelling evidence of its being one of
      the exemptions from the prohibition against violence. A
      medical `justification' would also serve to give ritual
      circumcision a spurious respectability and justification.</p>

      <h3>18.1 Commission's proposals</h3>

      <p>The Commission sums up its proposals in Part XVI. In
      paragraph 1, it proposes that the same principles should
      apply to all injuries inflicted with consent (so it says, but
      then draws a different treatment for ritual circumcision);
      that the infliction, paragraphs 2 and 3, of `seriously
      disabling injury' should remain a criminal offence but that
      the infliction, paragraphs 5 and 6, of lesser injuries should
      not be a criminal offence.</p>

      <p>`Seriously disabling injury' is defined in paragraph 7 as
      an injury which:</p>

      <p>(1) causes serious distress, and</p>

      <p>(2) involves the loss of a body member or organ or
      permanent bodily injury or permanent functional impairment,
      or serious or permanent disfigurement, or severe and
      prolonged pain, or serious impairment of mental health, or
      prolonged unconsciousness; and in determining whether an
      effect is permanent, no account should be taken of the fact
      that it may be remediable by surgery.</p>

      <p>In paragraph 12, the Commission proposes that a valid
      consent may not be given by a person without capacity (and
      capacity is discussed in, inter alia, paragraphs 13 and 14).
      An exception is proposed for `proper medical treatment,
      paragraph 31, which is defined in 31(2). In paragraph 38, the
      Commission proposes that no valid consent may be given by a
      person under the age of 18 to injuries inflicted for `sexual,
      religious or spiritual purposes'.</p>

      <p>It is remarkable that, against these proposals, male
      circumcision is dismissed with a few perfunctory lines in
      Part IX (see, by contrast, the length of Part XI on lawful
      correction), and with the occasional references elsewhere in
      the Consultation Paper. Even if the Commission's wholly
      erroneous assertion, unsupported in any way, that it is
      `generally accepted that the removal of the foreskin of the
      penis has little, if any, effect on a man's ability to enjoy
      sexual intercourse' were right, one might have expected some
      discussion as to why ritual male circumcision should be
      excepted from the general principles and, in particular, from
      the general proposal in relation to consensual injuries for
      sexual, religious or spiritual purposes at paragraph 38 of
      Part XVI. Equally, it is very difficult to understand why,
      when it by definition requires the amputation of the healthy
      and functional flesh from a healthy penis, it is to be
      regarded as differing from any other amputation and is an act
      `not, therefore, regarded as mutilation' (see in particular
      the definitions of `mutilate' and `mutilation' above) and
      accorded some special treatment. Further, as an somewhat
      technical aside, an exemption for certain ritual
      circumcisions for certain members of religious groups might
      (but I have not thought it worth pursuing this minor point)
      render any Bill containing such a proposal hybrid.</p>

      <p>Again, the fact that the consent but not the sacrifice
      comes not from the victim but from a person on his behalf,
      might have indicated a need for a rather more thorough
      examination of this ritual infliction of painful, risky and
      gravely damaging injury.</p>

      <p>Further, though in paragraphs 3.22 - 3.27 and 9.13 - 9.19
      there is some discussion of religious and cultural issues,
      there is no mention there of ritual male circumcision; albeit
      that the very reason of ritual male circumcision is religious
      for Jews and Muslims and cultural for other groups.</p>

      <p>The remark that `it is generally accepted that the removal
      of the foreskin of the penis has little, if any, effect on a
      man's ability to enjoy sexual intercourse' is, in its
      adoption of forelore and myth and its woeful failure to make
      even a cursory search of the body of medical literature,
      unworthy of a body charged with the considerable
      responsibility of examining the body of English law. The
      medical evidence, but briefly discussed above, renders the
      thrust of paragraph 9.2 of the Consultation Paper quite
      untenable. Whilst the Editorial Comment in the <i>British
      Journal of Urology</i>, 77, 1996:925 was not available to the
      Commission when it produced the Consultation Paper, the
      material on which that comment is based was readily
      available.</p>

      <p>The claim of legality of this mutilating procedure under
      common law is not only made wholly without any authority
      being cited in support, but is an assertion which is open to
      considerable doubt, even before the 20th century's more
      enlightened view of children. Further, it is clear that the
      Commission's view of ritual circumcision and thus of its
      alleged legality depends crucially on the assertion as to the
      lack of harm being correct: to the point that once harm can
      be objectively demonstrated, the assertion as to the legality
      of it fails.</p>

      <p>It is against the medical studies of circumcision that the
      procedure must be looked at to see whether or not it is as
      harmless as the Consultation Paper would wish to suggest in
      para 9.2; or whether it is in reality not only harmful but
      that the harm is such that is readily fits inside either the
      existing definition of `grievous bodily harm' or the Paper's
      new level of injury, namely `seriously disabling injury'.</p>

      <h3>18.2 `Seriously disabling injury'</h3>

      <p>In the Commission's proposals in the Consultation Paper,
      `Seriously disabling injury' is to be defined as an injury
      which:</p>

      <p>(1) causes serious distress; and</p>

      <p>(2) involves the loss of a body member or organ or
      permanent bodily injury or permanent functional impairment,
      or serious or permanent disfigurement, or severe and
      prolonged pain, or serious impairment of mental health, or
      prolonged unconsciousness. (my emphasis).</p>

      <p>The pain experienced as a inevitable consequence of the
      unanaesthetised circumcision, quite apart from the distress
      which might be caused by some or all of the range of
      complications and a realisation in later life of the
      inevitable losses, means that circumcision satisfies the
      first limb of the proposed definition.</p>

      <p>Circumcision also clearly satisfies almost all of the
      various, disjunctive, heads of the second limb since
      circumcision involves:</p>

      <p>-the loss of an organ or body member(the prepuce)</p>

      <p>-and it involves permanent bodily injury</p>

      <p>-and permanent functional impairment</p>

      <p>-and serious</p>

      <p>-and permanent disfigurement</p>

      <p>-and severe</p>

      <p>-and prolonged pain.</p>

      <p>In other words where the second limb of the proposed
      definition would be satisfied if but one of the various
      categories of harm were established, circumcision (as my
      emphasis seeks to highlight) satisfies most of them (and
      there is support in the medical literature that it might also
      result in serious impairment of mental health, and, in some
      if not all, cases in prolonged unconsciousness).</p>

      <p>There is a major objection to the Commission's proposal at
      paragraph 36 of Part XVI that "We provisionally propose that
      the circumcision of male children, performed with their
      parent consent in accordance with the rites of the Jewish and
      Muslim religions, should continue to be lawful": that is that
      it would create a class of children who, solely by an
      accident of birth and as a result of being male infants who
      have Jewish or Muslim parents (but seemingly not, in the way
      that the proposed exemption is currently drafted, children
      born to parents of other belief-systems who circumcise for
      religious/cultural reasons) are to be discriminated against
      as a result of sex, race and/or religion and to suffer the
      pain, risks and dysfunction of ritual circumcision which the
      majority of boys in Britain are spared. Quite apart from any
      prohibitions against discrimination on those grounds
      contained in international law, such a creation of a group of
      secondclass citizens would seem to be both abhorrent and to
      fly in the face of domestic legislation prohibiting racial
      and sexual discrimination.</p>

      <h2><a id="int" name="int"></a>19. International Law</h2>

      <p>It is not uncommon to see attempts by individuals and
      groups to treat international legal provisions, and to a
      lesser degree domestic laws, as if they were a sort of
      `supermarket pick-and-mix' selection of sweets, from which
      those elements which the individual takes as granting him, or
      preserving, freedoms, rights and protections which he sees as
      important, whilst at the same time rejecting those other
      provisions which he regards as intrusive (even though they
      are aimed at ensuring that the freedoms of others are given
      proper effect) because and only because the parts which he
      regards as unacceptable contain proper (though he of course
      does not concede them as being proper) limits to his actions.
      Thus the common provision as to freedom of religion is seized
      upon with enthusiasm; and the balancing provision as to
      proper limits so as to protect others is rejected. It is as
      if a person seeks to rely on laws against violence to
      himself, whilst regarding himself as free to disregard those
      concerning his violence towards others.</p>

      <p>This "pick-and-mix" approach becomes even less acceptable
      when it is clear that the performance of ritual circumcision
      is, at least for Jews and possibly also for Muslims, a method
      for the parent to be a more observant member of his religion
      rather than an act of grace between the child and god: the
      parent sacrifices something which is not his in order that he
      himself might gain favour with his god.</p>

      <p>Despite Britain's failure to meet its international
      obligations and to incorporate the <a
      href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm"
      target="_blank">European Convention on Human Rights</a> into
      domestic legislation (see Lord Mustill in <i>Brown</i> at
      p272C), that Convention is one to which, as Lord Mustill
      observed at p272F, Britain and its courts must have regard.
      Equally, other international instruments, signed and ratified
      by Britain cannot be ignored nor flouted. Even if it were
      otherwise, the fundamental human rights articulated there
      would demand, as a matter of public policy, to be respected.
      <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: The United Kingdom later
      did legislate the ECHR into domestic law by the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act 1998</a>.]</b></font></p>

      <p>The European Convention has been touched on above; in
      addition regard must be had to, but not exclusively to, the
      <a href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration on
      Human Rights</a>, and, especially, the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">United Nations
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>.</p>

      <p>These make it clear that circumcision for non-therapeutic
      reasons is a denial to the circumcised boy of his fundamental
      human rights. In the premises it is suggested that the
      current policy of English law (of either, if the Commission
      are right as to the current position of its legality,
      regarding circumcision as legal under domestic law; or at the
      least taking no firm position but allowing the practice to be
      conducted without interference) is open to challenge and
      could readily be challenged, under the European Convention,
      in the forum of the Court. In that event, it would be
      credible that the plaintiff would pray in aid in support of
      his case the provisions of other international instruments
      which re-state, albeit without such ready enforcement
      machinery, similar fundamental rights.</p>

          present Covenant undertakes to take the necessary steps,
          in accordance with its constitutional processes and with
          the provisions of the present Covenant, to adopt such
          legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give
          effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.
          3. Each State Party to the present Covenant
          undertakes:</p>

          <p>(a) To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms
          as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective
          remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been
          committed by persons acting in an official capacity;</p>

          <p>(b) To ensure that any person claiming such a remedy
          shall have his right thereto determined by competent
          judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or
          by any other competent authority provided for by the
          legal system of the State, and to develop the
          possibilities of judicial remedy;</p>

          <p>(c) To ensure that the competent authorities shall
          enforce such remedies when granted.</p>

          <p><b>Article 5</b></p>

          <p>1. Nothing in the present Covenant may be interpreted
          as implying for any State, group or person any right to
          engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the
          destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognized
          herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is
          provided for in the present Covenant.</p>

          <p>2. There shall be no restriction upon or derogation
          from any of the fundamental human rights recognized or
          existing in</p>

          <p>any State Party to the present Covenant pursuant to
          law, conventions, regulations or custom on the pretext
          that the present Covenant does not recognize such rights
          or that it recognizes them to a lesser extent.</p>

          <p><b>Article 18</b></p>

          <p>1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of
          thought, conscience and religion. This right shall
          include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief
          of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in
          community with others and in public or private, to
          manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance,
          practice and teaching. 2. No one shall be subject to
          coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to
          adopt a religion or belief of his choice.</p>

          <p>3. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may
          be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by
          law and are necessary to protect public safety, order,
          health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms
          of others.</p>

          <p>4. The States Parties to the present Covenant
          undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and,
          when applicable, legal guardians to ensure the religious
          and moral education of their children in conformity with
          their own convictions.</p>

      <h3>19.3 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989</h3>

      <p>This, the most recent, and most child-centred,
      international instrument is clear.</p>

      <p>In the Preamble, there is the following preambular
      paragraph 12:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Taking due account of the importance of the
          traditions and cultural values of each people for the
          protection and harmonious development of the child,"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>There is, in the preambular paragraphs, an important
      distinction to be drawn between the language of most of them
      and that of preambular paragraph 12: namely between
      `Recognizing.....' and `Taking account......'. The clear
      signal from the difference in language is that those matters
      in the `recognising' paragraphs formed a basis or framework
      for the Articles which follow, whereas the `Taking due
      account of the importance of the traditions and cultural
      values of each people for the protection and harmonious
      development of the child' was seen as not over-riding the
      protections and rights enunciated in the Convention [see, for
      example, also Art.3(3)]. This point is important in view of
      the provisions of Article 31(2): "States Parties shall
      respect and promote the right of the child to participate
      fully in cultural and artistic life and shall encourage the
      provision of appropriate and equal opportunities for
      cultural, artistic, recreational and leisure activity." What
      is clear from the structure of the Convention as a whole is
      that those activities which are damaging and/or inimical to
      the child and its health, development and best interests are
      not permitted and only to the extent that the family's
      cultural life are not in conflict are those cultural
      activities to be permitted. Thus, Article 31(2) does not
      over-ride the provisions of Article 24(3) "States Parties
      shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view
      to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health
      of children"</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Article 1</b></p>

          <p>For the purposes of the present Convention, a child
          means every human being below the age of eighteen years
          unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority
          is attained earlier."</p>

          <p>This, it will be noted, requires that the Convention
          be applied, without distinction as to sex, to all
          children.</p>

          <p><b>Article 2</b></p>

          <p>1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights
          set forth in the present Convention to each child within
          their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind,
          irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or
          legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion,
          political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social
          origin, property, disability, birth or other status.</p>

          <p>2. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures
          to ensure that the child is protected against all
          forms</p>

          <p>of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the
          status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the
          child's parents, legal guardians, or family members.</p>

          <p>This article requires State intervention to protect
          the child from all discrimination; and thus, limits,
          strictly, the rights of the parents or guardians of a
          minor. Here, as elsewhere, Article 18 of the Vienna
          Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, which provides
          that a state, while a treaty is awaiting ratification
          after signature, may not "act to defeat the object and
          purpose of a treaty", might well be illuminating; even if
          failure fully to implement might not attract
          international condemnation, enactment, or even a proposal
          by a official body (formally charged by the State with
          law review) for such an enactment, might well be seen as
          both a grave breach and a provocative one and one so at
          odds with the Convention that such behaviour would not be
          permitted even before any decision as to
          ratification.</p>

          <p><b>Article 3</b></p>

          <p>1. In all actions concerning children, whether
          undertaken by public or private social welfare
          institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities
          or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child
          shall be a primary consideration.</p>

          <p>2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such
          protection and care as is necessary for his or her
          wellbeing, taking into account the rights and duties of
          his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals
          legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end,
          shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative
          measures.</p>

          <p>3. States Parties shall ensure that the institutions,
          services and facilities responsible for the care or
          protection of children shall conform with the standards
          established by competent authorities, particularly in the
          areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of
          their staff as well as competent supervision."</p>

          <p>Circumcision is not performed in the best interest of
          a minor, but is instead performed to relieve the
          anxieties of parents regarding normal human sexual
          anatomy and to fulfil parental expectations of religious,
          social and sexual conformity. Parental or cultural belief
          that genital mutilation to any degree is in the best
          interests of the minor is irrelevant. Parents cannot
          endanger the lives of their children or cause irreparable
          physical disfigurement simply to raise them within the
          confines of their culture. Furthermore the `competent
          authorities' in this situation --the world-wide medical
          profession-are opposed to circumcision without obvious
          pathology.</p>

          <p><b>Article 4</b></p>

          <p>States Parties shall undertake all appropriate
          legislative, administrative, and other measures for the
          implementation of the rights recognized in the present
          Convention. With regard to economic, social and cultural
          rights, States Parties shall undertake such measures to
          the maximum extent of their available resources and,
          where needed, within the framework of international
          cooperation.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Despite Britain's seeming failure to give effect to this
      provision, it remains an international obligation on this
      country; and in the context of the Consultation Paper, any
      step taken now to give legitimacy to the continuation of the
      practice of non-therapeutic circumcision, particularly when
      in a highly discriminatory form, would be a grave breach both
      of this article as well as this and other Conventions as a
      whole.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>A primary sense of identity resides in the integrity of

      damage to this identity by mutilation or disfigurement of
      their penises.</p>

          of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The freedom in Article 14(1) is impaired for a ritually
      circumcised child since that mutilation for other than
      pressing medical reasons constitutes a possible impediment to
      joining, or even it has been suggested, marrying into
      religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism; and the physical
      marking of the infant in the name of religion is itself, even
      without the possible effect on a later wish to change
      religious adherence, a denial of that child's freedom of
      choice.</p>

          <p>Circumcision of a minor, either at an age when the
          child is unable to express his will or by force against
          his consent, violates the child's right of expression by
          its performance. It also violates the freedom of sexual
          expression by permanently and unnecessarily diminishing
          the sexual sensations and functions of the penis as
          intended by nature.</p>

          <p><b>Article 19</b></p>

          <p>Non-medical circumcision has been defined by many
          professional writers as all of the acts forbidden by
          Article 19(1). This Article also restricts the ability of

      </blockquote>

      <p>In light of the appalling record of risk and dysfunction
      from circumcision which can only be described as prejudicial
      to the health of minors, Article 24(3), which is part of an
      Article providing a protective framework, requires that these
      practices must not be used to justify non-medical
      circumcision of minors. In the absence of pathology or
      injury, the right to consent to the amputation of healthy
      genital structures for traditional, cultural, or cosmetic
      reasons must rest solely with the affected individual on
      reaching the age of consent and then only when that consent
      is fully informed.</p>

      <p>The prohibition in Article 24(3) covers, in view of
      Article 1, children of both sexes and thus circumcision of
      both sexes. The language, and thus the meaning is clear; and
      this is so notwithstanding that the evil that was in the
      forefront of minds may have been female circumcision. By
      virtue of Article 31 of the <a
      href="http://193.135.136.30/archives/vienna/vien_69.htm"
      target="_blank">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a>
      1969, the words of treaty provisions must be given their
      ordinary meaning; and by Article 32, recourse may not be had
      to the traveaux preparatoire unless the meaning of the treaty
      provisions is on the face of it unclear, or possibly, where
      all the parties are in agreement so to refer. To suggest that
      only female circumcision is to be regarded as in breach of
      the various conventions on Human Rights, and the Convention
      on the Rights of the Child in particular, is both to deny the
      medical evidence as to the pain, risks and sexual dysfunction
      from male circumcision and also to argue for the
      formalisation of discrimination against these male children
      on the grounds of their sex, race and the religious beliefs
      of the family into which they are born: those who would so
      suggest must produce compelling arguments that this is
      proper.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Article 37</b></p>

          <p>States Parties shall ensure that:</p>

          punishment......"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Given the pain, risks, diminution of sexual function and
      loss of privacy, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in a
      number of important areas of life, non-therapeutic
      circumcision is a grave breach of this common provision of
      international instruments on human rights.</p>

      <p>Bearing in mind the predictable cries that this paper will
      inevitably provoke, bearing in mind that many circumcisions
      are performed by doctors (whether they purport to be acting
      qua doctor or in some other capacity) and also bearing in
      mind the unacceptability of a "pick-and-mix" approach to
      legal protections, it would be apposite to cite part of The
      <a href="/library/ethics/nuremberg/">Nuremberg Code</a>
      (1947) (which followed the unspeakably depraved behaviour of
      the Nazis) as to medical ethics:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Principle I</b>: The voluntary consent of the human
          subject is absolutely essential. This means that the
          person involved should have the legal capacity to give
          consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise
          free power of choice, without the intervention of any
          element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching or
          other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should
          have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the
          elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him
          to make an understanding and enlightened decision.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Circumcision of minors violates the principle of informed
      consent because they do not have legal capacity to give
      consent, are unable to exercise free power of choice, and
      have no knowledge and comprehension of the amputation or its
      short- and long-term consequences. Parental consent to
      non-medically indicated circumcision is invalid because it
      steps outside their duty and right to consent to treatment on
      behalf of their children in lifethreatening situations.</p>

      <p>Further, as to medical ethics, the British Medical
      Association wrote<sup><a href="#n177">177</a></sup>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The standard established by the World Medical
          Association &mdash;<a href="/library/ethics/tokyo/">the
          Declaration of Tokyo</a> &mdash; gives little scope for
          ambiguity on whether or not doctors should become
          involved in torture [of prisoners]. It makes it clear
          that "the doctor shall not countenance, condone or
          participate in the practice of torture or other forms of
          cruel, inhuman or degrading procedures."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      There can be no doubt, in the light of the evidence here
      touched on, that non-therapeutic circumcision is a form of
      cruel and inhuman treatment with grave impact on the victim's
      physical and emotional health, function, and bodily
      integrity; and thus offending national and international
      laws.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>A Uruguayan psychiatrist, when questioned about his
      participation in torture, replied: "I was confined to my
      function. I ignored other aspects and there were some aspects
      I didn't want to know about ..... It wasn't my purpose. I am
      a doctor"; a remark which chillingly echoes that by Rudolf
      Hess at his trial at Nuremberg: "I really never gave much
      thought to whether it [mass killing] was wrong. It just
      seemed a necessity. We just never heard anything else." On
      all the evidence, this callousness and indifference to the
      individual by circumcisers contains the same mind-set, the
      same abdication of responsibility.</p>

      <h2><a id="discr" name="discr"></a>20. Discrimination</h2>

      <p>There are many attitudes which are, rightly, abhorred by a
      civilised society, condemned by international conventions and
      prohibited by national legislation: these include
      discrimination on various grounds. Yet the discrimination
      against boys in permitting the inevitably damaging mutilation
      of their genitals, whilst enacting legislation to declare as
      criminal the similar procedure when done to girls, is at the
      least as damaging as any other expression of discrimination,
      and given the resulting and irreparable sexual dysfunction
      the more so; this mutilation involves the amputation of
      highly functional and sensitive flesh, thereby ablating the
      victim's ability fully to enjoy sexual intercourse.</p>

      <p><a href="http://mypage.direct.ca/d/dch/kluge1.html"
      target="_blank">Kluge</a>, a professor of philosophy,
      compares female circumcision with male circumcision and,
      expressing the same views on both, writes<sup><a
      href="#n178">178</a></sup>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"To argue differently is to be guilty of
          discrimination on the basis of sex....Both involve what
          in other contexts would be called nonconsensual
          mutilation of a minor for nonmedical reasons."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Further, to allow circumcision further discriminates
      between those boys who, because of an accident of birth, face
      non-therapeutic circumcision and those more fortunate boys
      who do not; and worse still to countenance the enactment of
      legislation to permit the continuation of such a mutilation
      for ritual reasons (but only for some who do it for this
      reason: yet another act of discrimination) presumably thus
      depriving the boy of his ability to sue those responsible for
      his grievous injury as he can now do.</p>

      <p>Rejoicing, rightly, in our being a multi-cultural society
      does not, as has been demonstrated above, mean that we should
      be blind to practices, whatever their source and motive,
      which are themselves abusive and discriminatory of others,
      and which directly and inevitably diminish the freedoms, the
      human rights, the integrity and the dignity of others.</p>

      <h2><a id="end" name="end"></a>21. Conclusion</h2>

      <p>Non-therapeutic circumcision is painful, risky and
      disabling; as such it is unlawful and offends against
      domestic and international laws: it gives rise to criminal
      and civil liability. It raises issues of individual human
      rights, moral issues, issues of discrimination, physical and
      psychological damage: it is an abuse (sexual, physical and
      emotional) of the child.</p>

      <p>It does not involve the consent of the injured party in
      any way at all; indeed the victim's reactions clearly
      demonstrate, as clearly as the child is able, his pain,
      terror and lack of consent. The purported `consent' (more
      appropriately to be seen as `assent') by others to the
      infliction of this, typically unanaesthetised, amputation
      breaches legal obligations of parental duties, and thus
      breaches legal provisions for the protection of the weak and
      innocent child. The inclusion of this issue in the
      Consultation Paper, which deals with the questions of consent
      by a person for himself to the infliction on himself of
      injury by another, is misconceived and based on inadequate
      consideration of the legal position and a complete failure to
      consider the medical position.</p>

      <p>Although existing laws are sufficient to sustain a
      prosecution and a civil claim arising from circumcision, for
      the avoidance of any doubt (for the same reasons that the <a
      href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/statutes/pfca85.htm"
       target="_blank">Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act
      1985</a> was passed) and to avoid discrimination as between
      the sexes and/or between groups of male children, male
      non-therapeutic circumcision should be accorded the same
      legislative prohibition as female circumcision.</p>

      <p>It might, however, in contrast to the 1985 Act, be
      acceptable to permit a man over the age of 18 (and in line
      with the current provision for tattooing) to consent to have
      himself circumcised for cultural or religious reasons, as an
      exception to the general rule proposed by the Law Commission
      in the Consultation Paper as to the continuing ban on the
      consensual infliction of seriously disabling injury. But
      circumcision done as a non-therapeutic procedure to an
      unconsenting child is abhorrent, destructive and a legal,
      ethical and moral affront which has no place in any society
      which wishes to call itself civilised, not least as we near
      the 21st century. As Karl Menninger has said: "What's done to
      children, they will do to society." And as Gandhi said: "If
      we are to have real peace, we must begin with the
      children."</p>
