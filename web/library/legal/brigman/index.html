            The maltreatment of children is as old as recorded
            history. Infanticide, ritual sacrifice, exposure,
            mutilation, abandonment, brutal discipline and the near
            slavery of child labor have existed in all cultures at
            different periods, and have been justified by disparate
            beliefs - that they were necessary to placate a god, to
            expel spirits, to maintain the stability of a race or
            simply to inculcate learning. Practices viewed today as
            victimizing children were accepted for long periods in
            civilized communities as "in the best interest" of
            society. The Spartans with their exposure of infants,
            the English and New England owners of factories partly
            "manned" by children of eight or ten, the Southern
            slave owners, were all convinced that their treatment
            was beneficial to the community and perhaps to the
            children themselves.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Despite the great concern about child abuse among scholars
      and legislators in the past twenty years, the same type of
      cultural astigmatism which prevented past generations from
      perceiving their actions as child abuse prevent contemporary
      Americans from perceiving or acknowledging the most
      widespread form of child abuse in society today: child
      mutilation through routine neonatal circumcision of males. In
      a society in which over 89% of all males are circumcised
      within a few hours of birth, it may be difficult to conceive
      of circumcision as mutilation. However, from the perspective
      of a neutral outsider, neonatal circumcision is as barbarous
      as female circumcision, the removal of earlobes, fingers or
      toes, the binding of infant female feet or other disfiguring
      practices around the world.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Since circumcision is not medically warranted, has no
      significant physiological benefits, is painful because it is
      performed without anesthesia and leaves a wound in which
      urinary salts burn, carries a significant risk of surgical
      complications, including death, and deforms the penis, it
      would seem that as a nonaccidental physical injury, it is
      properly included in the definition of child abuse. This
      paper will examine the medical and psychological case against
      routine neonatal circumcision and will discuss the potential
      legal and constitutional barriers to treating the practice as
      child abuse.</p>

      <h3>II.&nbsp;&nbsp; H<font size="2">ISTORY AND</font> P<font
      size="2">RACTICE OF</font> C<font
      size="2">IRCUMCISION</font></h3>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Male circumcision has three forms 1) simple circumcision,
      which involves only the removal of the foreskin or prepuce;
      2) subincision (also known as ariltha), found among the
      Australian aborigines, which involves longitudinally cutting
      the urethra from the glans to the scrotum and opening the
      urethral canal, giving the penis a flat and sometimes
      bifurcated appearance; and 3) superincision, used in
      Polynesia, which involves cutting the preputium from the
      upper surface and extending the cut to the pubic region.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      While male circumcision is a relatively common practice,
      female circumcision of various types is not so widespread; it
      is not surprising that such mutilation is normally found only
      in preliterate societies.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Circumcision may be the oldest form of surgery.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> The Egyptians,
      who probably acquired the practice from African tribes,
      practiced circumcision as early as 4000 B. C. In the Jewish
      religion, the origin of circumcision is attributed to
      Abraham, who established a "blood covenant" with God through
      circumcision. The practice is also part of the pre-Islamic
      Arabic tradition and became a near prerequisite to becoming a
      Moslem. The practice is very widespread and is unknown only
      to Indo-Germanic people, the Mongols, and non-Moslem
      Finno-Ugrian races. Circumcision, although known, is not
      widely practiced in India.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Anthropologists,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> psychologists, and
      psychiatrists<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> have offered a variety of
      explanations for the practice: enhanced or decreased sexual
      performance, societal prestige, sacrifice to fertility gods,
      tribal signs, tests for endurance, reincarnation, and
      hygienic reasons. However, with the exception of Jews, for
      whom circumcision has long been a tribal sign, widespread
      circumcision in the United States appears to be largely a
      late nineteenth century development. For non-Jews, it serves
      neither as a means of tribal integration, or separation and
      identification, non as an initiation to establish male
      identity. The customary justification for the mutilation is
      hygienic, but it seem to have been primarily grounded in the
      anti-masturbation hysteria of the late 1800s. It was feared
      that the boy with a foreskin which had to be pulled back
      while cleaning would learn to masturbate - a practice widely
      believed to lead to insanity and numerous other
      illnesses.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      With the blessing and active cooperation of the medical
      profession, removal of the foreskin of newborns became part
      of standard hospital practice. The exact number of neonatal
      circumcisions performed each year is unknown since there is
      no systematic record is kept of ritual, religious or medical
      circumcisions. However, informed estimates are that 80% to
      90% of all male infants are routinely circumcised. For
      example, George Washington University Medical Center reported
      that 79% of male infants were circumcised between 1978 and
      1980;<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></font> the
      largest hospital in Salt Lake County, Utah, reported an
      average circumcision rate of 92% from 1975 to 1979;<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> and a survey
      of physicians in 1981 found that 80% of them believed that
      over 90% of their male patients were circumcised.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></font></p>

      Although physicians were early proponents of circumcision for
      hygienic reasons, the preponderance of medical opinion today
      is opposed to the practice. A major development in the move
      away from routine circumcision occurred in 1949 when
      <cite>The British Medical Journal</cite> published a <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">study</a> by Dr. Douglas
      Gairdner which informed physicians that it was perfectly
      normal for an infant's prepuce to be nonretractable for up to
      four years and that nonretractability of the foreskin was
      therefore not a justification for circumcision.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> Not only is
      routine surgery unwarranted, but an <a
      href="/library/procedure/patel/">article</a> published in
      1966 in <cite>The Canadian Medical Association Journal</cite>
      reported a complication rate running as high as 55% for
      hospital performed routine neonatal circumcisions.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></font> Other
      studies showed that approximately 10% of all circumcisions
      had to be repeated.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> While most of the surgical
      complications were minor, Dr. Robert L. Baker, writing in a
      1979 issue of <cite>Sexual Medicine Today</cite> calculated
      that 229 infants died in the United States as a result of
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In 1970 the <cite>Journal of the American Medical
      Association</cite> published a well-documented <a
      href="/library/general/preston/">study</a> entitled
      <cite>Whither the Foreskin?</cite> which concluded that
      "circumcision of the newborn is a procedure that should no
      longer be considered routine."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> The following year the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap#1971">Committee on the Fetus
      and the Newborn</a> of the American Academy of Pediatrics
      concluded that there were no valid medical reasons for
      routine neonatal circumcision. That position was reaffirmed
      by its Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> The
      <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>, which had give birth to
      the movement with its 1949 article, officially stated <a
      href="/library/general/BMJ/"><cite>The Case Against
      Circumcision</cite></a> in May 1979. It pointed out that
      while over 80% of American males are circumcised, only 6% of
      male infants in England and Wales undergo the practice and
      that circumcision is virtually unknown in Scandinavia, with
      no adverse effects seen in the unshorn.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Amazingly, it has been argued that the infant suffers little
      or no pain in the circumcision process. The evidence which is
      offered is that in the ritual Jewish circumcision, the
      infant, who is given an alcohol teat during surgery, cries
      little and almost immediately goes to sleep. That argument
      shows an ignorance of the effects of alcohol on infants and
      fails to acknowledge that "sleep" may be response to pain.
      Studies of infants circumcised in hospitals show that the
      surgery is physiologically stressful. <a
      href="/library/pain/talbert/">Talbert and others</a> examined
      adrenal-cortical response to circumcision and found responses
      congruent with severe stress.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> Three studies of non-REM
      sleep patterns following circumcision of infants lead to the
      same conclusion.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> Although there is some
      disagreement as to the effect of the intervening variable of
      wakefulness (itself a stress indicator), the studies clearly
      demonstrate a pattern of sleep disorganization consistent
      with major stress.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The potential long-term physiological and psychological
      consequences of circumcision are not known.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small>This lack of information is particularly
          troubling, since the human brain is especially vulnerable
          to both exogenous and endogenous influences during the
          interval from the latter part of pregnancy to about 18
          months of age. Since animal studies reveal long-term
          behavioral, physiological, anatomical and
          neuro-pharmacological effects of minor events in early
          life, the effects of circumcision on newborns should not
          be considered short-lived in the absence of evidence to
          the contrary.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n21">21</a></sup></font></small></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      There are no adequate studies of the effect of circumcision
      on later sexual performance and attitudes. In a 1959 <a
      href="/library/anatomy/winkelmann/">study</a>, Dr. Winkelmann
      of the Mayo Clinic contended that the foreskin itself is a
      specific type of erogenous zone and that its removal was
      significant:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>[T]he specific type of erogenous zone is found in
          the mucocutaneous regions of the body. Such specific
          sites of acute sensation in the body are the genital
          regions, including the prepuce, penis, clitoris, and
          external genitalia of the female, and the perianal skin,
          lip nipple and conjunctiva. It is the special anatomy of
          these regions that requires the use of the term
          "specific" when one speaks of erotic sensations
          originating in the skin. This anatomy favors acute
          perception.</small>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Similarly, <a href="/news/1966.07_Foley/">Dr. Foley</a>
      argues that "after circumcision when the glans is exposed to
      soiled diapers and rough clothing, this membrane becomes ten
      times thicker, and the free nerve-endings disappear. The
      surface becomes covered with an adherent layer of dead cells,
      rough dry and insensitive."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      To the contrary, however, Masters and Johnson found no
      significant differences in sensitivity of thirty-five
      non-circumcised and thirty-five circumcised males of similar
      ages. "Routine neurologic testing for both exterceptive and
      light tactile discrimination were conducted on the ventral
      and dorsal surfaces of the penile body with particular
      attention directed toward the glans. No clinically
      significant difference could be established between the
      circumcised and uncircumcised glans...."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Even if the findings of Masters and Johnson are accepted as
      conclusive, they merely establish that later sensitivity of
      the glans is not diminished. Their findings do not reach the
      critical objection that routine circumcision at birth is an
      unwarranted cruelty.</p>

      <h3>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp; C<font size="2">ONSTITUTIONAL AND</font>
      L<font size="2">EGAL</font> I<font size="2">SSUES</font></h3>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Since circumcision is medically unwarranted mutilation and
      disfigurement, it would appear to be a clear case of child
      abuse. A literal reading of criminal statutes gives that
      impression since mayhem, assault and battery, even when
      committed by parents or physicians are punishable crimes in
      every state criminal code. Furthermore, child abuse, commonly
      defined as the intentional, non-accidental use of physical
      force that result in injury to a child., is universally
      proscribed by state law. The California law is typical: "
      `[C]hild abuse' means a physical injury which is inflicted by
      other than accidental means on a child by another
      person."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> The code goes on to
      state:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>[A]ny person who wilfully inflicts upon any child
          ... injury resulting in a traumatic condition is guilty
          of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be
          punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or
          4 years or in the county jail for not more than one
          year.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n26">26</a></sup></font></small>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
      before it can be concluded that the state can, should, or has
      already outlawed the practice of circumcision through the
      adoption of general criminal statutes or child abuse
      statutes, the contemporary state of child abuse law and the
      social and religious views toward circumcision necessitate
      analysis of several major constitutional and legal issues,
      including the constitutional rights of parents, the nature of
      the family, and the right to privacy.</p>

      <p><cite>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constitutional Rights of Parents
      and Family Autonomy</cite></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Parental rights to the custody and control of their minor
      children are as old as civilization itself. Thomas Aquinas
      used the education of one's offspring as one of the most
      obvious examples of the operation of natural law.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></font> Modern
      judges refer to parents' custodial rights as "sacred," as a
      matter of natural law," <font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> and as inherent natural
      rights, for the protection of which, just as much as for the
      protection of the rights of the individual to life, liberty,
      and the pursuit of happiness, our government is formed."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Because the right to bear children is so basic, some believe
      it antedates the state.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small>Our political system is superimposed on and
          presupposes a social system of family units, not just of
          isolated individuals. No assumption more deeply underlies
          our society than the assumption that is the individual
          who decides to raise a family, with whom to raise a
          family, and, in broad measure, what values and beliefs to
          inculcate in the children who will later exercise the
          rights and responsibilities of citizens and heads of
          families.</small></p>
          ... 

          <p><small>...[T]he family unit does not simply co-exist
          with our constitutional system; it is an integral part of
          it. In democratic theory as well as practice, it is the
          family that children are expected to learn the values and
          beliefs that democratic institutions later draw on to
          determine group directions. The immensely important power
          of deciding about matters of early socialization has been
          allocated to the family not the government.<font

          href="#n30">30</a></sup></font></small></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      this reason, as well as because of the historical exclusion
      of family matters from the concern of the state, there has
      been great reluctance on the part of the courts to become
      involved in family governance. The position is well stated by
      the New York Court of Appeals:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>

      The rights of parents to the care and custody of their
      children is not expressly stated in the Constitution.
      However, the United States Supreme Court has upheld the
      fundamental rights of family integrity and recognized that
      there exists a private realm of family life beyond state
      control. Significantly, the Court has not yet decided a case
      which it perceived as presenting a clear conflict between the
      rights of the parent and the child.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Many of the cases which uphold parental rights are based upon
      a preference for traditional parent-controlled family life
      and involve parental rights to control the education of the
      their children. The first major case was <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/262/390.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Meyer v. Nebraska</cite></a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></font> in which the
      Court, in striking down a law prohibiting the teaching of
      German in the public schools, specifically addressed the
      rights of parents to control their children's education. The
      Court held that the due process clause of the fourteenth
      amendment included the right to "marry, establish a home, and
      bring up children."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup></font> Two years later in <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/268/510.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Pierce v. Society of
      Sisters</cite></a>,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></font> the Court struck down an
      Oregon compulsory school- attendance law which effectively
      outlawed private schools. Justice McReynolds, speaking for
      the Court, argued that "the child is not the mere creature of
      the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have
      the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and
      prepare him for additional obligations."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></font></p>

      In one of the few non-education, non-religious cases touching
      on parental rights, <a

      target="_blank"><cite>May v. Anderson</cite></a>,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup></font> the Supreme
      Court stated that one of the most fundamental rights in the
      "immediate right to the care, custody, management and
      companionship of minor children."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> Using this logic, the Court

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      target="_blank"><cite>Ginsberg v. New York</cite></a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup></font> a majority
      of the Court justified a law prohibiting the sale of
      pornography to a minor on the grounds that the law
      supplemented parental guidance which was not always present.
      In clear obiter dicta it stated that "[c]onstitutional
      interpretation has consistently recognized the parents claim
      to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of
      their children is basic to the structure of society."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup></font> Since the
      Court could have easily upheld the law without reference to
      parental authority, the dicta serve as an indication of the
      depth of judicial feeling on the subject of parental
      rights.</p>

      <cite>Stanley</cite> made it very clear that the mere
      assertion of a parens patriae interest in the protection of
      the child was insufficient to warrant abridgement of parental
      rights unless the potential harm to the child was
      significant. The opinion in <a

      The generalized claims of parental constitutional rights have
      not been without challenge; courts at all levels of the
      judicial heirarchy have occasionally intruded into the family
      relationship to protect children. The most important Supreme
      Court cases reflecting state and judicial intervention are <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Prince v.
      Massachussetts</cite></a>,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup></font> and the cases involving the
      rights of teenage females to have abortions.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup></font> In
      <cite>Prince</cite>, the Court sustained the conviction of a
      Jehovah's Witness for violating a state law prohibiting
      street solicitation by children. The Court explicitly
      rejected the mother's due process and religious freedom
      arguments. It also refused to accept the mother's claim on
      behalf of the nine year old girl who had enthusiastically
      volunteered to sell religious tracts in public streets. While
      acknowledging that there were "sacred private interests"
      associated with the mother's claims, the Court held that the
      state had the power to limit parental control in the interest
      of children. The essence of the opinion is captured in the
      statement that "[p]arents may be free to become martyrs
      themselves. But it does not follow they are free ... to make
      martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of
      full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for
      themselves."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On first impression, <cite>Prince v. Massachusetts</cite>
      appears to have been significantly narrowed in 1972 by <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/406/205.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Wisconsin v. Yoder</cite></a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></font> which upheld
      Amish parents' rights to refuse to educate their children
      beyond the eighth grade. The freedom of parents to impose
      their values on their children, which had been significantly
      narrowed in <cite>Prince</cite>, was very broadly restated in
      <cite>Yoder</cite>, especially when those parental values are
      based on a strong and distinct religious belief. Implying
      that the Court might have taken a different view if it had
      not been convinced of the sincerity of the parents' beliefs,
      Chief Justice Burger relied heavily on <cite>Pierce</cite>
      and the "history and culture of Western civilizations [which]
      reflect[s] a strong tradition of parental concern for the
      nurture and upbringing of their children."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Under <cite>Yoder</cite>, parental authority and discretion
      may be challenged only "if it appears that parental decisions
      will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a
      potential for significant social burdens."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup></font> The
      <cite>Yoder</cite> Court specifically pointed to the
      <cite>Georgetown College</cite> case,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></font> which allowed the giving of a
      transfusion contrary to the wishes of the parents, as an
      example of the kind of situation in which child jeopardy
      might warrant interference with parental authority.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Is the assertion of parental rights in <cite>Wisconsin v.
      Yoder</cite> a barrier to state intervention to prevent
      circumcision? The answer is a clear "no" in cases where
      religious convictions are not involved. Yoder is controlling,
      if at all, in those <cite>criminal</cite> cases in which
      parents are being prosecuted for refusal to perform an act
      which is contrary to their strongly held religious beliefs.
      At most, Yoder creates an exception to the general rule
      stated in <cite>Prince v. Massachussetts</cite> that parents
      actions harmful to children are actionable in courts. The
      heavy emphasis on the great sincerity and the exceptional
      religious beliefs in <cite>Yoder</cite> clearly requires
      limiting the case to similar situations.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Furthermore, the majority in <cite>Yoder</cite> explicitly
      noted that the rights of the parents and not the rights of
      the children were being decided:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>Contrary to the suggestions of the dissenting
          opinion ... our holding today in no degree depends on the
          assertion of the religious interest of the child as
          contrasted with that of the parents. It is the parents
          who are subject to prosecution here for failing to cause
          their children to attend school, and it is their right of
          free exercise, not that of their children that must
          determine Wisconsin's power to impose criminal penalties
          on the parent.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n51">51</a></sup></font></small>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Because the Court explicitly refused to consider the rights
      of the children involved in the controversy, or to determine
      if their interests were contrary to those of their parents,
      the Court effectively limited the precedential value of
      <cite>Yoder</cite> to those cases where parents and their
      children do not have conflicting interests.
      <cite>Yoder</cite> was decided in a vacuum in which the harm
      to the child was hypothetical or not established. The Court
      seemed to assume, as Justice Douglas pointed out in dissent,
      that all Amish children would remain in Amish communities
      (although the evidence was to the contrary) and therefore
      might not suffer detriment from the imposition of parental
      values.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Such a conclusion, and as resultant avoidance of a
      determination of children's rights, is not possible with
      regard to circumcision. Once a child is subjected to
      circumcision, painfully and medically unwarranted
      disfigurement is inevitable, affecting every child on whose
      behalf the choice is made. Moreover, the loss of education
      can be at least partially remedied at a later point.
      Circumcision is irreversible. These factors distinguish
      circumcision from the denial of education involved in
      <cite>Yoder</cite> and make the case inapplicable as a
      precedent. <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Prince v. Massachussetts</cite></a> is
      the controlling precedent, and parents who impose the
      unnecessary pain and suffering of circumcision can be made
      answerable to state law.</p>

      <p><cite>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom of Religion</cite></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Assuming arguendo that the state can outlaw circumcision
      under its general criminal laws and/or child abuse statutes,
      must it provide a religious exception for members of those
      religious sects for whom the practice is an essential part of
      the religion? A specific analysis of this issue is necessary
      because of the importance of circumcision in the Jewish and
      Muslim religions. It requires the evaluation of the cases
      decided under the religion clause of the first amendment to
      determine the basis for which religious groups have been
      granted exemptions from general law.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The first major constitutional conflict between the free
      exercise of religion and secular law reached the Supreme
      Court in <cite>Reynolds v. United States</cite><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></font> and involved
      the prosecution of a Mormon for bigamy. The Court
      distinguished between religious beliefs and religious
      practices and ruled that while the government could not
      interfere with religious beliefs, it could limit practices
      performed in the name of religion that were harmful to
      society. To rule otherwise, according to the Court would be
      to "make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior
      to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen
      to become a law unto himself."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Since the <cite>Reynolds</cite> decision in 1878, the
      belief-action dichotomy has been used to regulate activities
      which the state thought harmful to the participants or to the
      public. Thus, freedom of religion cannot be a pretext for
      engaging in commercial fortune telling; it cannot be used as
      a guide for the unlicensed practice of medicine despite the
      sincere belief of its practitioners; it cannot be used to
      void local anti-noise ordinances; it presents no protection
      against prosecution for fraud other than to diminish intent;
      and most relevant for our purposes, religious freedom has not
      been an adequate defense against a state law specifically
      outlawing the handling of poisonous and non-poisonous snakes
      as an integral, essential part of a religious service.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      A second group of cases has involved attempts to force
      Jehovah's Witnesses to comply with state laws on a variety of
      subjects. In the first case to apply the free exercise clause
      through the fourteenth amendment, <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/310/296.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Cantwell v.
      Connecticut</cite></a>,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup></font> the Supreme Court found that
      a state could not prosecute a Jehovah's Witness for
      soliciting money without a permit. In <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/319/624.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Board of Education v.
      Barnette</cite></a>,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup></font> the Supreme Court invalidated
      statutes requiring Jehovah's Witness children to salute the
      flag in public schools. The reasoning of the Court in the
      Barnette case is important for the present discussion. The
      Court found that the flag salute statute violated the
      religious establishment and free exercise clauses of the
      first amendment and emphasized that <cite>the refusal to
      salute would have no effect on others</cite>. This impact
      test is important and we will return to it later.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In the "Sunday Closing" cases,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup></font> the Court upheld a group of
      state laws which placed heavy economic burdens on Orthodox
      Jews, Sabbatarians, and others whose religions already
      required them to abstain from work on Saturday. Disagreeing
      with a dissenting Justice Brennan, who argued that the Sunday
      closing laws required the religious to chose between their
      business and their religion, the majority argued that the
      laws did not make any religious practice illegal and simply
      regulated secular activity. The Court admitted that the laws
      placed a burden on some but it actually affected "only those
      who believed it necessary to work on Sunday."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup></font> The Court
      argued that "[t]o strike down, without the most critical
      scrutiny, legislation which imposes only an indirect burden
      on the exercise of religion, i.e., legislation which does not
      make unlawful the religious practice itself, would radically
      restrict the operating latitude of the legislature.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup></font> Thus the
      essence of the Sunday Closing cases is that where the state
      enacts a general law designed to advance legitimate secular
      goals, the law is valid despite is indirect burden on
      religious practices.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Implicit in the Sunday closing cases is the requirement that
      the state use the least intrusive means to accomplish its
      legitimate purpose. This principle was made explicit in <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/374/398.html"
      target="_blank"><cite>Sherbert v. Verner</cite></a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup></font> which was
      decided the same day the Supreme Court struck down required
      Bible reading in the public school.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></font> <cite>Sherbert</cite>
      involved a woman denied employment compensation because she
      refused to take a job requiring her to work on her Sabbath.
      In overturning the state policy, the Court set forth a
      "compelling state interest" test which laws ever indirectly
      limiting religious freedom must meet: "[I]t is basic that no
      showing merely of a rational relationship to some colorable
      state interest would suffice; in this highly constitutional
      area, `[o]nly the gravest abuses, endangering the paramount
      interests, give occasion for permissable limitation."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <cite>Sherbert</cite> restates the rule set forth in the
      Sunday Closing cases but the outcome is different: the
      closing laws meet the "least intrusive means" test, but the
      denial of unemployment compensation in <cite>Sherbert</cite>
      could not. The state could have established an administrative
      procedure to allow reasonable exception to the requirement
      that a person must accept a job for which he or she is
      qualified or lose benefits.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The "least intrusive means" rule has been used to limit other
      state actions which have an indirect effect on religious
      freedom. It was the basis of the decision by the California
      Supreme Court that an ordinance making it illegal to possess
      peyote was an unconstitutional limitation of the religious
      freedom of the Navaho Indians.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></font> The California court
      determined that peyote was such an integral part of the
      religious ritual that the Navajos could not practice their
      religion without it. Unlike the Mormon case where polygamy
      was part of the religious belief but not part of the
      ceremony, the use of peyote was essential to the Navajo
      ceremony and therefore indispensable. The result of enforcing
      the peyote law would have been to terminate the religious
      practice and perhaps the religion itself.</p>

      The <cite>Sherbert</cite> least-intrusive doctrine also
      assisted the Amish, who relied very heavily on it in
      <cite>Wisconsin v. Yoder</cite>.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> The Amish successfully argued
      that the essential element of their faith was individual
      salvation achieved through a religious community separate
      from the outside world. Since the Amish religion, by its very
      nature, must be pervasive in the lives of its adherents, to
      prevent the Amish parents from withdrawing their children
      from public schools would have the effect of destroying the
      religion itself. The Supreme Court agreed:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>The essence of all that is said and written on the
          subject is that only those interests of the highest order
          and those not otherwise served can overbalance the
          legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion. We
          can accept it as settled, therefore. that however strong
          the State's interest in universal compulsory education,
          it is by no means absolute to the exclusion or
          subordination of all other interests.<font

      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Court was convinced that the non-public-school education of
      Amish children was adequate and therefore the exemption would
      not gravely undermine the legislative purpose. Citing
      <cite>Sherbert</cite>, the Court said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>A regulation neutral on its face may, in its ap-
          plication, nontheless offend the constitutional
          requirement for government neutrality. if it unduly
          burdens the free exercise of religion. ... By preserving
          doctrinal flexibility of the Religion Clauses "we have
          been able to chart a course that preserved the autonomy
          and freedom of religious bodies while avoiding any
          semblance of established religion. This is a tight rope
          and one we have successfully traversed."<font

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <cite>Yoder</cite> appears to provide a constitutional
      framework for setting aside an objectively legitimate state
      law so that a religious group can follow the dictates of its
      conscience. The Court seems to be saying that</p>

      Since the rite of circumcision is the <cite>sine qua
      non</cite> of Orthodox Judaism, in somewhat the same sense
      that isolation from the outside world is for the Amish,
      <cite>Yoder</cite> appears to be a particularly apt precedent
      in the circumcision controversy. Though it could be argued
      that circumcision is merely an initiation rite and not a way
      of life, and that <cite>Yoder</cite> is not a valid
      precedent, that argument misapprehends the extreme importance
      of circumcision to Orthodox Jews. It is difficult to
      overstate the significance of the ceremonial rite of
      circumcision. It is the token of the Covenant between God and
      Abraham:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>And God said unto Abraham: "and as for thee, thou
          shalt keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee
          throughout their generations. This is My covenant, which
          you shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after
          thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. And you
          shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; he
          that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
          every male throughout your generations...."<font
          size="2"><sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></font></small>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The importance of the ritual for Orthodox Jews is evidenced
      by the fact that it is one of the few acts permitted on the
      Sabbath if the eighth day falls there, not withstanding the
      prohibition of work and other activities on the Sabbath. Even
      more compelling is the requirement for the circumcision of
      dead infants:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <small>[A]n infant who dies before circumcision, whether
          within the eight days or thereafter, must be circumcised
          at the grave, in order to remove the foreskin which is a
          disgrace to him, but no benedictions should be pronounced
          over this circumcision. He should be given a name to
          perpetuate his memory and that mercy may be shown him
          from Heaven to be included in the resurrection of the
          dead, and that he may then have sufficient understanding
          to recognize his father and his mother.<font
          size="2"><sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></font></small>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Does the importance of circumcision in Orthodox Judaism
      constitutionally necessitate an exception to a general anti-
      circumcision statute? The answer is no. Despite the emphasis
      in <cite>Yoder</cite> on the sincerity of Amish beliefs,
      sincerity or intensity of belief cannot alone justify a
      religious dispensation from compliance with general laws.
      First, under the Constitution, the courts may not determine
      the legitimacy or intensity of religious beliefs.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup></font> Secondly,
      even if it were constitutionally permissible, it is extremely
      difficult to test or measure intensity of belief. How could a
      court properly distinguish between the intensity of Orthodox
      Jews' committment to circumcision and adherence to polygamy
      by the early Mormons in <cite>Reynolds</cite> or to snake
      handling in <cite>Hill v. Alabama</cite>?<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup></font> Even though
      by highlighting the intensity of belief as a justification,
      the Court in <cite>Wisconsin v. Yoder</cite> appears to offer
      dispensation based on that intensity, the facts in
      <cite>Yoder</cite> limit it to situations in which there is
      no conflict between the rights of the parent and the rights
      of the child.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Equally important, the <cite>Yoder</cite> Court notes that
      the state may interfere with parental discretion. "if it
      appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health
      and safety of the child, or have the potential for
      significant social burdens."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup></font> Although the example which
      the Court uses to illustrate its point involves a life
      threatening denial of a transfusion, the inclusion of
      "significant social burdens" in the definition broadens it
      considerably. To the extent that circumcision has potential
      for creating such social burdens, then it seems susceptible
      to state interference; moreover, circumcision can jeopardize
      the health, safety or even life of the child, as explained in
      Part III.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In short, there are two significant differences between the
      denial of education by parents on religious grounds and the
      religious rite of circumcision: (1) denial of education is at
      least partly reversible, whereas the disfigurement caused by
      removal of a body part is not, and (2) the physical pain and
      suffering, with potentially significant surgical and general
      health complications, inflicted on infants by circumcision is
      not found in parents' denial of education to their adolescent
      children.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Are these differences sufficient to prevent the creation of
      an exception to the general laws prohibiting circumcision?
      The answer to this question requires a judgment as to the
      personal and societal costs of inflicting pain and suffering
      on infants versus the value of maintaining a religious rite
      which is considered essential by adherents to a specific
      religion. The state can make an exception to application of
      its laws, as several states have in exempting Christian
      Scientists from child neglect laws,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup></font> but such an exception is not
      constitutionally required.</p>

      <p><cite>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Right to Privacy</cite></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The constitutional right to privacy does not constitute a
      barrier to treating circumcision as child abuse. Current
      state child abuse statutes modify the traditional
      physician-patient privacy privilege by requiring the
      physician to report child abuse. The irony here is that it is
      frequently physicians who are the perpertrators. If
      circumcision is treated as a criminal act, the whole issue of
      privacy ceases to have any meaning since the parties to an
      illegal conspiracy cannot claim privacy protection. Moreover,
      in the birth control and abortion cases basing the right to
      treatment on privacy, the physicians were protecting the
      right to privacy of their patients, not themselves.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup></font> Privacy
      rights are inappropriate to prevent state interference with
      the parents decision to subject their child to circumcision
      since the child is the patient not the parent. In <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/405/438.html"><cite>Eisenstadt
      v. Baird</cite></a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup></font> the Court ruled that the
      right to be free from governmental intrusion is the right of
      an individual, rather than a right granted to the family as
      an entity.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></font></p>

      <h3>V.&nbsp;&nbsp; R<font size="2">EMEDIES</font></h3>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The previous sections have established that the
      constitutional rights of parents, including freedom of
      religion, are inadequate to prevent the states from using
      their authority to treat circumcision as child abuse. The
      extent to which laws presently in existence can be used to
      prevent this practice is addressed next.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The most obvious way to proceed with enforcement of
      circumcision prohibitions is though criminal prosecution
      under existing state laws prohibiting assault and battery and
      conspiracy to assault and batter. Every state presently has
      laws which can be used for this purpose if circumcision is
      construed as battery. However, it will be extremely difficult
      to get a conviction, since circumcision is not culturally
      acknowledged as child abuse at the present time.
      Additionally, in some jurisdictions it may be difficult to
      establish the requisite criminal intent.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      For this reason, the civil law presently offers more fruitful
      avenues of approach. Because there are "no medical
      indications for routine circumcision,"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></font> the doctrine of informed
      consent requires that parents be told that such surgery is
      not required, that is is painful and that there are
      significant rates of surgical complications. Failure to give
      a complete explanation warrants a suit by parents, by the
      child or by a next friend acting on the child's behalf.
      Authorizing surgery on an infant after such a warning
      conceivably opens the door to a subsequent suit by the child
      against his parents. While state courts have been reluctant
      to allow suits by children against their parents, there is a
      growing trend to allow recovery where there is clear adverse
      interest.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Suits for damages against surgeons, hospitals, and
      conceivably parents, are possible because</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small>malice in the sense of ill will or a desire to
          cause injury is not essential to sustain a recovery for
          intentional wrongdoing. It is enough for the plaintiff to
          show that the defendant knowingly and intentionally did
          the act which caused the damage and that damage was
          substantially certain to follow.<font size="2"><sup><a
          href="#n79">79</a></sup></font></small></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The limitation posed by suits for negligence in this area is
      the same as that in the criminal law: negligence, like crime,
      is grounded in societally determined assumptions and
      expectations. Additionally, in the case of civil suits for
      circumcision, especially those cases without adverse medical
      complications, it will be difficult to establish damages
      other than pain and suffering. As a result, suits for damages
      are not likely to be numerous or very fruitful.</p>

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The most promising approach would seem to be a civil rights
      class action against hospitals designed to prevent routine
      neonatal circumcision, that is, in cases where circumcision
      is not medically warranted. A class action suit would focus
      on the individuals most culpable since competent surgeons are
      aware that routine neonatal circumcision is not good medical
      practice. It would also have the advantage of avoiding the
      constitutional issues of parental rights, as well as
      religious issues, since the Orthodox Jewish circumcision
      ceremony is not normally performed in medical centers by
      medical personnel.</p>
