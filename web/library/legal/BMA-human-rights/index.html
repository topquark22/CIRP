      Act 1998 on medical decision making</b></font> 

      <h3>October 2000</h3>

      <p>The Human Rights Act represents a major and welcome
      development in the protection of individual human rights in
      the United Kingdom. Over recent months there has been
      considerable speculation in the media and professional
      journals about the likely impact of the new legislation,
      including the impact on medical decision making. In many ways
      the true impact will not be known until a body of case law
      has developed to illustrate how UK courts interpret the
      Convention rights. What is clear, however, is that the
      introduction of the Human Rights Act does not represent a
      major change in practice for health professionals. The
      requirements of the Human Rights Act reflect, very closely,
      existing good practice. Decisions taken by doctors on the
      basis of current ethical standards are likely to be compliant
      with the Act. Issues such as human dignity, communication and
      consultation, and best interests which are central to good
      clinical practice are also pivotal to the Convention rights.
      It is likely however, at least initially, that attempts will
      be made to challenge medical decisions using the new
      legislation. It is therefore essential that decisions taken
      both about individual patients and in terms of medical
      policy, take account of Conventions rights, are transparent
      and can withstand scrutiny. Accurate and detailed recording
      of both the decision and the decision-making process also
      take on added importance.</p>

      <h3>Why is guidance needed?</h3>

      <h4>What is the Human Rights Act?</h4>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act 1998</a>, which came fully
      into force on 2 October 2000, incorporates into UK law the
      bulk of the substantive rights set out in the <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
      target="_blank">European Convention on Human Rights</a>.
      These include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Right to life (Article 2)</li>

        <li>Prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment
        or punishment (Article 3)</li>

        <li>Prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article
        4)</li>

        <li>Right to liberty and security (Article 5)</li>

        <li>Right to a fair trial (Article 6)</li>

        <li>No punishment without law (Article 7)</li>

        <li>Right to respect for private and family life (Article
        8)</li>

        <li>Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article
        9)</li>

        <li>Freedom of expression (Article 10)</li>

        <li>Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11)</li>

        <li>Right to marry (Article 12)</li>

        <li>Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14)</li>

        <li>Restrictions on political activity of aliens (Article
        16)</li>

        <li>Prohibition of abuse of rights (Article 17)</li>

        <li>Limitation on use of restrictions on rights (Article
        18)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Those who believe their rights have been violated by a
      public authority now have recourse to the UK courts whereas
      previously they would have had to take their case to the <a
      href="http://www.echr.coe.int/" target="_blank">European
      Court</a> in Strasbourg.</p>

      <p>In addition, UK courts and tribunals (including those
      considering applications for court declarations) are required
      to take account of the Human Rights Act and to ensure that
      the development of the common law is compatible with the
      Convention rights. The way in which the UK courts will
      interpret the Convention rights and the impact these will
      have on medical decision making is a matter of speculation.
      Although the courts must take into account existing
      Strasbourg case law, the Convention is a 'living instrument',
      which means that it should be interpreted in the light of
      present day conditions. This means that interpretation must
      reflect changing social attitudes which include patient
      expectations and ethical standards. Therefore recent
      decisions are likely to be of most significance and it is
      important to maintain an awareness of the growing body of
      case law in the UK.</p>

      <p><b>Why is the Human Rights Act relevant to medical
      treatment?</b><br />
       The <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> is relevant to health
      care providers since it regulates the relationship between
      individuals and public authorities. It is unlawful for public
      authorities 'to act in a way which is incompatible with a
      Convention right'. The description of a public authority
      given in the Act includes: the Department of Health, health
      authorities, Health Trusts, Primary Care Groups and Trusts in
      England, Primary Care Trusts in Scotland, Local Health Groups
      in Wales and the equivalent bodies, still to be established,
      in Northern Ireland. Individual doctors working within the
      NHS are almost certainly public authorities and it has been
      suggested that doctors working privately may also fall into
      that category. (The degree to which the work of private
      doctors is covered by the Act remains a matter of speculation
      and once this matter has been clarified the BMA will include
      information on its website) This means that from October 2000
      doctors working within the NHS throughout the UK are required
      by law to observe the Convention rights in reaching decisions
      and must be able to demonstrate that they have done so. Even
      if it emerges that private doctors are not classed as public
      authorities, the BMA believes, as a matter of good practice,
      that all doctors should ensure that their decisions are
      compliant with the Act.<br />
      </p>

      <p>Many doctors are not accustomed to thinking in terms of
      "rights" but one of the purposes of this guidance is to show
      the way in which accepted good practice, focused on patients'
      wishes and interests, closely echoes the requirements of the
      <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a>. In many cases,
      considering Convention rights will not alter the final
      decision, but the way in which the decision is reached will
      differ (by specifically considering human rights issues) and
      there will be greater transparency and scrutiny of the
      decision-making process.</p>

      <h4>How will decision making differ?</h4>

      <p>Decision making by all public authorities must now be
      approached from a new perspective. In addition to the range
      of questions considered in the past, there are two further
      questions to ask in each case:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Are someone's human rights affected by the decision?
        And, if so,</li>

        <li>Is it legitimate to interfere with them?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It will take time for doctors to become sufficiently
      familiar with these new requirements for them to become a
      standard and routine part of the decision-making process. The
      dilemmas doctors are confronted with will not change but the
      terms within which they must address them will. Many aspects
      of existing good practice - such as careful assessment of
      best interests, balancing conflicting rights and consulting
      with patients and, as appropriate, their relatives - take on
      added importance as a result of the Human Rights Act, which
      makes them a required part of the decision-making process.
      Doctors are accustomed to taking into account the duties owed
      to patients and so the Human Rights Act should not involve
      major changes for them although decision making may initially
      take longer until this new way of thinking about those duties
      becomes incorporated into everyday practice. It is not,
      however, something doctors can opt out of and all their
      medical decisions are potentially open to challenge.</p>

      <h3>Which human rights are relevant?</h3>
      Articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 are likely to be the
      most relevant to medical decisions although other Articles
      may also be relevant. Convention rights are divided into
      three types:

      <ul>
        <li>absolute rights (Article 3, 4 and 7), from which no
        derogation is permitted although even these rights are open
        to interpretation;</li>

        <li>limited rights (Article 2, 5 and 6) where the
        limitations are explicitly stated in the wording of the
        Article; and</li>

        <li>qualified rights (Articles 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) where
        derogation is permitted but any action must: be based in
        law, meet Convention aims, be non-discriminatory, necessary
        in a democratic society and proportionate.</li>
      </ul>
      Article 14 does not give a free standing right but may only
      be invoked in a claim for some other Convention right (see
      section 2.8).

      <p>Until a body of case law develops in the UK, it is unclear
      what impact the Human Rights Act will have on medical
      decision making. This guidance draws on existing cases from
      the European Court and Commission and advises on the likely
      impact of the Act on the day-to-day decisions of health
      professionals. It illustrates the way in which Convention
      rights are relevant to some common medical decisions. It is
      not possible to provide guidance for every scenario but the
      aim of this document is to use common examples to illustrate
      how a human rights approach can be incorporated into decision
      making, the general principles of which can then be applied
      to other situations. As UK case law develops and provides
      clarity on issues where it is only possible, at present, to
      speculate, additional information will be provided on the
      BMA's website.</p>

      <p>Doctors are also affected by the Act in other ways, for
      example, as employers or employees and in relation to the
      protection of their own rights. In certain circumstances, for
      example, the duty placed on public authorities extends to
      taking measures designed to ensure the proper protection of
      staff from the infringement of their Convention rights by
      others (such as protecting doctors from violent or racially
      abusive patients [British Medical Association Medical
      Education Department (in press) Provision of care to violent
      and racially abusive patients, BMA: London.]. These aspects
      of the Act are not covered by this guidance, which is limited
      to medical decision making, but specific advice may be sought
      from the BMA on these and other matters concerning the
      legislation.</p>

      <p><b>Article 2 - Right to life</b><br />
      1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No
      one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the
      execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction
      of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.</p>

      <p>2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted
      in contravention of this Article when it results from the use
      of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:<br />
       (a) In defence of any person from unlawful violence;<br />
       (b) In order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the
      escape of a person lawfully detained;<br />
       (c) In action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a
      riot or insurrection.</p>

      <p>The introduction of a "right to life" in the Human Rights
      Act does not mean that doctors must always strive to prolong
      life but that specific consideration must be given to this
      right as part of the medical decision-making process. Article
      2 imposes positive and negative obligations on public
      authorities (X-v-FRG Appl, (1984)), such that they have a
      duty to take adequate and appropriate steps to protect the
      life of individuals in their care (X-v-UK (1978) 14 DR 31),
      as well as not to take life intentionally. It is therefore
      arguable that a health care provider is obliged to make
      adequate provision for medical care in all cases where the
      right to life of a patient could be at risk, and that
      withholding or withdrawing any life prolonging treatment
      could be in breach of Article 2.</p>

      <p>The extent of the public authority's obligation, however,
      is limited to that which is reasonable (Osman-v-UK (1998) 29
      EHRR 245). The UK courts began to consider human rights
      arguments before the Human Rights Act was implemented and in
      one of the first cases to specifically address the issue (A
      National Health Service Trust v D &amp; Ors (2000) TLR
      19/7/2000), Mr Justice Cazalet made clear that Article 2 does
      not require the prolongation of life in all circumstances (In
      considering whether the withdrawal of life-prolonging
      treatment would be contrary to Article 2, Mr Justice Cazalet
      said "[t]here does not appear to be a decision of the <a
      href="http://www.echr.coe.int/" target="_blank">European
      Court</a> which indicates that the approach adopted by the
      English courts in situations such as this is contrary to
      Article 2".). In that case, concerning non-resuscitation of a
      19-month-old child ("I") who had severe disabilities and a
      very short life-expectancy, it was held that withholding
      life-prolonging treatment did not breach Article 2 because
      the decision was made on the basis of the child's best
      interests.</p>

      <p>"I" was born in November 1998 and suffered from a severe,
      chronic, irreversible and worsening lung disease giving him a
      very short life expectancy. He also had heart failure,
      hepatic dysfunction and renal dysfunction with a background
      of severe developmental delay. When" I" was 19 months old the
      hospital applied to the court to be permitted to treat him as
      advised by his paediatrician; this would include
      non-resuscitation in the event of a respiratory and/or
      cardiac failure and the provision of palliative care to ease
      his suffering and to permit his life to end peacefully and
      with dignity. The parents strongly opposed the application
      considering it to be premature. Given the conflicting views
      that could not be resolved by discussion, or by seeking
      further medical opinions, a "best interests" application was
      made to the court. Reports were considered from three
      consultant paediatricians, all of whom agreed that it was in
      the best interests of "I" that he should not be further
      subjected to resuscitation involving the provision of
      artificial ventilation and admission to paediatric intensive
      care. These decisions were reached on grounds of the invasive
      nature and risks of artificial ventilation and the distress,
      discomfort and pain caused by the treatment. In reaching his
      judgement, Mr Justice Cazalet stated that the court's clear
      respect for the sanctity of human life imposed a strong
      obligation in favour of taking all steps capable of
      preserving life, save in the most exceptional circumstances.
      In this case, however, he held that there could be no Article
      2 infringement because the treatment authorised
      (non-resuscitation) was made in the best interests of "I". (A
      National Health Service Trust v D &amp; Ors (2000) TLR
      19/7/2000)</p>

      <p>That withdrawing or withholding treatment which has the
      potential to prolong life does not breach Article 2 where
      non-treatment is in the patient's best interests was
      confirmed in a subsequent case involving two patients in
      persistent vegetative state (pvs) (Judge confirms patients'
      right to die. The Guardian 7 October 2000). The case,
      involving two patients Ms H and Mrs M, was heard in the High
      Court on 5 and 6 October 2000. Before the Human Rights Act
      was implemented, it was speculated that the common law
      position permitting the withdrawal of artificial nutrition
      and hydration from patients in pvs may be inconsistent with
      those patients' right to life. The case, which was heard in
      the High Court just days after the Act's implementation,
      however, confirmed that where withdrawal of artificial
      nutrition and hydration is in a patient's best interests,
      there is no breach of Article 2.</p>

      <p>To the extent that best interests remain central to the
      decision-making process, this reflects an extension, rather
      than a change, of existing good practice. Since the
      introduction of the Human Rights Act, however, the way in
      which best interests are assessed and the factors taken into
      account in reaching those decisions are likely to be open to
      far greater scrutiny. Doctors must be able to show that the
      patient's right to life was specifically considered and,
      where treatment is not provided, to demonstrate legitimate
      grounds for not taking steps to enforce that right.</p>

      <p>Article 2 is also constrained by the concept of futility
      (LCB-v-UK Appl No 23413/94 (1998). The Times, 15 June 1998.)
      There is a lack of consensus about the meaning of futility,
      but it is possible that if treatment would have no effective
      result, then withholding it would not breach Article 2. It is
      for the court to decide whether futility should be considered
      from a 'medical goal' or a broader 'best interests'
      perspective.</p>

      <p>Although people cannot generally waive their right to life
      by consenting to be killed, a competent adult may effectively
      waive his or her right to have life prolonged by making an
      informed refusal of life-prolonging treatment. Individuals
      may not, however, waive the right to have someone else's life
      prolonged, such as a dangerously ill child or an incompetent
      adult and nor can they require others to take active measures
      to end their life or that of someone else.</p>

      <p>The positive duty on a public authority to protect life,
      under Article 2, requires it to take steps to prevent
      life-threatening conditions by, for example, vaccination
      programmes. It also includes a duty to inform the public of
      threats to life which could include a duty to warn of the
      effects of pollution, epidemics and perhaps risks such as
      BSE. This duty could extend to situations where a doctor
      knows that an individual patient is putting another
      identifiable individual at risk, for example, if a doctor is
      aware that a patient is knowingly exposing his or her partner
      to HIV infection, or has refused to inform close relatives
      that they are at risk of a serious, life-threatening genetic
      disorder for which avoiding action could be taken. People who
      are harmed by a doctor's failure to warn in such cases could
      claim that this breached their Article 2 right. In deciding
      whether to breach confidentiality, in these circumstances,
      however, the doctor needs to consider the patient's right to
      privacy, including under Article 8 (see section 2.5). The two
      conflicting rights would need to be balanced, based on the
      individual facts of the case, to decide which should take
      precedence; the doctor must be able to justify choosing one
      over the other. In practice the same type of analysis is
      required as before the Act came into force although the
      decision-making process and the reasonableness of the
      decision may now be open to greater scrutiny.</p>

      <p>Treatment that could prolong life may sometimes be
      withheld on the grounds of scarce resources. Whilst it is
      open to a patient to argue that economic factors should not
      be taken into consideration in making treatment decisions,
      any claim under Article 2 would need to show that failing to
      provide treatment would lead to a real, perhaps inevitable,
      and immediate risk of death and that providing treatment was
      likely to avert that risk. Even if this case could be made,
      for example with some new expensive drugs for cancer
      patients, public authorities are only required to take those
      steps to avoid death that are "appropriate" and it appears
      that a shortage of resources may be a valid constraint to
      providing life-prolonging treatment. In reaching policy
      decisions about the allocation of resources, Health
      Authorities, or other decision-making bodies, must be able to
      show that they have considered their patients' Article 2
      right, and must be able to justify interfering with that
      right. Such decisions must be transparent, logical and able
      to withstand scrutiny. The decision must also be
      non-discriminatory; a blanket age restriction on treatment
      such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, for example, is likely
      to contravene Article 14 (see section 2.8). The court is
      unlikely to interfere in a particular case with a Health
      Authority's decisions on allocation of resources provided the
      appropriate procedures have been followed.</p>

      <p>Article 2 does not state that everyone has the right to
      life, only to have that right protected by law.
      Traditionally, under UK law, an unborn child has no legal
      rights. However, it has been suggested that the right to life
      in Article 2 of the <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
      target="_blank">European Convention</a> could extend to the
      unborn, in certain circumstances, so as to give the fetus, in
      some situations, a right to life. The <a
      href="http://www.echr.coe.int/" target="_blank">European
      Court</a> has avoided making a decision as to whether
      "everyone" includes the unborn child. Given, however, that
      individual states are allowed a wide margin of appreciation
      on matters of a moral nature, discussion on the subject
      within the European Commission16 and the way UK law has
      developed in this area, it is unlikely that a fetus would be
      considered, by the UK courts, to have legal rights under the
      Human Rights Act. Until a case has been considered, however,
      the law on this matter, particularly in relation to viable
      fetuses, remains uncertain.</p>

      <p><b>Article 2 - Summary</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li>The patient's right to life under Article 2 should be
        specifically considered in any decision to withhold or
        withdraw life-prolonging treatment but this does not mean
        that treatment must always be provided. Treatment may be
        withdrawn if: providing treatment would not be in the
        patient's best interests; the treatment is considered
        futile; or the patient has effectively waived his or her
        right to have life prolonged by making an informed refusal
        of life-prolonging treatment.</li>

        <li>Article 2 may impose a duty on doctors to take steps to
        prevent life-threatening conditions and a duty to inform
        the public, or individuals, of threats to their life. Where
        this would involve a breach of confidentiality, this should
        be balanced against the patient's right to
        confidentiality.</li>

        <li>Article 2 must be taken into account where potentially
        life-prolonging treatment is not provided on economic
        grounds. Any such decisions must be made in a
        non-discriminatory way and the decisions must hold up to
        scrutiny.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>Article 3 - prohibition of torture</b><br />
      No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Article 3 is an absolute right,
      allowing no derogations but it can be interpreted in various
      ways.</span> Whether an act constitutes inhuman or degrading
      treatment depends upon a range of factors and the individual
      circumstances of each case. Withholding proper medical care
      in a case where someone is suffering from a serious illness
      could, in certain circumstances, amount to treatment contrary
      to Article 3 (although how 'proper medical care' should be
      defined is a matter of debate and is ultimately for the
      courts to decide)(Tanko-v-Finland (1994)). <span
      class="yellow">Equally, however, providing invasive treatment
      contrary to the patient's expressed wish or his or her best
      interests - where, for example, the burdens outweigh the
      benefits - could also violate that patient's Article 3
      rights.</span> This latter interpretation was reinforced by a
      1997 case before the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/"
      target="_blank">European court</a> (D-v-UK [1997] 24 EHRR
      423), in which it was held that Article 3 includes the right
      to be allowed to die with dignity. Therefore either giving or
      withholding treatment could breach the patient's Article 3
      rights, depending upon the individual circumstances.</p>

      <p>D was born and spent most of his life in St Kitts. On
      arrival in the UK in 1993, seeking permission to enter for
      two weeks, he was found to be in possession of a substantial
      quantity of cocaine and was sentenced to six years'
      imprisonment. While in prison D was found to be HIV positive
      and developed AIDS for which he was receiving medical
      treatment. On his release from prison on licence, D applied
      to remain in the UK on compassionate grounds so that he could
      continue to receive the level of medical care he needed. This
      request was turned down and D took his case to the European
      Court of Human Rights. D's solicitor argued that removal to
      St Kitts would entail the loss of the medical treatment D was
      currently receiving, thereby shortening his life expectancy.
      Furthermore such action would condemn him to spend the rest
      of his remaining days in pain and suffering in conditions of
      isolation, squalor and destitution. The Court held that,
      although it could not be said that the conditions which would
      confront him in the receiving country were themselves a
      breach of the standards of Article 3, D's removal to St Kitts
      would expose him to a real risk of dying under most
      distressing circumstances and would thus amount to inhuman
      treatment in violation of Article 3. D-v- UK [1997] 24 EHRR
      423</p>

      <p>In addition to differing interpretations of individual
      rights, there are also some cases in which different rights
      appear to conflict. In some cases, for example, Articles 2
      and 3 will come into conflict if withholding treatment would
      lead to the death of the patient but providing it could be
      classed as inhuman or degrading treatment. In the case of "I"
      referred to above, Mr Justice Cazalet decided that, given the
      individual circumstances of that case, the best interests of
      "I" was that his right to be allowed to die with dignity
      should be upheld. In this case, Article 3 took precedence
      over Article 2; this will not always be the case. In every
      decision all Convention rights must be considered and where
      they conflict, the doctor must be able to justify choosing
      one over the other.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">The <a
      href="http://www.echr.coe.int/" target="_blank">European
      Court</a> has established that medical treatment without
      consent could, in extreme circumstances, be considered
      inhuman or degrading treatment (Herczegfalvy-v-Austria (1992)
      15 EHRR 437).</span> Where, as UK law permits, treatment is
      provided to an incompetent patient in his or her best
      interests, Article 3 is not violated (X-v-FRG (1984) 7 EHRR
      CD 152). If, on the other hand, the treatment has been
      refused by a competent patient, or it was known that the
      patient would not have given consent to the treatment, or the
      patient had refused the treatment through an advance
      directive (See, for example, British Medical Association
      (1995) Advance Statements About Medical Treatment, BMA:
      London), and the effect on the patient is sufficiently
      serious, providing treatment could be deemed to breach the
      patient's Article 3 rights. The threshold set by the courts,
      however, is very high and it would need to be shown that the
      effect of the decision was sufficiently serious to fall
      within the scope of Article 3. Treatment without valid
      consent could also be deemed to breach Article 8 (see section
      2.8).</p>

      <p>From 1972 to 1984 Mr Herczegfalvy was compulsorily
      detained in Austria, some of the time in prison and,
      intermittently, in a psychiatric hospital after he was
      diagnosed as suffering from paranoia querulans. On a number
      of occasions during this period he went on hunger strike and
      was force-fed. Mr Herczegfalvy also refused to consent to any
      medical examination or treatment but was given sedatives and
      other medication against his will. In order to administer the
      treatment in the face of his aggression and death threats, he
      was attached to a security bed or was handcuffed with a belt
      around his ankles. After his release in 1984, Mr Herczegfalvy
      made a number of complaints about his treatment, including a
      claim under Article 3 that the forcible administration of
      food and neuroleptics and the use of handcuffs and the
      security bed to administer the treatment constituted inhuman
      or degrading treatment. The Court considered that the
      position of inferiority and powerlessness which was typical
      of patients confined in psychiatric hospitals called for
      increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention had
      been complied with. It held, however, that it was for the
      medical authorities to decide, on the basis of the recognised
      rules of medical science, and on the therapeutic methods to
      be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and
      mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of
      deciding for themselves. The court went on to say that, as a
      general rule, a measure which is a therapeutic necessity
      cannot be regarded as inhuman or degrading but that medical
      necessity must be convincingly shown to exist. In the case of
      Mr Herczegfalvy, it was held that the evidence was not
      sufficient to disprove that the medical necessity justified
      the treatment and that there had not been a violation of
      Article 3. Herczegfalvy-v-Austria (1992) 15 EHRR 437</p>

      <p>Failure to provide information could, in extreme cases, be
      classed as inhuman or degrading treatment. For example,
      parents who belatedly discovered that their deceased child's
      organs had been retained and used for research may be caused
      great anguish and distress. Failure to provide information
      about what had happened to the organs could be seen to breach
      Article 3.</p>

      <p>Refusing to provide treatment for a patient because of
      some personal characteristic, such as age, sexual orientation
      or physical or mental handicap, might also be considered a
      breach of Article 3, amounting to inhuman or degrading
      treatment. This Article prohibits treatments that 'lower the
      individual in rank, position, reputation or character,
      whether in his own eyes or the eyes of other people' (East
      African Asians -v-UK 1981). In a 1994 case before the
      European court it was held that not providing medical
      treatment to patients in custody was a breach of Article 3
      (Hurtado-v-Switzerland (1994)). The same may be true if
      treatment that would clearly benefit them is withheld from
      elderly patients who are dependent on the NHS for the
      provision of medical care.</p>

      <p><b>Article 3 - Summary</b><br />
       <span class="yellow">Patients have a right under Article 3
      to be protected from inhuman or degrading treatment.</span>
      Whether the treatment is "inhuman or degrading" depends upon
      the individual circumstances of the case, in particular,
      whether it reaches the high threshold of gravity set by the
      court. Such cases are likely to be exceptional but could
      include, for example: withholding proper medical care in a
      case where someone is suffering from a serious illness;
      providing invasive treatment contrary to the patient's best
      interests - where, for example, the burdens outweigh the
      benefit; denying the patient the right to be allowed to die
      with dignity; treatment without consent except where
      treatment is provided to an incompetent patient in his or her
      best interests; providing treatment against the wishes of a
      competent patient; providing treatment to an incompetent
      patient when it is known that he or she would not have given
      consent to the treatment, or had specifically refused the
      treatment by means of an advance directive; refusing to
      provide treatment for a patient because of some personal
      characteristic, such as age, sexual orientation or physical
      or mental handicap. The individual factors of the case need
      to be assessed to decide how "inhuman or degrading treatment"
      should be interpreted.</p>

      <p><b>Article 5 - Right to liberty and security</b><br />
      1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.
      No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following
      cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by
      law:<br />
      (e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of
      the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound
      mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants</p>

      <p>4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or
      detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the
      lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a
      court and his release ordered if the detention is not
      lawful.</p>

      <p>The right to liberty does not mean that individuals must
      never be detained against their will and Article 5 provides
      specific exceptions to permit the lawful detention of those
      who have committed a criminal offence and to detain those who
      may pose a risk to themselves or others. "Unsoundness of
      mind" is one of the exceptions allowed by Article 5(1)(e)
      although the European Court has taken the view that the
      meaning of that phrase is not susceptible to a definitive
      interpretation since it will continually evolve. As a
      minimum, however, the Court has emphasised that "unsoundness
      of mind" cannot be used to detain an individual merely
      because his or her views or behaviour deviate from the norms
      prevailing in a particular society. This standard is also
      reflected in the UK mental health legislation. Detention
      under Article 5(1)(e) is only justified where appropriate
      procedures have been followed. The European Court has
      specified that in order for such detention to be lawful, in
      all but emergency cases, there must be reliable evidence
      before a competent authority:</p>

      <p>1. that a true mental disorder has been established by
      objective medical expertise;<br />
      2. that the mental disorder is of a kind or degree
      warranting compulsory confinement; and<br />
      3. the validity of continued confinement depends upon the
      persistence of such a disorder. (Winterwerpt-v-The
      Netherlands (1979).</p>

      <p>In addition, patients who are detained are entitled to
      seek review of the lawfulness of the detention and of the
      continued need for detention.</p>

      <p>Article 5 gives patients protection against arbitrary
      detention and could be used to challenge unjustified
      detention under the mental health legislation or informal
      treatment for a mental disorder. In order to ensure that
      Article 5 is not breached, the proper procedures must be
      carefully followed. Where an individual is considered to
      represent a risk to another person, in considering whether
      compulsory detention would be appropriate, the positive duty
      to protect life must also be included in the decision-making
      process.</p>

      <p><b>Article 6 - Right to a fair trial</b><br />
      1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations
      or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled
      to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an
      independent and impartial tribunal established by law.
      Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and
      public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the
      interest of morals, public order or national security in a
      democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the
      protection of the private life of the parties so require, or
      to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court
      in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the
      interests of justice.</p>

      <p>It has been suggested that one of the effects of Article 6
      will be to make it more common for Trusts to apply to the
      courts for declarations about the provision or withholding of
      treatment (Parsons N, Glendening J.The Human Rights Act 1998:
      Consent to Treatment, NHSLA Review Human Rights - Special
      Edition, Issue 19, Summer 2000 pp.12-13.). Some lawyers
      express scepticism about this use of Article 6 and further
      information on this point will be made available once this
      point has been clarified.</p>

      <p><b>Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family
      life</b><br />
      1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and
      family life, his home and his correspondence.</p>

      <p>2. There shall be no interference by a public authority
      with the exercise of this right except such as is in
      accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic
      society in the interests of national security, public safety
      or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention
      of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,
      or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of
      others.</p>

      <p>This Article is very broad but its relevance to medical
      decisions relates, primarily, to the rights of individuals to
      confidentiality and to be involved in decision making about
      their treatment or that of their relatives.</p>

      <p>In a 1989 case before the <a
      href="http://www.echr.coe.int/" target="_blank">European
      Court</a> (Gaskin-v-UK (1989) A man who had been brought up
      in local authority care sought access to files that the local
      authority had compiled about him. The Court held that Article
      8 imposes a positive obligation on the state. Since the files
      contained information relating to his childhood and
      development, a lack of access was a breach of his Article 8
      rights.). It was held that public authorities have a positive
      obligation to allow an individual access to files containing
      information about him or her. Although this case related to
      files held by the local authority, it is likely that a
      failure to allow individuals access to medical records
      concerning their treatment may also breach Article 8. Since
      the subject access provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998
      came into force in March 2000, individuals have had a
      statutory right of access to the whole of their medical
      record (with limited, specific exceptions) and so Article 8
      reflects existing access legislation in the UK.</p>

      <p>In addition to allowing individuals access to their own
      medical records Article 8 may also impact on the amount of
      information to be provided for consent to be valid and
      informed. It could be argued, for example, that informed
      consent had not been obtained because a particular piece of
      information about the treatment was withheld. This does not
      mean that doctors must tell patients about every possible
      complication of the treatment however small, but that they
      must be able to show that they have taken into account the
      patients' Article 8 rights and be able to justify withholding
      information. Some forms of experimental or innovative
      treatment could also violate Article 8 unless the patient has
      been given sufficient information and has given a valid
      consent.</p>

      <p>It is likely that Article 8 also extends to individual
      rights to be involved in medical decisions. The Court has
      taken the view that parents have the right under Article 8 to
      be involved in important decisions concerning their children
      (W-v-UK (1987) 10 EHRR 29.).</p>

      <p><b>Article 9 - Freedom of thought, conscience and
      religion</b><br />
      1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience
      and religion; this right includes freedom to change his
      religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community
      with others and in public or private, to manifest his
      religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and
      observance.</p>

      <p>2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be
      subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and
      are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
      public safety, for the protection of public order, health or
      morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of
      others.</p>

      <p>Article 9 is absolute so far as the right to belief is
      concerned, but qualified (permitting derogation) in respect
      of the right to act on one's beliefs or oblige others to
      comply with them. A patient may object to treatment, or the
      parents of a child may object to treatment for the child, on
      religious grounds, even where withholding treatment may lead
      to death. If the medical professionals deem treatment to be
      in the best interests of the patient and necessary to
      preserve life, then a decision to treat or to withhold
      treatment must be made by balancing the competing rights of
      the patient under Article 9 and the positive obligation of
      the health authority under Article 2. The patient's right to
      be protected from inappropriate or unlawful treatment without
      consent (which may be claimed under Article 3) must also be
      taken into account.</p>

      <p>It is possible that Article 9 could be used to claim a
      broader legal right to conscientious objection. Currently the
      only areas where doctors have a legal right to claim a
      conscientious objection are to participation in abortion and
      activities licensed under the Human Fertilisation and
      Embryology Act. The BMA, and other professional bodies,
      however, recognise an ethical right to claim a conscientious
      objection to a broader range of activities: prescribing
      contraception including emergency contraception, for example,
      and decisions to withhold or withdraw treatment, including
      artificial nutrition and hydration. It is possible that
      Article 9 could be used to strengthen such a claim and to
      challenge an employer's insistence upon involvement in such
      activities. It is still necessary for a doctor claiming a
      conscientious objection to refer the patient to another
      practitioner and to provide treatment in an emergency
      situation.</p>

      <p><b>Article 10 - Freedom of expression</b><br />
      1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This
      right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive
      and impart information and ideas without interference by
      public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article
      shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of
      broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.</p>

      <p>2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with
      it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such
      formalities, conditions, restriction or penalties as are
      prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society,
      in the interests of national security, territorial integrity
      or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
      for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of
      the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the
      disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
      maintaining the authority and impartiality of the
      judiciary.</p>

      <p>Article 10 could be called upon by patients in support of
      their right to receive information considered by their doctor
      to be appropriate and necessary.</p>

      <p>A case was brought before the <a
      href="http://www.echr.coe.int/" target="_blank">European
      Court</a> by two companies, Open Door Counselling Ltd. and
      Dublin Well Woman Centre, two counsellors working for the
      latter company and two women of child-bearing age. The
      applicants complained of an injunction imposed by the Irish
      courts restraining the companies or their employees from
      providing certain information to pregnant women concerning
      abortion facilities outside the jurisdiction of Ireland. The
      Court decided that the injunction constituted an interference
      with the right of the companies and the counsellors to impart
      information, as well as the rights of the other applicants to
      receive information. The Court recalled that freedom of
      expression is also applicable to "information" or "ideas"
      that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the
      population. In this case it was important to note that the
      corporate applicants neither advocated nor encouraged
      abortion but solely explained available options. This
      interference was considered to be disproportionate to the
      aims pursued. The protection of the right to life of the
      unborn was a legitimate aim and the Court acknowledged that
      the national authorities enjoyed a wide margin of
      appreciation in matters of morals. This power is however not
      unlimited. Taking into consideration the absolute nature of
      the injunction which imposed a "perpetual" and absolute
      restraint, as well as the fact that the injunction appeared
      to have been largely ineffective in protecting the right to
      life of the unborn, the Court held that the injunction was
      disproportionate and therefore there had been a breach of
      Article 10 of the Convention. Moreover it noted that the
      injunction had actually created a risk to the health of women
      due to lack of proper counselling. (Open Door and Dublin Well
      Woman-v-Ireland (1992))</p>

      <p>In the past doctors have been advised, by Health
      Authorities, not to inform patients that there is a course of
      treatment that could be beneficial for them because the
      treatment is not available on the NHS. Patients could
      challenge such instructions under Article 10 which gives them
      the right to receive information without interference by a
      public authority. There is a difference, however, between the
      right of the patient to challenge instructions, where the
      doctor is willing to give the information, and the doctor's
      positive obligation to inform the patient. Positive
      obligations may arise under Article 10 although these have
      yet to be fully explored. It is possible, however, that
      patients could take action in such circumstances using
      Article 8 since a failure to provide the information could
      mean that their consent was not valid and informed.</p>

      <p><b>Article 10 - Summary</b><br />
      Article 10 could be used to challenge attempts by Health
      Authorities to restrict or influence the information to be
      provided to patients.</p>

      <p><b>Article 12 - Right to marry and found a
      family</b><br />
      Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry
      and to found a family, according to the national laws
      governing the exercise of this right.</p>

      <p>It has been suggested that Article 12 could be used to
      challenge decisions not to provide access to fertility
      treatment although the European Commission has stated that
      Article 12 does not give individuals an absolute right to be
      provided with assistance to conceive.</p>

      <p>Gavin Mellor was serving a life sentence for murder when
      he met and married his wife. In 1997 he applied for
      permission to be allowed to inseminate his wife artificially
      arguing that Article 12 of the <a href=""
      target="_blank">European Convention</a> gave him the right to
      found a family. The Secretary of State refused the request on
      the grounds that artificial insemination was not needed for
      medical reasons but was sought in order to circumvent the
      normal consequences of imprisonment. Furthermore, he argued
      that there were serious concerns about the stability of the
      relationship which had not been tested under normal
      circumstances. Mr Justice Forbes held that the Secretary of
      State's decision did not contravene Mr Mellor's Article 12
      rights. It had been clearly established that the Article 12
      right to found a family did not mean that a person must be
      given, at all times, the actual possibility of procreating
      his descendants. In reality, what Mr Mellor was seeking was
      to be granted the privilege or benefit of being afforded
      access to artificial insemination services because an
      inevitable consequence of his lawful detention in custody was
      that it was impossible for his wife to conceive a child by
      natural means. The Secretary of State was therefore entitled
      to formulate a policy for dealing with such requests by
      prisoners to decide whether the privilege should be made
      available in a particular case. The application was
      dismissed. (R v Secretary of State for the Home Department,
      ex parte Gavin Mellor (2000) LTL 4/8/2000)</p>

      <p>Article 12 is also relevant to applications to court for
      the sterilisation of incompetent adults. In Re A (Re A (Male
      Sterilisation) 2000 1 FLR 549), an application for the
      sterilisation of a 28-year-old man with Down syndrome was
      rejected. Reference was made in that case to A's right to
      privacy and to found a family and it was suggested that the
      view of A that he did not want the operation ought not to be
      ignored even though he was unable to understand its
      implication. In the Court of Appeal, Lady Justice
      Butler-Sloss warned that with the direct application of the
      <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
      target="_blank">European Convention on Human Rights</a> to
      English domestic law imminent, the courts should be slow to
      take any step which might infringe the rights of those unable
      to speak for themselves.</p>

      <p><b>Article 12 - Summary</b> It is possible that Article 12
      could be used to challenge decisions not to give access to
      fertility treatment or applications for enforced
      sterilisation.</p>

      <p><b>Article 14 - Prohibition of discrimination</b><br />
      The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this
      Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any
      ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion,
      political or other opinion, national or social origin,
      association with a national minority, property, birth of
      other status.</p>

      <p>This Article does not give a free standing right, but may
      only be invoked in a claim for some other Convention right. A
      "blanket ban" on providing certain treatments on the ground
      of age, for example, may contravene patients' right to be
      free from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment (Article 3)
      and also their right to respect for private and family life
      (Article 8). Although Article 8(2) appears to allow
      derogation on the grounds of resources, such derogation must
      be applied without discrimination. An example of a breach of
      Article 14 could be rationing which appears solely based on
      age rather than evidence of effectiveness and benefit for the
      individual. Age discrimination falls within the ambit of
      Article 14, even though it is not mentioned explicitly,
      because the list in Article 14 is not exhaustive and includes
      "other status". Clinical indicators demonstrating that older
      people in general benefit less from a certain treatment may
      not be accepted as a justification if such arguments are
      applied in a blanket way rather than treatment decisions
      being based on individual assessment. It is very unlikely,
      however, that health authorities and individual doctors could
      be seen as obliged to provide futile, ineffective or unproven
      treatment. It is important, therefore, that attention is paid
      to the individual circumstances of each case and the
      requirements of the individual patient.</p>

      <p><b>Article 14 - Summary</b> Article 14 ensures that all
      individuals enjoy the Convention rights without
      discrimination. This means that "blanket" decisions - based
      on age or medical condition - instead of decisions based on
      an assessment of the individual factors of the case, are
      likely to be challenged.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>How can doctors show compliance with the Act?</h3>
      <b>How can doctors determine whether interference with a
      right is legitimate?</b><br />
      Many decisions in medical practice involve patients' human
      rights. The rights that are affected need to be identified
      first. The next stage of the process is to consider whether
      it is legitimate, in the circumstances, to interfere with
      those rights. <span class="yellow">In order to assess this,
      it is necessary to be familiar with the concept of
      proportionality.</span> 

      <p><b>Proportionality</b><br />
      <span class="yellow">Any interference with a Convention
      right must be proportionate to the intended objective. This
      means that even if there is a legitimate reason for
      interfering with a particular right, the desired outcome must
      be sufficient to justify the level of interference
      proposed.</span> This involves a similar thought process to
      that used by doctors in many contexts, for example, to decide
      whether a breach of confidentiality is justified in the
      public interest. In those cases, doctors must consider
      whether the legitimate aim in disclosing information (to
      prevent or detect a serious crime, for example) is
      sufficiently serious to justify breaching confidentiality.
      These decisions are made by balancing the competing interests
      and by careful assessment of the individual factors in the
      particular case. In some cases a breach of confidentiality
      will be justified and in others it will not and those making
      the decision may be called upon to justify their actions.
      Although the term "proportionality" may be new to doctors,
      the concept is not.</p>

      <p><b>The Decision-making Process</b><br />
       Deciding whether interference with a Convention right is
      legitimate requires consideration of the following:<br />
       a) Is an absolute right involved? If so, there can be no
      interference with it although there are issues of
      interpretation (see discussion of Article 3 above).<br />
       b) Is a limited or qualified right involved? If so,</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Refer to existing guidance from professional bodies to
        identify how similar cases have been judged.</li>

        <li>Is the proposed interference justified by the aim
        pursued? (Does it meet the proportionality rule?) It
        must:</li>
      </ul>
       - impair the right as little as possible;<br />
       - meet the objectives in question;<br />
       - not be arbitrary, unfair or irrational; and<br />
       - balance the need against the severity of the effect of
      impairing the right.<br />
       

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> allows judges to look at
      both the decision-making process and the merits of the
      decision (R-v-Ministry of Defence, ex p Smith [1996] Q.B.
      517.) Therefore doctors' decisions are likely to be open to
      greater scrutiny and must be more transparent and properly
      recorded. Existing good practice, emphasising the importance
      of consultation and of carefully documenting decisions and
      the reasons for them, takes on greater importance.</p>

      <p>As can be seen, the rights-based assessment required since
      the introduction of the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> echoes very closely the
      type of decision-making process promoted in existing good
      practice guidelines. The main difference is the language
      which should be used to describe the decision making process,
      with terms such as "rights" and "proportionality" gradually
      being introduced into the medical lexicon. Decision making
      also needs to be approached and documented in an increasingly
      formal way so that doctors not only take account of the human
      rights aspects of the decisions they make but are also seen
      to have done so.</p>

      <p>In every decision doctors must consider all Convention
      rights and must be able to demonstrate legitimate grounds for
      interfering with such rights. Where different rights come
      into conflict (such as Articles 2 and 3), the doctor must be
      able to justify choosing one over the other in a particular
      case. Any decision, either to provide or withhold treatment,
      could be open to challenge using the Human Rights Act. <span
      class="yellow">It is therefore essential to build into the
      decision-making process consideration of how the decision
      could be justified from a human rights
      perspective.</span></p>
