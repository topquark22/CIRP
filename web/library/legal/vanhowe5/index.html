      <p><font size="+1"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

      <p>Circumcision is the amputation of the prepuce from the
      rest of the penis, resulting in permanent alteration of the
      anatomy histology and function of the penis [<a
      href="#n1">1,2</a>]. Recently, legal scholars have challenged
      the legality of neonatal circumcision [<a href="#n3">3-7</a>]
      and argued that it constitutes child abuse [<a
      href="#n8">8,9</a>]. While this conjecture may seem
      outlandish to American physicians, who tend to a population
      in which 70-90% of the males are circumcised neonatally, such
      claims have a strong foundation in legal precedent and
      medico-ethical standards that aim to protect the bodily
      integrity of persons.</p>
      <br />

      <p><font size="+1"><b>Bodily integrity and informed
      consent</b></font></p>

      <p>Among a free society's most treasured principles are
      personal autonomy, respect for the individual and
      preservation of the body's physical integrity [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]. Patients are entitled to make decisions
      about their medical care through a process of `informed
      consent'. Medical providers must refrain from unwarranted
      interventions and allow patients the individual
      self-determination to control their own lives [<a
      href="#n11">11,12</a>].</p>

      <p>Incompetent persons cannot, of course exercise a right of
      self determination; someone must make decisions for them.
      Ordinarily this surrogate decision making is not regarded as
      anyone's right. Rather, some individual is accorded the
      privilege of acting as advocate for the incompetent person's
      interests [<a href="#n13">13</a>]. However, for children, the
      law in common-law jurisdictions has historically ignored this
      norm and has allowed parents to make medical decisions for
      their minor children without having to demonstrate that their
      choices were in the children's best interests. This stance is
      particularly prevalent in the USA, although echoes of it are
      seen in other common-law jurisdictions, especially amongst
      lay people, who find ideas of children's rights
      uncomfortable. However, in recent years there has been a
      trend among legislatures, courts, legal scholars and
      child-welfare advocates toward insistence on respecting
      children, legally and morally, as distinct persons whose
      fundamental needs or `welfare interests' warrant legal
      protection [<a href="#n14">14</a>], rather than viewing
      children as appendages or property of their parents to be
      treated however parents (within minimal limitations) see fit
      [<a href="#n15">15</a>]. Simply complying with parental
      wishes is increasingly less acceptable; the child's best
      interests must also be considered [<a href="#n16">16,17</a>].
      Like surrogate decision-makers for incompetent adults,
      parents should be able to demonstrate that their judgement is
      the same as that which the child would rationally choose for
      himself, if able to do so. Such a demonstration should be
      necessary before medical professionals may accede to the
      preferences of parents regarding medical intervention for
      their children. [<a href="#n12">12</a>].</p>

      <p>In an effort to protect the rights of children, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics
      developed a <a href="/library/ethics/AAP/">policy about
      informed consent in cases involving children</a>. Informed
      <i>parental permission</i> can substitute for consent from
      the child only for medical interventions in situations of
      clear and immediate medical necessity, such as an immediate
      threat to the child from disease, trauma, or deformity. For
      non-essential treatments, which can be deferred without
      substantial risk, the physician and family should wait until
      the child's consent can be obtained [<a href="#n18">18</a>].
      Such a principle should apply even more strongly in the case
      of circumcision, which carries significant potential for
      causing serious harm. The committee emphasized the duty of
      the physician to protect the patient (the child) from
      parental desires that might be detrimental to the child.</p>
      <br />

      <p><a id="US" name="US"></a><font size="+1"><b>United States
      case law</b></font></p>

      <p>American case law clearly protects the bodily integrity of
      incompetent individuals. For example, doctors may not
      sterilize or administer contraceptives to a mentally retarded
      woman, regardless of parental desires, without showing it is
      the least restrictive means available for protecting the
      woman's interests [<a href="#n19">19</a>]. Similarly, courts
      have limited the authority of parents to secure medical
      intervention for the child. In <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/406/205.html"><i>Wisconsin v
      Yoder</i></a>, the US Supreme Court held that parental
      authority may be limited `if it appears that parental
      decisions will jeopardize the health and safety of the child'
      [<a href="#n20">20</a>]. Lower courts have refused to allow
      parents to secure non-medically indicated procedures on
      children. For example in <i>Little v Little</i>, the
      <i>guardian ad litem</i> of a 14-year-old mentally
      incompetent, but otherwise perfectly healthy girl applied at
      the behest of the girl's mother for an order authorizing the
      mother to consent to the removal of a kidney from the girl's
      body, for the purpose of transplanting the kidney into the
      girl's brother who was suffering from end-stage renal
      disease. A Texas Court of Appeal rejected the request,
      holding that the `power of parents to consent to surgical
      intrusions upon the person of the minor...is limited to the
      power to consent to medical "treatment".' [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>]. To date, all courts have held that
      surgical removal of a normal, healthy, uninjured part of the
      body is not `treatment'. In a transplantation case similar to
      Little v Little, a Louisiana Court of Appeal ruled that
      surgery could not take place and accorded `protection to a
      minor's right to be free in his person from bodily intrusion
      to the extent of the loss of an organ unless such loss be in
      the best interest of the minor'. [<a href="#n22">22</a>].</p>
      <br />

      <p><a id="UK" name="UK"></a><font size="+1"><b>United
      Kingdom</b></font></p>

      <p>Under English law, assaults ranging from common assault to
      inflicting grievous bodily harm are offences under the
      <i>Offences against the Person Act 1861</i>. The <a
      href="http://www.lawcampus.butterworths.co.uk/fortin/statutes/cypa33.htm">
      <i>Children and Young Persons Act</i> 1933</a> makes
      willfully assaulting a child an offence. <i>The <a
      href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/statutes/ca89.htm">
      Children Act 1989</a></i> requires that paramount
      consideration be given to the welfare of the child and the
      child's wishes [<a href="#n23">23</a>]. Newborns can only be
      a subject of a research trial if the risk is no more than
      minimal and the child stands to benefit directly [<a
      href="#n24">24</a>]. The UK Department of Health guidelines
      similarly provide that `those acting for the child can only
      give their consent provided that the intervention is for the
      benefit of the child. If they are responsible for allowing
      the child to be subjected to any risk (other than one so
      insignificant as to be negligible) which is not for the
      benefit of the child, it could be said that they were acting
      illegally' [<a href="#n25">25</a>]</p>

      <p>In Queensland, Australia, the <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">Queensland Law Reform
      Commission</a> concluded that `on a strict interpretation of
      the assault provisions of the Queensland <i>Criminal
      Code</i>, routine circumcision could be regarded as a
      criminal act' [<a href="#n26">26</a>].</p>
      <br />

      <p><a id="human" name="human"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>International Law</b></font></p>

      <p>International human rights law clearly protects the child
      from unnecessary bodily intrusion [<a href="#n27">27</a>].
      The <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/"><i>Convention on
      the Rights of the Child</i></a> [<a href="#n28">28</a>] calls
      for states that are parties to the convention to ensure that
      no violence, injury, or abuse occurs while the child is under
      the care of a parent or legal guardian (Article 19.1). It
      requires that children be protected from torture, from any
      cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (Article
      37a), and from unlawful interference with their privacy
      (Article 16), Similarly, the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/"><i>Declaration of the
      Rights of the Child</i></a> stipulates that children must be
      protected from all forms of cruelty, neglect and exploitation
      [<a href="#n29">29</a>]. This respect for bodily integrity is
      also reflected in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/alderson/"><i>European Charter for
      Children in Hospitals</i></a>, which states that `every child
      shall be protected from unnecessary medical treatment and
      investigation'. [<a href="#n30">30</a>]</p>
      <br />

      <p><a id="lawful" name="lawful"></a><font size="+1"><b>Can
      involuntary circumcision be lawful?</b></font></p>

      <p>The test for the lawfulness of a surgical intervention on
      a child has three parts; the intervention must be medically
      necessary [<a href="#n21">21,26,31</a>], must be in the best
      interests of the child [<a href="#n22">22,23,26,32,33</a>],
      and must not expose the child to unnecessary suffering or
      injury [<a href="#n24">24,25,34</a>]. When a child has an
      illness, a medical or surgical intervention selected to
      facilitate the child's recovery can be justified. On the
      other hand, when healthy flesh is amputated from a healthy
      organ in a healthy child, the intervention is presumptively
      unlawful and the onus lies upon those who conduct the
      amputation to demonstrate that it satisfies the three part
      test. Justifications for neonatal circumcision have taken
      several forms, but as discussed below, under close scrutiny
      all of these purported justifications fail to satisfy these
      criteria.</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse because
      parental consent is given'</i></p>

      <p>In the USA, parents sign a consent form that allows
      physicians to medically intervene on their children, and some
      physicians may believe that this absolutely absolves them of
      legal responsibility. However, if left unchecked, parents can
      then act to the detriment of their child., who is vulnerable
      and at the parents' mercy [<a href="#n35">35</a>], so several
      safeguards exist.</p>

      <p>First, parental consent in only effective for
      interventions that are in the child's best interest. Routine
      circumcision involves the painful removal of healthy tissue
      from a child and thus involves significant physical harm.
      Without medical benefits that outweigh this harm,
      circumcision must be deemed contrary to a child's best
      interests (see the following discussion of costs and
      benefits). <a href="/library/ethics/AAP/">When a conflict
      between parental preferences and the child's interests
      arises, the physician must protect the child, who is after
      all the physician's patient</a>. [<a href="#n18">18</a>]. In
      such cases, a replacement for the surrogate should be sought
      [<a href="#n10">10</a>]. Court authority should be obtained
      for any surgery that is invasive, irreversible, or major; if
      there is a significant risk of making the wrong decision; or
      if the consequences of a wrong decision are particularly
      grave. [<a href="#n36">36</a>]. As for the circumcision of
      males (like circumcision of females) is clearly invasive and
      irreversible, and arguably has substantial consequences for
      the person circumcised, court authority should be required
      for all circumcisions not required by exigent medical
      necessity. While on the face if it this may appear excessive,
      this rule is necessary to protect the individual's
      fundamental and legally protected rights, which despite the
      clear law have been ignored or over-ridden by dogmatic
      parents and /or complaisant doctors. Difficulty in accepting
      this conclusion may arise from a resistance to recognizing
      that infants have rights of their own.</p>

      <p>The same point might be made by viewing parental consent
      as surrogate decision-making. Surrogates are expected to make
      decisions based on what the incompetent patient would want
      for himself if competent. Significantly, among males in the
      USA who were not circumcised as children, only 0.3% choose to
      undergo circumcision later in life [<a href="#n37">37</a>]
      This suggests that parents who elect to have their sons
      circumcised violate this principle of substitute consent.</p>

      <p>Second, parental permission is reserved, even for
      medically indicated interventions, to those that cannot
      safely wait until the child can be involved in the
      decision-making process. Even if there were sufficient
      medical benefits to outweigh the evident harms, would there
      be any harm in waiting to circumcise? Would most of the
      supposed medical benefits still be realized if a male chose
      to be circumcised upon becoming competent to decide for
      himself? Are there significant benefits in postponing the
      operation for months or years rather than performing it on a
      newborn? Significantly, although circumcision is the most
      frequently performed operation on children (indeed it is the
      most frequently performed surgery in the USA) a recent review
      article addressing the optimal timing for urological
      procedures in children did not even mention circumcision [<a
      href="#n38">38</a>], suggesting either that their is no
      urgency to performing circumcisions immediately after birth
      or, more probably, that this surgery has not been given the
      attention it deserves. While a few urinary tract infections
      may be prevented with neonatal circumcision [<a
      href="#n39">39</a>], the reported complication rates in the
      newborn period (2.0% [<a href="#n40">40</a>] to 6.4% [<a
      href="#n41">41</a>] are higher than those reported in
      circumcisions later in life (1.7% [<a
      href="#n42">42,43</a>]). The risk of meatal stenosis after
      circumcision may be reduced if the surgery is delayed until
      after toilet training. [<a href="#n44">44</a>]. While general
      anaesthesia is considered too risky for neonates, the results
      of attempts to control the pain with topical and local
      anaesthetics, although better than no anaesthetic, have been
      lackluster [<a href="#n45">45-50</a>]. Postponing
      circumcision until the risk of general anaesthetic is more
      acceptable would be in the child's best interest.</p>

      <p>In Australia, the <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">Queensland Law Reform
      Commission</a> neonatal circumcision `consent by parents to
      the procedure being performed may be invalid in the light of
      the common law's restrictions on the ability of parents to
      consent to the nontherapeutic treatment of children'. [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>] Likewise, in <i>Re Z</i> [<a
      href="#n32">32</a>] a UK court ruled that it `could refuse to
      permit a parent's exercise of parental responsibility even
      though it was <i>bona fide</i> and reasonable, if it was
      contrary to the child's best interests'. This invalidation of
      parental consent to an unjustified procedure has been
      suggested as applying to treatment performed with `consent'
      but without cause or excuse'. [<a href="#n31">31</a>]. Thus,
      in those jurisdictions, parental privilege clearly does not
      extend to procedures not required by medical necessity
      including purely cosmetic surgery. The over-riding criterion
      of the child's best interests limits parental power [<a
      href="#n36">36,51</a>]. It is understood that what is in the
      parents' or family's best interest is not automatically in
      the child's best interest [<a href="#n26">26</a>]. The
      child's best interests must be determined objectively, and
      parental preference is irrelevant.</p>

      <p>Third, any parental consent to circumcision must be
      <i>informed</i> consent, and the actual process for obtaining
      parental consent to circumcision in the USA typically falls
      far below the standard for other surgery [<a
      href="#n52">52</a>]. Physicians performing the operation
      often know little about the prepuce or the care of the
      normal, uncircumcised penis [<a href="#n53">53</a>]. Not
      surprisingly, this low level of knowledge in physicians is
      paralleled by a similarly poor level of parental knowledge
      about the complete penis [<a href="#n52">52,54</a>]. In
      addition, doctors typically do a poor job of communicating
      information to parents, such as the surgical risks inherent
      in circumcision. [<a href="#n55">55</a>].</p>

      <p>Fourth, parental consent cannot be valid if any coercive
      elements affected or induced the granting of consent [<a
      href="#n56">56</a>]. Nevertheless it is routine in the USA to
      ask a woman during a prenatal visit or on admission to the
      obstetrics ward [<a href="#n57">57</a>] whether she desires
      circumcision for her child if it is a boy [<a
      href="#n58">58</a>]. Offering a medically unnecessary surgery
      that will benefit the physician and hospital but not benefit
      the patient is clearly unethical [<a href="#n59">59</a>].
      Such a practice is a subtle but no less insidious form of
      coercion. Offering circumcision to a mother is often
      interpreted as a recommendation [<a
      href="#n52">52,58,60</a>]. Mothers are left with the
      impression that `it must be the thing to do, or our doctor
      would not have told us about it'[<a href="#n61">61</a>].
      Given the perinatal emotional upheaval, parental consent in
      the neonatal context is rarely , if ever freely given [<a
      href="#n62">62</a>]. The epitome of absurdity is Wiswell's
      suggestion of obtaining informed parental refusal [<a
      href="#n63">63</a>].</p>

      <p>To summarize, reliance on parental consent for neonatal
      circumcision is inadequate unless proof is provided that
      circumcision provides medical benefits outweighing the harms
      it occasions, that the health of the child would be
      significantly prejudiced by postponing the procedure until he
      is capable of giving effective consent to it himself, and
      that parental decisions are fully informed and uncoerced.</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse because it
      has medical benefits'</i></p>

      <p>Is the prophylactic value of neonatal circumcision enough
      to justify violating a newborn's bodily integrity against his
      will? (The use of restraints and the degree and character of
      crying [<a href="#n64">64,65</a>] show that the child
      undergoes circumcision unwillingly.) Currently surgical
      prophylaxis has been assessed in only one other instance [<a
      href="#n66">66</a>]. Because the risk of breast cancer and
      ovarian cancer are significantly increased with <i>BRCA1</i>
      and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations, and their presence can be
      detected, women with these mutations may consider
      prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy. Even in the average
      30-year-old woman with out these genetic markers,
      prophylactically removing both breasts and ovaries would add
      an additional 8 months in life expectancy. In either case,
      such prophylactic surgery is considered a `highly personal
      decision' made only after clear discussion of its effects on
      medical outcomes, and despite the increase in life-expectancy
      for the average woman, the authors of the study concluded
      that `prophylactic surgery is obviously unreasonable for
      these women'. [<a href="#n66">66</a>]. Yet, for every cancer
      death for penile cancer in the USA, 264 women will die from
      either ovarian or breast cancer [<a href="#n67">67</a>]. If
      prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy at age 30 are
      considered `obviously unreasonable' [<a href="#n66">66</a>],
      why should prophylactic circumcision be considered
      `reasonable' when the benefits, existence of which are
      dubious, are markedly more remote? One study found that
      circumcision decreased the number of quality-adjusted years
      by a mean of 14h [<a href="#n68">68</a>], while another found
      a mean increase of just 10 days [<a href="#n69">69</a>].</p>

      <p>The assumption that neonatal circumcision has prophylactic
      value has never been conclusively proven [<a
      href="#n68">68-71</a>]. Haberfield, who has written in
      defence of circumcision, relies heavily on asserted benefits
      in asserting its legality [<a href="#n72">72</a>]. By doing
      so, that author shows ignorance of the law, the medical
      evidence and the thrust of the QLRC report [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>] In contrast, that author argues that
      female circumcision is properly classified as illegal by many
      Western countries because it has no medical benefits
      acknowledged by Western medicine [<a href="#n72">72</a>].
      These arguments are fundamental flaws. First, female
      circumcision has in the past been proposed by some medical
      professionals as possessing many of the same medical benefits
      that supporters of male circumcision currently argue result
      from the latter procedure [<a href="#n73">73</a>]. If studies
      of a quality comparable to that of the studies that have
      purported to show a medical benefit for male circumcision, a
      medical benefit for female circumcision might be
      `demonstrated' as well. Moreover with both male and female
      genital alteration, the persons responsible for performing
      the procedures, as well as the respective cultures as a
      whole, validate the importance of childhood genital surgery,
      and for many of the same asserted reasons [<a
      href="#n74">74</a>].</p>

      <p>Second, Haberfield largely ignores the costs involved in
      circumcision. While amputating a foot to prevent ingrown
      toenails could be construed as a benefit, one clearly needs
      to incorporate the decision-making process due consideration
      of the risks, complications and loss of function resulting
      from the proposed procedure. Neonatal circumcision has
      repeatedly been shown to be cost-ineffective and to have an
      overall detrimental effect on health [<a
      href="#n68">68-71</a>]. These findings negate any argument
      that the procedure's asserted benefits override a child's
      rights to bodily integrity and health, both of which are
      protected by international human rights standards [<a
      href="#n5">5,7,28</a>]</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/"><i>Convention
      on the Rights of the Child</i></a> [<a href="#n28">28</a>]
      requires all nations to respect the child's right to enjoy
      the highest attainable standard of health (Article 24). The
      Convention calls for the abolition of traditional practices
      prejudicial to the health of children (Article 24.3).
      Unnecessarily exposing a child to health risks (including
      death), pain and genital alteration clearly contravenes these
      provisions. <i>The Convention of the Rights of the Child</i>
      has attained a rare level of international authority because
      it has been adopted by every nation in the world except the
      USA and Somalia.</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse because it
      constitutes only "minor surgery"'</i></p>

      <p>Haberfield's argument that circumcision is allowable
      because it is not `major surgery' [<a href="#n72">72,75</a>]
      conflicts with the conclusion of the QLRC [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>]; Haberfield provides neither evidence or
      discussion. The analysis suggests that Haberfield is
      unfamiliar with the procedure, which clearly qualifies as
      major amputative surgery, and misstates the effect of the
      legal position. The all too common comment that `minor
      surgery' is surgery that `someone else undergoes' applies
      here. Circumcision performed on older children and adults
      often requires general anesthesia with a mean recovery time
      of nearly 2 weeks [<a href="#n76">76</a>]. Although newborns
      have a lower pain threshold than older infants, children and
      adults [<a href="#n77">77</a>], the vast majority of newborn
      circumcisions in the USA are performed with little or no
      anesthesia [<a href="#n78">78</a>].</p>

      <p>During the circumcision, a baby's blood oxygen level
      decreases [<a href="#n79">79</a>]; his heart rate,
      respiratory rate, blood pressure and stress measures increase
      dramatically [<a href="#n80">80-84</a>]. His cry takes on a
      surprisingly high-pitched piercing cry observed only when a
      baby experiences excruciating pain [<a
      href="#n64">64,65</a>]. He may completely dissociate, a
      response that is similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.
      He may become oddly quiet in apparent despair at the lack of
      any available escape from his ordeal [<a href="#n85">85</a>].
      Nearly 20% of those circumcised without anaesthesia will have
      apnoea/choking episodes [<a href="#n49">49</a>] consistent
      with an apparent life-threatening event [<a
      href="#n86">86,87</a>].</p>

      <p>A boy's sleep pattern is altered after circumcision, with
      light sleep increasing and deep sleep decreasing in the
      period after surgery [<a href="#n81">81,82,88,89</a>].
      Infants who are circumcised have been observed to suck
      harder, faster and more vigorously at their bottles, making
      them less available to their surroundings, and less able to
      interact with their mother [<a href="#n90">90,91</a>].
      Feeding also deteriorates after circumcision [<a
      href="#n45">45</a>].</p>

      <p>Even if the complications from the procedure are ignored,
      the penis is markedly altered. Circumcision amputates nearly
      all the fine-touch neuroreceptors [<a href="#n1">1</a>],
      thickens the epithelial layers of the exposed glans, reduces
      the mobility of penile shaft skin, and results in different
      sexual behavioural preferences [<a
      href="#n92">92,93</a>].</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/legal/QLRC/">QLRC</a> (Australia)
      stated that `in the absence of "real" consent, circumcision
      would fall under the definition of assault under s.245 of the
      Queensland Criminal Code. It might also be an offence
      endangering life or health'. [<a href="#n26">26</a>] Some
      would even argue that the practice of neonatal circumcision
      constitutes torture, because of the intense and unwarranted
      pain the newborn suffers, and torture is clearly condemned by
      international instruments such as the <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/h2catoc.htm"><i>Convention
      Against Torture</i></a> [<a href="#n94">94</a>] and the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/"><i>Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</i></a> [<a href="#n27">27</a>].</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse where it is
      performed pursuant to a religious requirement'</i></p>

      <p>While the USA Constitution prohibits government from
      interfering with religious beliefs, it does not protect
      practices performed in the name of religion that are harmful
      to society [<a href="#n95">95</a>] or to another individual
      [<a href="#n96">96,97</a>]. Rights of religious freedom do
      not relieve an individual's obligation to comply with valid,
      neutral law of equal application [<a href="#n98">98-104</a>].
      Likewise the <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> [<a
      href="#n25">25</a>] (Article 14.3), the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-covenant/"><i>International Covenant
      on Civil and Political Rights</i></a> [<a
      href="#n105">105</a>] (Article 18.3), and the <a
      href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/BH547.txt">
      <i>American Convention of Human Rights</i></a> (Article 12.3
      all provide that the free exercise of religion is protected
      so long as it does not violate public safety, order, health,
      or morals, or the fundamental rights of another human
      being.</p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html"><i>European
      Convention on Human Rights</i></a> (1950) contains similar
      provisions and is in the process of being incorporated into
      the Human Rights Bill in the UK. Although the Bill currently
      before Parliament contains amendments by the House of Lords
      exempting mainstream religions, it is likely that the UK
      Government will remove or change those amendments so that the
      Bill follows the requirements of the Convention. Even without
      changes to the Bill as it now stands, there will be nothing
      to stop an aggrieved person, who complains that his protected
      rights have been damaged and that remedies have been made
      unavailable in domestic courts because of the defective
      incorporation of the Convention, from seeking remedies in the
      European Court of Human Rights.</p>

      <p>Given the significant lifelong harm caused by
      circumcision, the clear human rights violations entailed by
      the procedure, and the absence of genuine medical benefit,
      circumcision cannot be justified by appeal to the rights of
      religious freedom of parents or of religious communities. It
      is a mistake to understand anyone's right to religious
      freedom to include a right to make decisions regarding the
      medical care of another person. Rights in our culture protect
      individual self-determination, which includes control over
      one's body but which clearly does not include control over
      the body of another. Thus, regardless of how fervently a
      person may wish to decide what will happen to another's body,
      we simply do not understand that person's constitutional
      liberties to include that decision-making power. In fact we
      deem that person's religious convictions to be entirely
      irrelevant in deciding what rules he or she must abide by in
      interacting with or making decisions on behalf of others. [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>]</p>

      <p>The US Supreme Court endorsed this conclusion in <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html"><i>Prince v.
      Massachusetts</i></a> [<a href="#n106">106</a>]. In deciding
      a conflict between parents' religious beliefs and children's
      physical well-being, it ruled that `parents may be free to
      become martyrs themselves but it does not follow that they
      are free to make martyrs of their children before they have
      reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can
      make that choice for themselves'. The religious beliefs of
      the parents, over which the child has no control, cannot be
      used to excuse harming the child's temporal interests [<a
      href="#n96">96</a>] nor can they entitle the parent to
      control the child for the parents' benefit [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>].</p>

      <p>In English law, all factors must be taken into account in
      deciding what are the best interests of the child [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>]. Thus parents' religious beliefs are only
      one factor among many when looking at non-therapeutic
      circumcision, and should be relatively unimportant when
      making a decision about circumcising children.</p>

      <p>Furthermore it would be improper to impute any religious
      beliefs to children: doctors are no more in a position to
      assume what a person will believe when he grows up than are
      parents. Parents choosing circumcision for religious reasons
      may in fact be violating the child's own religious freedom,
      including the freedom to change religious beliefs [<a
      href="#n20">20, 107-109</a>]. Children should therefore not
      be compelled to undergo a painful medically unjustified
      surgery that alters their genitals mere because the procedure
      is considered by some members of a religion to be essential
      to that faith. The procedure may well be inconsistent with
      the dictates of other religions that the person, who is
      presently an infant might select when he becomes an adult.
      The common use of the phrase `Jewish or Muslim boy' reflects
      our inability to approach the decision from the infant's
      perspective. These are boys of Jewish or Muslim parents; they
      have yet to determine their own religion. Cutting a child's
      genitalia takes away his right to choose whether to be marked
      with the scars of that particular religion. A boy, on
      reaching maturity, may resent a permanent change to his
      genitals made without his approval for a religion he did not
      accept.</p>

      <p>Thus Etchells <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n110">110</a>] are
      misguided when they suggest that physicians should base the
      content of their informed decision on parental motives. They
      state that `if the parents' decision is based on strong
      cultural beliefs and practices, a detailed, impersonal
      disclosure of all known risks and benefits would probably not
      be relevant or helpful. However, if the decision is based on
      personal experiences (e.g. the father was circumcised), a
      detailed, impersonal disclosure of the risks and benefits
      would be helpful in helping the parents to come to a
      decision'. This statement contradicts their positions on
      <i>therapeutic privilege</i> [<a href="#n111">111</a>] and
      <i>substitute consent</i> [<a href="#n112">112</a>], does not
      address the child's interests, and may be little more than
      misplaced `political correctness' in an attempt to preserve
      tradition and placate Jews and Muslims. They fail to explain
      how parental motives alters the risks, benefits and treatment
      options, or the physician's duty to give full disclosure.
      Risks that these parents consider insignificant may well be
      significant for the infant. In short, all infants deserve the
      highest possible level of care, regardless of their parents'
      beliefs [<a href="#n113">113</a>].</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse because it
      has cultural benefits"</i></p>

      <p>Haberfield [<a href="#n72">72</a>] argues that a child of
      Jewish or Muslim parents may feel psychologically and
      spiritually isolated from his religion and culture if not
      circumcised, that a practice integral to these religions has
      credible cultural value, and that ritual circumcision should
      be allowed on this basis. He argues that `the autonomy of its
      citizens' is of enough value that a state's intervention is
      inappropriate. This prohibition `seems further inappropriate
      in a multicultural society espousing tolerance for
      multicultural practices'. He recognizes that multiculturalism
      cannot be used as a blanket approval for all cultural
      practices and argues for example, that female circumcision
      would not warrant approval, and that local legislators should
      be free to prohibit practices they perceive to be repugnant
      to their communities [<a href="#n114">114</a>]. However,
      Haberfield provides little empirical support and no
      principled thesis for treating male and female genital
      alteration differently.</p>

      <p>More reasonably, <a
      href="/library/legal/poulter/">Poulter</a> [<a
      href="#n115">115</a>] argues that a tentative argument for
      parents authorizing an intervention against a child's
      interests can be made if the harm caused by the intervention
      is compensated by sufficient advantage to others, and if the
      intervention is not seriously detrimental to the child.
      However, Poulter characterizes as `unlikely' a justification
      based on the more remote and controversial benefit of
      satisfying a deeply felt community attachment to traditional
      customs'. A year later he wrote that any custom that involves
      `cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment' such as female
      circumcision should not be tolerated [<a
      href="#n116">116</a>]; he fails to discuss male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>While Haberfield chastises <a
      href="/library/legal/richards/">Richards</a> for failing to
      `consider the right of an individual's autonomy in a liberal
      society'[<a href="#n75">75</a>] he inexplicably fails to
      recognize the autonomy of the individual whose genitalia are
      to be altered. A cultural or religious community may view the
      child, and more specifically the prepuce, as community
      property; however, a child must be regarded as possessing the
      same full rights as any adult to exclusive ownership of his
      body [<a href="#n33">33</a>]. Supposed benefits to the rest
      of society are not accepted as sufficient justification for
      involuntary surgery on adults. Nor should they be so accepted
      with children. Such procedures cannot be justified by the
      possible existence of cultural blindness regarding a
      particular practice, a phenomenon that allows several clear
      human rights violations to persist in various cultures
      throughout the world. The <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">QLRC</a> states that the best
      interests of the child `is a matter to be determined
      objectively'. [<a href="#n117">117</a>]. Clearly,
      Haberfield's attempts to justify a harmful cultural practice
      fall short of the mark.</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse because it is
      not as damaging as female circumcision'</i></p>

      <p>The notion that female circumcision is more damaging than
      male circumcision may be more the product of cultural
      blindness than any actual difference in severity. The
      justifications given for altering the genitalia of both sexes
      are strikingly similar [<a href="#n6">6,74</a>], and several
      legal scholars find the practices equally problematic [<a
      href="#n6">6-8</a>]. The dramatic changes in anatomy, the
      horrific complications (including death) that can arise [<a
      href="#n118">118-124</a>], and the prolonged psychological
      sequelae [<a href="#n85">85, 125-128</a>] leave little doubt
      as to the damaging effects of male circumcision. While the
      most drastic forms of female circumcision arguably entail
      greater harm than male circumcision, some forms of female
      circumcision involve less drastic procedures that are
      comparable in severity to male circumcision.</p>

      <p>In any event, the human rights principles outlined above
      are absolute in their protection of certain basic rights that
      are violated by genital alterations, regardless of severity
      [<a href="#n3">3-5</a>]. Any genital alteration that is not
      medically necessary infringes the basic human right to bodily
      integrity. Statutes that safeguard females against any
      alteration of their genitals while ignoring male genital
      alteration are illogical in their discrimination against
      males [<a href="#n5">5-7</a>]. Such laws highlight the
      artificiality of our culturally based treatment of male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution
      guarantee equal protection under the laws and prohibit
      discrimination on the basis of sex without an `exceedingly
      persuasive justification' [<a href="#n129">129</a>], i.e.
      proof by the state that affording lesser protection to one
      sex closely serves an important state interest [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>]. It is therefore unlikely that American
      gender-specific laws against female genital alteration could
      survive constitutional scrutiny [<a href="#n131">131</a>].
      Circumcision serves no interest of the state, let alone an
      important one. Case law and constitutional law in the USA
      demonstrate that courts have the power and duty under equal
      protection principles to extend the protection of female
      circumcision statutes to boys [<a
      href="#n131">131-133</a>].</p>

      <p>Equal protection principles embedded in international law
      and binding on all nations under treaty and/or customary law
      similarly prohibit invidious discrimination on the basis of
      gender, such as is inherent in the statutes that prohibit
      only female genital mutilation but permit the continuation of
      the male procedure. The <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-covenant/"><i>International Covenant
      of Civil and Political Rights</i></a> [<a
      href="#n105">105</a>] provides that every child must have,
      without discrimination, the right to the same protections.
      (Article 24.1). This is echoed in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/"><i>Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</i></a>, which states that all are equal before
      the law and entitled without discrimination to equal
      protection of the law'. (Article 7). <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-charter/"><i>The Charter of the
      United Nations</i></a> likewise calls for the `observance of
      human rights and freedoms for all without distinction as to
      race, sex, language, or religion'. (Article 55c) [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>].</p>

      <p>Revealingly, lawmakers in the USA have at times implicitly
      acknowledged that male circumcision may constitute ritual
      abuse, at least in certain circumstances. No other apparent
      explanation exists for the specific exemptions for male
      circumcision in the ritual abuse laws of California
      (California Penal Code, para 662.83), Idaho Criminal Code,
      para 18-15-06 a4.b) and Illinois (Illinois Compiled Statutes
      para 5/12-32 and 5/12-33). These legislators must have
      considered male circumcision ritual abuse; otherwise there
      would not have been a need to include this statutory
      loophole.</p>
      <br />

      <p><i>`Neonatal circumcision is not child abuse because it
      has never been prosecuted as such'</i></p>

      <p>The only judicial references to the lawfulness of male
      circumcision in the UK appear in two offhand comments by the
      court in <i>R v Brown</i> [<a href="#n134">134</a>] and <i>R
      v Adesanya</i> [<a href="#n135">135</a>]. In neither case is
      supportive evidence given for these declarations. With a
      similar lack of justification, Williams considered the
      illegality of ritual circumcision `utterly absurd' [<a
      href="#n136">136</a>]. Most commentary supporting
      circumcision's legality relies on the untenable notion that
      is in no way medically harmful [<a href="#n115">115,137</a>].
      On the other hand, several scholars have credibly argued that
      neonatal circumcision could be prosecuted under current
      statutes [<a href="#n26">26,138</a>]. Adequate consent is the
      usual source of privilege that may justify an otherwise
      medically unjustified and harmful surgery. In the absence of
      such consent, neonatal circumcision satisfies the definition
      of criminal assault and battery. All assaults that inflict
      bodily harm are illegal [<a href="#n139">139</a>]. <a
      href="/library/legal/brigman/">Brigman</a> states that `since
      circumcision is medically unwarranted mutilation and
      disfigurement, it would appear to be a clear case of child
      abuse' [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. While there have been no
      reported cases of successful prosecution of a male
      circumcision that was performed to the standard of care and
      to which the parents consented, this may be largely an
      artefact of the cultural tolerance of a practice that other
      cultures consider reprehensible. Numerous activities once
      tolerated as lawful are now considered criminal, including
      violence against one's wife, children, servants, or animals
      [<a href="#n134">134</a>]. Among the functions of criminal
      law are protecting citizens, especially the young and
      vulnerable, from what is injurious, and providing safeguards
      from exploitation [<a href="#n140">140</a>]. Brigman
      recommends using existing state laws prohibiting assault and
      battery to prohibit circumcision, but acknowledges that it
      would be extremely difficult to obtain a conviction [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>].</p>
      <br />

      <p><a id="discussion" name="discussion"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

      <p>American attitudes toward neonatal circumcision may be in
      the throes of a paradigm shift [<a href="#n141">141</a>]. The
      medical justifications suggested for neonatal circumcision
      are rapidly being exposed as myths, while the procedure's
      defenders are becoming more vocal in their attempts to
      prevent the truth about the procedure from being absorbed
      into mainstream American culture [<a
      href="#n142">142-144</a>]. However, cultural blindness is
      likely to hinder progress in allaying the damage caused by
      male circumcision. Laws generally reflect societal attitudes
      and rarely herald dramatic social transformation. Likewise,
      judges are more likely to respond to well-established social
      trends than to be the vanguard of dramatic change. Courts
      naturally view issues through society's social and cultural
      prejudices [<a href="#n5">5</a>].</p>

      <p>There is little doubt that a physician who today performs
      an operation with no therapeutic benefit, and which results
      in significant risk and inevitable loss of function, risks a
      civil claim for damages as well as censure from his
      professional body. In the USA, circumcision commonly serves
      as a basis for malpractice claims [<a href="#n145">145</a>].
      The current practice of inadequate disclosure of information
      during the informed consent process may be responsible for
      some of these claims. Citing <i>Bolam vs. Friern Hospital
      Management Committee</i> [<a href="#n146">146</a>],
      Haberfield [<a href="#n72">72</a>] argues that while a
      physician is always obliged to fully disclose the risks and
      benefits of a proposed procedure, as long as the physician
      follows the practice accepted at the time by a responsible
      body of medical opinion, the doctor cannot be held negligent.
      However that analysis dose not take into account a recent
      Irish court ruling that a doctor who follows a practice
      approved by colleagues of similar specialities could
      nevertheless be challenged if it can be established that the
      practice has inherent defects that ought to be obvious to any
      person who gives the matter due consideration [<a
      href="#n147">147</a>]. Likewise under British law, physicians
      cannot defend themselves from charges of
      malpractice/assault/battery by stating that they were
      `inspired by a belief in the efficacy of a pseudo-medical
      treatment' [<a href="#n134">134</a>]. Haberfield's suggestion
      does not accord with the law in the UK or elsewhere; full
      disclosure is required regardless of contemporary medical
      opinion [<a href="#n148">148</a>]</p>

      <p>However, Haberfield also contends that circumcision's
      `<i>claimed</i> prophylactic medical benefits' would help a
      physician pass the Bolam test. In reality, the physician's
      liability is related to the body of medical opinion and, more
      importantly, to the validity of parental consent. In the
      context of circumcision, the current American practice of
      solicitation of a medically unnecessary operation with no
      prior parental inquiry and unrequested consultation represent
      glaring exceptions to ethically practised medicine [<a
      href="#n58">58</a>]. In the absence of medical need, it is
      hard to see how solicitation for this surgery amounts to
      anything more than the exploitation of normal and healthy
      children for money.</p>
      <br />

      <p><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>

      <p>The medical community is violating the law through a
      combination of faulty medical opinion, negligence and
      inadequate consent [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. Circumcision
      amputates the prepuce from the penis, resulting in a
      permanent alteration in the anatomy, histology and functional
      integrity of the penis. The procedure is not without risk,
      and horrific complications have been recorded in the medical
      literature. For circumcision of a non-consenting minor to be
      legally valid there must be a clear and immediate medical
      necessity; unsolicited, uncoerced, fully informed parental
      consent; and a determination that it is in the child's best
      interest. It must be shown to a reasonable degree of
      certainty that the child would, upon attainment of the age of
      reason, desire circumcision for himself. For circumcision to
      be permitted as a religious ritual, it would need to be
      demonstrated that the child is virtually certain to practice
      that religion upon attaining the age of reason and that the
      child will suffer in some way from having the decision
      reserved for him to make as an adult. Circumcision as
      currently practiced on non-consenting minors fails to meet
      that criteria.</p>

      <p>There is no reason, other than cultural bias, why the
      current child abuse laws and laws prohibiting female
      circumcision are not applied to those performing involuntary
      male circumcision. For those physicians currently performing
      involuntary circumcisions, the only protection may be full
      disclosure, but based on current legal precedent, this may
      not be enough.</p>
