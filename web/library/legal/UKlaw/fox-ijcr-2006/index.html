      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Routine neonatal male circumcision has
      generally failed to excite medico-legal attention.
      Notwithstanding recent debates in the ethical literature,
      notably in special issues or symposia in the <i>Journal of
      Medical Ethics</i> (2004, 30) and <i>American Journal of
      Bioethics</i> (2003, 3), the law has yet to engage seriously
      with this issue. In a forthcoming contribution to an emerging
      medico-legal debate we have suggested that neglect of this
      issue is partly attributable to the way in which routine
      infant male circumcision (and its attendant effects and
      risks) is typically characterised in opposition to female
      circumcision for rhetorical and political reasons (<a
      href="#c14">Fox and Thomson, 2005</a>). The result is that,
      while female circumcision is constructed as morally and
      legally unacceptable within a civilised society, male
      circumcision is characterised as a standard and benign
      medical practice. In this article our focus turns to the
      related failure to engage in a full cost/benefit analysis of
      the practice and the harm it causes to boy children.</p>

      <p class="text2">This article starts by outlining, briefly,
      how routine male circumcision has come to be debated in
      contemporary ethical, professional and (the limited) legal
      literature. Particular attention is devoted to the
      privileging of parental choice, notwithstanding documented
      medical risks and the absence of conclusive evidence of
      medical benefit. We suggest that the medico-legal failure to
      take seriously the risks involved is understandable if we
      recognise that the concept of harm is inherently fluid and
      that pain (particularly where it is experienced by infants)
      is often incapable of articulation. This insight means that
      it is crucial to address the ways in which specific harms are
      contextualised. We explore this process of constructing harm
      through a consideration of the law&rsquo;s response to
      circumcision in the leading case of <a
      href="/library/legal/UKlaw/rvbrown1993/"
      target="_blank"><i>Brown</i></a> and in the Law
      Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on circumcision in its
      report <i>Consent in the Criminal Law</i>. By problematising
      the legal reasoning in these English legal texts we seek to
      contest legal orthodoxy which construes the decision to
      circumcise a male infant as a legitimate parental
      decision.</p>

      <p class="text2">We also suggest that this prevailing legal
      consensus is largely a product of the way in which the
      practice has historically emerged. Thus we trace a brief
      history of neonatal male circumcision, focusing on the early
      justifications for the procedure and interrogating the types
      of harm that were constructed or imagined in these
      justifications. In these medical histories, the emphasis is
      placed on harms risked by not circumcising rather than the
      risks inherent in the procedure. Importantly, such
      justifications are based on matters of hygiene coupled with
      the control of disease, madness and masturbation. Although
      clearly spurious, as we shall highlight, echoes of these
      justifications recur in current debates and continue to carry
      potent symbolic resonance. Our contention is that in order to
      effect a shift in attitudes to the practice, the early
      justifications need to be articulated and challenged, and
      this has to be coupled with an emphasis on the real risks of
      the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before continuing, it is important to
      qualify what bodies we are talking of. In this paper our
      primary concern is with Anglo-American bodies. More
      specifically, we focus on the neonatal body subjected to this
      procedure for social (rather than legitimate medical)
      reasons.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Other
      European/industrialised nations do not share the same history
      of routine neonatal circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> (although Canada and Australia too
      have historically had high rates of neonatal circumcision (<a
      href="#c48">Waldeck, 2002</a>; <a href="#c37">Queensland Law
      Reform Commission, 1993</a>). As well as geographical
      specificity, there is also a chronology to note, since the
      shared history of routine circumcision in these countries has
      not endured. Thus, based on Army records, it has been
      estimated that before World War II 50% of working class and
      85% of upper class men in England were circumcised (<a
      href="#c19">Gollaher, 1994</a>: 25; see also <a
      href="#c17">Gairdner, 1949</a>). Whilst US rates remain high,
      in the UK the numbers, though significant, are now
      comparatively small. Estimates suggest that approximately
      30,000 procedures are performed annually in the UK, most on
      young children (<a href="#c50">Williams and Kapila,
      1993a</a>); and 1993 figures indicate that 5&ndash;6 per cent
      of British men were circumcised (<a href="#c54">Williams and
      Kapila, 1993b</a>).<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> With the
      introduction of the NHS, procedures that could not be
      demonstrated to be clearly medically efficacious were no
      longer to be provided by the state.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Whilst this process has had mixed
      success, circumcision was one procedure to be dropped early
      in the life of the NHS. The results under a private insurance
      system have been quite different, although available
      statistics do appear to suggest a decline in the recent
      incidence of circumcision in the US. The American Academy of
      Pediatrics estimated that, in 1999, 85 percent of male
      newborns were circumcised; (<a href="#c1">American Academy of
      Pediatrics, 1999</a>) while statistics for the following year
      record a rate of around 65 percent (<a href="#c33">National
      Center for Health Statistics, 2001</a>). Some commentators
      have argued that a downward trend in the statistics points to
      routine circumcision being experienced by only a minority of
      newborns within a generation (<a href="#c30">Miller,
      2002</a>). The picture is, however, more complicated that
      this suggests, since the statistics fail to display a linear
      decline, are affected by under reporting, and do not reflect
      regional and racial differences (<a href="#c48">Waldeck,
      2002</a>).</p>

      <h4>Contemporary Medico-Legal Debates</h4>

      <p class="quote">Ritual circumcision of male infants as
      religious and cultural practice is lawful in this country. .
      . . We allow parents to agree to a relatively minor, albeit
      irreversible procedure, in the interests of observing
      religious freedoms in the upbringing of their male child but
      that freedom stops short at the seriously invasive procedure
      on young girls (<a href="#c8">Bridge, 2002</a>: 279).</p>

      <p class="text1">Caroline Bridge&rsquo;s statement
      characterises most contemporary legal responses to the issue
      of male circumcision. Bridge constructs a simplified
      oppositional relationship between male and female
      circumcision whereby male circumcision is self-evidently
      different from the practice of female circumcision. As we
      have argued elsewhere, this form of response contributes to
      the negation of male circumcision as an issue within
      medico-legal literature (<a href="#c14">Fox and Thomson,
      2005</a>). Here we want to consider a related aspect of the
      contemporary debate. Anotable feature of work on female
      circumcision is the attention paid to the harms and risks
      inherent in the procedure(s). In sharp contrast, and related
      to the rhetorical strategy we have noted above, the harms
      inherent in male circumcision are generally downplayed, as in
      Bridge&rsquo;s essay, with risks being minimised as part of a
      strategy that privileges parental choice and freedoms.</p>

      <p class="text2">A special issue of the <i>American Journal
      of Bioethics</i> in 2003 further illustrates this discursive
      pattern. The issue&rsquo;s lead article &lsquo;Between
      Prophylaxis and Child Abuse&rsquo; purports to offer a third
      way within the polarised circumcision debate (<a
      href="#c4">Benatar and Benatar, 2003</a>). Stating that
      &lsquo;the ethics of a surgical procedure cannot be assessed
      independently of whatever harms and benefits it does or does
      not have&rsquo; (<a href="#c4">Benatar and Benatar, 2003</a>:
      36), the authors, Michael and David Benatar, provide a
      detailed analysis of the numerous studies that have aimed to
      validate or challenge the various prophylactic justifications
      that have emerged over time. Significantly, the authors
      conclude that none of the scientific evidence &lsquo;is
      anywhere near conclusive&rsquo; (<a href="#c4">Benatar and
      Benatar, 2003</a>: 42). Yet, notwithstanding their stated
      commitment to a full cost/benefit analysis, the authors
      dedicate just two paragraphs to pain, and only a single
      paragraph to consideration of possible complications (<a
      href="#c4">Benatar and Benatar, 2003</a>: 38). In relation to
      costs, they conclude that &lsquo;the most significant cost of
      neonatal circumcision is the pain that accompanies it. . . .
      Where [anesthesia] is used, this major cost can be eliminated
      or at least significantly reduced&rsquo; (<a
      href="#c4">Benatar and Benatar, 2003</a>: 42). Other risks
      involved are even more cursorily dealt with. Conversely, the
      authors argue that scientific opinion suggests medical
      benefits stem from circumcision. For instance, they propose
      that circumcision may offer some protection against urinary
      tract infection (<a href="#c4">Benatar and Benatar, 2003</a>:
      39). Yet these proposed benefits are not quantified in a way
      whereby they can be measured against quantifiable risks (such
      as the risks of haemorrhage, sepsis, ulceration or laceration
      of the penis or scrotum, psychological complications (Benatar
      and Benatar, 2003: 92&ndash;6),<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      or a morbidity rate of one in 500,000 (<a href="#c4">Benatar
      and Benatar, 2003</a>: 42). Ultimately, then, the Benatars
      themselves fail to provide an adequate cost/benefit analysis
      and their &lsquo;third way&rsquo; amounts simply to an
      argument for parental choice based on minimising the inherent
      risks of infant circumcision. Downplaying the risks permits
      the authors to embrace the cultural and social benefits that
      might flow from its exercise. Thus, they state, &lsquo;if we
      are correct that no clear and significant <i>medical</i>
      benefits derive from circumcision, there still might be
      <i>other</i> kinds of benefits&rsquo; (<a href="#c4">Benatar
      and Benatar, 2003</a>: 44). They conclude:</p>

      <p class="quote">[W]e think that neonatal circumcision cannot
      unequivocally be said to yield a net medical gain or loss. In
      other words, it is not something that can be said to be
      routinely indicated, nor something that is routinely
      contra-indicated. It is a discretionary matter. The decision
      whether or not to circumcise a child should thus be made by
      the parents, who, within certain limits, are entitled to
      employ their own value judgments in the furtherance of their
      child&rsquo;s best interests. These limits are not exceeded
      in most decisions about neonatal circumcision, given the
      nature of the medical evidence (<a href="#c4">Benatar and
      Benatar, 2003</a>: 42).</p>

      <p class="text1">As we have noted, a similar discursive
      strategy characterises the wider circumcision debate, as is
      evidenced by the recently revised BMA guidance to doctors (<a
      href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>). It too foregrounds the need for a
      cost/benefit analysis and, significantly, within this it
      highlights the contested nature of the claimed benefits. At
      various points evidence for the supposed beneficial effects
      of circumcision is described as &lsquo;equivocal&rsquo; (<a
      href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>: 2, 4) &lsquo;inconclusive&rsquo;
      (<a href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>: 4), &lsquo;not convincingly
      proven&rsquo; (<a href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>: 5),
      &lsquo;contradictory&rsquo; causing &lsquo;significant
      disagreement&rsquo;, lacking consensus and, ultimately,
      &lsquo;insufficient&rsquo;, leading to the conclusion that
      &lsquo;evidence concerning the health benefit from
      non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone
      to be justification&rsquo; (<a href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>: 7).
      Yet, while this is coupled with a recognition that there are
      inherent &lsquo;medical and psychological&rsquo; risks in the
      procedure (<a href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>: 5), the dominant
      message remains that parental beliefs should be respected,
      despite not being grounded in claims to health benefits:</p>

      <p class="quote">The medical harms or benefits have not been
      unequivocally proven but there are clear risks of harm if the
      procedure is done inexpertly. The Association has no policy
      on these issues. Indeed it would be difficult to formulate a
      policy in the absence of unambiguously clear and consistent
      medical data on the implications of the intervention. As a
      general rule, however, the BMA believes that the parents
      should be entitled to make choices about how best to promote
      their children&rsquo;s interests, and it is for society to
      decide what limits should be imposed on parental choices (<a
      href="#c10">BMA, 2003</a>: 3).<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As such, while the BMA&rsquo;s recognition
      of both the equivocal nature of the claimed benefits and the
      clear risks of harm (although this is subsequently minimised)
      may be interpreted as a progressive position, it nonetheless
      continues to construct male circumcision as an expression of
      parental privilege. This downplays both the pain experienced
      by the neonate (see <a href="#c4">Benatar and Benatar,
      2003</a>: 37&ndash;8 and accompanying references; <a
      href="#c49">Warnock and Sandrin, 2004</a>) and the fact that
      while complication rates from routine circumcision are low,
      the chances of these complications being mutilatory,
      infective or haemorrhagic are high (<a href="#c54">Williams
      and Kapila, 1993b</a>; <a href="#c18">Gerharz and Haarmann,
      2000</a>). Indeed, complications are potentially
      catastrophic, since death, gangrene, and total or partial
      amputation are known adverse outcomes (<a href="#c22">Hodges
      <i>et al.</i>, 2002</a>). This pattern of reasoning is also
      evident in <i>Re J (Re J (A Minor) (Prohibited Steps Order:
      Ciricumcision)</i>, and <i>Re J (Specific Issue Orders:
      Muslim Upbringing &amp; Circumcision)</i> [2000] 1 FLR 571;
      (2000) 52 BMLR 82, the only case where UK courts have
      directly considered circumcision). A similar conclusion has
      been reached in the Court of Appeal in <i>Re S (children)
      (Specific Issue: Religion: Circumcision</i>) [2005] 1 FLR
      236. The case concerned a five year old boy &ndash;
      &lsquo;J&rsquo; &ndash; who following his parents&rsquo;
      separation lived with his mother, a non-practising English
      Christian. His father was a non-practising Turkish Muslim,
      who wanted J to be circumcised so as to identify him with his
      father and confirm him as a Muslim. Having considered the
      factors relevant to J&rsquo;s upbringing, the Court of Appeal
      concluded that J should not be circumcised because he was
      not, and nor was he likely to be, brought up in the Muslim
      religion. Instead he had &ldquo;a mixed heritage and an
      essentially secular lifestyle&rdquo; and was unlikely to have
      such a degree of involvement with Muslims as to justify
      circumcising him for social reasons. In these circumstances,
      Wall J held that the boy was unlikely to derive any social or
      cultural benefit from circumcision:</p>

      <p class="quote">[T]he mother, as J&rsquo;s primary carer,
      would find it extremely difficult to present the question of
      circumcision to J in a positive light, and unlike ritual
      circumcision occurring in the context of a Muslim family . .
      . J&rsquo;s circumcision would be likely to be surrounded by
      tension and stress. . . . The strained relationship between
      the parents, and the fact that as a circumcised child J would
      be unlike most of his peers, increases the risk that J will
      suffer from adverse psychological effects from being
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text1">Having reached this conclusion, the court
      was able to avoid squarely confronting the legality of
      non-therapeutic circumcision, and could simply state that,
      for such a procedure, the consent of both parents would be
      desirable. On appeal Thorpe LJ reaffirmed that the judge had
      correctly balanced the father&rsquo;s right to manifest his
      religion against the welfare of the child and the rights of
      the mother. However, the more fundamental issue of
      <i>why</i>, in the event of agreement, this should be a
      familial decision is not addressed by either court. For our
      purposes the interest of the case lies in how it reveals
      law&rsquo;s reluctance to calculate the (admittedly
      complicated) risks of circumcision, and its readiness to set
      the social, religious or cultural benefits believed to flow
      from the practice against medical harms. Implicit in the
      judgements in this case is the assumption that the
      socio-religious benefits accruing in cases where a child is
      brought up in a Muslim or Jewish environment would be
      suf.cient to outweigh the medical risks &ndash; a conclusion
      endorsed by a number of leading medico-legal commentators.
      For instance Margot Brazier notes that:</p>

      <p class="quote">The child suffers momentary pain. Although
      medical opinion may not necessarily regard it as positively
      bene.cial, it is in no way medically harmful if properly
      performed. The community as a whole regards it as a decision
      for the infant&rsquo;s parents (<a href="#c6">Brazier,
      1992</a>: 350).<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/2000.html"
      target="_blank">Court of Appeal</a>, Thorpe LJ seems more
      cautious but does cite with approval Wall J&rsquo;s view
      that:</p>

      <p class="quote">[C]ircumcision is an effectively
      irreversible surgical intervention which has no medical basis
      in J&rsquo;s case. It is likely to be painful and carries
      with it small but definable physical and psychological risks.
      For it to be ordered there would accordingly have to be clear
      benefits to J which would demonstrate that circumcision was
      in his interests notwithstanding the risks (at 574).</p>

      <p class="text1">Yet, although he summarily dismisses the
      contrary view of the father&rsquo;s counsel that any
      considerations against circumcision were either transient or
      speculative, it is noteworthy that there is no explication of
      the precise nature of these physical and psychological risks.
      This is curious in an age when judges in health care cases
      appear to require ever more detailed quantifications of risks
      prior to authorising medical interventions.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Although a potential disadvantage is
      that reducing cost benefit analyses to statistical
      calculations may be very contested and may render judges
      especially susceptible to medical evidence if it is framed in
      quantifiable terms, we would argue that it is important that
      some attempt is made to quantify the nature of risks,
      especially when the purpose is non therapeutic, as in the
      contexts of research and vaccination, as well as
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">As well as minimising risks, commentators
      are equally prone to exaggerate putative benefits of infant
      circumcision. As noted above, Caroline Bridge reads <i>Re
      J</i> as authority for the proposition that doctors must
      embrace cultural pluralism by recognising and acting upon
      religious wishes, even if this involves a medically
      unnecessary procedure which interferes with the bodily
      integrity of the child, provided both parents agree and to
      the extent that the child benefits (<a href="#c8">Bridge,
      2002</a>: 282). However, in weighing these benefits, she not
      only characterises the practice as not causing significant
      harm, but also includes highly contested protective benefits
      against sexually transmitted diseases which are said to flow
      from male circumcision. Bridge&rsquo;s conclusion in
      facilitated by the rhetorical strategies we have
      outlined:</p>

      <p class="quote">Male circumcision is relatively harmless
      albeit, like tattooing, irreversible. The risks are minimal,
      the cultural and religious significance very great to large
      number of people, and it is now reported as having long term
      protective effects. This enhances its rational basis. Just as
      significantly, it is not a practice belonging to the fringes
      of society but is almost part of the mainstream. Female
      circumcision is the reverse (<a href="#c8">Bridge, 2002</a>:
      284).</p>

      <p class="text1">Though conceding that this is &ldquo;an
      arguably medically unnecessary and irreversible invasive
      procedure on male infants&rdquo; and that it is
      &ldquo;arguably, unnecessary mutilation for religious or
      cultural reasons&rdquo;, Bridge concludes that
      &ldquo;[a]rguably the long term protective benefits of
      circumcision, coupled with its religious significance,
      contribute to the child&rsquo;s overall welfare and is in his
      best interests&rdquo; (<a href="#c8">Bridge, 2002</a>: 281).
      The repeated qualifier &lsquo;arguably&rsquo; signals how
      much scope there is for debate over the alleged benefits and
      risks of the practice, while construing male circumcision as
      &ldquo;almost part of the mainstream&rdquo; signals a
      reluctance to challenge cultural norms.</p>

      <h4>The process of down-playing medical risks</h4>

      <p class="text1">Addressing the question of why such risks
      continue to be routinely denied or downplayed, thus casting
      this as a non-issue for law, pulls in several directions.
      Responses &ndash; or rather the failure to respond &ndash; to
      risk may be partly attributable to a widespread unwillingness
      to recognise certain forms of harm, especially those which
      are child specific. Below we address the ambivalent and
      contested nature of harm and pain. However, notwithstanding
      the historical and continuing cultural devaluation of the
      risks posed by male circumcision, it is impossible for
      commentators to ignore them completely and they are now
      beginning to be acknowledged in ethics and law.</p>

      <p class="text2">Turning first to professional ethical
      guidance issued to physicians. The American Paediatric
      Association guidance concedes that the infant experiences
      pain, with the resulting wound taking approximately ten days
      to heal. However, provided it is performed properly it
      concludes that there are generally no acknowledged
      ramifications (<a href="#c2">American Pediatric Association,
      1995</a>). As we have noted, the British Medical
      Association&rsquo;s advice on circumcision focuses on
      potential benefits rather than risks, although it
      acknowledges that, whereas &ldquo;the practice of
      circumcision has previously been considered to be morally
      neutral&rdquo;, it is now increasingly open to challenge. The
      BMA advises that:</p>

      <p class="quote">Individual doctors approached by parents
      requesting circumcision for their sons must counsel the
      parents about the implications of the procedures, including
      the health risks involved. Any surgical procedure, including
      one of a minor nature, carries with it risks, and parents
      must be made aware of these in order to give valid consent to
      the operation. In addition, doctors usually consider
      appropriate anaesthesia a requirement and this also carries
      an element of risk.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Yet, notwithstanding this tacit
      acknowledgement of its inherent risks, the practice is
      clearly to be tolerated. There seems little will on the part
      of the medical profession, whether institutionally or at the
      level of the individual practitioner, to challenge the
      acceptability of the procedure. In this respect attitudes to
      male circumcision may usefully be contrasted with other areas
      of health care law, where the ethics and legality of exposing
      infants to risk has generated considerable controversy and
      debate. We would suggest that a more productive comparison
      than female circumcision is to draw analogies with enrolment
      of infants in clinical research or vaccination programmes. In
      these contexts children are clearly vulnerable to being used
      for the benefit of others, raising similar concerns about the
      limits, if any, to parental powers to consent to
      controversial and invasive procedures on very young children.
      Yet, despite the possibility of real benefit to the
      individual child or other children, an extensive literature
      debates the ethics of engaging children in such practices
      (see, for instance, <a href="#c34">Nicolson, 1985</a>; <a
      href="#c9">Bridgeman, 2002</a>). The lack of tangible
      individual or societal bene.t accompanying circumcision makes
      it surprising that the routine nature of this practice has
      escaped similar legal controversy. Law&rsquo;s failure to
      scrutinise adequately the risky nature of this practice is
      particularly indefensible, since tort actions have forced law
      to confront and quantify the damage that has resulted from
      negligently performed circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One glaring example of UK law&rsquo;s
      failure is an influential Law Commission consultation paper,
      whose reasoning forms the basis for the BMA&rsquo;s guidance.
      In <i>Consent in the Criminal Law</i> the Law Commission
      addressed the limits that law should impose on the degree of
      injury to which a victim might lawfully consent. Its
      conclusion &ndash; that English law should permit the causing
      of intentional consensual injury provided that it fell short
      of being &ldquo;seriously disabling&rdquo; (<a
      href="#c26">Law Commission, 1995</a>: para 4.51) &ndash;
      would represent a significant liberalisation of English law
      in relation to a range of consensual practices, such as
      sado-masochism, branding, piercing and tattooing. In adopting
      this position, the Commission was highly critical of the
      landmark House of Lords&rsquo; decision in <i>R v. Brown</i>
      (<i>R v. Brown</i> [1993] 2 All ER 75), which criminalised
      the infliction of injury during consensual sado-masochistic
      practices.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> However, the
      notable feature of the practices considered by the Law
      Commission in Part IX of this report is that, aside from male
      circumcision, all of them are consensual actions engaged in
      by adults. To place infant male circumcision in this context
      seems bizarre, and explicable only by the Commission&rsquo;s
      implicit endorsement of an <i>obiter</i> comment by Lord
      Templeman in <i>Brown</i>, categorising male circumcision as
      a deliberately inflicted, but apparently lawful injury:</p>

      <p class="quote">Surgery involves intentional violence
      resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm but
      surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities carried on
      with consent by or on behalf of the injured person have been
      accepted as lawful notwithstanding that they involve actual
      bodily harm or may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual
      circumcision, tattooing, ear piercing and violent sports
      including boxing are lawful activities.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In the single paragraph which it
      subsequently devotes to circumcision the Commission simply
      states, without reference to any legal authority, that
      &ldquo;[m]ale circumcision is lawful under English common
      law.&rdquo; There is no discussion of what the practice
      involves, and, crucially, harms occasioned are downplayed or
      wholly ignored in the following statement:</p>

      <p class="quote">It is generally accepted that the removal of
      the foreskin of the penis has little if any effect on a
      man&rsquo;s ability to enjoy sexual intercourse, and this act
      is not, therefore, regarded as a mutilation (<a
      href="#c26">Law Commission, 1995</a>: para 9.2).</p>

      <p class="text1">There is no acknowledgement that this
      position is heavily disputed in the medical literature, given
      that &ldquo;[t]he prepuce plays an important role in the
      mechanical functioning of the penis during sexual acts, such
      as penetrative intercourse and masturbation&rdquo; (<a
      href="#c47">Warren, 1997</a>: 89). Moreover, the Law
      Commission omits any consideration of the greater risks
      inherent in circumcision. The elision of these risks leads it
      to propose that: &lsquo;[I]t would be useful to put the
      lawfulness of ritual male circumcision beyond any
      doubt&rsquo; (<a href="#c26">Law Commission, 1995</a>:
      9.3).</p>

      <p class="text2">In relation to body piercing of young
      children the Law Commission is equally tolerant of parental
      preferences (<a href="#c26">Law Commission, 1995</a>: 11.22)
      and Jo Bridgeman suggests this may be rooted in our cultural
      unwillingness to recognise young children as possessors of
      bodily integrity (<a href="#c9">Bridgeman 2002</a>: 111).
      Moreover, not only does the Commission fail to support its
      position on these interferences with bodily integrity, but
      David Ormerod and Michael Gunn have highlighted the
      inconsistencies underpinning its reasoning. Elsewhere it
      takes the view that female circumcision should remain
      completely banned, yet suggests that adults should be allowed
      to consent to even seriously disabling injury occasioned by
      gender reassignment or cosmetic surgery (<a
      href="#c36">Ormerod and Gunn, 1996</a>).<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> We would argue that in its failure
      to engage fully with a risk/benefit assessment of these
      various practices, the consultation document, like the
      <i>Brown</i> decision itself, is characteristic of legal
      reasoning. <i>Brown</i> has attracted a wealth of critical
      comment, one strand of which centres on the way in which it
      grossly exaggerated the risks of the sexual practices
      involved.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> In the case of
      circumcision a reversal of this process may be traced in
      law&rsquo;s willingness to downgrade risks of harm. This
      allows the Law Commission to ignore the fundamental
      challenges posed by male circumcision, including whether it
      can be categorised as a seriously disabling injury, whether
      the practice should be banned or limited to specific
      religious groups and whether it can be regarded as in the
      best interests of the child (<a href="#c36">Ormerod and Gunn,
      1996</a>: 703).</p>

      <p class="text2">It is significant that a range of different
      ethico-legal texts, from court decisions, to professional
      guidance, to law reform proposals, reveal a similar
      understanding of and response to circumcision. Together these
      texts form an influential discourse according to which infant
      male circumcision is perceived as low risk and hence a matter
      of parental choice, notwithstanding the lack of scientific
      justification for the practice. Only limited consideration is
      given to the seemingly obvious fact that circumcision is the
      excision of healthy tissue from a child unable to give his
      consent for no demonstrable medical benefit. In the rest of
      this article we wish to explore why this might be the case.
      It is necessary in doing so to address the reasons why and
      conditions in which this discourse and legal norms have
      emerged. The next section offers a brief genealogy of the
      emergence and routinization of the practice of circumcision
      in order to reframe male circumcision by rebutting
      contemporary medico-legal complacency as to its
      justifications. This also serves to highlight the way in
      which the historical justifications foreground the idea of
      marking and managing the sexed infant body and male
      sexuality.</p>

      <h4>Historical medical narratives</h4>

      <p class="text1">In February 1870 the highly respected and
      influential orthopaedic surgeon Dr John Lewis A. Sayre
      visited a young patient suffering paralysis. Initially he was
      unable to ascertain the cause, but soon discovered that the
      five year old boy&rsquo;s penis, whilst otherwise normal, had
      &lsquo;very small and pointed&rsquo; glans &lsquo;tightly
      imprisoned in the contracted foreskin. In an effort to
      escape, the meatus urinarius had become puffed out and red as
      in a case of severe granular urethritis.&rsquo; As he
      concluded:</p>

      <p class="quote">An excessive venery is a fruitful source of
      physical prostration and nervous exhaustion, sometimes
      producing paralysis, I was pleased to look upon this case in
      the same light, and recommended circumcision as a means of
      relieving the irritated and imprisoned penis (<a
      href="#c41">Sayre, 1870</a>: 206).</p>

      <p class="text1">The circumcision led to almost immediate
      improvements in the boy&rsquo;s health and before long he was
      walking with normal limbs. Sayer went on to perform a number
      of such operations. Subsequently he informed his colleagues
      that circumcision was the answer to a range of ailments:
      &lsquo;Many of the cases of irritable children, with restless
      sleep, and bad digestion, which are often attributed to
      worms, is [sic] solely due to the irritation of the nervous
      system caused by an adherent or constricted prepuce&rsquo;
      (<a href="#c41">Sayre, 1870</a>: 210). This marked the
      beginning of the rise and rise of Phimosis, an ill-defined
      and fluid pathology (<a href="#c21">Hodges, 1999</a>) and the
      recoding of the foreskin as pathological. Beyond the ailments
      of children, circumcision came to be seen as a cure for more
      problematic and elusive illnesses, as Miller notes:</p>

      <p class="quote">Within fairly short order, circumcision was
      promoted as a remedy for alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, gout,
      rheumatism, curvature of the spine and headache . . .
      paralysis, malnutrition, night terrors, and clubfoot; eczema,
      convulsions and mental retardation; promiscuity, syphilis,
      and cancer (<a href="#c30">Miller, 2002</a>: 527).</p>

      <p class="text1">Medical circumcision developed during a
      well-documented period of experimentation in genital surgery.
      This experimentation was motivated in part by the theory of
      reflex neurosis, a belief that &lsquo;there was an intricate
      web of nervous affinity running through the spine of every
      organ of the body and that, in turn, each organ had its own
      sphere of influence on physical and mental health&rsquo; (<a
      href="#c18">Gollaher, 1994</a>). On this understanding,
      circumcision emerged as a cure for a range of mental as well
      as physical illnesses. It was promoted as a cure for the
      related Victorian scourges of masturbation and insanity, and
      the more amorphous neurasthenia, a condition entailing:</p>

      <p class="quote">morbid fears, fear of society, of solitude,
      or travelling, of places, of disease, or morbid impulses, to
      kill oneself or others, mental depression, wakefulness,
      headache, impaired memory, [and] deficient mental control (<a
      href="#c5">Beard, 1882</a>).</p>

      <p class="text1">Importantly, at the same time that
      circumcision emerged in a therapeutic context for a growing
      number of problems, clitoridectomies and other medical
      treatment of the clitoris were enthusiastically revived for
      the alleviation of psychological symptoms (<a
      href="#c19">Gollaher, 1994</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">As with this form of female circumcision, a
      belief emerged that male circumcision cured masturbation, a
      &lsquo;well known&rsquo; cause of degeneracy and insanity.
      The role played by the emerging fear of the masturbating
      child in the history of the normalisation of circumcision
      needs to be acknowledged. Circumcision allowed the Victorians
      to manage cultural anxieties regarding masturbation,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> which had prompted an extensive
      campaign against masturbation and spermatorrhoea (&lsquo;wet
      dreams&rsquo;) (<a href="#c30">Miller, 2002</a>: 534). It was
      forcefully argued that circumcision diminished the incidence
      of masturbation by removing or preventing adhesions which
      would otherwise lead to the penis being handled and &ndash;
      almost invariably &ndash; to self-abuse (<a
      href="#c30">Miller, 2002</a>: 527). Arguably, curing
      masturbation was understood as the most important health
      benefit of circumcision (<a href="#c30">Miller, 2002</a>:
      527).<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Peter Charles
      Remondino&rsquo;s polemical and misleadingly titled
      <i>History of Circumcision</i> provides an indication of the
      role played by the spectre of the masturbating child, and
      illustrates the ultimate status that the
      &lsquo;tight-constricted, glans-deforming, onanism-producing,
      cancer-generating&rsquo; foreskin attained:</p>

      <p class="quote">The prepuce seems to exercise a malign
      influence in the most distant and apparently unconnected
      manner; where, like some of the evil genii or sprites in the
      Arabian tales, it can reach from afar the object of its
      malignity, striking him down unawares in the most
      unaccountable manner; making him a victim to all manner of
      ills, sufferings, and tribulations; unfitting him for
      marriage or the cares of business; making him miserable and
      an object of continual scolding and punishment in childhood,
      through its worriments and nocturnal enuresis; later on,
      beginning to affect him with all kinds of physical
      distortions and ailments, nocturnal pollutions, and other
      conditions calculated to weaken him physically, mentally and
      morally; to land him perchance, in jail or even in a lunatic
      asylum (<a href="#c39">Remondino, 1891</a>: 187,
      255&ndash;6).</p>

      <p class="text1">Associated with the &lsquo;war&rsquo; on
      masturbation was the more general desire to curb or tame
      masculine sexuality. Thus, in the <i>British Medical
      Journal</i> in 1935, R.W. Cockshut argued that a (further)
      benefit of removing the foreskin was the diminishment of the
      libido:</p>

      <p class="quote">I suggest that all male children should be
      circumcised . . . Civilization . . . requires chastity, and
      the glans of the circumcised rapidly assumes a leathery
      texture less sensitive than skin. Thus the adolescent has his
      attention drawn to his penis much less often . . . (<a
      href="#c11">Cockshut</a>).<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">The efficacy of circumcision was so widely
      accepted that it was enthusiastically advocated as a
      prophylactic, and by 1910 had become the most common
      operation in the United States (<a href="#c30">Miller, 2002:
      532)</a>.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> The case for
      prophylactic circumcision was forcefully made by J.M. McGee,
      though he remained unconvinced by Sayer&rsquo;s dramatic
      claims:</p>

      <p class="quote">I would favor circumcision . . . independent
      of existing disease, as a sanitary precaution [because] . . .
      (1.) The exposure of the glans to friction etc., hardens it,
      and renders it less liable to abrasion in sexual intercourse,
      and consequently venereal ulcer. (2.) It is acknowledged to
      be useful as a preventative of masturbation. (3.) It
      certainly renders the accident of phymosis and paraphymosis
      impossible. (4.) It prevents the retention of sebaceous
      secretion and consequent balanitis. (5.) It probably promotes
      continence by diminishing the pruriency of the sexual
      appetite (<a href="#c27">McGee, 1882</a>, cited in <a
      href="#c19">Gollaher, 1994</a>).</p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, within this history it is important
      to note the class and race dynamic that emerged. The fact
      that routine male circumcision long out lasted the sanitary
      movement may be explained in part through the recognition of
      how circumcision status became a signifier of social standing
      or distinction. Within this period childbirth for the middle-
      and upper-classes moved from the domestic setting to a
      medical moment subject to the management of physicians. As
      midwives rarely performed the procedure, to be circumcised
      was literally a marker of the child&rsquo;s birth rite/right.
      Similarly, it also existed as a barometer of the
      medicalisation of childbirth and the social status of the
      profession (<a href="#c19">Gollaher, 1994</a>). In 1949, on
      the eve of the decline in circumcision rates in the UK, one
      study of university entrants noted that 84 percent of
      students coming from the &lsquo;best-known public
      schools&rsquo; were circumcised, in comparison to only 50
      percent from other schools (<a href="#c17">Gairdner,
      1949</a>: 1433&ndash;37). This worked through from the
      association between health and morals and also through the
      association with the physician &lsquo;class&rsquo;. Gollaher
      notes that: &lsquo;the trend was inspired by a kind of
      medical class who persuaded their private patients of . . .
      the utility of emulation&rsquo; (<a href="#c19">Gollaher,
      1994</a>). This emulation of class was of growing importance
      within the changing demographics of turn of the century
      America. With the influx of immigrants from Southern and
      Eastern Europe a racist discourse of pollution and contagion
      emerged. Circumcision status as a social marker flourished
      within this. As Gollaher concludes:</p>

      <p class="quote">So it happened that the foreskin, despised
      by the medical profession, came to broadly signify ignorance,
      neglect, and poverty. As white middle-class gentiles adopted
      circumcision, those left behind were mainly recent
      immigrants, African Americans, the poor, and others at the
      margins of respectable society (<a href="#c19">Gollaher,
      1994</a>: 22&ndash;23).</p>

      <p class="text1">The distribution across class continues to
      the present day (<a href="#c29">Miller, 2002</a>: 532), and
      may be a material factor in the persistence of the procedure.
      As Sarah Waldeck has argued, &lsquo;norms that are rooted in
      concerns about esteem and reputation often work to lock in
      inefficiencies&rsquo;(<a href="#c48">Waldeck, 2002</a>).</p>

      <h4>Constructing harm to boy&rsquo;s bodies</h4>

      <p class="text1">In the more recent medical narratives
      surrounding circumcision that we examined above the discourse
      of risks and harms looms large. Significantly, however, the
      preoccupation in this literature is again with harms that are
      portrayed as flowing from a failure to circumcise, rather
      than those potentially or directly inflicted by the practice
      of circumcision itself. We would argue that this is a typical
      feature of law, which as we have noted, tends differentially
      to construct harms, attaching weight to some, while
      downplaying others. In a society characterised by a
      proliferation of risks, the notion of &lsquo;harm&rsquo;
      remains conceptually fluid. As Beck, Wells and others have
      argued, societal perceptions of risk are culturally specific
      and dependent on contemporary notions of what harms are
      acceptable (see, for instance, <a href="#c3">Beck, 1992</a>;
      <a href="#c52">Wells, 1998</a>). Medicine and law function as
      key social institutions to not only manage risks, but to
      produce knowledge about them. Ideally, this should translate
      into some forum for disseminating and debating the legal and
      moral issues raised, but in the context of male circumcision,
      we would argue that current ethical guidance and law fails to
      do this.</p>

      <p class="text2">We would suggest that a number of factors
      facilitate the downplaying of risks and harm this context. It
      is worth noting that the notion of harm is inherently
      subjective and open to manipulation. The texts we have
      analysed above demonstrate Carol Smart&rsquo;s contention
      that &lsquo;harm&rsquo; is not &ldquo;a transcendental notion
      which is automatically knowable and recognisable at any
      moment in history by any member of a culture&rdquo; (<a
      href="#c45">Smart, 1999</a>: 392).<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> Moreover, the notion of harm to
      children is particularly open to manipulation given the
      inability of a young child to articulate his pain and the
      contradictions which are evident in law&rsquo;s understanding
      of children. As Katherine O&rsquo;Donovan has argued, law
      routinely denies the subjectivity of children, and has
      structured the parent/child relationship in terms of parental
      responsibility (<a href="#c35">O&rsquo;Donovan, 1993</a>). Of
      course, this general construction of the child as a legal
      object rather than subject is reflective of a broader
      confusion in our society about the status of children.
      Throughout the twentieth century Valerie Zelizer has traced a
      profound cultural transformation in our attitudes to
      children, which she terms the &lsquo;sacrilization&rsquo; of
      children&rsquo;s lives. This process involves a shift from
      viewing children as an object of utility to valuing them as
      an object of sentiment (<a href="#c55">Zelizer, 1985</a>:
      Chapter 1). These competing constructions of the child
      &ndash; as expendable property and as a sentimental object of
      concern &ndash; can both be tracked in the history of
      circumcision we have outlined. Although the latter
      construction is now dominant, in the Victorian era children
      were much more readily deemed expendable &ndash; as
      exemplified by high rates of infant mortality, and even new
      born child murder (<a href="#c24">Jackson, 1998</a>). Thus,
      it is scarcely surprising that &ldquo;[c]hildhood has lurched
      from privacy, non regulation and minimal legal protection
      into regulation by a phalanx of specialist agencies&rdquo;
      (<a href="#c12">Evans, 1993</a>: 392). Yet, as exemplified by
      the circumcision debates, such regulation remains partial, as
      certain decisions pertaining to children remain unchallenged
      in the private zones of family and religion. Thus, although
      they may indeed be cast as objects of concern, frequently
      this does not translate into benefits or protection for the
      child.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our discussion of how the Law Commission
      discounted risks to children at pp. 164&ndash;5 above, we
      noted Bridgeman&rsquo;s argument that we remain culturally
      unwilling to recognise the bodily integrity of young
      children. She argues persuasively that &ldquo;within law,
      children&rsquo;s bodies are constructed as potential and what
      is permitted by the law is determined by consideration of the
      future which the child embodies and without consideration of
      the present reality of the child&rdquo; (<a
      href="#c9">Bridgeman, 202</a>: 103). We would suggest that,
      in the circumcision context, this construction of the child
      results in undue priority being accorded to parental
      assessments of his best future interests and a concomitant
      downplaying of harms inflicted in the present. The harm which
      we would particularly flag up in this context is the pain
      inflicted on the child. As Elaine Scarry has argued in her
      influential consideration of the topic, it is inherently
      difficult to make sense of pain. Unlike any other state of
      consciousness it lacks a referential context &ndash;
      &ldquo;it is not <i>of</i> or <i>for</i> anything. It is
      precisely because it takes no object that it, more than any
      other phenomenon, resists objectification in language&rdquo;
      (<a href="#c42">Scarry, 1985</a>: 5). Scarry suggests that
      pain&rsquo;s resistance to, or active destruction of
      language, results in it being radically unshareable:</p>

      <p class="quote">[F]or the person in pain, so uncontestably
      and unnegotiably present is it that &lsquo;having pain&rsquo;
      may come to be thought of as the most vibrant example of what
      it is to &lsquo;have certainty&rsquo;, while for the other
      person it is so elusive that &lsquo;hearing about pain&rsquo;
      may exist as the primary model of what it is &lsquo;to have
      doubt&rsquo;. Thus pain comes unshareably into our midst as
      at once that which cannot be denied and that which cannot be
      confirmed (<a href="#c42">Scarry, 2002</a>: 4).</p>

      <p class="text1">Clearly such difficulties in communicating
      and sharing the experience of pain are compounded in the case
      of young children since they have no language at all in which
      to attempt to communicate their experience. In this regard we
      would argue that the medical profession have been culpable in
      their failure to articulate the pain inherent in
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Indeed, as Miller points out, doctors took
      advantage of the fact that performing the procedure on
      neonates who were incapable of resisting made it considerably
      easier to practise (<a href="#c29">Miller, 2002</a>: 530).
      Furthermore, then prevailing beliefs that neonates did not
      experience pain allowed physicians to argue that surgical
      interventions at this early stage carried reduced risks,
      since they could be accomplished without anaesthetic and with
      less invasive cutting than would be necessary with an older
      child. Additionally, even physicians who acknowledged that
      the procedure in.icted pain could justify this by pointing to
      a salutary association thereby created between pain and
      masturbation, thus reinforcing the campaign against
      masturbation.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> Miller notes
      that a further practical advantage of early circumcision was
      that bad results, even death, were easily explicable in an
      era where neonatal death was unremarkable (<a
      href="#c30">Miller, 2002</a>: 530&ndash;1). It is more
      surprising that modern understandings of children as objects
      of intense concern (<a href="#c12">Evans, 1993</a>: 209),
      coupled with significantly reduced rates of infant mortality,
      and growing evidence of the capacity even of late foetuses to
      feel pain (<a href="#c13">Fitzgerald, 1995</a>), have not
      conspired to make doctors more conscious of the need to
      underline the infant capacity for pain and to contest
      practices which in.ict it unnecessarily. As Scarry notes,
      &ldquo;the success of the physician&rsquo;s work will often
      depend on the acuity with which she can hear the fragmentary
      language of pain, coax it into clarity and interpret
      it&rdquo; (<a href="#c42">Scarry, 1985</a>: 7). In this
      regard we argue that the medical profession have failed
      children.</p>

      <p class="text2">We would also suggest that gender is
      crucially implicated in this failure. In health care, as in
      other legal disciplines, male bodies have functioned as the
      norm and therefore tended to be less politically contentious
      than other bodies. Thus, feminist critiques of health care
      law have done much to foreground harms that are specific to
      women&rsquo;s bodies, while foetal rights advocates have
      argued strenuously for foetal protection policies that avert
      harm to the foetus. Debates concerning these bodies have
      often focused on their vulnerability to harm &ndash; as is
      evident in the framing of debates around female circumcision.
      By contrast, male bodies are typically constructed as safe,
      bounded and impermeable.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> We
      would argue that this construction is problematic in a number
      of ways. Within the immediate context it fits somewhat
      uneasily with law&rsquo;s rather vexed construction of
      children&rsquo;s bodies, rendering the construction of the
      boy&rsquo;s body in law inherently contradictory. We would
      suggest that this may make it more difficult to uncover harms
      to boys &ndash; a contention which seems to be borne out by
      the tendency of Anglo-American legal commentators to minimise
      the harms inflicted on boys by circumcision with a
      concomitant propensity to exacerbate the risks occasioned by
      less invasive forms of female circumcision. Our suggestion is
      that within law the role of abuse victim is feminised, so
      that the discursive construction of victims may produce a
      greater acknowledgment of harms perpetrated against girls. As
      Carol Smart has noted, boys were seemingly &ldquo;not
      constituted as part of the historical story of child sexual
      abuse&rdquo; (<a href="#c45">Smart, 1999</a>: 395).</p>

      <p class="text2">On this view gender is an important
      component of the subjective construction of harm. This
      contention is also borne out by the historical medical
      narratives outlined above, which continue to be implicated in
      contemporary reluctance to acknowledge male circumcision as
      harm. Moreover, we would tentatively flag up here an argument
      that, for boys, the pain inflicted by circumcision may even
      be seen as beneficial in fostering a necessary training in
      masculinity. In aesthetic terms it serves to medically
      enhance his body, thereby conferring important social
      benefits through signalling his membership of privileged
      religious, racial or social groupings. We would argue that
      understanding circumcision as an initiation into masculinity
      underpins the deeprooted cultural preference for male
      circumcision in Anglo-American world and is useful both in
      accounting for the persistence of the practice and in
      suggesting ways to eradicate it.</p>

      <h4>Conclusions</h4>

      <p class="quote">Although the sensation of pain is entirely
      subjective, how it is perceived, configured, communicated
      and, explained, relieved or amplified, and its effect upon a
      person&rsquo;s relationship to others and themselves, are
      shaped inter-subjectively by cultural beliefs and social
      practices, including, not least by prevailing medical
      categories and beliefs (<a href="#c31">Morgan, 2002</a>:
      88).</p>

      <p class="text1">This paper has aimed to question the general
      legal and social acceptance of the practice of routine male
      circumcision. Contesting current legal approaches to issues
      of harm, risk and the rights of children, we have argued that
      the dominant permissive approach to male circumcision is
      indefensible. Historically law has tolerated male
      circumcision as a benign practice, but we hope to have
      demonstrated that many of the underlying reasons for
      construing it as harmless need to be re-assessed. Doing so
      would, we argue, help to challenge the view that simply
      because a practice is perceived as mainstream in our society
      (<a href="#c8">Bridge, 2002</a>: 282) it is to be legally
      tolerated in the absence of a compelling case that its
      medical benefits outweigh its clear harms. We concur with
      Sarah Waldeck&rsquo;s position that imposing legal reforms
      will not work unless the social norms which underpin them and
      parental motivations for circumcising their children are
      understood and subjected to challenge. Consequently we
      suggest that further consideration is needed of the specific
      form which legal regulation might take, on this and other
      issues where parents are entrusted with deciding in the best
      interests of their children. Any legal reform proposals must
      be coupled with a clear demonstration of their rationale, and
      we would argue that the medical profession has a key role to
      play in education. As was the case with child sexual abuse,
      we suggest that the contested nature of key conceptions in
      the circumcision debate &ndash; such as &lsquo;child&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;harm&rsquo; and &lsquo;pain&rsquo; &ndash; combined
      with the fact that such pain is inflicted within the sanctity
      of the family account for law&rsquo;s resistance to attempts
      to regulate the practice or fully evaluate its risks. In this
      context, as with the uncovering of child abuse, we would
      argue that there is a need for law to be alert to its power
      in defining risks and manipulating the concept of harm, and
      to interrogate why parents should be entrusted with decisions
      about their children&rsquo;s best interests. For so long as
      children continue to function as the repository of various
      contradictory meanings, concerns that they evoke will often
      speak more to the implications for adults of issues
      surrounding the child, than child protection.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> <span class="yellow">Our contention
      is that in cases of demonstrable harm, such as the
      unnecessary and painful excision of healthy tissue, law and
      professional guidance should be motivated by child protection
      until that child can make his or her autonomous
      decisions.</span></p>

        Phimosis refers to a constricted or adherent foreskin. Most
        male infants are, however, born with an adherent foreskin
        that only subsequently becomes fully functioning. The vast
        majority of male children will have fully retractable
        foreskins by the age of five. In addition, many persistent
        problems can be remedied manually without having to rely on
        circumcision. Medical understandings of Phimosis have been
