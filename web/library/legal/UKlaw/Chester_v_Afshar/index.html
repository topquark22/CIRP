      </div>

      <ol>
        <li><!--1-->The defendant appeals against the order made by
        His Honour Judge Robert Taylor, sitting as a Judge of the
        High Court in the Queen's Bench Division, on 21 December
        2000 in a medical negligence action. The judge found that
        the defendant had not been negligent in his conduct of the
        operation but had been negligent in failing to warn the
        claimant of the risk of paralysis which in fact ensued. He
        held the defendant liable for the injuries sustained in the
        operation and gave judgment for the claimant for damages to
        be assessed.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--2-->The appeal raises the important and difficult
        question, not so far considered at appellate level in this
        country, of when a doctor should be held to have caused the
        injury, the risk of which he failed to give proper warning
        to his patient. The judge gave permission to appeal on that
        issue. The defendant also wishes to challenge the judge's
        finding of fact that a proper warning had not been given
        and to argue that the allegation should not have been
        pursued because it was not properly pleaded. The claimant
        wishes to challenge the judge's finding of fact that the
        operation had not been negligently performed, but only
        should she lose the appeal on the main issue. She also has
        permission to appeal against the costs order made by the
        judge, but that has not been argued pending the
        determination of the current appeal.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text"><b>The facts</b></p>

      <ol start="3">
        <li><!--3-->The claimant in this action, Miss Chester, was
        a working journalist born in 1943, who had had various
        episodes of back pain from April 1988. For these she was
        conservatively treated by Dr Wright, a consultant
        rheumatologist. In September of 1994 she had a fifth
        episode of back trouble, very shortly before she was to
        undertake a professional engagement in France. The episode
        was so severe that walking was painful. She consulted Dr
        Wright, who gave her an epidural injection to tide her over
        the trip, and on her return arranged for her to have a MRI
        scan.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--4-->On 13 October 1994, Dr Wright saw Miss Chester
        again, having seen the results of the scan which showed "A
        very substantial centro-lateral variation at L2/3, central
        canal stenosis at L3 and L4/5". He advised the claimant to
        consider surgery to her back. She made it clear that she
        wished to avoid surgery if at all possible, expressing a
        general aversion to it. Accordingly, he gave a
        sinu-vertebral block injection at L2 level and a large
        volume epidural injection. As this brought about no clear
        improvement, Dr Wright repeated his advice as to surgery,
        this time recommending two practitioners, one of whom was
        the defendant, Mr Afshar, an eminent neurosurgeon.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--5-->Miss Chester was not impressed by this choice.
        She wanted a consultant (a word she understood as
        "advisor") to advise her on alternatives to surgery, while
        Dr Wright was advising surgery and sending her to a
        surgeon. In his letter of referral to Mr Afshar, Dr Wright
        wrote that she was "... anxious to avoid surgery if at all
        possible ... I feel sure she will take a long time to
        recover without your assistance." As the last sentence
        implied, surgery then was elective rather than necessary.
        She did not need emergency surgery.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--6-->Miss Chester had her consultation with Mr Afshar
          as his last appointment on 18 November 1994, a Friday. He
          examined her for 15 minutes and some 30 minutes was spent
          in discussion. It is common ground that Mr Afshar advised
          Miss Chester that the three intra-vertebral discs in
          question should be removed. But there was a sharp
          conflict of evidence as to the detail of the
          conversation. Mr Afshar gave an account in which he dealt
          with the risk of cauda equina nerve root disturbance,
          while according to Miss Chester there was no such
          explanation. Miss Chester's account was summarised thus
          by the judge (we have corrected clerical errors in his
          verbatim quotations from the witness statements but
          adopted his summaries of the oral evidence, taken from
          his notes): 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"23. According to the Claimant, she was
            never adequately warned of the possible risks involved
            in such an operation. Her account of what she was told
            by the Defendant on 18 November 1994 is set out in the
            following terms in paragraph 5 of her first witness
            statement, which is dated 22 September 1999 [TB Volume
            1, pages 64-65]:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`I first met the Defendant, Mr
              Afshar, on 18 November 1994 when I attended his
              Harley Street surgery for examination. On that
              occasion, I was accompanied by my husband and, after
              studying the MRI scan which was taken on 6 October
              1994, Mr Afshar quite matter of factly said I needed
              surgery to remove three discs, which were the cause
              of my problem. As I was very concerned about having
              to undergo surgery for my problem, I asked what the
              success rate of such an operation was, but did not
              receive a clear answer from Mr&nbsp;Afshar, although
              he did tell me that he performed about 300 operations
              such as this per year. As I was concerned, I told him
              of the many horror stories I had heard about back
              operations and he laughed, stating that he had never
              crippled anybody yet. Indeed, so confident was he
              that I distinctly remember that, almost as an aside,
              he stated: "Of course, you could be my first".
              Certainly it occurred to me that removal of three
              discs was rather a lot, and when I put this to Mr
              Afshar, he almost dismissively agreed. Further, when
              he told me the time at which he was to perform the
              surgery, I did suggest that it was rather late in the
              evening, but Mr Afshar responded that he would not be
              tired and was capable of working through the night
              when necessary. As a result of Mr Afshar's confidence
              in performing the surgery, and because he was
              recommended by Dr Wright, I agreed to undergo the
              operation. However, at no time was it suggested to me
              that there could be serious complications which could
              lead to any form of paralysis or leave me in a
              wheelchair. Indeed, if I had been aware of the major
              complications associated with this surgery then, due
              to my fear of surgery, I would have obtained at least
              a second, if not a third, opinion. Unfortunately, Mr
              Afshar never provided me with information on the
              seriousness of possible complications and as a result
              I lost the opportunity to seek an alternative
              opinion.'</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">In the course of her evidence, she
          somewhat expanded this account in response to counsel's
          questions. In her evidence-in-chief, the Claimant said
          this:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`After examination Mr Afshar showed
              me the scan. He pointed out three bulges and said
              they shouldn't be there and would all have to come
              out. When I was told this I felt terrible because he
              was, in effect, saying that I would have to have
              surgery. I didn't want to have surgery. I asked Mr
              Afshar if there was any other way to escape having
              surgery. He didn't give me any alternatives. He said
              I had three discs which would have to be removed -
              and that in a couple of months I would be back doing
              the work I had always done. He said I would be eight
              to ten days in hospital, after which I would have to
              rest up a bit. I said I had heard a lot of horror
              stories about surgery and I wanted to know about the
              risks. The reply I got from Mr Afshar was: "Well, I
              have never crippled anybody yet". It was a throw-away
              line. He did add: "Of course, you could be my first".
              I didn't take this seriously, in a crippling sense. I
              just took it that it was a very easy operation - Zum!
              Zum! Zum! One of my questions to Mr Afshar in Miss
              Martin's office was: "Isn't three discs rather a
              lot?" the answer was matter-of-factly: "Yes" ... I
              agreed to the surgery because Mr Afshar made it sound
              really simple. He did not tell me about any downside
              or risks whatever. He made it sound easy. He said he
              did about 300 such operations a year, so I said:
              "Let's do it". If I had been provided with an
              alternative that didn't involve surgery, as I now
              know them to be, I would have taken it. If I had been
              told of the risks of surgery, as I now know them to
              be, I would not have had the operation on Monday 21
              November. I would have had a very shaky weekend and
              called various journalist friends as to who I should
              go to see. I would also have contacted the BMA. I
              would have wanted at least two further opinions as to
              whether an operation was necessary in the first
              place. Nobody had said to me that this was a
              life-and-death matter and: "If you don't have this
              operation you will end up in a wheelchair". Dr Wright
              and Mr Afshar had never said this. The operation
              sounded so simple and routine.'</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">When cross-examined, she replied:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`I asked a lot of questions about the
              operation. Before I went to see Mr Afshar I knew
              surgery was a possibility. I hadn't done any research
              about surgery beforehand. Mr Afshar did not discuss
              any risks with me whatsoever. He didn't mention
              haemorrhage. I did not mention paralysis
              specifically, but I may have implied this when I
              spoke of horror stories. If I had learnt that, as has
              subsequently come out, I was a high risk patient, I
              would not have gone for operation on the Monday, nor
              would my husband have let me. Mr Afshar never
              mentioned the risk of paralysis. He never mentioned
              the risk of being crippled, except in a throw-away
              line at which we laughed. It was not mentioned that
              there was a small risk of nerve damage, infection and
              bleeding. I have a good memory for the conversation
              on that particular occasion.'"</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--7-->Mr Afshar's account was that he had warned Miss
          Chester of the risks, as the judge recounts: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"25. The defendant dealt with this
            issue in paragraphs 7 to 9 of his first witness
            statement, which is dated 23 September 1999 [TB Volume
            1, pages 81-83]:"</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`I recollect that the Claimant
              attended the appointment on 18.11.94 with her husband
              and she asked numerous questions regarding the
              surgery and the risks and all matters were discussed
              in great detail with her. I believe that she was the
              last patient of the day and that she was continuing
              to ask questions when we left my consulting room and
              went into my secretary's room in order to book the
              operation. My secretary clearly remembers the
              Claimant asking further questions in the secretaries'
              office in her presence. The Claimant could therefore
              be in no doubt about the procedure or the risks
              associated with it. I explained to her that there was
              a small risk of cauda equina and nerve root
              disturbance. I explained that this could mean
              weakness and sensory disturbance leading to reduction
              in power in her legs and alterations to touch,
              temperature and position sense. I would have
              explained that the risks were not great and this
              advice would be based on my own experience of having
              performed many hundreds of similar operations since
              1975 and I had not experienced these problems
              previously. I also explained that there was a small
              risk of haemorrhage and infection. Following similar
              operations, I have experienced a case of infection in
              about three or four cases, but I have never had a
              case of haemorrhage and this is very rare. I would
              have explained that all operations carry certain
              risks but that the risks of this particular operation
              were not great in comparison to surgical procedures
              that are carried out on the brain and spinal cord.
              The Claimant asked a number of questions in addition
              to what the operation involved and what the risks
              were. She asked what would happen if nothing was
              done, how long she would be in hospital, and when she
              would be able to go back to work. I went into the
              procedure very thoroughly and explained that if she
              did not have the operation performed then she would
              certainly have continual problems due to the
              substantial L2/L3 disc. I would not have described
              the operation as straightforward, although I may well
              have described it as routine as I perform up to three
              or four of these operations per week. I would not
              have expressly stated to the Claimant that I was
              entirely competent to carry out the procedure,
              although I accept that this would be implicit as the
              Claimant would not have been referred to me if I was
              not competent to carry out the procedure. I would not
              have expressly said to her that she could only
              experience improvement in her symptoms if she had the
              operation performed, and that she had nothing to lose
              and only to gain. However I would have told her that
              her pain would have the optimal chance of improvement
              as a result of the operation and the operation would
              decrease the risk of the discs causing damage in the
              future. I did not tell her that there should be no
              delay in carrying out the procedure. The Claimant
              asked me when she could have it done and I explained
              that I would check with my secretary. The Claimant
              was not someone who needed emergency surgery. As it
              was routine surgery, I explained that she would be
              able to have the operation performed at the next
              available slot. When we went to see my secretary it
              was apparent that there was space for her on the
              operating list on 21.11.94 and we booked her in for
              that date.'</p>

          <p class="text">In the course of his evidence he said

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`With all patients who undergo
              neuro-surgery, whatever the procedure is, it is
              important to tell them of the risks. This was
              indelibly imprinted on me from my one-and-a-half
              years' residence in the United States. I was doing
              the majority of the surgery there and having to get
              consents. Informed consent was then as big an issue
              in the United States as it has become here. It is
              always my practice to explain the risks to the
              patient. She was an articulate, highly intelligent
              lady. She was nervous and anxious. She asked many
              questions. I explained to her about nerve damage. In
              particular she asked about paralysis and leg
              weakness. I can't remember the exact words but she
              expressed herself in terms such as "crippling". I
              tried to reassure her. I told her that I had never
              caused any damage to the cauda equina or nerve roots
              in many hundreds of operations I had carried out in
              20 to 25 years of spinal surgery. I can't remember
              verbatim what I told her but, if she had asked what
              the risk was, I would have told her that the risk was
              less than one in 100. I would have gone on to speak
              of my own experiences, which is really what she was
              interested in, in the terms she has said in her
              witness statement. I do not feel that I misled her
              about the risks. I do not think that I would now
              alter what I said to her.'</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">In cross-examination, the Defendant
          replied:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`I can't remember verbatim what I
              said about the risks to Miss Chester. I said in
              general terms that the risks of nerve damage in
              someone who was neurologically intact were not great.
              I didn't think that operating as I did would cause a
              high risk, or indeed any significant risk, of cauda
              equina syndrome. Otherwise I would have told Miss
              Chester of this. Pre-operatively I had not come
              across a case where disc surgery had caused cauda
              equina syndrome. Before the surgery I would have said
              that the risks of cauda equina syndrome were small.
              It was a possible risk. Every operation has
              possibilities. I discussed with Miss Chester the
              outcomes of having surgery or not having surgery. In
              order to remove any disc by any route you have to
              manipulate the nerve root and dural sac. There is a
              small risk of nerve damage in any routine
              micro-discectomy. The more compression and the
              greater the prolapse, the greater the risk. The
              higher the disc, the bigger the risk. I showed Miss
              Chester where the disc was, what it was doing to the
              nerve roots and why I recommended surgery. I can't
              remember the percentage terms I told her for that
              particular disc. Cauda equina syndrome can lead, at
              one end of the spectrum, to minor disturbance of
              nerve roots. At the other end there is paralysis. I
              thought I had spent a great deal of time spelling out
              the risks. Miss Chester asked me a lot of questions
              about nerve damage and I told her. I told Miss
              Chester that she would have continuing problems
              without surgery: I meant the problems she had
              experienced before. I would not have agreed before
              the event that she was at risk of paralysis without
              surgery. There was a risk of paralysis but I did not
              think it sufficient to mention it to an already
              nervous patient. She had a potential risk of
              paralysis without surgery, but if you ask me what the
              degree of risk was or when it could occur, I cannot
              say.'</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">He also accepted that he had not made a
          note about his discussion about risks with the Claimant,
          adding: `Certainly since the mid-nineties we have been
          making notes of our discussions but I have no note of
          this discussion.' Finally, in re-examination, he
          said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`Pre-operatively this was not an
              exceptional case. It was a large prolapsed disc. It
              was at an unusual site. Most prolapsed discs are
              lower down but prolapses at this site are not
              uncommon.'"</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--8-->The operation took place when scheduled on Monday
          21 November 1994, three days after the consultation. The
          consent form, signed without further explanation on the
          afternoon of the operation, was for an L2/3, L3/4 and
          L4/5 micro-discectomy. It took some two hours. At first
          Mr Afshar thought the operation had been successful. His
          operation note reflects this. His evidence was 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"There was no complication during the
            operation. When I said in note `Roots and cauda equina
            fully decompressed', that is what I could actually see
            using the microscope. The goals of my original
            operation were fully met."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">But when Miss Chester recovered
          consciousness, it was clear that all was not well. There
          was both motor and sensory impairment. Mr Afshar
          mobilised a full radiological team, and a scan showed
          that full decompression had not been achieved in the
          first operation. So Mr Afshar conducted a second
          operation. The site was re-explored immediately. But
          still Mr Afshar could not, during his second operation,
          find any explanation for Miss Chester's condition which
          satisfied him. Accordingly, a second post-operative scan
          was performed the following day; this revealed only a
          small fragment of material which Mr Afshar did not think
          would have contributed to "the profound change which had
          occurred". In his contemporaneous note he recorded:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"My only explanation for the current
            situation is one of cauda equina contusion that may
            have occurred on the routine medial retraction of L3
            root and cauda equinal dura during the L2/L3 disc
            removal at the first procedure."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">He said in evidence "Because a nerve had
          been damaged, I assumed that I had caused the damage by
          manipulation. That is only an assumption. There could be
          other factors, such as interruption of vascular
          supply."</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--9-->Post-operatively, Miss Chester made progress in
          certain respects. Within two or three weeks her right leg
          function returned virtually to normal, but on her left
          side progress was much slower, and at trial, six years
          later, she still suffered substantial disability in a
          number of areas. Paragraph 8 of her Statement of Claim
          reads: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"Following the said surgical procedures
            set forth in Paragraph 7 hereinbefore, the Plaintiff's
            condition was worse than it had been pre-operatively.
            She has, since that date been suffering extensive
            neurological deficit which has resulted in gross
            functional deficit, continuing pain, unemployability
            and every aspect of her life has been diminished if not
            ruined."</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li><!--10-->Miss Chester's claim was put in two ways.
        First, it was said that in breach of contractual duty and
        negligently, Mr Afshar failed to advise, explain or
        otherwise counsel her as to the real risks attached to the
        surgical procedure, thereby depriving her of an opportunity
        to reflect, consider and/or seek alternative medical or
        other opinion as to the options which might be open to her;
        second, that the first surgical procedure was negligently
        carried out by Mr Afshar, that he used the wrong technique,
        and that he caused bruising (and so neural damage) to the
        cauda equina and/or nerve roots (no criticism is now made
        of the second or remedial operation). It follows that if
        Miss Chester succeeded in proving negligence in the first
        operation, she would not have to prove the issue as to
        warning of risks inherent in that operation.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text"><b>The judge's findings: the
      operation</b></p>

      <ol start="11">
        <li>
          <!--11-->The judge found that Miss Chester had 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"52. ... suffered a cauda equina
            syndrome as a result of contusion or damage to her
            already compressed cauda equina occurring while the
            defendant was retracting or at least manipulating the
            relevant nerve root and theca during the L2/L3 disc
            removal".</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">That was a known risk of the surgery
          advised and performed by Mr Afshar, put by him at about
          0.9% (para 53). Mr Firth (the claimant's expert)
          described the risk as "the terror of neurosurgery" (para
          54). Mr Findlay (the defendant's expert) reported that
          "Nerve root injury or injury to the cauda equina is a
          recognised risk in lumbar surgery, and said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"54. ... Most of us would put a figure
            of one to two percent on the risk of nerve damage
            (including both single and multiple nerves) and other
            serious risks."</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--12-->It was common ground that the risk of cauda
          equina damage from microdiscectomy was no less and no
          greater than from other forms of lumbar surgery, such as
          laminectomy, and that cauda equina damage can occur
          during lumbar surgery without any negligence on the part
          of the surgeon (paras 55 and 56). Mr Firth spoke of the 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"irreducible minimum of risk inherent
            in all lumbar surgery - that one can lose movement of
            the legs, bowels and bladder in what can be quite a
            `simple' operation."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">Mr Findlay confirmed that damage to the
          cauda equina "... does not in itself indicate a
          sub-standard performance of the surgery".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--13-->The judge concluded that the defendant had not
          been negligent in the first operation: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"76. I am not satisfied that any of Mr
            Firth's criticisms of the way in which the Defendant
            performed the first operation have been made out. I
            accept that Mr Firth is very eminent in the field of
            neurosurgery, and that his research interests include
            microsurgery. But he was in the difficult position of
            trying to criticise the conduct of a delicate operation
            at which he had not been present. The Defendant, who
            had sole conduct of the operation throughout, gave a
            very clear account of what he had done, supported by a
            detailed contemporaneous note. I find it improbable
            that a man of his undoubted skill and experience,
            performing an operation he had done many times before,
            would not have removed as much bone as he needed to
            give himself the access that he required. I also find
            it improbable that he would have concluded the first
            operation without achieving full decompression, when
            this had been his objective. I also accept that he
            confirmed this when he carried out the second
            operation. I do not think that the post-operative scans
            are a reliable guide to whether or not decompression
            had been achieved, for the reasons given by Mr Findlay
            (which I accept).</p>

            <p class="text">77. As I have already said, it is
            common ground that, in an operation of this kind, nerve
            damage can occur without any negligence on the part of
            the operating surgeon. I think that this was the
            position in the present case. In my judgment, the
            Claimant has failed to establish that the Defendant was
            in any [way] negligent in his conduct of her
            surgery."</p>

          controversial. The judge summarised it in this way:

            <p class="text">"44. ... Effectively this claim has
            been pursued on the basis that the appropriate test to
            apply to the Defendant's conduct was the well-known
            test enunciated by McNair J in <i>Bolam v Friern
            Hospital Management Committee</i> [1957] 1 WLR 582 and

            <p class="text">45. In <i>Sidaway</i> Lord Bridge of
            Harwich said (at p 898B-C) that, when questioned by a
            patient of apparently sound mind about risks involved
            in a particular treatment proposed, the doctor's duty
            must be to answer both as truthfully and as fully as
            the questioner requires. That case concerned a
            laminectomy operation, and Lord Templeman said that, if
            the plaintiff concerned had asked questions about this
            operation, "she could and should have been informed
            that there was an aggregate risk of between one per
            cent. and two per cent. risk of some damage either to
            the spinal cord or to a nerve root resulting in some
            injury which might vary from irritation to
            paralysis."</p>

        <li><!--15-->It was common ground at the trial (para 57)

        should have warned the claimant of the risk of damage
        involved in the surgery and its possible consequences, such
        as paralysis. In the light of the questions she asked, and
        the observations of Lord Bridge and Lord Templeman in

            was one of many;</p>

            <p class="text">(3) Her description of the Defendant's
            response to the possibility of her being crippled seems
            to me to have the ring of truth and most unlikely to be
            the result of either invention or reconstruction;</p>

            <p class="text">(4) At a very early stage, albeit after
            the outcome of the surgery was known to her, she was
            telling Mr Polkey that she had not been advised about
            the risk of being crippled;</p>

            <p class="text">(5) There can be no doubt that prior to
            the consultation, the Claimant was very averse to the
            idea of any surgery, and was anxious to avoid it if at
            all possible: this is confirmed by Dr&nbsp;Wright's
            letter of referral to the Defendant;</p>

            <p class="text">(6) It is not in dispute that neither
            the Defendant nor the Claimant regarded the operation
            as a matter of urgency, and that it was fixed for the
            following Monday as a matter of convenience;</p>

            <p class="text">(7) In all these circumstances I find
            it extremely improbable that, if the Claimant had been
            adequately informed that the proposed surgery carried a
            recognised, albeit small, risk of nerve damage possibly
            resulting in paralysis, she would have agreed without
            demur to the operation going ahead in three day's time
            (with a weekend intervening). It seems to me that,
            given her pre-existing aversion to surgery and her
            expressed concern about being crippled, the very least
            that she would have done would have been (as she says)
            to seek a second, or even third, opinion - which would
            inevitably have meant that the proposed operation would
            not have gone ahead on 21 November 1994;</p>

            <p class="text">(8) In reaching these conclusions, I am
            alert to the dangers identified by Hutchison J (as he
            then was) in <i>Smith v Barking Health Authority</i>
            [1994] 5 Med LR 285, at p 289, of giving weight to
            assertions by a plaintiff, after the adverse outcome of
            an operation is known, as to what she would have
            decided before the operation had she been given proper
            advice as to the risks inherent in it. However, if I
            apply the suggested test of what a reasonable claimant
            in Miss Chester's position would have done - assuming,
            as I think I should, a reasonable person with Miss
            Chester's documented aversion to surgery - my
            conclusion is still the same."</p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <!--17-->We find those reasons compelling. Points (1) and
          (2) show that Miss Chester was potentially a good and
          reliable witness. The judge was entitled to find that
          points (3) to (5) had the ring of truth and that her
          questions as to "horror stories" were laughed off, and
          not confronted. Point (6) emphasises that there was no
          hurry for this elective operation, and that the claimant
          was unlikely to agree to a timetable which for practical
          purposes would have excluded the opportunity to take a
          second or third opinion - further supporting the
          downplaying of the risk (see point (7)). Lastly (point
          (8)), whether one takes a subjective or objective view of
          her aversion to surgery, the judge was fully entitled to
          find that her account rang true, and was consistent with
          reconciling Miss Chester's change from aversion to
          acquiescence in 72 hours. He concluded: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"66. Having accepted the Claimant's
            account of what was said at the consultation, I am
            satisfied that she was never given adequate or proper
            advice by the Defendant as to the risks involved in the
            proposed surgery, in particular as to the risk of nerve
            damage possibly resulting in paralysis. Despite her
            requests for information about such risk, she was given
            to understand in effect that there were none.
            Accordingly I find that in this respect the Defendant's
            failure to advise the Claimant adequately was negligent
            under the principle in <i>Bolam</i>."</p>

          <!--18-->Mr Spencer has asked for permission to appeal
          against the judge's factual findings on this issue but we
          do not think it appropriate to give permission. The judge
          saw and heard the witnesses. There is no reason to think
          that he did not make the most of that opportunity. He
          gave detailed and compelling reasons for preferring the
          claimant's account of the conversation. There are no
          grounds which would justify our interfering with his
          findings of fact. He also gave an explanation of why the
          defendant did not warn. He concluded that Mr Afshar would
          

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"65. ... naturally be anxious to avoid
            alarming or confusing the patient unnecessarily. In the
            present case, as the defendant indicated during his
            evidence, he clearly thought that the risk of damage to
            the claimant was extremely small. Furthermore he knew
            that he personally had never caused any nerve damage in
            the many hundreds of operations he had carried out over
            20 to 25 years. It may be that he considered the
            claimant over-anxious or over-preoccupied with `horror
            stories' and the possibility of being crippled. I do
            not find it improbable that, in an attempt to reassure,
            he deflected her inquiries by answering them in the
            light-hearted terms she has described - and which he
            accepts he may have used at some stage. However
            understandable such a response may have been in
            psychological terms, it was not an adequate response in
            legal terms, as Lord Templeman indicated in

      <p class="text"><b>The judge's findings: causation</b></p>

      <ol start="19">
        <li><!--19-->The next step was for the judge to consider
        what would have happened if Miss Chester had been
        adequately warned as to the risk. The judge accepted (para
        67) Miss Chester's evidence that if she had known the
        actual risks of the proposed surgery, she would not have
        consented to the operation taking place on 21 November, and
        that before deciding what to do, she would have sought a
        second or possibly even a third opinion. In all the
        circumstances, that finding brings with it the conclusion
        that, on the balance of probabilities, she would not have
        been operated on on the 21<sup>st</sup> had she been
        properly advised of the risks of the operation. There was
        no urgency about the operation, and the 21<sup>st</sup>
        would not have allowed time to satisfy Miss Chester's
        reasonable requirements of taking a second and perhaps a
        third opinion before making up her mind. The judge found
        that a reasonable person with her aversion to surgery would
        have done something. He took it as an indicator of her
        truthfulness that she never went further to claim that she
        would never at any time or under any circumstances have
        consented to surgery.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--20-->Mr Spencer for the defendant urged the judge
        to find that had she sought a second opinion it would
        probably have been from Professor Crockard, who would have
        advised her that she was at lesser risk of paralysis with
        surgery than without, and that the probable outcome would
        have been that Miss Chester would in due course have
        consented to the same surgery. However, the judge declined
        to make these findings. While he accepted both as
        possibilities, he rejected them as probabilities because
        had Professor Crockard given such advice as a second
        opinion, Miss Chester, having made her own enquiries of
        journalist colleagues, would have sought a third
        opinion.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--21-->The judge concluded that it would be impossible
          to determine whom she would have seen, what she would
          have been advised, and how she would have acted in
          response to that advice. The judge had heard a
          considerable amount of evidence on this topic, which
          revealed a considerable divergence of views as to whether
          the claimant was in November 1994 at serious risk of
          paralysis without surgery (summarised in para 69 (1) and
          (3)). He found (para 69 (4) and (5)) that, if the
          claimant had gone to another consultant, it was more
          probable than not that the consultant would have tried to
          meet her concerns by suggesting some alternative course
          presenting her with a number of different options both
          surgical and conservative. He concluded (para 70): 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"Accordingly - while it is impossible
            to say what the probable outcome would have been if the
            claimant had sought a further opinion or opinions - I
            think it improbable that any surgery she might
            eventually undergo would have been <u>identical</u> in
            circumstances (including the nature of the surgery,
            procedure and surgeon) to the operation she actually
            underwent on November 21, 1994."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">The judge was entitled to his view that
          it was impossible for him to draw an inference as to the
          probable outcome if Miss Chester had sought a further
          opinion or opinions. If, however, this court disagreed
          with that view, and if the material were there, this
          court could draw its own inference.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--22-->The judge went on to conclude that this was
          sufficient to prove a causal link between the failure to
          warn and the damage suffered: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"81. ... On the findings that I have
            made, the risk that materialised during the operation
            on 21 November 1994 was the risk about which she should
            have been, but was not, adequately warned. Had she been
            adequately warned, the operation in question would not
            have taken place and she would not have suffered
            damage. In these circumstances, and without more, it
            seems to me that the necessary causal link is
            sufficiently established. I do not see how the fact
            that the claimant cannot prove that at no future time
            would she have undergone such an operation can break
            the causal link thus established. This is especially so
            when, as I have found, it is improbable that the
            circumstances of any future surgery would have been
            identical to those in which the risk, on any view a
            small one, actually materialised."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">What might happen in future was relevant
          to quantum:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"82. Of course, the possibility that
            the Claimant might in future undergo such an operation,
            or even another type of lumbar operation carrying a
            similar risk, may well be relevant. But it seems to me
            that such a possibility would be relevant to the issue
            of damages rather than liability (as was the view of
            Gaudron and Gummow JJ in <a
            href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/1998/55.html"

            type to &ndash; but more extreme than &ndash; the
            present one in which the court found on the facts that,
            had the claimant been adequately advised, the operation
            in question would have been postponed for six months,
            at the end of which period she would have undergone
            surgery and probably suffered the same damage. . . In
            such a case the claimant's damages would presumably be
            limited to six months pain, suffering and consequential
            loss, but it seems to me that there would be a causal
            link between the failure to advise and such
            damages."</p>

      </ol>

      <p class="text"><b>The issue in this appeal</b></p>

      <ol start="23">
        <li><!--23-->The issue on causation is easy to state. Miss
        Perry for the claimant submits that, to establish a causal
        link between the defendant's failure to advise and warn the
        claimant of the risk and the damage (and its consequences)
        which she sustained, it is sufficient for the claimant to
        prove that, had she been properly advised, she would not
        have consented to undergo that operation on that day. Miss
        Perry relies on the majority decision of the High Court of
        Australia, <a
        href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/1998/55.html"
         target="_blank"><i>Chappel v Hart</i></a> [1998] 72
        Australian Law Journal Reports 1344; [1999] Lloyd's Law
        Reports (Medical) 223.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--24-->Mr Spencer, for the defendant, submits that to
        establish the causal link, the claimant must go further
        than that. She must prove that, had she been properly
        advised, she would never have undergone the surgery in
        question, either on 21st November <u>or on any subsequent
        date</u>. Effectively she must show that, had the operation
        been postponed and had she taken a second opinion, she
        would then have refused to have surgery of the type
        proposed at any stage. Mr Spencer submitted that the
        minority view in <i>Chappel v Hart</i> was to be preferred.
        He drew attention to a line of first instance decisions in
        this country pre-dating <a
        href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/1998/55.html"
         target="_blank"><i>Chappel v Hart</i></a>, which are
        consistent with the approach for which he contends.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--25-->First in time was <i>Smith v Barking, Havering
        and Brentwood Health Authority</i> [1994] 5 Med LR 285, a
        decision of Hutchison J in 1988. The claimant was not
        properly warned of the risk of tetraplegia resulting from
        the difficult operation recommended by her surgeon; but
        without it she would have become tetraplagic within about
        nine months in any event. He accepted that the question of
        what the claimant would have done had she been properly
        warned was to be approached subjectively rather than
        objectively &ndash; ie what would this particular claimant
        have done rather than what would a reasonable claimant have
        done. He rejected a submission that the onus was on the
        defendant to prove that the claimant would not have refused
        the operation if properly advised. In reliance on the House
        of Lords' decisions in <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Health
        Authority</i> [1987] AC 750 and <i>Wilsher v Essex Area
        Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074 he held that the burden
        of proving causation lay with the claimant. He accepted the
        submission that `the plaintiff could only succeed if she
        established on the balance of probabilities that, had she
        received proper warning and advice, she would have elected
        against the operation.' But he found on the balance of
        probabilities that she would have consented to it, even if
        properly advised. This case is obviously correct as to
        where the burden of proof lies. It is also correct as to
        the legal consequence of the factual finding reached: if a
        claimant would have had the operation even if properly
        advised, then the lack of a warning cannot have caused the
        injury. The judge did not have to address the more subtle
        question at issue here.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--26-->Next in time was <i>McAllister v Lewisham and
          North Southwark Health Authority</i> [1994] 5 Med LR 343,
          a decision of Rougier J in December 1993. The claimant
          underwent lengthy brain surgery to correct a neurological
          deficit in her left leg. She was warned of the risk that
          it would make her leg worse rather than better but not of
          the general risks affecting brain surgery or of the risk
          of hemiplegia which in fact occurred. The judge held that
          this was negligent. The claimant herself was reluctant to
          say what she would have done had she been properly
          warned. The judge was confident that she would not have
          had the operation when she did and would have seized the
          opportunity of postponing it at least until after she was
          secure in her job and could take the risk of a long
          period of time off. He went on to conclude that on the
          balance of probabilities she would have continued to
          decline the operation. Hence she had succeeded in proving
          the necessary causal connection. Thus Rougier J adopted
          the same approach as that signalled by Hutchison J in
          <i>Smith v Barking, Havering and Brentwood</i> but
          reached the opposite conclusion on the facts. His Honour
          Judge Taylor commented in this case: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"I acknowledge that Rougier J in
            <i>McAllister</i> decided liability on the basis that
            it was necessary for the plaintiff to establish that
            she would have continued to decline the operation in
            question; but it does not appear that he was ever
            invited to adopt any different approach to the question
            of causation, or that the interesting point which I
            have to decide was ever canvassed before him.
            Furthermore the decision in <a
            href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/1998/55.html"
             target="_blank"><i>Chappel v Hart</i></a> was several
            years later than <i>McAllister</i>."</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li><!--27-->The same comment could be made of <i>Smith v
        Tunbridge Wells Health Authority</i> [1994] 5 Med LR 334,
        in which Morland J reached a similar result. He found that
        the claimant had not been properly warned of the risk of
        impotence and bladder malfunction from rectal surgery. The
        major part of his judgment is devoted to whether a warning
        should have been given and if so whether it was done
        sufficiently clearly. He was entirely satisfied that if a
        proper warning had been given, the claimant would have
        refused the operation.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--28-->Last in the line was <i>Smith v Salford Health
        Authority</i> [1994] 5 Med LR 321. Potter J found that the
        defendant was at fault in his pre-operative investigations
        and assessment of the situation, in failing to give proper
        advice, and in his conduct of the operation. He found the
        defendant liable on the basis of the use of an
        inappropriate instrument. He would not have found the
        defendant liable on the basis of the failure to warn,
        because he was not satisfied that the claimant would have
        declined the operation if he had been properly
        advised.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--29-->We thus have two cases finding against the
        claimant on the basis that he or she would have had the
        operation in any event and two cases finding for the
        claimant on the basis that he or she would have refused the
        operation. Not surprisingly, both parties to the present
        case draw some support from these decisions. Mr Spencer
        relies upon the way in which Hutchison J, Rougier J and
        Potter J asked themselves the question: had the claimant
        satisfied them that he or she would have refused the
        operation? Miss Perry points out that there is no case
        denying liability on the basis of the factual findings in
        this case: ie that she would have refused this particular
        operation but it was impossible to predict whether she
        would have consented to some form of surgery in the
        future.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--30-->We come, therefore, to the majority decision
        of the High Court of Australia in <a
        href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/1998/55.html"
         target="_blank"><i>Chappel v Hart</i></a>, which the judge
        found `extremely persuasive'. The facts were, in his
        careful words, `reasonably similar' to this case. The
        claimant, a school teacher, had a strong clear voice, which
        was important to her, both professionally and generally.
        She had a `relentlessly progressive' throat condition which
        would require surgery at some time, sooner or later. That
        surgery carried with it a very slight risk of injury which
        would leave her with a weak voice. Whether the operation
        was done well or badly, it would carry with it an inherent
        risk of perforation of the oesophagus, which could lead to
        infection and damage to her voice. She brought her
        anxieties as to her voice to Dr Chappel's attention, but he
        did not warn her of the risk inherent in the operation. In
        the event, he operated on the claimant with due skill and
        care, but perforation occurred notwithstanding, infection
        set in, and her voice was permanently damaged. She sued Dr
        Chappel both in contract and in tort for his failure to
        warn her. The Supreme Court of New South Wales awarded her
        damages. The trial judge found that had Mrs Hart received
        an appropriate warning, she would not have had surgery when
        she did, but would have had it done later by `the most
        experienced surgeon with a record and a reputation in the
        field'. The Court of Appeal of New South Wales dismissed
        the doctor's appeal. He then appealed to the High Court of
        Australia. The appellant contended that there was no causal
        connection between the failure to warn and her injury,
        because surgery was inevitable and carried the risk which
        eventuated, she had not lost any real or valuable chance of
        the risk being diminished or avoided, and the injury
        resulted from a random risk that she was willing to accept.
        Hence she was entitled to only nominal damages. The
        doctor's appeal was dismissed.<br />

        <li>
          <!--31-->The majority (Gaudron J, Gummow J and Kirby J)
          rejected the appellant's arguments and held that his
          negligence had caused the injury. All three of them
          declined to treat the case as one involving the loss of a
          chance. Her loss was the physical injury suffered.
          Gaudron J said this (we quote from the report at [1998]
          72 Australian Law Journal Reports 1344 because the
          paragraphs are numbered): 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"9. Where there is a duty to inform it
            is, of course, necessary for a plaintiff to give
            evidence as to what would or would not have happened if
            the information in question had been provided. If that
            evidence is to the effect that the injured person would
            have acted to avoid or minimise the risk of injury, it
            is to apply sophistry rather than common sense to say
            that, although the risk of physical injury which came
            about called the duty of care into existence, breach of
            that duty did not cause or contribute to that injury,
            but simply resulted in the loss of an opportunity to
            pursue a different course of action."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">Further,</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"12. . . . The argument proceeds on the
            erroneous footing that the damage sustained by Mrs Hart
            was simply exposure to risk, not the harm which
            eventuated. And to say that Mrs Hart would inevitably
            have been exposed to risk of the harm which she
            suffered is not to say that she would inevitably have
            suffered that harm."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">As Gaudron J also pointed out (para 17),
          the risk may have been the same, but the likelihood of
          that risk eventuating in future was not the same. There
          was evidence that the risk diminished with the skill and
          experience of the surgeon concerned. It was in any event
          extremely rare (para 20).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--32-->Gummow J referred to previous High Court
          authority in <i>March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd</i>
          (1991) 171 CLR 506, per Mason CJ at 514, that 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"62. . . . generally speaking, a
            sufficient causal connection is established if it
            appears that the plaintiff would not have sustained the
            injuries complained of had the defendant not been
            negligent. However, the `but for' test is not a
            comprehensive and exclusive criterion, and the results
            which are yielded by its application properly may be
            tempered by the making of value judgments and the
            infusion of policy considerations. ...</p>

            <p class="text">66. In the present appeal, not only was
            the damage which Mrs Hart suffered reasonably
            foreseeable, but the fact that the relevant conjunction
            of circumstances could occur should have been the
            subject of any adequate warning and the reason for
            giving it. It is true that in some cases of a failure
            to warn by a medical practitioner an application of the
            `but for' test without qualification could lead to
            absurd or unjust results. Such would have been the
            situation if, for example, instead of suffering damage
            to her laryngeal nerve, Mrs Hart had been injured
            through misapplication of anaesthetic. Whilst it would
            still be open to conclude that, but for Dr Chappel's
            failure to warn her of the possibility of damage to her
            voice, she would not have opted for the operation at
            that time and would not have been injured by the
            anaesthetic, the law would not conclude that the
            failure to warn of the risk of injury to the laryngeal
            nerve caused the injury resulting from the
            anaesthetic.</p>

            <p class="text">67. The present appeal is significantly
            different from the situation described. In Mrs Hart's
            case, the very risk of which she should have been
            warned materialised. In his written submissions filed
            by leave after the hearing of the appeal, Dr Chappel
            conceded that, if the surgery had been performed at a
            different time, then `[i]n all likelihood' Mrs Hart
            `would not have suffered the random chance of injury'.
            In addition, the particular risk involved had been the
            subject of specific inquiry by Mrs Hart of the medical
            practitioner who was then engaged by her to perform the
            surgery. She was a person for whom the potential
            consequences of damage to her voice were more
            significant than the `statistical' risk. Those
            additional factors, combined with the satisfaction of
            the `but for' test were sufficient to establish
            causation in this case."</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--33-->
          Kirby J described his thought process thus: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"94. . . . The strongest arguments for
            Dr Chappel, as it seems to me, are those which lay
            emphasis upon a logical examination of the consequences
            which would have flowed had he not breached his duty to
            warn his patient. Dissecting the facts in that way
            affords a powerful argument which would banish from
            consideration the events which in fact occurred in the
            operation which he carried out. All that would have
            happened, had he given the requisite warning, would
            have been a change in the timing of the operation and
            of the identity of the surgeon. For Dr Chappel, these
            were irrelevant changes as the evidence showed that,
            whenever the operation was performed and whoever did
            it, the tripartite chances which had to combine to
            produce the misfortune which Mrs Hart suffered were
            extremely rare. There was thus an equivalence of
            unlikelihood. They were risks inherent in the
            procedure, not wholly avoidable even by the most
            skilful and experienced of surgeons. In the view which
            Dr Chappel urged of the case, Mrs Hart was left with
            nothing more than the time sequence. To burden a
            surgeon, in whose actual performance no fault would be
            found, with civil liability for randomised chance
            events that followed the surgery would not be
            reasonable. It would penalise him for chance alone. It
            would do nothing to establish a superior standard in
            the performance of the work of surgeons generally.</p>

            <p class="text">95. For a time I was attracted to Dr
            Chappel's arguments. Ultimately, I have concluded
            against them. The `commonsense' which guides courts in
            this area of discourse supports Mrs Hart's recovery. So
            does the setting of standards which uphold the
            importance of the legal duty that was breached here.
            This is the duty which all health care professionals in
            the position of Dr Chappel must observe: the duty of
            informing patients about risks, answering their
            questions candidly and respecting their rights,
            including (where they so choose) to postpone medical
            procedures and to go elsewhere for treatment.</p>

            <p class="text">96. In <i>Environment Agency (formerly
            National Rivers Authority) v Empress Car Co
            (Abertillery) Ltd</i> [1998] 2 WLR 350, at pp 356-358,
            Lord Hoffmann emphasised that common-sense answers to
            questions of causation will differ according to the
            purpose for which the question is asked. The answer
            depends upon the purpose and scope of the rule by which
            responsibility is being attributed. In <i>Rogers v
            Whitaker</i> (1992) <a
            href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr479.html">
            175 CLR 479</a>, at p 490, this Court decided that `a
            doctor has a duty to warn a patient of a material risk
            inherent in the proposed treatment' and that:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">`a risk is material if, in the
              circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable
              person in the patient's position, if warned of the
              risk, would be likely to attach significance to it or
              if the medical practitioner is or should be
              reasonably aware that the particular patient, if
              warned of the risk, would be likely to attach
              significance to it.'</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="text">These standards have fairly been
            described as onerous. They are. But they are the law.
            They are established for good reason. When not complied
            with (as was held to be so in this case) it should
            occasion no surprise that legal consequences follow.
            This was an unusual case where the patient was found to
            have made very clear her concerns. The practicalities
            are that, had those concerns been met as the law
            required, the overwhelming likelihood is that the
            patient would not, in fact, have been injured. So much
            was eventually conceded. In such circumstances,
            commonsense reinforces the attribution of legal
            liability. It is true to say that the inherent risks of
            injury from rare and random causes arises in every
            surgical procedure. A patient, duly warned about such
            risks, must accept them and their consequences. Mrs
            Hart was ready to accept any general risks of the
            operation about which she was warned. However, she
            declined to bear the risks about which she questioned
            the surgeon and received no adequate response. When
            those risks so quickly eventuated, commonsense suggests
            that something more than mere coincidence or irrelevant
            cause has intervened. This impression is reinforced
            once it is accepted that Mrs Hart, if warned, would not
            have undergone the operation when she did."</p>

        <li><!--34-->English law does not impose quite such a
        rigorous standard upon doctors as that in <i>Rogers v
        Whittaker</i>, but the policy point made by Kirby J would

        <br />
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--35-->The minority view can be taken from the judgment
          of McHugh J: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"25. The rejection [in <i>March v
            Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd</i> (1991) 171 CLR 506]
            of the `but for' test as the sole determinant of
            causation means that the plaintiff in this case cannot
            succeed merely because she would not have suffered
            injury but for the defendant's failure to warn her of
            the risk of injury. However, his failure to warn her of
            the risk was one of the events that in combination with
            others led to the perforation of her oesophagus and
            damage to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. Without
            that failure, the injury would not have occurred when
            it did and, statistically, the chance of it occurring
            during an operation on another occasion was very small.
            Moreover, that failure was the very breach of duty
            which the plaintiff alleges caused her injury. The
            defendant's failure to warn, therefore, must be
            regarded as the cause of the plaintiff's injury unless
            common sense or legal policy requires the conclusion
            that, for the purposes of this action, the failure is
            not to be regarded as a cause of the plaintiff's
            injury."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">However,</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"27. Before the defendant will be held
            responsible for the plaintiff's injury, the plaintiff
            must prove that the defendant's conduct materially
            contributed to the plaintiff suffering that injury. In
            the absence of a statute or undertaking to the
            contrary, therefore, it would seem logical to hold a
            person causally liable for a wrongful act or omission
            only when it increases the risk of injury to another
            person. If a wrongful act or omission results in an
            increased risk of injury to the plaintiff and that risk
            eventuates, the defendant's conduct has materially
            contributed to the injury that the plaintiff suffers
            whether or not other factors also contributed to that
            injury occurring. If, however, the defendant's conduct
            does not increase the risk of injury to the plaintiff,
            the defendant cannot be said to have materially
            contributed to the injury suffered by the
            plaintiff."</p>

         target="_blank"><i>Chappel v Hart</i></a> shows that the
        issue is not an easy one and may be approached in a number
        of different ways. It is axiomatic that it is not enough to
        show that the acts or omissions of the defendant caused the
        damage. Obviously, in this case they did that. It is not
        only that Mr Afshar's actions at the operating table
        produced the physical effects sustained. His acts and
        omissions during the consultation on 18 November were
        clearly one cause, along with the claimant's own decision,
        of the claimant having the operation on 21 November. But
        the claimant must prove that the defendant's breach of his
        duty towards her caused the damage. Miss Chester must show
        that Mr Afshar's failure to warn her of the risk of the
        damage she sustained caused her to suffer that
        damage.<br />

        <li><!--38-->In accordance with logic and authority (eg
        <i>Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp;</i> Simmons
        [1995] 1 WLR 1602) the answer to that question must
        considerably depend upon the answer to the further question
        of what would have happened if she had been properly
        warned. There is a spectrum of possible answers to that
        second question. At each end of the spectrum the solution
        would be plain. If the claimant would have had the same
        operation at the same time in any event (as in the first
        and third <i>Smith</i> cases), then the defendant's failure
        to warn her properly would have made no difference. He
        would not have caused her to do anything which she would
        not otherwise have done. It would be as if she had chosen
        to have the operation knowing the risks she was running. On
        the other hand, if the claimant would never have had the
        operation had she been properly warned (as in the
        <i>McAllister</i> and the second <i>Smith</i> cases),
        clearly the defendant's breach of duty would have caused
        her to have it and Mr Spencer accepts that it would also
        have caused her to sustain the damage. The only issue would
        then have become one of quantum: how does her damaged state
        after the operation compare with the state she would have
        been in without it?<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--39-->The present case lies in between the two
        extremes. The claimant can show that she would not have had
        the operation she did, or would not have had it when she
        did, or would not have had it in the circumstances in which
        she did, but she cannot show that she would never have had
        some surgical procedure of this kind which would have
        carried the same or similar risks. Can it then be said that
        causing her to have the operation caused her to suffer the
        damage?<br />

        <li><!--40-->The minority view in <a

         target="_blank"><i>Chappel v Hart</i></a> was that the
        defendant had not increased the risk to which the claimant
        was exposed. That may have been debatable, in that there
        was some evidence from which it might be inferred that the
        risk would have been less at the hands of a more
        experienced surgeon. But the risk was in any event so small
        that the difference must have been minuscule. However, if
        it were only appropriate to focus attention on the risks of
        having the operation whenever it took place, the claimant
        would never succeed, even when she could show that she
        would never have had the operation. The risks were always
        the same and the defendant did not increase them. But Mr
        Spencer accepts that <i>McAllister</i> was rightly decided.
        In our view he is correct to do so. The defendant does
        change the risk in a material way: he causes the patient to
        have an operation which she would not otherwise have had
        then and there and possibly not at all. Logically, the
        correct comparison of risk is between having that operation
        on that occasion and not having it.<br />

        elsewhere, will inevitably or on the balance of
        probabilities have produced exactly the same result for her
        . . . then . . . the claimant must succeed.' If it is more
        likely than not that the same damage would have been
        sustained in any event, then all the defendant has done is
        bring forward the date when she suffers it. If it is more
        likely than not that the same damage would not have been
        suffered, then by causing her to have the operation that
        day he has caused her to sustain it. There is no problem of
        remoteness because the risk was clearly foreseeable: it was
        the fact that it was a foreseeable risk, albeit a small
        one, that gave rise to the duty to warn which was broken.
        Indeed, in each of these cases, it can be said that he has
        caused some damage, the question of acceleration being one
        of quantum rather than causation.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--42-->If that is the correct approach, then causation
          is established in this case. The judge made a clear
          finding that the claimant would not have had the
          operation when she did. The defendant therefore caused
          her to have the operation. The judge did not expressly
          find that the likelihood was that she would not have
          suffered the same injury on a different occasion. But the
          evidence both as to the general and the particular risks
          of this procedure was such that such a finding was
          strongly arguable if not inevitable when damages come to
          be assessed. At the trial it was not suggested that the
          well-known risk of cauda equina damage resulting from the
          type of surgery advised and performed by the defendant
          was greater than 1 to 2%. Nor do we think that there was
          any evidence to show that the claimant's constitution
          made her abnormally vulnerable to this type of surgery.
          But this will be a matter for the court assessing
          damages. On the assessment it will be open to the
          defendant to argue (and prove so far as he may be able to
          do so) that 

          <p class="text">(i) it is more likely than not that the
          claimant would have undergone an operation with the same
          or similar risks in the future; and</p>

          <p class="text">(ii) it is more likely than not that the
          same risk would have eventuated.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--43-->Several further considerations help us to
          conclude that the correct approach goes at least this
          far. We accept that the `but for' test is necessary but
          not always sufficient to establish causation in law. Even
          if the claimant would not have been on the operating
          table that day if the defendant had given her a proper
          warning, the defendant is not liable for coincidences
          which have nothing to do with him, such as the
          anaesthetic failure referred to by Gummow J or lightning
          striking the operating theatre. The classic example of
          this point was given by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Banque
          Bruxelles SA v Eagle Star</i> [1997] AC 191, at 213D-E: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"A mountaineer about to undertake a
            difficult climb is concerned about the fitness of his
            knee. He goes to a doctor who negligently makes a
            superficial examination and pronounces the knee fit.
            The climber goes on the expedition, which he would not
            have undertaken if the doctor had told him the true
            state of his knee. He suffers an injury which is an
            entirely foreseeable consequence of mountaineering but
            has nothing to do with his knee."</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li><!--44-->In cases such as the present, however, it
        simply cannot be said that the injury suffered had nothing
        to do with the problem which had taken the claimant to the
        doctor. It was a consequence of that very problem and the
        doctor's attempt to put it right. Furthermore it was a
        consequence about which the claimant had expressed her
        concern to the doctor and been wrongly reassured. The
        closer analogy is with the mountaineer who consults his
        doctor because he is afraid that his knee will give way
        under the strain of mountain climbing, is wrongly reassured
        that it will not, and who is injured because his knee does
        give way. The doctor was not to blame for the knee giving
        way, any more than the doctor (if the first operation was
        not negligently performed) was to blame for the cauda
        equina syndrome in this case, but he was to blame for the
        mountaineer being on the mountain at all.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li><!--45-->What if the mountaineer would not have taken
        the risk immediately but cannot rule out the possibility
        that his love of mountaineering was such that he would have
        been prepared to run it at some later date? Logic would
        again suggest that this should only make a difference if it
        was more likely than not that he would do so: the mere
        possibility that his feelings would eventually get the
        better of him does not break the chain. Furthermore, by
        causing him to go up the mountain when he would not have
        done so the doctor had caused him to suffer the injury
        earlier than he would otherwise have done. He has therefore
        lived for longer with the consequences of a broken leg (or
        whatever) than he would otherwise have done. The question
        then becomes one of quantification rather than causation,
        as the judge held in this case.<br />

          Lord Hoffmann in <i>Environment Agency (formerly National
          Rivers Authority) v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd</i>
          [1999] 2 AC 22, at pp 29 &ndash; 31: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"The first point to emphasise is that
            common sense answers to questions of causation will
            differ according to the purpose for which the question
            is asked. Questions of causation often arise for the
            purpose of attributing responsibility to someone, for
            example, so as to blame him for something which has
            happened . . . . one cannot give a common sense answer
            to a question of causation for the purpose of
            attributing responsibility under some rule without
            knowing the purpose and scope of the rule."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">A somewhat similar point was made by Laws
          LJ in <a
          href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/190.html"
           target="_blank"><i>Rahman v Arearose</i></a> [2001] QB
          351, at p 367, albeit in the different context of sharing
          responsibility between two different tortfeasors:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"33. So in all these cases the real
            question is, what is the damage for which the defendant
            under consideration should be held <i>responsible</i>.
            The nature of his duty (here the common law duty of
            care) is relevant; causation, certainly will be
            relevant &ndash; but it will fall to be viewed, and in
            truth can only be understood, in the light of the
            answer to the question: from what kind of harm was it
            the defendant's duty to guard the claimant?"</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">In principle there seems to be little
          difficulty in attributing causative responsibility to a
          doctor who has in breach of duty failed to draw a
          particular risk to his patient's attention if in the
          event that particular risk materialises.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--47-->The purpose of the rule requiring doctors to
          give appropriate information to their patients is to
          enable the patient to exercise her right to choose
          whether or not to have the particular operation to which
          she is asked to give her consent. English law has
          rejected the proposition that a failure to give adequate
          warning vitiates the patient's consent, thus turning the
          operation into an assault: see <i>Chatterton v Gerson</i>
          [1981] QB 432. Liability lies in negligence rather than
          trespass. But the patient does still have the right to
          choose what will and will not be done with her body and
          the doctor must take the care expected of a reasonable
          doctor in the circumstances in giving her the information
          relevant to that choice. The law is designed to require
          doctors properly to inform their patients of the risks
          attendant on their treatment and to answer questions put
          to them as to that treatment and its dangers, such
          answers to be judged in the context of good professional
          practice, which has tended to a greater degree of
          frankness over the years, with more respect being given
          to patient autonomy. The object is to enable the patient
          to decide whether or not to run the risks of having that
          operation at that time. If the doctor's failure to take
          that care results in her consenting to an operation to
          which she would not otherwise have given her consent, the
          purpose of that rule would be thwarted if he were not to
          be held responsible when the very risk about which he
          failed to warn her materialises and causes her an injury
          which she would not have suffered then and there. As
          Adrian Whitfield QC pointed out in his comment on
          <i>Chappel v Hart</i> [1999] Lloyd's Law Reports
          (Medical) 253, at p 255: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"The view of the minority of the High
            Court, that the `but for' test works injustice and that
            the effective cause should be taken not as the
            defendant's failure to warn, but rather the random
            occurrence of an inherent risk, runs counter to the
            whole basis of informed consent cases, which are
            designed to protect patients against negligent failure
            to advise against just such risks."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">It would in our judgment be unjust to
          hold that the effective cause of the claimant's injury
          was the random occurrence of the 1 to 2% risk referred to
          above rather than the defendant's failure to bring such
          risk to her attention.</p>
        </li>
               
        <li><!--48-->In the end, therefore, all these
        considerations lead us to the same conclusion: that the
        conclusion of the majority in <i>Chappel v Hart</i> was
        right and that the judge reached the right conclusion in
        this case. We therefore reject the grounds of appeal which
        argue that the judge adopted the wrong test, failed to
        adopt the correct test, and therefore failed to make the
        necessary findings of fact to support his conclusions. We
        have already indicated that we see no reason to disturb the
        judge's factual findings on the issue of whether or not an
        adequate warning was given and would refuse permission to
        appeal on that ground.<br />
        <br />
        </li>

        <li>
          <!--49-->That leaves the first ground of appeal, for
          which the defendant would also require permission. This
          is a pleading point. From issue of the Statement of
          Claim on 9 April 1998 until trial of the action in
          December 2000, the claimant's pleading was in the form
          complained of, paragraph 11 of which read: 

          <blockquote>
            <p class="text">"In breach of his said duty and/or
            negligently, the Defendant wholly failed to advise,
            explain or otherwise counsel the Plaintiff as to the
            real risks attached to the said surgical procedure
            thereby depriving the Plaintiff of an opportunity to
            reflect, consider and/or seek alternative medical or
            other opinion in respect of options which may be open
            to her which, it is averred, the Plaintiff would have
            done and so sought had the Defendant acted in
            accordance with reasonably medical practice in the
            course of his said consultation and thereafter at the
            London Bridge Hospital."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">At the beginning of the trial Mr Spencer
          sought to strike out the issue on the ground that it was
          inadequately pleaded in terms of causation. He was
          unsuccessful. The defendant had had more than two years
          to obtain whatever particulars he wanted. So far as we
          are aware he did nothing effective to do so. The judge
          held that it was too late to do so on the eve of trial.
          We cannot say that the exercise of his discretion was
          plainly wrong. In any event, the pleading was adequate to
          allege that the claimant would not have consented to the
          operation which was in fact performed upon her and would
          at the very least have postponed the decision. That, on
          the law as we have held it to be, was sufficient.</p>
