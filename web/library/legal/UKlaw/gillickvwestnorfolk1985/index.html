      <br />
       The Department of Health and Social Security issued a
      circular to area health authorities containing, inter alia,
      advice to the effect that a doctor consulted at a family
      planning clinic by a girl under 16 would not be acting
      unlawfully if he prescribed contraceptives for the girl, so
      long as in doing so he was acting in good faith to protect
      her against the harmful effects of sexual intercourse. The
      circular further stated that, although a doctor should
      proceed on the assumption that advice and treatment on
      contraception should not be given to a girl under 16 without
      parental consent and that he should try to persuade the girl
      to involve her parents in the matter, nevertheless the
      principle of confidentiality between doctor and patient
      applied to a girl under 16 seeking contraceptives and
      therefore in exceptional cases the doctor could prescribe
      contraceptives without consulting the girl's parents or
      obtaining their consent if in the doctor's clinical judgment
      it was desirable to prescribe contraceptives. The plaintiff,
      who had five daughters under the age of 16, sought an
      assurance from her local area health authority that her
      daughters would not be given advice and treatment on
      contraception without the plaintiff 's prior knowledge and
      consent while they were under 16. When the authority refused
      to give such an assurance the plaintiff brought an action
      against the authority and the department seeking (i) as
      against both the department and the area health authority a
      declaration that the advice contained in the circular was
      unlawful, because it amounted to advice to doctors to commit
      the offence of causing or encouraging unlawful sexual
      intercourse with a girl under 16, contrary to s 28(1) of the
      Sexual Offences Act 1956, or the offence of being an
      accessory to unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under
      16, contrary to s 6(1) of that Act, and (ii) as against the
      area health authority a declaration that a doctor or other
      professional person employed by it in its family planning
      service could not give advice and treatment on contraception
      to any child of the plaintiff below the age of 16 without the
      plaintiff 's consent, because to do so would be unlawful as
      being inconsistent with the plaintiff 's parental rights. The
      judge held (i) that a doctor prescribing contraceptives to a
      girl under 16 in accordance with the advice contained in the
      department's circular would not thereby be committing an
      offence of causing or encouraging unlawful sexual intercourse
      with the girl, contrary to s 28(1) of the 1956 Act, and (ii)
      that a parent's interest in his or her child did not amount
      to a 'right' but was more accurately described as a
      responsibility or duty, and accordingly giving advice to a
      girl under 16 on contraception without her parent's consent
      was not unlawful interference with parental 'rights'. He
      accordingly dismissed the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff
      appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed her appeal and
      granted the declarations sought, on the grounds that a child
      under 16 could not validly consent to contraceptive treatment
      without her parents' consent and that therefore the circular
      was unlawful. The department appealed to the House of Lords
      against the grant of the first declaration. The area health
      authority did not appeal against the granting of the second
      declaration. 

      <p class="text1"><b>Held --</b> (1) (Lord Templeman
      dissenting) Having regard to the reality that a child became
      increasingly independent as it grew older and that parental
      authority dwindled correspondingly, the law did not recognise
      any rule of absolute parental authority until a fixed age.
      Instead, parental rights were recognised by the law only as
      long as they were needed for the protection of the child and
      such rights yielded to the child's right to make his own
      decisions when he reached a sufficient understanding and
      intelligence to be capable of making up his own mind.
      Accordingly, a girl under 16 did not, merely by reason of her
      age, lack legal capacity to consent to contraceptive advice
      and treatment by a doctor (see p 409 e to g j to p 410 a c d
      j to p 411 b, p 412 b to d, p 414 f, p 420 d g h, p 421 d, p
      422 a, p 423 c d and p 428 d e, post) dictum of Lord Denning
      MR in <i>Hewer v Bryant</i> [1969] 3 All ER at 582 and <i>R v
      D</i> [1984] 2 All ER 449 applied <i>Re P</i> (a minor)
      (1981) 80 LGR 301 approved <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i>,
      <i>Agar-Ellis v Lascelles</i> (1878) 10 Ch D 49, (1883) 24 Ch
      D 317 criticised.</p>

      <p class="text1">(2) (Lord Brandon dissenting) A doctor who
      in the exercise of his clinical judgment gave contraceptive
      advice and treatment to a girl under 16 without her parents'
      consent did not commit an offence under s 6(1) or s 28(1) of
      the 1956 Act, because the bona fide exercise by the doctor of
      his clinical judgment negated the mens rea which was an
      essential ingredient of those offences (see p 413 g to j, p
      414 f, p 425 a c d, p 427 j to p 428 b and p 431 h j,
      post).</p>

      <p class="text1">(3) (Lord Brandon and Lord Templeman
      dissenting) It followed that a doctor had a discretion to
      give contraceptive advice or treatment to a girl under 16
      without her parents' knowledge or consent provided the girl
      had reached an age where she had a sufficient understanding
      and intelligence to enable her to understand fully what was
      proposed, that being a question of fact in each case. It also
      followed that the department's guidance could be followed by
      a doctor without involving him in any infringement of
      parental rights or breach of the criminal law. The
      department's appeal would therefore be allowed, the first
      declaration would be set aside and (per Lord Fraser and Lord
      Scarman) the second declaration should be overruled as being
      erroneous (see p 411 g, p 413 a to d, p 414 c to f, p 416 h
      j, p 423 j, p 424 h, p 425 g h and p 428 d e, post).&nbsp;
      Per Lord Fraser and Lord Scarman. A parent who wishes to
      proceed against a public authority to protect what he or she
      alleges to be his or her parental rights against a threatened
      infringement by the authority is entitled, because of the
      private law content of the claim, to proceed by way of an
      ordinary action rather than by way of judicial review (see p
      405 e, p 416 c to e and p 428 d e, post) <i>O'Reilly v
      Mackman</i> [1982] 3<br />
       All ER 1124 distinguished. Quaere (per Lord Bridge).
      Whether, and if so when, non-statutory guidance issued by a
      government department to subordinate authorities will be open
      to judicial review (see p 426 b to d f to j and p 427 e,
      post).&nbsp; Decision of the Court of Appeal [1985] 1 All ER

       <b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br />
      <br />
       Appeal<br />
      <br />
       The Department of Health and Social Security (the DHSS)
      appealed with leave of the Court of Appeal against the
      decision of that court (Eveleigh, Fox and Parker LJJ) ([1985]
      1 All ER 533, [1985] 2 WLR 413) on 20 December 1984 allowing
      an appeal by the respondent, Victoria Gillick (Mrs Gillick),
      against the order of Woolf J ([1984] 1 All ER 365, [1984] QB
      581) hearing the Crown Office list on 26 July 1983 whereby he
      held that Mrs Gillick was not entitled to declarations (i) as
      against both the West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health
      Authority and the DHSS, a declaration that on its true
      construction a Health Service notice (HN (80) 46) issued by
      the DHSS had no authority in law and gave advice which was
      unlawful, wrong and adversely affected or might adversely
      affect the welfare of Mrs Gillick's children and/or the
      rights of Mrs Gillick as parent and custodian of the
      children, and/or the ability of Mrs Gillick properly and
      effectively to discharge her duties as parent and custodian,
      and (ii) as against the area health authority alone, a
      declaration that no doctor or other professional person
      employed by them in the family planning service or otherwise
      might give any contraceptive advice and/or abortion advice
      and/or treatment to any child of Mrs Gillick below the age of
      16 without Mrs Gillick's prior knowledge and consent. The
      Court of Appeal granted the declarations sought by Mrs
      Gillick. The area health authority did not appeal against the
      court's decision as to the second declaration. The facts are
      set out in the opinion of Lord Fraser.<br />

      <br />
       <a id="fraser" name="fraser"></a> JUDGMENT BY-1: LORD FRASER
      OF TULLYBELTON<br />
      <br />
      </p>

      <p class="text1"><b>JUDGMENT-1:<br />
       LORD FRASER OF TULLYBELTON.</b> My Lords, the main question
      in this appeal is whether a doctor can lawfully prescribe
      contraception for a girl under 16 years of age without the
      consent of her parents. The second appellant, the Department
      of Health and Social Security (the DHSS), maintains that a
      doctor can do so. The respondent, Mrs Gillick, maintains that
      he cannot. The first appellant, West Norfolk and Wisbech Area
      Health Authority, was not represented when the appeal reached
      this House, but in the Court of Appeal it was represented by
      the same counsel as the DHSS.&nbsp; In December 1980 the DHSS
      issued guidance on family planning services for young people,
      which was a revised version of earlier guidance on the same
      subject, and which stated, or implied, that, at least in
      certain cases which were described as 'exceptional', a doctor
      could lawfully prescribe contraception for a girl under 16
      without her parents' consent. Mrs Gillick, who is the mother
      of five daughters under the age of 16, objected to the
      guidance and she instituted the proceedings which have led to
      this appeal, and in which she claims a declaration against
      both appellants that the advice given in the guidance was
      unlawful. She also claims a further declaration against the
      first appellant alone, but it is of less general importance
      than the declaration to which I have already referred, and I
      defer consideration of it until later in this speech.&nbsp;
      It will be convenient to dispose at once of some preliminary
      matters. In the first place, Mrs Gillick's husband is not a
      party to the present proceedings, but we were informed that
      he is in full agreement with Mrs Gillick's contention, and I
      proceed on that basis. Second, there is no suggestion that
      Mrs Gillick's relationship with her daughters is other than
      normal and happy, nor is it suggested that there is any
      present likelihood of any of the daughters seeking
      contraceptive advice or treatment without the consent of
      their mother.&nbsp; Third, I must mention a procedural
      matter. The declaration which is claimed against the DHSS, to
      the effect that the advice given in the guidance was
      unlawful, amounts to an assertion that the Secretary of State
      for Health and Social Security has acted illegally, in the
      sense of ultra vires. The remedy claimed is in the field of
      public law and, since the decision of your Lordships' House
      in <i>O'Reilly v Mackman</i> [1982] 3 All ER 1124, [1983] 2
      AC 237, it is one which should normally be claimed in an
      application for judicial review. But the writ and statement
      of claim in this action were issued on 5 August 1982, three
      months before the decision in O'Reilly, which was on 25
      November 1982. Accordingly, counsel for the DHSS merely
      mentioned the procedural point but he did not submit that the
      procedure was out of order. I have had the benefit of reading
      in draft the speech prepared by my noble and learned friend
      Lord Scarman and I agree with him that, for the reasons
      explained by him, Mrs Gillick was fully entitled to proceed
      in the case by ordinary action.&nbsp; The advice, the
      lawfulness of which is in dispute, is a revised version of
      part of a comprehensive memorandum of guidance on the family
      planning service which had been issued to health authorities
      in May 1974 under cover of a circular (Health Service
      circular (interim series) (HSC(IS) 32)) from the DHSS. The
      memorandum of guidance was divided into a number of sections,
      one of which was section G, which was headed 'The Young'. The
      revised section G, which contains the disputed advice, is as
      follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Clinic sessions should be available for people of all
        ages, but it may be helpful to make separate, less formal
        arrangements for young people. The staff should be
        experienced in dealing with young people and their
        problems. There is widespread concern about counselling and
        treatment for children under 16. Special care is needed not
        to undermine parental responsibility and family stability.
        The Department would therefore hope that in any case where
        a doctor or other professional worker is approached by a
        person under the age of 16 for advice in these matters, the
        doctor, or other professional, will always seek to persuade
        the child to involve the parent or guardian (or other
        person in loco parentis) at the earliest stage of
        consultation, and will proceed from the assumption that it
        would be most unusual to provide advice about contraception
        without parental consent. It is, however, widely accepted
        that consultations between doctors and patients are
        confidential and the Department recognises the importance
        which doctors and patients attach to this principle. It is
        a principle which applies also to the other professions
        concerned. To abandon this principle for children under 16
        might cause some not to seek professional advice at all.
        They could then be exposed to the immediate risks of
        pregnancy and of sexually-transmitted diseases, as well as
        other long-term physical, psychological<br />
         and emotional consequences which are equally a threat to
        stable family life. This would apply particularly to young
        people whose parents are, for example, unconcerned,
        entirely unresponsive, or grossly disturbed. Some of these
        young people are away from their parents and in the care of
        local authorities or voluntary organisations standing in
        loco parentis. The Department realises that in such
        exceptional cases the nature of any counselling must be a
        matter for the doctor or other professional worker
        concerned and that the decision whether or not to prescribe
        contraception must be for the clinical judgment of a
        doctor.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">That advice emphasised, more strongly than
      section G in its original form had done, that the cases in
      which a doctor could properly advise a girl under 16 years of
      age about contraception without parental consent would be
      most unusual. If the advice had been contained in a legal
      document there might well have been room for argument as to
      its exact effect, but, in my view, it is perfectly clear that
      it would convey to any doctor or other person who read it
      that the decision whether or not to prescribe contraception
      for a girl under 16 was in the last resort a matter for the
      clinical judgment of a doctor, even if the girl's parents had
      not been informed that she had consulted the doctor, and even
      if they had expressed disapproval of contraception being
      prescribed for her. Mrs Gillick objected to the guidance, in
      its amended form, and after some correspondence with the area
      health authority, she wrote to the acting area administrator
      on 3 March 1981 a letter which included this paragraph:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'I formally FORBID any medical staff employed by Norfolk
        A.H.A. to give any contraceptive or abortion advice or
        treatment whatsoever to my four daughters, while they are
        under 16 years without my consent.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Mrs Gillick's youngest (fifth) daughter has
      been born since that letter was sent. The acting
      administrator replied on 9 March 1981 acknowledging the
      letter and stating that the area health authority held to the
      view 'that treatment prescribed by a doctor is a matter for
      that doctor's clinical judgment, taking into account all the
      factors of the case'.&nbsp; On 5 August 1982 Mrs Gillick
      began these proceedings against the area health authority and
      the DHSS, in which she seeks the following declarations (as
      amended before the master):</p>

      <blockquote>
        '(i) a declaration against the [area health authority] and
        the [DHSS] on a true construction of the said Notice and in
        the events which have happened, including and in particular
        the publication and the circulation of the said Notice, the
        said Notice has no authority in law and gives advice which
        is unlawful and wrong, and which adversely affects or which
        may adversely affect the welfare of [Mrs Gillick's] said
        children, and/or the rights of [Mrs Gillick] as parent and
        custodian of the said children, and/or the ability of [Mrs
        Gillick] properly and effectively to discharge her duties
        as such parent and custodian (ii) a declaration against the
        [area health authority] that no doctor or other
        professional person employed by the [area health authority]
        either in the Family Planning Service or otherwise may give
        any contraceptive and/or abortion advice and/or treatment
        to any child of [Mrs Gillick] below the age of 16 without
        the prior knowledge and consent of the said child's parent
        or guardian.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Woolf J refused to grant the declarations
      sought by Mrs Gillick and dismissed the action (see [1984] 1
      All ER 365, [1984] QB 581). The Court of Appeal (Eveleigh,
      Fox and Parker LJJ) ([1985] 1 All ER 533, [1985] 2 WLR 413)
      allowed the appeal and granted the declarations. Against
      that&nbsp; decision the DHSS now appeals. The central issue
      in the appeal is whether a doctor can ever, in any
      circumstances, lawfully give contraceptive advice or
      treatment to a girl under the age of 16 without her parents'
      consent. The effect of the Court of Appeal's judgment is to
      answer that question in the negative. The answer is subject
      certainly to one exception, in the case of an order by a
      competent court this exception was recognised by Parker LJ in
      the Court of Appeal (see [1985] 1 All ER 533 at 539, [1985] 2
      WLR 413 at 420), and it is accepted in Mrs Gillick's printed
      case. But it is of theoretical rather than practical
      importance, because it would inevitably involve disclosing to
      the parents the doctor's advice to the girl, and thus would
      destroy its confidentiality, and also because the delay and
      expense of obtaining a court order makes frequent use of such
      procedure impracticable. There must, I think, be a second
      exception for cases in which the parents, or the sole
      surviving parent, have deliberately abandoned their parental
      responsibilities in such cases it would, in my opinion, be
      wrong to allow them to emerge from the shadows solely in
      order to veto contraceptive advice or treatment for their
      daughter. But these exceptions do not touch the principle
      which is at issue in the appeal. &nbsp; The guidance is
      addressed to regional health authorities and other
      authorities concerned in administering the national health
      service (the NHS), and the appeal therefore only directly
      concerns doctors and other persons working in the NHS. I
      shall refer throughout to doctors, to include brevitatis
      causa other professional persons working in the NHS.</p>

      <p class="text1">The first statutory provision for
      contraceptive advice and treatment in the NHS was made by s 1
      of the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act 1967.
      That section empowered local health authorities in England
      and Wales, with the approval of the Minister of Health, to
      make arrangements for giving advice on contraception, for
      medical examination of persons seeking such advice and for
      the supply of contraceptive substances and appliances. There
      appears to have been no similar provision applying to
      Scotland. The 1967 Act was repealed by the National Health
      Service Reorganisation Act 1973, which, by s 4, replaced the
      power of local health authorities to provide such advice and
      treatment with a duty on the Secretary of State to do so. A
      similar duty was placed on the Secretary of State for
      Scotland by s 8 of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act
      1972. The 1973 provision for England and Wales has now been
      superseded by the National Health Service Act 1977, which by
      s 5(1)(b) imposes a duty on the Secretary of State--</p>

      <blockquote>
        'to arrange, to such extent as he considers necessary to
        meet all reasonable requirements in England and Wales, for
        the giving of advice on contraception, the medical
        examination of persons seeking advice on contraception, the
        treatment of such persons and the supply of contraceptive
        substances and appliances.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">These, and other, provisions show that
      Parliament regarded 'advice' and 'treatment' on contraception
      and the supply of appliances for contraception as essentially
      medical matters. So they are, but they may also raise moral
      and social questions on which many people feel deeply, and in
      that respect they differ from ordinary medical advice and
      treatment. None of the provisions to which I have referred
      placed any limit on the age (or the sex) of the persons to
      whom such advice or treatment might be supplied.</p>

      <p class="text1">Three strands of argument are raised by the
      appeal. These are: (1) whether a girl under the age of 16 has
      the legal capacity to give valid consent to contraceptive
      advice and treatment including medical examination (2)
      whether giving such advice and treatment to a girl under 16
      without her parents' consent infringes the parents' rights
      and (3) whether a doctor who gives such advice or treatment
      to a girl under 16 without her parents' consent incurs
      criminal liability. I shall consider these strands in
      order.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>1. The legal capacity of a girl under 16
      to consent to contraceptive advice, examination and
      treatment</b><br />
       There are some indications in statutory provisions to which
      we were referred that a girl under 16 years of age in England
      and Wales does not have the capacity to give valid consent to
      contraceptive advice and treatment. If she does not have the
      capacity, then any physical examination or touching of her
      body without her parents' consent would be an assault by the
      examiner. One of those provisions is s 8 of the Family Law
      Reform Act 1969, which is in the following terms:</p>

      <blockquote>
        '(1) The consent of a minor who has attained the age of
        sixteen years to any surgical, medical or dental treatment
        which, in the absence of consent, would constitute a
        trespass to his person, shall be as effective as it would
        be if he were of full age and where a minor has by virtue
        of this section given an effective consent to any treatment
        it shall not be necessary to obtain any consent for it from
        his parent or guardian . . .&nbsp; (3) Nothing in this
        section shall be construed as making ineffective any
        consent which would have been effective if this section had
        not been enacted.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The contention on behalf of Mrs Gillick was
      that sub-s (1) of s 8 shows that, apart from the subsection,
      the consent of a minor to such treatment would not be
      effective. But I do not accept that contention because sub-s
      (3) leaves open the question whether consent by a minor under
      the age of 16 would have been effective if the section had
      not been enacted. That question is not answered by the
      section, and sub-s (1) is, in my opinion, merely for the
      avoidance of doubt.&nbsp; Another statutory provision which
      was referred to in this connection is the National Health
      Service (General Medical and Pharmaceutical Services)
      Regulations 1974, SI 1974/160, as amended by the National
      Health Service (General Medical and Pharmaceutical Services)
      Amendment Regulations 1975, SI 1975/719. The regulations
      prescribe the mechanism by which the relationship of doctor
      and patient under the NHS is created. Contraceptive services,
      along with maternity medical services, are treated as
      somewhat apart from other medical services in respect that
      only a doctor who specially offers to provide contraceptive
      or maternity medical services is obliged to provide them: see
      the definition of 'medical card' and 'treatment' in reg 2(1)
      see also regs 6(1)(a) and 14(2)(a) and Sch 1, para 13. But
      nothing turns on this fact. Two points in those regulations
      have a bearing on the present question although, in my
      opinion, only an indirect bearing. The first is that by reg
      14 any 'woman' may apply to a doctor to be accepted by him
      for the provision of contraceptive services. The word 'woman'
      is not defined so as to exclude a girl under 16 or under any
      other age. But reg 32 provides as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'An application to a doctor for inclusion on his list . . .
        may be made, either--(a) on behalf of any person under 16
        years of age, by the mother, or in her absence, the father,
        or in the absence of both parents the guardian or other
        adult person who has the care of the child or (b) on behalf
        of any other person who is incapable of making such an
        application by a relative or other adult person who has the
        care of such person. . .'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The words in para (b) which I have
      emphasised are said, by counsel for Mrs Gillick, to imply
      that a person under 16 years of age is incapable of applying
      to a doctor for services and therefore give some support to
      the argument on behalf of Mrs Gillick. But I do not regard
      the implication as a strong one because the provision is
      merely that an application 'may' be made by the mother or
      other parent or guardian and it applies to the doctor's list
      for the provision of all ordinary medical services as well as
      to his list for the provision of contraception services. I do
      not believe that a person aged 15, who may be living away
      from home, is incapable of applying on his own behalf for
      inclusion in the list of a doctor for medical services of an
      ordinary kind not connected with contraception.&nbsp; Another
      provision, in a different branch of medicine, which is said
      to carry a similar implication is contained in the Mental
      Health Act 1983, s 131, which provides for informal admission
      of patients to mental hospitals. It provides by sub-s
      (2):</p>

      <blockquote>
        'In the case of a minor who has attained the age of 16
        years and is capable of expressing his own wishes, any such
        arrangements as are mentioned in subsection (1) above [for
        informal admission] may be made, carried out and determined
        notwithstanding any right of custody or control vested by
        law in his parent or guardian.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">That provision has only a remote bearing on
      the present question because there is no doubt that a minor
      under the age of 16 is in the custody of his or her parents.
      The question is whether such custody necessarily involves the
      right to veto contraceptive advice or treatment being given
      to the girl.&nbsp; Reference was also made to the Education
      Act 1944, s 48, which dealt with medical inspection and
      treatment of pupils at state schools. Section 48(3), which
      imposed on the local education authority a duty to provide
      for medical and dental inspection of pupils, was repealed and
      superseded by the National Health Service Reorganisation Act
      1973, s 3 and Sch 5. The 1973 Act in turn was replaced by the
      National Health Service Act 1977, s 5(1)(a). Section 48(4) of
      the Education Act 1944, which has not been repealed, imposes
      a duty on the local education authority to arrange for
      encouraging pupils to take advantage of any medical treatment
      so provided, but it includes a proviso in the following
      terms:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Provided that if the parent of any pupil gives to the
        authority notice that he objects to the pupil availing
        himself of any of the provision [for medical treatment etc]
        so made the pupil shall not be encouraged . . . so to do.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">I do not regard that provision as throwing
      light on the present question. It does not prohibit a child
      under the stipulated age from availing himself of medical
      treatment or an education authority from providing it for
      him. If the child, without encouragement from the education
      authority, 'wishes to avail himself of medical treatment' the
      section imposes no obstacle in his way. Accordingly, in my
      opinion, the proviso gives no support to the contention from
      Mrs Gillick, but on the contrary points in the opposite
      direction.</p>

      <p class="text1">The statutory provisions to which I have
      referred do not differentiate so far as the capacity of a
      minor under 16 is concerned between contraceptive advice and
      treatment and other forms of medical advice and treatment. It
      would, therefore, appear that, if the inference which Mrs
      Gillick's advisers seek to draw from the provisions is
      justified, a minor under the age of 16 has no capacity to
      authorise any kind of medical advice or treatment or
      examination of his own body. That seems to me so surprising
      that I cannot accept it in the absence of clear provisions to
      that effect. It seems to me verging on the absurd to suggest
      that a girl or a boy aged 15 could not effectively consent,
      for example, to have a medical examination of some trivial
      injury to his body or even to have a broken arm set. Of
      course the consent of the parents should normally be asked,
      but they may not be immediately available. Provided the
      patient, whether a boy or a girl, is capable of understanding
      what is proposed, and of expressing his or her own wishes, I
      see no good reason for holding that he or she lacks the
      capacity to express them validly and effectively and to
      authorise the medical man to make the examination or give the
      treatment which he advises. After all, a minor under the age
      of 16 can, within certain limits, enter into a contract. He
      or she can also sue and be sued, and can give evidence on
      oath. Moreover, a girl under 16 can give sufficiently
      effective consent to sexual intercourse to lead to the legal
      result that the man involved does not commit the crime of
      rape: see <i>R v Howard</i> [1965] 3 All ER 684 at 685,
      [1966] 1 WLR 13 at 15, when Lord Parker CJ said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        '. . . in the case of a girl under sixteen, the
        prosecution, in order to prove rape, must prove either that
        she physically resisted, or if she did not, that her
        understanding and knowledge were such that she was not in a
        position to decide whether to consent or resist . . . there
        are many girls under sixteen who know full well what it is
        all about and can properly consent.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Accordingly, I am not disposed to hold now,
      for the first time, that a girl aged less than 16 lacks the
      power to give valid consent to contraceptive advice or
      treatment, merely on account of her age. Out of respect for
      the comprehensive and fully researched argument submitted by
      counsel for the DHSS I should notice briefly two old Acts to
      which he referred, but which do not appear to me to be
      helpful. One of these is the Act 4 &amp; 5 Ph &amp; M c 8
      (abduction (1557)) for punishing 'such as shall take away
      maidens that be inheritors, being within the age of sixteen
      years, or that marry them, without consent of their parents'.
      That Act was evidently passed for the protection of property
      rather than for protection of the virtue of maidens. It was
      repealed by the Act 9 Geo 4 c 31 (offences against the person
      (1828)). We were referred to s 20 of the 1828 Act, but that
      section was concerned only with punishing abduction of any
      unmarried girl under the age of 16 and appears to me to have
      little or no bearing on the present problem.</p>

      <p class="text1">On this part of the case accordingly I
      conclude that there is no statutory provision which compels
      me to hold that a girl under the age of 16 lacks the legal
      capacity to consent to contraceptive advice, examination and
      treatment provided that she has sufficient understanding and
      intelligence to know what they involve. I can deal with the
      case law more conveniently in what follows.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>2. The parents' rights and duties in
      respect of medical treatment of their child.</b><br />
       The amended guidance expressly states that the doctor will
      proceed from the assumption that it would be 'most unusual'
      to provide advice about contraception without parental
      consent. It also refers to certain cases where difficulties
      might arise if the doctor refused to promise that his advice
      would remain confidential and it concludes that the
      department realises that 'in such exceptional cases' the
      decision whether or notto prescribe contraception must be for
      the clinical judgment of a doctor. Mrs Gillick's contention
      that the guidance adversely affects her rights and duties as
      a parent must, therefore, involve the assertion of an
      absolute right to be informed of and to veto such advice or
      treatment being given to her daughters even in the 'most
      unusual' cases which might arise (subject, no doubt, to the
      qualifications applying to the case of court order or to
      abandonment of parents' duties). It was, I think, accepted
      both by Mrs Gillick and by the DHSS, and in any event I hold,
      that parental rights to control a child do not exist for the
      benefit of the parent. They exist for the benefit of the
      child and they are justified only in so far as they enable
      the parent to perform his duties towards the child, and
      towards other children in the family. If necessary, this
      proposition can be supported by reference to <i>Blackstone's
      Commentaries</i> (1 Bl Com (17th edn, 1830) 452), where he
      wrote: 'The power of parents over their children is derived
      from . . . their duty.' The proposition is also consistent
      with the provisions of the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971, s
      1, as amended, as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Where in any proceedings before any court . . . (a) the
        legal custody or upbringing of a minor . . . is in
        question, the court, in deciding that question, shall
        regard the welfare of the minor as the first and paramount
        consideration, and shall not take into consideration
        whether from any other point of view the claim of the
        father in respect of such legal custody, upbringing,
        administration or application is superior to that of
        themother, or the claim of the mother is superior to that
        of the father.'
      </blockquote>
      <br />
       

      <p class="text1">From the parents' right and duty of custody
      flows their right and duty of control of the child, but the
      fact that custody is its origin throws but little light on
      the question of the legal extent of control at any particular
      age. Counsel for Mrs Gillick placed some reliance on the
      Children Act 1975. Section 85(1) provides that in that Act
      the expression 'the parental rights and duties' means 'all
      the rights and duties which by law the mother and father have
      in relation to a legitimate child and his property', but the
      subsection does not define the extent of the rights and
      duties which by law the mother and father have. Section 86 of
      the Act provides:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,
        ''legal custody'' means, as respects a child, so much of
        the parental rights and duties as relate to the person of
        the child (including the place and manner in which his time
        is spent) . . .'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">In the Court of Appeal Parker LJ attached
      much importance to that section, especially to the words in
      brackets. He considered that the right relating to the place
      and manner in which the child's time is spent included the
      right, as he put it, 'completely to control the child'
      subject of course always to the intervention of the court.
      Parker LJ went on thus ([1985] 1 All ER 533 at 540, [1985] 2
      WLR 413 at 423):</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Indeed there must, it seems to me, be such a right from
        birth to a fixed age unless whenever, short of majority, a
        question arises it must be determined, in relation to a
        particular child and a particular matter, whether he or she
        is of sufficient understanding to make a responsible and
        reasonable decision. This alternative appears to me
        singularly unattractive and impracticable, particularly in
        the context of medical treatment.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">My Lords, I have, with the utmost respect,
      reached a different conclusion from that of Parker LJ. It is,
      in my view, contrary to the ordinary experience of mankind,
      at least in Western Europe in the present century, to say
      that a child or a young person remains in fact under the
      complete control of his parents until he attains the definite
      age of majority, now 18 in the United Kingdom, and that on
      attaining that age he suddenly acquires independence. In
      practice most wise parents relax their control gradually as
      the child develops and encourage him or her to become
      increasingly independent. Moreover, the degree of parental
      control actually exercised over a particular child does in
      practice vary considerably according to his understanding and
      intelligence and it would, in my opinion, be unrealistic for
      the courts not to recognise these facts. Social customs
      change, and the law ought to, and does in fact, have regard
      to such changes when they are of major importance. An example
      of such recognition is to be found in the view recently
      expressed in your Lordships' House by Lord Brandon, with
      which the other noble and learned Lords who were present
      agreed, in <i>R v D</i> [1984] 2 All ER 449 at 457, [1984] AC
      778 at 806. Dealing with the question of whether the consent
      of a child to being taken away by a stranger would be a good
      defence to a charge of kidnapping, Lord Brandon said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'In the case of a very young child, it would not have the
        understanding or the intelligence to give its consent, so
        that absence of consent would be a necessary inference from
        its age. In the case of an older child, however, it must, I
        think be a question of fact for a jury whether the child
        concerned has sufficient understanding and intelligence to
        give its consent if, but only if, the jury considers that a
        child has these qualities, it must then go on to consider
        whether it has been proved that the child did not give its
        consent. While the matter will always be for the jury alone
        to decide, I should not expect a jury to find at all
        frequently that a child under 14 had sufficient
        understanding and intelligence to give its consent.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">That expression of opinion seems to me
      entirely contradictory of the view expressed by Cockburn CJ
      in <i>R v Howes</i> (1860) 1 E &amp; E 332 at 336--337, 121
      ER 467 at 468--469:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'We repudiate utterly, as most dangerous, the notion that
        any intellectual precocity in an individual female child
        can hasten the period which appears to have been fixed by
        statute for the arrival at the age of discretion for that
        very precocity, if uncontrolled, might very probably lead
        to her irreparable injury. The Legislature has given us a
        guide, which we may safely follow, in pointing out sixteen
        as the age up to which the father's right to custody of his
        female child is to continue and short of which such a child
        has no discretion to consent to leaving him.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The question for decision in that case was
      different from that in the present, but the view that the
      child's intellectual ability is irrelevant cannot, in my
      opinion, now be accepted. It is a question of fact for the
      judge (or jury) to decide whether a particular child can give
      effective consent to contraceptive treatment.&nbsp; In times
      gone by the father had almost absolute authority over his
      children until they attained majority. A rather remarkable
      example of such authority being upheld by the court was <i>Re
      Agar-Ellis</i>, <i>Agar-Ellis v Lascelles</i> (1883) 24 Ch D
      317, which was much relied on by the Court of Appeal. The
      father in that case restricted the communication which his
      daugher aged 17 was allowed to have with her mother, against
      whose moral character nothing was alleged, to an extent that
      would be universally condemned today as quite unreasonable.
      The case has been much criticised in recent years and, in my
      opinion, with good reason. In <i>Hewer v Bryant</i> [1969] 3
      All ER 578 at 582, [1970] 1 QB 357 at 369 Lord<br />
       Denning MR said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'I would get rid of the rule in <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i> and of
        the suggested exceptions to it. That case was decided in
        the year 1883. It reflects the attitude of a Victorian
        parent towards his children. He expected unquestioning
        obedience to his commands. If a son disobeyed, his father
        would cut him off with 1s. If a daughter had an
        illegitimate child, he would turn her out of the house. His
        power only ceased when the child became 21. I decline to
        accept a view so much out of date. The common law can, and
        should, keep pace with the times. It should declare, in
        conformity with the recent report on the Age of Majority
        (Report of the Committee on the Age of Majority (Cmnd 3342)
        under the chairmanship of Latey J, published in July 1967),
        that the legal right of a parent to the custody of a child
        ends at the eighteenth birthday and even up till then, it
        is a dwindling right which the courts will hesitate to
        enforce against the wishes of the child, the older he is.
        It starts with a right of control and ends with little more
        than advice.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">I respectfully agree with every word of that
      and especially with the description of the father's authority
      as a dwindling right. In J v C [1969] 1 All ER 788, [1970] AC
      668 Lord Guest and Lord MacDermott referred to the decision
      in <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i> as an example of the almost absolute
      power asserted by the father over his children before the
      Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 and plainly thought such
      an assertion was out of place at the present time: see per
      Lord MacDermott ([1969] 1 All ER 788 at 814--815, [1970] AC
      668 at 703--704). In R v D [1984] 2 All ER 449, [1984] AC 778
      Lord Brandon cited <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i> an example of the
      older view of a father's authority which his Lordship and the
      other members of the House rejected. In my opinion, the view
      of absolute paternal authority continuing until a child
      attains majority which was applied in <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i> is
      so out of line with present-day views that it should no
      longer be treated as having any authority. I regard it as a
      historical curiosity. As Fox LJ pointed out in the Court of
      Appeal (see [1985] 1 All ER 533 at 554, [1985] 2 WLR 413 at
      439), the <i>Agar-Ellis</i> cases (1878) 10 Ch D 49, (1883)
      24 Ch D 317 seemed to have been regarded as somewhat extreme
      even in their own day, as they were quickly followed by the
      Guardianship of Infants Act 1886, which, by s 5, provided
      that the court may--</p>

      <blockquote>
        'upon the application of the mother of any infant [whether
        under 16 or not] . . . make such order as it may think fit
        regarding the custody of such infant and the right of
        access thereto of either parent, having regard to the
        welfare of the infant, and to the conduct of the parents .
        . .'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Once the rule of the parents' absolute
      authority over minor children is abandoned, the solution to
      the problem in this appeal can no longer be found by
      referring to rigid parental rights at any particular age. The
      solution depends on a judgment of what is best for the
      welfare of the particular child. Nobody doubts, certainly I
      do not doubt, that in the overwhelming majority of cases the
      best judges of a child's welfare are his or her parents. Nor
      do I doubt that any important medical treatment of a child
      under 16 would normally only be carried out with the parents'
      approval. That is why it would and should be 'most unusual'
      for a doctor to advise a child without the knowledge and
      consent of the parents on contraceptive matters. But, as I
      have already pointed out, Mrs Gillick has to go further if
      she is to obtain the first declaration that she seeks. She
      has to justify the absolute right of veto in a parent. But
      there may be circumstances in which a doctor is a better
      judge of the medical advice and treatment which will conduce
      to a girl's welfare than her parents. It is notorious that
      children of both sexes are often reluctant to confide in
      their parents about sexual matters, and the DHSS guidance
      under consideration shows that to abandon the principle of
      confidentiality for contraceptive advice to girls under 16
      might cause some of them not to seek professional advice at
      all, with the consequence of exposing them to 'the immediate
      risks of pregnancy and of sexually-transmitted diseases'. No
      doubt the risk could be avoided if the patient were to
      abstain from sexual intercourse, and one of the doctor's
      responsibilities will be to decide whether a particular
      patient can reasonably be expected to act on advice to
      abstain. We were told that in a significant number of cases
      such abstinence could not reasonably be expected. An example
      is <i>Re P</i> (a minor) (1981) 80 LGR 301, in which
      Butler-Sloss J ordered that a girl aged 15 who had been
      pregnant for the second time and who was in the care of a
      local authority should be fitted with a contraceptive
      appliance because, as the judge is reported to have said (at
      312)--</p>

      <blockquote>
        'I assume that it is impossible for this local authority to
        monitor her sexual activities, and, therefore,
        contraception appears to be the only alternative.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">There may well be other cases where the
      doctor feels that because the girl is under the influence of
      her sexual partner or for some other reason there is no
      realistic prospect of her abstaining from intercourse. If
      that is right it points strongly to the desirability of the
      doctor being entitled in some cases, in the girl's best
      interest, to give her contraceptive advice and treatment if
      necessary without the consent or even the knowledge of her
      parents. The only practicable course is, in my opinion, to
      entrust the doctor with a discretion to act in accordance
      with his view of what is best in the interests of the girl
      who is his patient. He should, of course, always seek to
      persuade her to tell her parents that she is seeking
      contraceptive advice, and the nature of the advice that she
      receives. At least he should seek to persuade her to agree to
      the doctor's informing the parents. But there may well be
      cases, and I think there will be some cases, where the girl
      refuses either to tell the parents herself or to permit the
      doctor to do so and in such cases the doctor will, in my
      opinion, be justified in proceeding without the parents'
      consent or even knowledge provided he is satisfied on the
      following matters: (1) that the girl (although under 16 years
      of age) will understand his advice (2) that he cannot
      persuade her to inform her parents or to allow him to inform
      the parents that she is seeking contraceptive advice (3) that
      she is very likely to begin or to continue having sexual
      intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment (4) that
      unless she receives contraceptive advice or treatment her
      physical or mental health or both are likely to suffer (5)
      that her best interests require him to give her contraceptive
      advice, treatment or both without the parental consent.&nbsp;
      That result ought not to be regarded as a licence for doctors
      to disregard the wishes of parents on this matter whenever
      they find it convenient to do so. Any doctor who behaves in
      such a way would, in my opinion, be failing to discharge his
      professional responsibilities, and I would expect him to be
      disciplined by his own professional body accordingly. The
      medical profession have in modern times come to be entrusted
      with very wide discretionary powers going beyond the strict
      limits of clinical judgment and, in my opinion, there is
      nothing strange about entrusting them with this further
      responsibility which they alone are in a position to
      discharge satisfactorily.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>3. Is a doctor who gives contraceptive
      advice or treatment to a girl under 16 without her parents'
      consent likely to incur criminal liability?</b><br />
       The submission was made to Woolf J on behalf of Mrs Gillick
      that a doctor who provided contraceptive advice and treatment
      to a girl under 16 without her parents' authority would be
      committing an offence under s 28 of the Sexual Offences Act
      1956 by aiding and abetting the commission of unlawful sexual
      intercourse. When the case reached the Court of Appeal
      counsel on both sides conceded that whether a doctor who
      followed the guidelines would be committing an offence or not
      would depend on the circumstances. It would depend on the
      doctor's intentions this appeal is concerned with doctors who
      honestly intend to act in the best interests of the girl, and
      I think it is unlikely that a doctor who gives contraceptive
      advice or treatment with that intention would commit an
      offence under s 28. It must be remembered that a girl under
      16 who has sexual intercourse does not thereby commit an
      offence herself, although her partner does: see the Sexual
      Offences Act 1956, ss 5 and 6. In any event, even if the
      doctor would be committing an offence, the fact that he had
      acted with the parents' consent would not exculpate him as
      Woolf J pointed out ([1984] 1 All ER 365 at 373, [1984] QB
      581 at 595). Accordingly, I regard this contention as
      irrelevant to the question that we have to answer in this
      appeal. Parker LJ in the Court of Appeal dealt at some length
      with the provisions of criminal lawintended to protect girls
      under the age of 16 from being seduced, and perhaps also to
      protect them from their own weakness. Parker LJ expressed his
      conclusion on this part of the case as follows ([1985] 1 All
      ER 533 at 550, [1985] 2 WLR 413 at 435):</p>

      <blockquote>
        'It appears to me that it is wholly incongruous, when the
        act of intercourse is criminal, when permitting it to take
        place on one's premises is criminal and when, if the girl
        were under 13, failing to report an act of intercourse to
        the police would up to 1967 have been criminal, that either
        the department or the area health authority should provide
        facilities which would enable girls under 16 the more
        readily to commit such acts. It seems to me equally
        incongruous to assert that doctors have the right to accept
        the young, down, apparently, to any age, as patients, and
        to provide them with contraceptive advice and treatment
        without reference to their parents and even against their
        known wishes.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">My Lords, the first of those two sentences
      is directed to the question, which is not in issue in this
      appeal, of whether contraceptive facilities should be
      available at all under the NHS for girls under 16. I have
      already explained my reasons for thinking that the
      legislation does not limit the duty of providing such
      facilities to women of 16 or more. The second sentence, which
      does bear directly on the question in the appeal, does not
      appear to me to follow necessarily from the first and with
      respect I cannot agree with it. If the doctor complies with
      the first of the conditions which I have specified, that is
      to say if he satisfies himself that the girl can understand
      his advice, there will be no question of his giving
      contraceptive advice to very young girls.&nbsp;&nbsp; For
      those reasons I do not consider that the guidance interferes
      with the parents' rights.</p>

      <p>The second declaration</p>

      <p class="text1">The second declaration is directed only
      against the area health authority. Its practical importance
      would be minimal because doctors are not 'employed' by the
      area health authority in the family planning service and, if
      they were, the declaration could easily be avoided by the
      girl going to a doctor in a different area. The Court of
      Appeal made the declaration sought, and the authority has not
      appealed against its decision. I am, therefore, of opinion
      that we should not reverse the decision of the Court of
      Appeal on this part of the case. But it is clearly
      inconsistent with the views I have expressed on the first
      declaration, and I agree with Lord Scarman that it should be
      overruled.&nbsp; I would allow the appeal against the first
      declaration granted by the Court of Appeal, and I would
      overrule the second declaration as being erroneous.</p>
      <b>JUDGMENT BY-2: LORD SCARMAN</b><br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text1"><a id="scarman" name="scarman"></a>
      <b>JUDGMENT-2: LORD SCARMAN.</b> My Lords, I have had the
      advantage of reading in draft the speech delivered by my
      noble and learned friend Lord Fraser. Agreeing with it, I
      shall endeavour in delivering my opinion to avoid repetition.
      The importance of the case is, however, such that I believe
      it necessary, even at the cost of some repetition, to deliver
      my opinion in my own words. The case is the beginning, not
      the conclusion, of a legal development in a field glimpsed by
      one or two judges in recent times (notably Butler-Sloss J in
      <i>Re P</i> (a minor) (1981) 80 LGR 301) but not yet fully
      explored. Mrs Gillick, even though she may lose the appeal,
      has performed a notable public service in directing judicial
      attention to the problems arising from the interaction of
      parental right and a doctor's duty in a field of medicine
      unknown to our fathers but of immense consequence to our
      society. The contraceptive pill has introduced a new
      independence, and offers new options, for women but has it in
      the process undermined parental right and duty? In my
      judgment, the answer is No, even though parental right may
      not be as extensive or as long lasting as she believes it to
      be.</p>

      <p class="text1">Victoria Gillick, mother of five daughters
      under the age of 16, challenges the lawfulness of a
      memorandum of guidance issued by the Department of Health and
      Social Security which she says encourages and in certain
      circumstances recommends health authorities, doctors and
      others concerned in operating the department's family
      planning services to provide contraceptive advice and
      treatment to girls under the age of 16 without the knowledge
      or consent of a parent. Mrs Gillick is a wife and mother
      living in a united family with her husband and their
      children. The husband supports the action being taken, as
      they both see it, to protect their daughters. Nothing further
      need be said of their family situation in deciding this
      appeal.&nbsp; Mrs Gillick began her proceedings by the issue
      of a writ against two defendants, the health authority for
      the area in which she lives and the department. She claims in
      an ordinary civil action declaratory relief against both
      defendants that the guidance is unlawful, and against the
      area health authority alone a declaration that no doctor or
      other person in its employ may give contraception or abortion
      advice to Mrs Gillick's children under the age of 16 without
      her prior knowledge and consent. The area health authority
      has taken no part in the litigation, but the department has
      fought the case strenuously. The appeal to the House is that
      of the department the health authority has not appealed and
      is not represented.</p>

      <p class="text1">The written case submitted on Mrs Gillick's
      behalf to the House formulates three propositions of law, any
      one of which, if made good, would suffice to entitle her to
      relief. They are as follows: (i) parental rights should be
      protected from any invasion or interference neither
      authorised by a competent court nor expressly authorised by
      statute (the parental rights case) (ii) the provision of
      contraceptive treatment to girls under the age of 16 either
      constitutes criminal conduct in itself or is so closely
      analogous thereto as to be contrary to public policy (the
      criminal law case) (iii) a girl below the age of 16 is not
      capable in law of giving a valid consent to medical treatment
      and in the particular context of this case to contraceptive
      or abortion treatment (the age of consent point).</p>

      <p class="text1">Before, however, considering these
      propositions, it is necessary to clear out of the way certain
      procedural questions, which, though not urged on our
      attention, do call for a brief consideration.<br />
      <br />
       <b>Procedure</b><br />
       Three procedural questions have emerged in the course of the
      litigation. First, Mr Simon Brown, who before his elevation
      to the Bench had the conduct of the case as counsel for the
      department, raised at the trial the question as to the
      propriety of the civil court granting a declaration in a case
      which involved the criminal law. The judge saw no reason why
      he should be inhibited on this ground from dealing with the
      issues in the action and I agree with him. It was not
      contended that the issue of the guidance was itself a crime
      the case against the department was simply that the guidance,
      if followed, would result in unlawful acts and that the
      department by issuing it was exercising a statutory
      discretion in a wholly unreasonable way, i e the classical
      Wednesbury case for judicial review: see <i>Associated
      Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp</i> [1947] 2
      All ER 680, [1948] 1 KB 223.&nbsp; The second question is as
      to the propriety of proceeding in this case by ordinary civil
      action. Should not Mrs Gillick have proceeded by way of
      judicial review under RSC Ord 53? No point was taken at trial
      or in the Court of Appeal against Mrs Gillick that she should
      have proceeded not by issuing a writ but by applying for
      judicial review. Woolf J did, however, mention the matter
      only to hold that there was a relevant precedent for
      proceeding by writ in this House's decision in <i>Royal
      College of Nursing of the UK v Dept of Health and Social
      Security</i> [1981] 1 All ER 545, [1981] AC 800.&nbsp; The
      point having been brought to the attention of the House I
      think it desirable to consider it if only because of the
      later decision of the House in <i>O'Reilly v Mackman</i>
      [1982] 3 All ER 1124 at 1134, [1983] 2 AC 237 at 285, where
      Lord Diplock, with whose opinion their other Lordships
      agreed, laid down a rule in these terms:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Now that those disadvantages [i e those previously
        associated with prerogative order procedure] to applicants
        have been removed and all remedies for infringements of
        rights protected by public law can be obtained on an
        application for judicial review, as can also remedies for
        infringements of rights under private law if such
        infringements should also be involved, it would in my view
        as a general rule [my emphasis] be contrary to public
        policy, and as such an abuse of the process of the court,
        to permit a person seeking to establish that a decision of
        a public authority infringed rights to which he was
        entitled to protection under public law to proceed by way
        of an ordinary action and by this means to evade the
        provisions of Ord 53 for the protection of such
        authorities.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">If there be in the present case an abuse of
      the process of the court, the House cannot overlook it, even
      if the parties are prepared to do so, and even though the
      writ in this case was issued before the decision of the House
      in O'Reilly's case. Mrs Gillick's action is essentially to
      protect what she alleges to be her rights as a parent under
      private law. Although she is proceeding against&nbsp; two
      public authorities and invokes the criminal law and public
      policy in support of her case, she claims as a parent whose
      right of custody and guardianship in respect of her children
      under the age of 16 is (she says) threatened by the guidance
      given by the department to area health authorities, doctors
      and others concerned in the provision by the department of a
      family health service. This is a very different case from
      <i>O'Reilly v Mackman</i>, where it could not be contended
      that there was any infringement or threat of infringement of
      any right derived from private law. For the appellants in
      O'Reilly's case were convicted prisoners faced with
      forfeiture of remission, and they were held to have not a
      right to remission of their prison sentences but merely 'a
      legitimate expectation' which could, if the necessary facts
      were established, entitle them 'to a remedy in public law'.
      They had, therefore, no private right in the matter, and
      could rely only on the 'public law' doctrine of legitimate
      expectation.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to embark on an analysis
      of the newly fledged distinction in English law between
      public and private law, for I do not see Mrs Gillick's claim
      as falling under the embargo imposed by O'Reilly's case. If I
      should be wrong in this view, I would nevertheless think that
      the private law content of her claim was so great as to make
      her case an exception to the general rule. Lord Diplock
      recognised that the general rule which he was laying down
      admitted of exceptions, including cases--</p>

      <blockquote>
        'where the invalidity of the [public authority's] decision
        arises as a collateral issue in a claim for infringement of
        a right of the plaintiff arising under private law, or
        where none of the parties objects to the adoption of the
        procedure by writ or originating summons.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">(See [1982] 3 All ER 1124 at 1134, [1982] 2
      AC 237 at 285.) Both these exceptions can be said to apply in
      the present case. Like Lord Diplock, I think that procedural
      problems in the field of public law must be left to be
      decided on a case to case basis. Mrs Gillick was, in my
      opinion, fully entitled to proceed by ordinary action, even
      though she could also have proceeded by way of judicial
      review.&nbsp; The third and final procedural question is a
      mere technicality as such, it creates (no lawyer would be
      surprised) more trouble than the other two. If the House
      should allow department's appeal against the guidance
      declaration, what is to be done about the other declaration
      granted exclusively against the area health authority? As a
      matter of common sense, if Mrs Gillick fails to establish
      that the department's guidance is unlawful, she cannot on the
      evidence in this case establish her entitlement to the other
      declaration against the health authority. The Court of Appeal
      treated the second declaration as consequential on the
      guidance declaration, which on the evidence it was plainly
      right to do. But there is a difficulty in allowing an appeal
      where there is no appellant and no appeal. Fortunately in
      this case there is no issue between the parties as to costs.
      If the department succeeds, it does not ask for costs against
      Mrs Gillick here or below and the area health authority has
      incurred no costs. Two courses are open to the House: one
      would be to ignore the technicalities, allow the appeal (if
      that be the view of the House), and set aside both
      declarations the other, which is strictly correct, would be
      to allow the department's appeal and to declare that the
      reasoning was also applicable to the Court of Appeal's
      decision in favour of the health authority, which must,
      therefore, be held to be overruled. If the second course
      should be taken, the only order to be made by the House would
      be to allow the department's appeal and set aside the
      'guidance' declaration. I favour the second course.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>The department's guidance</b><br />
       In 1974 the department assumed statutory responsibility for
      the provision of family planning services on a national
      basis. This involved a reorganisation which included a
      transfer of services from the agencies previously concerned
      to area health authorities. In the course of the
      reorganisation, which took some two years to complete, the
      department issued guidance as to the duties and
      responsibilities of doctors and others concerned with the
      provision of such services. It was empowered so to do by its
      assumption, pursuant to statute, of responsibility for the
      provision of such services. In May 1974 the department
      circulated a memorandum of guidance HN (80) 46 it included a
      section (section G) as to the provision of services to young
      people. The text of section G aroused some public concern,
      and in December 1980 a revised section G was issued to
      replace the earlier text. It is this revision which lies at
      the heart of the case, being the subject of Mrs Gillick's
      challenge. I set it out in full:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'REVISED SECTION G--THE YOUNG<br />
         Clinic sessions should be available for people of all
        ages, but it may be helpful to make separate, less formal
        arrangements for young people. The staff should be
        experienced in dealing with young people and their
        problems. There is widespread concern about counselling and
        treatment for children under 16. Special care is needed not
        to undermine parental responsibility and family stability.
        The Department would therefore hope that in any case where
        a doctor or other professional worker is approached by a
        person under the age of 16 for advice in these matters, the
        doctor, or other professional, will always seek to persuade
        the child to involve the parent or guardian (or other
        person in loco parentis) at the earliest stage of
        consultation, and will proceed from the assumption that it
        would be most unusual to provide advice about contraception
        without parental consent. It is, however, widely accepted
        that consultations between doctors and patients are
        confidential and the Department recognises the importance
        which doctors and patients attach to this principle. It is
        a principle which applies also to the other professions
        concerned. To abandon this principle for children under 16
        might cause some not to seek professional advice at all.
        They could then be exposed to the immediate risks of
        pregnancy and of sexually-transmitted disease, as well as
        other long-term physical, psychological and emotional
        consequences which are equally a threat to stable family
        life. This would apply particularly to young people whose
        parents are, for example, unconcerned, entirely
        unresponsive, or grossly disturbed. Some of these young
        people are away from their parents and in the care of local
        authorities or voluntary organisations standing in loco
        parentis. The Department realises that in such exceptional
        cases the nature of any counselling must be a matter for
        the doctor or other professional worker concerned and that
        the decision whether or not to prescribe contraception must
        be for the clinical judgment of a doctor.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The first question in the appeal is simply:
      what is the true meaning of this text? Does it, or does it
      not, permit doctors concerned in the provision of a statutory
      service to prescribe contraceptive treatment for a girl under
      16 without the knowledge and consent of her parents? And, if
      it does, in what circumstances?&nbsp; There can be no doubt
      that it does permit doctors to prescribe in certain
      circumstances contraception for girls under 16 without the
      knowledge and consent of a parent or guardian. (In this
      opinion I shall use the term 'parent' to include 'guardian'.)
      The text is not, however, clear as to the circumstances
      (variously described as 'unusual' and 'exceptional') which
      justify a doctor in so doing. The House must be careful not
      to construe the guidance as though it was a statute or even
      to analyse it in the way appropriate to a judgment. The
      question to be asked is: what would a doctor understand to be
      the guidance offered to him if he should be faced with a girl
      under 16 seeking contraceptive treatment without the
      knowledge or consent of her parents?&nbsp; He would know that
      it was his duty to seek to persuade the girl to let him bring
      into consultation her parents (or one of them). If she
      refused, he (or the counsellor to whom the girl had gone)
      must ask himself whether the case was one of those
      exceptional cases in which the guidance permitted a doctor to
      prescribe contraception without the knowledge or consent of a
      parent (provided always that in the exercise of his clinical
      judgment he thought this course to be in the true interest of
      his patient). In my judgment the guidance clearly implies
      that in exceptional cases the parental right to make
      decisions as to the care of their children, which derives
      from their right of custody, can lawfully be overridden, and
      that in such cases the doctor may without parental
      consultation or consent prescribe contraceptive treatment in
      the exercise of his clinical judgment. And the guidance
      reminds the doctor that in such cases he owes the duty of
      confidentiality to his patient, by which is meant that the
      doctor would be in breach of his duty to her if he did
      communicate with her parents.&nbsp; The guidance leaves two
      areas of the doctor's responsibility in some obscurity.
      Though it provides illustrations of exceptional cases, it
      offers no definition. And it gives no clue as to what is
      meant by 'clinical judgment' other than that it must at least
      include the professional judgment of a doctor as to what is
      the medically appropriate advice or treatment to be offered
      to his patient.&nbsp; This lack of definition does not, in my
      judgment, assist Mrs Gillick. If, contrary to her submission,
      the law recognises that exceptional cases can arise in which
      it is lawful for a doctor to prescribe contraceptive
      treatment for a girl under 16 without the knowledge and
      consent of a parent, the guidance would be within the law
      notwithstanding its lack of precision, unless its vagueness
      created so obscure a darkness that it could reasonably be
      understood by a doctor as authorising him to prescribe
      without the parent's consent whenever he should think fit.
      &nbsp; I do not find on a fair reading of the guidance
      anything to obscure or confuse its basic message that a
      doctor is only in exceptional circumstances to prescribe
      contraception for a young person under the age of 16 without
      the knowledge and consent of a parent. No reasonable person
      could read it as meaning that the doctor's discretion could
      ordinarily override parental right. Illustrations are given
      in the text of exceptional cases in which the doctor may take
      the 'most unusual' course of not consulting the parent. Only
      in exceptional cases does the guidance contemplate him
      exercising his clinical judgment without the parent's
      knowledge and consent. Lastly, there really can be no<br />
       compulsion in law on a government department to spell out to
      a doctor what is meant by 'clinical judgment'.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>The question in the appeal</b><br />
       It is only if the guidance permits or encourages unlawful
      conduct in the provision of contraceptive services that it
      can be set aside as being the exercise of a statutory
      discretionary power in an unreasonable way.&nbsp; The
      question, therefore, for the House is: can a doctor in any
      circumstances lawfully prescribe contraception for a girl
      under 16 without the knowledge and consent of a parent?</p>

      <p class="text1">Before discussing the question, I put out of
      the way the two exceptions which I understand both parties to
      the appeal accept, namely the order of a competent court and
      emergency. Nobody disputes the existence of the court
      exception, nor does the other situation call for more than a
      brief mention.&nbsp; If, as is clear in the light of s 5 of
      the National Health Service Act 1977 (re-enacting earlier
      legislation) and s 41 of the National Health Service
      (Scotland) Act 1978, contraceptive medical treatment is
      recognised as a legitimate and beneficial treatment in cases
      in which it is medically indicated, it must be an available
      option for the doctor in an emergency where treatment is
      urgently needed and the consent of the patient or his parent
      cannot be obtained either in time or at all. And the case of
      a teenage girl abandoned by her parents and not yet received
      into the care of a local authority or placed under the
      protection of a responsible adult in loco parentis can be
      seen to be a true emergency. Both Mrs Gillick, as I
      understand her case, and the department accept these
      exceptions to the general rule that a parent must be
      consulted and give consent and I say no more than that it
      would be unthinkable for the law not to recognise them.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Parental right and the age of
      consent</b><br />
       Mrs Gillick relies on both the statute law and the case law
      to establish her proposition that parental consent is in all
      other circumstances necessary. The only statutory provision
      directly in point is s 8 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969.
      Subsection (1) of the section provides that the consent of a
      minor who has attained the age of 16 to any surgical, mental
      or dental treatment which in the absence of consent would
      constitute a trespass to his person shall be as effective as
      if he were of full age and that the consent of his parent or
      guardian need not be obtained. Subsection (3) of the section
      provides:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Nothing in this section shall be construed as making
        ineffective any consent which would have been effective if
        this section had not been enacted.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">I cannot accept the submission made on Mrs
      Gillick's behalf that sub-s (1) necessarily implies that
      prior to its enactment the consent of a minor to medical
      treatment could not be effective in law. Subsection (3)
      leaves open the question whether the consent of a minor under
      16 could be an effective consent. Like my noble and learned
      friend Lord Fraser, I read the section as clarifying the law
      without conveying any indication as to what the law was
      before it was enacted. So far as minors under 16 are
      concerned, the law today is as it was before the enactment of
      the section.&nbsp; Nor do I find in the provisions of the
      statute law to which Parker LJ refers in his judgment in the
      Court of Appeal (see [1985] 1 All ER 533, [1985] 2 WLR 413)
      any encouragement, let alone any compelling reason, for
      holding that Parliament has accepted that a child under 16
      cannot consent to medical treatment. I respectfully agree
      with the reasoning and conclusion of my noble and learned
      friend Lord Fraser on this point.&nbsp; The law has,
      therefore, to be found by a search in the judge-made law for
      the true principle. The legal difficulty is that in our
      search we find ourselves in a field of medical practice where
      parental right and a doctor's duty may point us in different
      directions. This is not surprising. Three features have
      emerged in today's society which were not known to our
      predecessors: (1) contraception as a subject for medical
      advice and treatment (2) the increasing independence of young
      people and (3) the changed status of women. In times past
      contraception was rarely a matter for the doctor but with the
      development of the contraceptive pill for women it has become
      part and parcel of every-day medical practice, as is made
      clear by the department's <i>Handbook of Contraceptive
      Practice</i> (1984 revision) esp para 1.2. Family planning
      services are now available under statutory powers to all
      without any express limitation as to age or marital status.
      Young people, once they have attained the age of 16, are
      capable of consenting to contraceptive treatment, since it is
      medical treatment and, however extensive be parental right in
      the care and upbringing of children, it cannot prevail so as
      to nullify the 16-year-old's capacity to consent which is now
      conferred by statute. Furthermore, women have obtained by the
      availability of the pill a choice of life-style with a degree
      of independence and of opportunity undreamed of until this
      generation and greater, I would add, than any law of equal
      opportunity could by itself effect.&nbsp; The law ignores
      these developments at its peril. The House's task, therefore,
      as the supreme court in a legal system largely based on rules
      of law evolved over the years by the judicial process is to
      search the overfull and cluttered shelves of the law reports
      for a principle or set of principles recognised by the judges
      over the years but stripped of the detail which, however
      appropriate in their day, would, if applied today, lay the
      judges open to a justified criticism for failing to keep the
      law abreast of the society in which they live and work.&nbsp;
      It is, of course, a judicial commonplace to proclaim the
      adaptability and flexibility of the judge-made common law.
      But this is more frequently proclaimed than acted on. The
      mark of the great judge from Coke through Mansfield to our
      day has been the capacity and the will to search out
      principle, to discard the detail appropriate (perhaps) to
      earlier times and to apply principle in such a way as to
      satisfy the needs of his own time. If judge-made law is to
      survive as a living and relevant body of law, we must make
      the effort, however inadequately, to follow the lead of the
      great masters of the judicial art. In this appeal, therefore,
      there is much in the earlier case law which the House must
      discard almost everything I would say but its principle. For
      example, the horrendous Ellis decisions (see <i>Re
      Agar-Ellis</i>, <i>Agar-Ellis v Lascelles</i> (1878) 10 Ch D
      49, (1883) 24 Ch D 317) of the late nineteenth century
      asserting the power of the father over his child were rightly
      remaindered to the history books by the Court of Appeal in
      <i>Hewer v Bryant</i> [1969]3 All ER 578, [1970] 1 QB 357, an
      important case to which I shall return later. Yet the
      decisions of earlier generations may well afford clues to the
      true principle of the law: e g <i>R v Howes</i> (1860) 3 E
      &amp; E 332 at 336, 121 ER 467 at 468, which I also later
      quote. It is the duty of this House to look at, through and
      past the decisions of earlier generations so that it may
      identify the principle which lies behind them. Even Lord
      Eldon (no legal revolutionary) once remarked, when invited to
      study precedent (the strength of which he never
      underrated):</p>

      <blockquote>
        '. . . all law ought to stand upon principle, and unless
        decision has removed out of the way all argument and all
        principle so as to make it impossible to apply them to the
        case before you, you must find out what is the principle
        upon which it must be decided.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">(See <i>Queensberry Leases Case</i> (1819) 1
      Bli 339 at 486--487, 4 ER 127 at 179, quoted by Lord Campbell
      Lives of the Lord Chancellors (4th edn, 1857) vol 10, ch 213,
      p 244.) Approaching the earlier law in this way, one finds
      plenty of indications as to the principles governing the
      law's approach to parental right and the child's right to
      make his or her own decision. <span class="yellow">Parental
      rights clearly do exist, and they do not wholly disappear
      until the age of majority. Parental rights relate to both the
      person and the property of the child: custody, care and
      control of the person and guardianship of the property of the
      child. But the common law has never treated such rights as
      sovereign or beyond review and control. Nor has our law ever
      treated the child as other than a person with capacities and
      rights recognised by law. The principle of the law, as I
      shall endeavour to show, is that parental rights are derived
      from parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed
      for the protection of the person and property of the
      child.</span> The principle has been subjected to certain age
      limits set by statute for certain purposes and in some cases
      the courts have declared an age of discretion at which a
      child acquires before the age of majority the right to make
      his (or her) own decision. But these limitations in no way
      undermine the principle of the law, and should not be allowed
      to obscure it. Let me make good, quite shortly, the
      proposition of principle. First, the guardianship
      legislation. Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act
      1886 began the process which is now complete of establishing
      the equal rights of mother and father. In doing so the
      legislation, which is currently embodied in s 1 of the
      Guardianship of Minors Act 1971, took over from the Chancery
      courts a rule which they had long followed (it was certainly
      applied by Lord Eldon during his quarter of a century as Lord
      Chancellor, as Parker LJ in this case (see [1985] 1 All ER
      533 at 541, [1985] 2 WLR 413 at 424), quoting Heilbron J,
      reminds us) that when a court has before it a question as to
      the care and upbringing of a child it must treat the welfare
      of the child as the paramount consideration in determining
      the order to be made. There is here a principle which limits
      and governs the exercise of parental rights of custody, care
      and control. It is a principle perfectly consistent with the
      law's recognition of the parent as the natural guardian of
      the child but it is also a warning that parental right must
      be exercised in accordance with the welfare principle and can
      be challenged, even overridden, if it be not.&nbsp; Second,
      there is the common law's understanding of the nature of
      parental right. We are not concerned in this appeal to
      catalogue all that is contained in what Sachs LJ has
      felicitously described as the 'bundle of rights' which
      together constitute the rights of custody, care and control
      (see <i>Hewer v Bryant</i> [1969] 3 All ER 578 at 585, [1970]
      1 QB 357 at 373). It is abundantly plain that the law
      recognises that there is a right and a duty of parents to
      determine whether or not to seek medical advice in respect of
      their child, and, having received advice, to give or withhold
      consent to medical treatment. The question in the appeal is
      as to the extent and duration of the right and the
      circumstances in which outside the two admitted exceptions to
      which I have earlier referred it can be overridden by the
      exercise of medical judgment.&nbsp; As Parker and Fox LJJ
      noted in the Court of Appeal, the modern statute law
      recognises the existence of parental right: e g ss 85 and 86
      of the Children Act 1975 and ss 2, 3 and 4 of the Child Care
      Act 1980. It is derived from parental duty. A most
      illuminating discussion of parental right is to be found in
      <i>Blackstone's Commentaries</i> (1 Bl Com (17th edn, 1830)
      vol 1, chs 16 and 17). <span class="yellow">He analyses the
      duty of the parent as the 'maintenance . . . protection, and
      . . . education' of the child (at p 446). He declares that
      the power of parents over their children is derived from
      their duty and exists 'to enable the parent more effectually
      to perform his duty,</span> and partly as a recompense for
      his care and trouble in the faithful discharge of it' (at p
      452). In ch 17 he discusses the relation of guardian and
      ward. It is, he points out, a relation 'derived out of [the
      relation of parent and child]: the guardian being only a
      temporary parent, that is, for so long a time as the ward is
      an infant, or under age' (at p 460). A little later in the
      same chapter he again emphasises that the power and
      reciprocal duty of a guardian and ward are the same, pro
      tempore, as that of a father and child and adds that the
      guardian, when the ward comes of age (as also the father who
      becomes guardian 'at common law' if an estate be left to his
      child), must account to the child for all that he has
      transacted on his behalf (at pp 462--463). He then embarks on
      a discussion of the different ages at which for different
      purposes a child comes of sufficient age to make his own
      decision and he cites examples, viz a boy might at 12 years
      old take the oath of allegiance at 14 he might consent to
      marriage or choose his guardian 'and, if his discretion be
      actually proved, may make his testament of his personal
      estate' at 18 he could be an executor: all these rights and
      responsibilities being capable of his acquiring before
      reaching the age of majority at 21 (at p 463). The two
      chapters provide a valuable insight into the principle and
      flexibility of the common law. <span class="yellow">The
      principle is that parental right or power of control of the
      person and property of his child exists primarily to enable
      the parent to discharge his duty of maintenance, protection
      and education until he reaches such an age as to be able to
      look after himself and make his own decisions.</span>
      Blackstone does suggest that there was a further
      justification for parental right, viz as a recompense for the
      faithful discharge of parental duty but the right of the
      father to the exclusion of the mother and the reward element
      as one of the reasons for the existence of the right have
      been swept away by the guardianship of minors legislation to
      which I have already referred. He also accepts that by
      statute and by case law varying ages of discretion have been
      fixed for various purposes. But it is clear that this was
      done to achieve certainty where it was considered necessary
      and in no way limits the principle that parental right
      endures only so long as it is needed for the protection of
      the child. Although statute has intervened in respect of a
      child's capacity to consent to medical treatment from the age
      of 16 onwards, neither statute nor the case law has ruled on
      the extent and duration of parental right in respect of
      children under the age of 16. More specifically, there is no
      rule yet applied to contraceptive treatment, which has
      special problems of its own and is a late comer in medical
      practice. It is open, therefore, to the House to formulate a
      rule. The Court of Appeal favoured a fixed age limit of 16,
      basing itself on a view of the statute law which I do not
      share and on its view of the effect of the older case law
      which for the reasons already given I cannot accept. It
      sought to justify the limit by the public interest in the law
      being certain. Certainty is always an advantage in the law,
      and in some branches of the law it is a necessity. But it
      brings with it an inflexibility and a rigidity which in some
      branches of the law can obstruct justice, impede the law's
      development and stamp on the law the mark of obsolescence
      where what is needed is the capacity for development. The law
      relating to parent and child is concerned with the problems
      of the growth and maturity of the human personality. If the
      law should impose on the process of 'growing up' fixed limits
      where nature knows only a continuous process, the price would
      be artificiality and a lack of realism in an area where the
      law must be sensitive to human development and social change.
      If certainty be thought desirable, it is better that the
      rigid demarcations necessary to achieve it should be laid
      down by legislation after a full consideration of all the
      relevant factors than by the courts, confined as they are by
      the forensic process to the evidence adduced by the parties
      and to whatever may properly fall within the judicial notice
      of judges. Unless and until Parliament should think fit to
      intervene, the courts should establish a principle flexible
      enough to enable justice to be achieved by its application to
      the particular circumstances proved by the evidence placed
      before them. &nbsp; The underlying principle of the law was
      exposed by Blackstone and can be seen to have been
      acknowledged in the case law. It is that parental right
      yields to the child's right to make his own decisions when he
      reaches a sufficient understanding and intelligence to be
      capable of making up his own mind on the matter requiring
      decision. Lord Denning MR captured the spirit and principle
      of the law when he said in <i>Hewer v Bryant</i> [1969] 3 All
      ER 578 at 582, [1970] 1 QB 337 at 369:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'I would get rid of the rule in <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i>
        ((1883) 24 Ch D 317) and of the suggested exceptions to it.
        That case was decided in the year 1883. It reflects the
        attitude of a Victorian parent towards his children. He
        expected unquestioning obedience to his commands. If a son
        disobeyed, his father would cut him off with 1s. If a
        daughter had an illegitimate child, he would turn her out
        of the house. His power only ceased when the child became
        21. I decline to accept a view so much out of date. The
        common law can, and should, keep pace with the times. It
        should declare, in conformity with the recent report on the
        Age of Majority (Report of the Committee on the Age of
        Majority (Cmnd 3342) under the chairmanship of Latey J,
        published in July 1967), that the legal right of a parent
        to the custody of a child ends at the eighteenth birthday
        and even up till then, it is a dwindling right which the
        courts will hesitate to enforce against the wishes of the
        child, the older he is. It starts with a right of control
        and ends with little more than advice.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">But his is by no means a solitary voice. It
      is consistent with the opinion expressed by the House in <i>J
      v C</i> [1969] 1 All ER 788, [1970] AC 668, where their
      Lordships clearly recognised as out of place the assertion in
      the <i>Agar-Ellis</i> cases (1878) 10 Ch D 49, (1883) 24 Ch D
      318 of a father's power bordering on 'patria potestas'. It is
      consistent with the view of Lord Parker CJ in <i>R v
      Howard</i> [1965] 3 All ER 684 at 685, [1966] 1 WLR 13 at 15,
      where he ruled that in the case of a prosecution charging
      rape of a girl under 16 the Crown must prove either lack of
      her consent or that she was not in a position to decide
      whether to consent or resist and added the comment that
      'there are many girls who know full well what it is all about
      and can properly consent'. And it is consistent with the
      views of the House in the recent criminal case where a father
      was accused of kidnapping his own child, <i>R v D</i> [1984]
      2 All ER 449 [1984] AC 778, a case to which I shall return.
      &nbsp; For the reasons which I have endeavoured to develop,
      the case law of the nineteenth and earlier centuries is no
      guide to the application of the law in the conditions of
      today. The <i>Agar-Ellis</i> cases (the power of the father)
      cannot live with the modern statute law. The habeas corpus
      'age of discretion' cases are also no guide as to the limits
      which should be accepted today in marking out the bounds of
      parental right, of a child's capacity to make his or her own
      decision and of a doctor's duty to his patient. Nevertheless
      the 'age of discretion' cases are helpful in that they do
      reveal the judges as accepting that a minor can in law
      achieve an age of discretion before coming of full age. The
      'age of discretion' cases are cases in which a parent or
      guardian (usually the father) has applied for habeas corpus
      to secure the return of his child who has left home without
      his consent. The courts would refuse an order if the child
      had attained the age of discretion, which came to be regarded
      as 14 for boys and 16 for girls, and did not wish to return.
      The principle underlying them was plainly that an order would
      be refused if the child had sufficient intelligence and
      understanding to make up his own mind. A passage from the
      judgment of Cockburn CJ in <i>R v Howes</i> (1860) 3 E &amp;
      E 332 at 336--337, 121 ER 467 at 468--469, which Parker LJ
      quoted in the Court of Appeal, illustrates their reasoning
      and shows how a fixed age was used as a working rule to
      establish an age at which the requisite 'discretion' could be
      held to be achieved by the child. Cockburn CJ said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'Now the cases which have been decided on this subject shew
        that, although a father is entitled to the custody of his
        children till they attain the age of twenty-one, this Court
        will not grant a habeas corpus to hand a child which is
        below that age over to its father, provided that it has
        attained an age of sufficient discretion to enable it to
        exercise a wise choice for its own interests. The whole
        question is, what is that age of discretion? We repudiate
        utterly, as most dangerous, the notion that any
        intellectual precocity in an individual female child can
        hasten the period which appears to have been fixed by
        statute for the arrival of the age of discretion for that
        very precocity, if uncontrolled, might very probably lead
        to her irreparable injury. The legislature has given us a
        guide, which we may safely follow, in pointing out sixteen
        as the age up to which the father's right to the custody of
        his female child is to continue and short of which such a
        child has no discretion to consent to leaving him.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The principle is clear and a fixed age of
      discretion was accepted by the courts by analogy from the
      Abduction Acts (the first being the Act 4 &amp; 5 Ph &amp; M
      c 8 (1557)). While it is unrealistic today to treat a
      sixteenth century Act as a safe guide in the matter of a
      girl's discretion, and while no modern judge would dismiss
      the intelligence of a teenage girl as 'intellectual
      precocity', we can agree with Cockburn CJ as to the principle
      of the law: the attainment by a child of an age of sufficient
      discretion to enable him or her to exercise a wise choice in
      his or her own interests.&nbsp; The modern law governing
      parental right and a child's capacity to make his own
      decisions was considered in R v D [1984] 2 All ER 449, [1984]
      AC 778. The House must, in my view, be understood as having
      in that case accepted that, save where statute otherwise
      provides, a minor's capacity to make his or her own decision
      depends on the minor having sufficient understanding and
      intelligence to make the decision and is not to be determined
      by reference to any judicially fixed age limit. The House was
      faced with a submission that a father, even if he had taken
      his child away by force or fraud, could not be guilty of a
      criminal offence of any kind. Lord Brandon, with whom their
      other Lordships agreed, commented that this might well have
      been the view of the legislature and the courts in the
      nineteenth century, but had this to say about parental right
      and a child's capacity in our time to give or withhold a
      valid consent ([1984] 2 All ER 449 at 456, [1984] AC 778 at
      804--805):</p>

      <blockquote>
        'This is because in those times both the generally accepted
        conventions of society and the courts by which such
        conventions were buttressed and enforced, regarded a father
        as having absolute and paramount authority, as against all
        the world, over any children of his who were still under
        the age of majority (then 21), except for a married
        daughter. The nature of this view of a father's rights
        appears clearly from various reported cases, including, as
        a typical example, <i>Re Agar-Ellis</i>, <i>Agar-Ellis v
        Lascelles</i> (1883) 24 Ch D 317. The common law, however,
        while generally immutable in its principles, unless
        different principles are laid down by statute, is not
        immutable in the way in which it adapts, develops and
        applies those principles in a radically changing world and
        against the background of radically changed social
        conventions and conditions.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Later he said ([1984] 2 All ER 449 at 457,
      [1984] AC 778 at 806):</p>

      <blockquote>
        'I see no good reason why, in relation to the kidnapping of
        a child, it should not in all cases be the absence of the
        child's consent which is material, whatever its age may be.
        In the case of a very young child, it would not have the
        understanding or the intelligence to give its consent, so
        that absence of consent would be a necessary inference from
        its age. In the case of an older child, however, it must, I
        think, be a question of fact for a jury whether the child
        concerned has sufficient understanding and intelligence to
        give its consent if, but only if, the jury considers that a
        child has these qualities, it must then go on to consider
        whether it has been proved that the child did not give its
        consent. While the matter will always be for the jury alone
        to decide, I should not expect a jury to find at all
        frequently that a child under 14 had sufficient
        understanding and intelligence to give its consent.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">In the light of the foregoing I would hold
      that as a matter of law the parental right to determine
      whether or not their minor child below the age of 16 will
      have medical treatment terminates if and when the child
      achieves a sufficient understanding and intelligence to
      enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed. It
      will be a question of fact whether a child seeking advice has
      sufficient understanding of what is involved to give a
      consent valid in law. Until the child achieves the capacity
      to consent, the parental right to make the decision continues
      save only in exceptional circumstances. Emergency, parental
      neglect, abandonment of the child or inability to find the
      parent are examples of exceptional situations justifying the
      doctor proceeding to treat the child without parental
      knowledge and consent but there will arise, no doubt, other
      exceptional situations in which it will be reasonable for the
      doctor to proceed without the parent's consent.&nbsp; When
      applying these conclusions to contraceptive advice and
      treatment it has to be borne in mind that there is much that
      has to be understood by a girl under the age of 16 if she is
      to have legal capacity to consent to such treatment. It is
      not enough that she should understand the nature of the
      advice which is being given: she must also have a sufficient
      maturity to understand what is involved. There are moral and
      family questions, especially her relationship with her
      parents long-term problems associated with the emotional
      impact of pregnancy and its termination and there are the
      risks to health of sexual intercourse at her age, risks which
      contraception may diminish but cannot eliminate. It follows
      that a doctor will have to satisfy himself that she is able
      to appraise these factors before he can safely proceed on the
      basis that she has at law capacity to consent to
      contraceptive treatment. And it further follows that
      ordinarily the proper course will be for him, as the guidance
      lays down, first to seek to persuade the girl to bring her
      parents into consultation, and, if she refuses, not to
      prescribe contraceptive treatment unless he is satisfied that
      her circumstances are such that he ought to proceed without
      parental knowledge and consent.<br />
       Like Woolf J, I find illuminating and helpful the judgment
      of Addy J of the Ontario High Court in <i>Johnston v
      Wellesley Hospital</i> (1970) 17 DLR (3d) 139, a passage from
      which he quotes in his judgment in this case ([1984] 1 All ER
      365 at 374, [1984] QB 581 at 597). The key passage bears
      repetition (17 DLR (3d) 139 at 144--145):</p>

      <blockquote>
        'But, regardless of modern trend, I can find nothing in any
        of the old reported cases, except where infants of tender
        age or young children were involved, where the Courts have
        found that a person under 21 years of age was legally
        incapable of consenting to medical treatment. If a person
        under 21 years were unable to consent to medical treatment,
        he would also be incapable of consenting to other types of
        bodily interference. A proposition purporting to establish
        that any bodily interference acquiesced in by a youth of 20
        years would nevertheless constitute an assault would be
        absurd. If such were the case, sexual intercourse with a
        girl under 21 years would constitute rape. Until the
        minimum age of consent to sexual acts was fixed at 14 years
        by a statute, the Courts often held that infants were
        capable of consenting at a considerably earlier age than 14
        years. I feel that the law on this point is well expressed
        in the volume on Medical Negligence (1957) by Lord Nathan
        (p 176): ''It is suggested that the most satisfactory
        solution of the problem is to rule that an infant who is
        capable of appreciating fully the nature and consequences
        of a particular operation or of particular treatment can
        give an effective consent thereto, and in such cases the
        consent of the guardian is unnecessary but that where the
        infant is without the capacity, any apparent consent by him
        or her will be a nullity, the sole right to consent being
        vested in the guardian.'' '
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">I am, therefore, satisfied that the
      department's guidance can be followed without involving the
      doctor in any infringement of parental right. Unless,
      therefore, to prescribe contraceptive treatment for a girl
      under the age of 16 is either a criminal offence or so close
      to one that to prescribe such treatment is contrary to public
      policy, the department's appeal must succeed.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>The criminal law case</b><br />
       If this case should be made good, the discussion of parental
      right is, of course, an irrelevance. If it be criminal or
      contrary to public policy to prescribe contraception for a
      girl under the age of 16 on the ground that sexual
      intercourse with her is unlawful and a crime on the part of
      her male partner, the fact that her parent knew and consented
      would not make it any less so. I confess that I find the
      submission based on criminality or public policy surprising.
      So far as criminality is concerned, I am happy to rest on the
      judgment of Woolf J, whose approach to the problem I believe
      to be correct. Clearly a doctor who gives a girl
      contraceptive advice or treatment not because in his clinical
      judgment the treatment is medically indicated for the
      maintenance or restoration of her health but with the
      intention of facilitating her having unlawful sexual
      intercourse may well be guilty of a criminal offence. It
      would depend, as my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser
      observes, on the doctor's intention, a conclusion hardly to
      be wondered at in the field of the criminal law. The
      department's guidance avoids the trap of declaring that the
      decision to prescribe the treatment is wholly a matter of the
      doctor's discretion. He may prescribe only if she has the
      capacity to consent or if exceptional circumstances exist
      which justify him in exercising his clinical judgment without
      parental consent. The adjective 'clinical' emphasises that it
      must be a medical judgment based on what he honestly believes
      to be necessary for the physical, mental and emotional health
      of his patient. The bona fide exercise by a doctor of his
      clinical judgment must be a complete negation of the guilty
      mind which is an essential ingredient of the criminal offence
      of aiding and abetting the commission of unlawful sexual
      intercourse.&nbsp; The public policy point fails for the same
      reason. It cannot be said that there is anything necessarily
      contrary to public policy in medical contraceptive treatment
      if it be medically indicated as in the interest of the
      patient's health for the provision of such treatment is
      recognised as legitimate by Parliament: see s 5 of the
      National Health Service Act 1977. If it should be prescribed
      for a girl under 16 the fact that it may eliminate a health
      risk in the event of the girl having unlawful sexual
      intercourse is an irrelevance unless the doctor intends to
      encourage her to have that intercourse. If the prescription
      is the bona fide exercise of his clinical judgment as to what
      is best for his patient's health, he has nothing to fear from
      the criminal law or from any public policy based on the
      criminality of a man having sexual intercourse with
      her.&nbsp; It can be said by way of criticism of this view of
      the law that it will result in uncertainty and leave the law
      in the hands of the doctors. The uncertainty is the price
      which has to be paid to keep the law in line with social
      experience, which is that many girls are fully able to make
      sensible decisions about many matters before they reach the
      age of 16. I accept that great responsibilities will lie on
      the medical profession. It is, however, a learned and highly
      trained profession regulated by statute and governed by a
      strict ethical code which is vigorously enforced. Abuse of
      the power to prescribe contraceptive treatment for girls
      under the age of 16 would render a doctor liable to severe
      professional penalty. The truth may well be that the rights
      of parents and children in this sensitive area are better
      protected by the professional standards of the medical
      profession than by a priori legal lines of division between
      capacity and lack of capacity to consent since any such
      general dividing line is sure to produce in some cases
      injustice, hardship and injury to health. &nbsp; For these
      reasons I would allow the department's appeal, and set aside
      the declaration that the guidance is unlawful. I would add
      that, since the second declaration granted by the Court of
      Appeal, which concerns only the area health authority, was
      based on the same reasoning as the first, it must be held to
      have been wrongly granted. The Court of Appeal's decision to
      grant it should be, in my opinion, overruled as erroneous in
      law.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>JUDGMENT BY-3: LORD BRIDGE OF
      HARWICH</b><br />
      <br />
       <b>JUDGMENT-3:<a id="harwich" name="harwich"></a><br />
       LORD BRIDGE OF HARWICH.</b> My Lords, the prelude to the
      proceedings from which this appeal arises was an exchange of
      correspondence between the present respondent, Mrs Victoria
      Gillick, and her local area health authority in which she
      sought, but failed to obtain, an assurance that in no
      circumstances would any of her daughters when under 16 be
      offered contraceptive advice or treatment. Mrs Gillick now
      has her declaration against the health authority, from which
      it does not appeal. I should suppose that in such a family as
      Mrs Gillick's the possibility of any of her daughters under
      16 seeking to use contraceptives secretly was in any event so
      remote as to make the issue in the proceedings against the
      health authority purely academic. But what prompted the
      correspondence was a memorandum of guidance (to which I will
      refer simply as 'the memorandum' ) on the subject of
      contraceptive advice and treatment for children under 16
      issued to all health authorities by the present appellant,
      the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). The
      terms of the memorandum are set out in full in the speeches
      of my noble and learned friends Lord Fraser and Lord Scarman.
      The memorandum has been declared by the Court of Appeal to be
      contrary to law and it is that declaration that gives rise to
      the only live issue in this appeal. It is against the ethos
      expressed in the memorandum that Mrs Gillick's crusade, as my
      noble and learned friend Lord Templeman aptly calls it, is
      primarily directed.&nbsp; Throughout the hearing of the
      argument in the appeal and in subsequent reflection on the
      questions to which it gives rise I have felt doubt and
      difficulty as to the basis of the jurisdiction which Mrs
      Gillick invokes in her claim to a declaration against the
      DHSS. If the claim is well founded, it must surely lie in the
      field of public rather than private law. Mrs Gillick has no
      private right which she is in a position to assert against
      the DHSS. But the point which troubles me has nothing to do
      with the purely procedural technicality that the proceedings
      were commenced by writ rather than by application for
      judicial review. I agree that no objection has been, nor
      could now be, raised on that ground. My difficulty is more
      fundamental. I ask myself what is the nature of the action or
      decision taken by the DHSS in the exercise of a power
      conferred on it which entitles a court of law to intervene
      and declare that it has stepped beyond the proper limits of
      its power. I frame the question in that way because I believe
      that hitherto, certainly in general terms, the court's
      supervisory jurisdiction over the conduct of administrative
      authorities has been confined to ensuring that their actions
      or decisions were taken within the scope of the power which
      they purported to exercise or conversely to providing a
      remedy for an authority's failure to act or to decide in
      circumstances where some appropriate statutory action or
      decision was called for.&nbsp; Now it is true that the
      Secretary of State for Health and Social Security under s
      5(1)(b) of the National Health Service Act 1977 has a general
      responsibility for the provision within the national health
      service of what may be described shortly as family planning
      services. But only in a very loose sense could the issue of
      the memorandum be considered as part of the discharge of that
      responsibility. The memorandum itself has no statutory force
      whatever. It is not and does not purport to be issued in the
      exercise of any statutory power or in the performance of any
      statutory function. It is purely advisory in character and
      practitioners in the national health service are, as a matter
      of law, in no way bound by it.&nbsp; In the light of these
      considerations I cannot, with all respect, agree that the
      memorandum is open to review on Wednesbury principles (see
      <i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury
      Corp</i> [1947] 2 All ER 680, [1948] 1 KB 223) on the ground
      that it involves an unreasonable exercise of a statutory
      discretion. Such a review must always begin by examining the
      nature of the statutory power which the administrative
      authority whose action is called in question has purported to
      exercise, and asking, in the light of that examination, what
      were, and what were not, relevant considerations for the
      authority to take into account in deciding to exercise that
      power. It is only against such a specific statutory
      background that the question whether the authority has acted
      unreasonably, in the <i>Wednesbury</i> sense, can properly be
      asked and answered. Here there is no specific statutory
      background by reference to which the appropriate Wednesbury
      questions could be formulated.&nbsp; The issue by a
      department of government with administrative responsibility
      in a particular field of non-statutory guidance to
      subordinate authorities operating in the same field is a
      familiar feature of modern administration. The innumerable
      circulars issued over the years by successive departments
      responsible in the field of town and country planning spring
      to mind as presenting a familiar example. The question
      whether the advice tendered in such non-statutory guidance is
      good or bad, reasonable or unreasonable cannot, as a general
      rule, be subject to any form of judicial review. But the
      question arises whether there is any exception to that
      general rule.</p>

      <p class="text1">Your Lordships have been referred to the
      House's decision in <i>Royal College of Nursing of the UK v
      Dept of Health and Social Security</i> [1981] 1 All ER 545,
      [1981] AC 800. The background to that case was exceptional,
      as only becomes fully clear when one reads the judgment of
      Woolf J at first instance (see [1981] 1 All ER 545). The
      Royal College of Nursing (the RCN) and the DHSS had received
      conflicting legal advice whether or not it was lawful, on the
      true construction of certain provisions of the Abortion Act
      1967, for nurses to perform particular functions in the
      course of a novel medical procedure for the termination of
      pregnancy, when acting on the orders and under the general
      supervision of a registered medical practitioner but not
      necessarily in his presence. The RCN had issued a memorandum
      and a later circular to its members to the effect that it was
      not lawful. The DHSS had issued a circular advising that it
      was lawful. The desirability of an authoritative resolution
      of this dispute on a pure question of law was obvious in the
      interests both of the nursing profession and of the public.
      The proceedings took the form of a claim by the RCN against
      the DHSS for a suitable declaration and the DHSS in due
      course counterclaimed a declaration to the opposite effect.
      As Woolf J pointed out, neither side took any point as to the
      jurisdiction of the court to grant a declaration. Woolf J
      himself felt it necessary to raise and examine certain
      questions as to the locus standi of the RCN to bring the
      proceedings and as to the propriety of their form. He
      answered these questions in a favourable sense to enable him
      to decide the disputed question of law on its merits. No
      technical question bearing on jurisdiction attracted any
      mention in the Court of Appeal (see [1981] 1 All ER 545,
      [1981] AC 800) or in this House. In the litigation the
      original conflict between the parties was reflected in a
      conflict of judicial opinion. On a count of judicial heads a
      majority of five to four favoured the RCN. But by a majority
      of three to two in your Lordships' House the DHSS carried the
      day and obtained the declaration it sought.</p>

      <p class="text1">Against this background it would have been
      surprising indeed if the courts had declined jurisdiction.
      But I think it must be recognised that the decision (whether
      or not it was so intended) does effect a significant
      extension of the court's power of judicial review. We must
      now say that if a government department, in a field of
      administration in which it exercises responsibility,
      promulgates in a public document, albeit non-statutory in
      form, advice which is erroneous in law, then the court, in
      proceedings in appropriate form commenced by an applicant or
      plaintiff who possesses the necessary locus standi, has
      jurisdiction to correct the error of law by an appropriate
      declaration. Such an extended jurisdiction is no doubt a
      salutary and indeed a necessary one in certain circumstances,
      as the Royal College of Nursing case itself well illustrates.
      But the occasions of a departmental non-statutory publication
      raising, as in that case, a clearly defined issue of law,
      unclouded by political, social or moral overtones, will be
      rare. In cases where any proposition of law implicit in a
      departmental advisory document is interwoven with questions
      of social and ethical controversy, the court should, in my
      opinion, exercise its jurisdiction with the utmost restraint,
      confine itself to deciding whether the proposition of law is
      erroneous and avoid either expressing ex cathedra opinions in
      areas of social and ethical controversy in which it has no
      claim to speak with authority or proffering answers to
      hypothetical questions of law which do not strictly arise for
      decision.<br />
       My Lords, the memorandum, in expressing the view that in
      exceptional and unusual cases it may be proper for a doctor
      to offer contraceptive advice and treatment to a girl under
      16 without the knowledge or consent of her parent, guardian
      or other person in loco parentis, implies that the law does
      not prohibit the doctor from so acting. The exceptional and
      unusual cases contemplated are clearly not confined to cases
      of children abandoned by their parents and not yet taken into
      care by a local authority or to cases of 'emergency',
      whatever meaning one may give to that word in this context. I
      am content to assume, without deciding, that Mrs Gillick, in
      view of her dispute with the health authority, has sufficient
      locus standi to contest the issue of the lawfulness of the
      memorandum. To succeed in her action against the DHSS she
      must at least establish that, leaving aside cases of
      abandoned children or emergencies, the law does absolutely
      prohibit the prescription of contraception for a girl under
      16 without parental consent or an order of the court.&nbsp;
      The most direct support for that proposition is to be found
      in the opinion of my noble and learned frield Lord Brandon
      that to prescribe contraception for a girl under 16, with or
      without parental consent, is either to aid and abet the
      offence which will be committed by the man with whom she has
      intercourse, or at least so far to facilitate his criminal
      conduct as to be contrary to public policy. I appreciate the
      logical cogency of my noble and learned friend's reasoning,
      but I cannot agree with his conclusion. With reference to the
      possible criminal complicity of the doctor I am content
      gratefully to adopt the relevant passage from the judgment of
      Woolf J (see [1984] 1 All ER 365 at 371--373, [1984] QB 581
      at 593--595), with which I fully agree. On the issue of
      public policy, it seems to me that the policy consideration
      underlying the criminal sanction imposed by statute on men
      who have intercourse with girls under 16 is the protection of
      young girls from the untoward consequences of intercourse.
      Foremost among these must surely be the risk of pregnancy
      leading either to abortion or the birth of a child to an
      immature and irresponsible mother. In circumstances where it
      is apparent that the criminal sanction will not, or is
      unlikely to, afford the necessary protection, it cannot, in
      my opinion, be contrary to public policy to prescribe
      contraception as the only effective means of avoiding a
      wholly undesirable pregnancy. On the facts presented to
      Butler-Sloss J in Re P (a minor) (1981) LGR 301, I think, if
      I may respectfully say so, that she took an eminently
      sensible and entirely proper course.&nbsp; The alternative
      and more extensively argued ground on which Mrs Gillick
      challenges the lawfulness of the memorandum depends on the
      two closely related propositions: (a) that no girl under 16
      can have the capacity in law to give a valid consent to
      submit to contraceptive treatment (b) that the prescription
      of such treatment without parental consent is an unlawful
      invasion of parental rights. Both these propositions are
      comprehensively examined in the speeches of my noble and
      learned friends Lord Fraser and Lord Scarman. I fully agree
      with the reasons expressed by both my noble and learned
      friends for reaching the conclusion that neither proposition
      is well founded in law.&nbsp; Accordingly I would allow the
      appeal of the DHSS to the extent of setting aside the
      declaration made by the Court of Appeal that the memorandum
      was contrary to law.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>DISSENT BY-1: LORD BRANDON OF
      OAKBROOK</b><br />
      <br />
       <b>DISSENT-JDGMT-1:<a id="brandon" name="brandon"></a><br />
       LORD BRANDON OF OAKBROOK.</b> My Lords, in this case your
      Lordships are concerned with the legal aspect of three
      activities relating to the sexual conduct of girls who are
      under the age of 16. The first activity is the giving to such
      girls by professional persons other than doctors (e g social
      workers) of advice about contraception. The second activity
      is the physical examination of such girls by doctors with a
      view to their using one or other form of contraception. The
      third activity is the prescribing for such girls of
      contraceptive treatment, especially that form which is
      commonly called 'the pill'. The question with regard to these
      three activities which has been raised in the two courts
      below, and again in your Lordships' House, is whether such
      activities can be lawfully carried on without the prior
      knowledge and consent of the parents of any girl of the age
      concerned.&nbsp; In my opinion the formulation of the
      question for decision in this way involves the rolling up in
      one composite question of two quite separate and distinct
      points of law. The first point of law is whether the three
      activities to which I have referred can be carried on
      lawfully in any circumstances whatever. If, on the one hand,
      the right answer to the first point of law is No, then no
      second point of law arises for decision. If, on the other
      hand, the answer to the first question is Yes, then a second
      point of law arises, namely whether the three activities
      referred to can only be lawfully carried on with the prior
      knowledge and consent of the parents of the girl concerned.
      The first point of law appears to me to be one of public
      policy, the answer to which is to be gathered from an
      examination of the statutory provisions which Parliament has
      enacted from time to time in relation to men having sexual
      intercourse with girls either under the age of 13 or between
      the ages of 13 and 16. It is, I think, sufficient to begin
      with the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 and then to go on to
      the Sexual Offences Act 1956, by which the former Act was
      repealed and largely replaced.&nbsp; Part I of the 1885 Act,
      which contained ss 2 to 12, had the cross-heading 'Protection
      of Women and Girls'. Sections 4 and 5 provided, so far as
      material:</p>

      <blockquote>
        '4. Any person who unlawfully and carnally knows any girl
        under the age of thirteen years shall be guilty of felony,
        and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the
        discretion of the court to be kept in penal servitude for
        life, or for any term not less than five years, or to be
        imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or
        without hard labour . . .<br />
        <br />
         5. Any person who--(1.) Unlawfully and carnally knows or
        attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any girl
        being of or above the age of thirteen years and under the
        age of sixteen years . . . shall be guilty of a
        misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be liable
        at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any
        term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour .
        . .'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">In <i>R v Tyrrell</i> [1894] 1 QB 710,
      [1891--4] All ER Rep 1215 it was held by the Court for Crown
      Cases Reserved that it was not a criminal offence for a girl
      between the ages of 13 and 16 to aid and abet a man in
      committing, or to incite him to commit, the misdemeanour of
      having carnal knowledge of her contrary to s 5 of the
      Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 set out above. The ground of
      this decision was that the 1885 Act had been passed for the
      purpose of protecting women and girls against themselves: see
      the judgment of Lord Coleridge CJ ([1894] 1 QB 710 at 712,
      [1891--4] All ER Rep 1215 at 1215--1216): The Sexual Offences
      Act 1956 represents the latest pronouncement of Parliament on
      these matters. Sections 5 and 6 provide, so far as
      material:</p>

      <blockquote>
        '5. It is a felony for a man to have unlawful sexual
        intercourse with a girl under the age of thirteen.<br />
        <br />
         6.--(1) It is an offence . . . for a man to have unlawful
        sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen . .
        .'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Further, by s 37 and Sch 2, the maximum
      punishment for an offence under s 5 is imprisonment for life,
      and that for an offence under s 6 imprisonment for two years.
      Since the passing of the 1956 Act the distinction between
      felonies and misdemeanours has been abolished. For the
      purposes of this case, however, nothing turns on this change
      of terminology.</p>

      <p class="text1">My Lords, the inescapable inference from the
      statutory provisions of the 1885 and 1956 Acts to which I
      have referred is that Parliament has for the past century
      regarded, and still regards today, sexual intercourse between
      a man and a girl under 16 as a serious criminal offence so
      far as the man who has such intercourse is concerned. So far
      as the girl is concerned, she does not commit any criminal
      offence, even if she aids, abets or incites the having of
      such intercourse. The reason for this, as explained earlier,
      is that the relevant statutory provisions have been enacted
      by Parliament for the purpose of protecting the girl from
      herself. The having of such intercourse is, however,
      unlawful, and the circumstance that the man is guilty of a
      criminal offence, while the girl is not, cannot alter that
      situation.&nbsp; On the footing that the having of sexual
      intercourse by a man with a girl under 16 is an unlawful act,
      it follows necessarily that for any person to promote,
      encourage or facilitate the commission of such an act may
      itself be a criminal offence, and must, in any event, be
      contrary to public policy. Nor can it make any difference
      that the person who promotes, encourages or facilitates the
      commission of such an act is a parent or a doctor or a social
      worker.&nbsp; The question then arises whether the three
      activities to which I referred earlier should properly be
      regarded as, directly or indirectly, promoting, encouraging
      or facilitating the having, contrary to public policy, of
      sexual intercourse between a man and a girl under 16. In my
      opinion there can be only one answer to this question, namely
      that to give such a girl advice about contraception, to
      examine her with a view to her using one or more forms of
      protection and finally to prescribe contraceptive treatment
      for her, necessarily involves promoting, encouraging or
      facilitating the having of sexual intercourse, contrary to
      public policy, by that girl with a man. The inhibitions
      against the having of sexual intercourse between a man and a
      girl under 16 are primarily twofold. So far as the man is
      concerned there is the inhibition of the criminal law as
      contained in ss 5 and 6 of the 1956 Act. So far as both are
      concerned there is the inhibition arising from the risk of an
      unwanted pregnancy. To give the girl contraceptive treatment,
      following appropriate advice and examination, is to remove
      largely the second of these two inhibitions. Such removal
      must involve promoting, encouraging or facilitating the
      having of sexual intercourse between the girl and the
      man.</p>

      <p class="text1">It has been argued that some girls under 16
      will have sexual intercourse with a man whether contraceptive
      treatment is made available to them or not, and that the
      provision of such treatment does not, therefore, promote,
      encourage or facilitate the having of such intercourse. In my
      opinion this argument should be rejected for two quite
      separate reasons. The first reason is that the mere fact that
      a girl under 16 seeks contraceptive advice and treatment,
      whether of her own accord or at the suggestion of others,
      itself indicates that she, and probably also the man with
      whom she is having, or contemplating having, sexual
      intercourse, are conscious of the inhibition arising from the
      risk of an unwanted pregnancy. They are conscious of it and
      are more likely to indulge their desires if it can be
      removed. The second reason is that, if all a girl under 16
      needs to do in order to obtain contraceptive treatment is to
      threaten that she will go ahead with, or continue, unlawful
      sexual intercourse with a man unless she is given such
      treatment, a situation tantamount to blackmail will arise
      which no legal system ought to tolerate. The only answer
      which the law should give to such a threat is, 'Wait till you
      are 16.' The DHSS has contended that s 5(1) of the National
      Health Service Act 1977 imposes on it a statutory duty to
      carry out, in relation to girls under 16 as well as to older
      girls or women, the three activities to which I referred
      earlier. That provision reads:</p>

      <blockquote>
        'It is the Secretary of State's duty . . . (b) to arrange,
        to such extent as he considers necessary to meet all
        reasonable requirements in England and Wales, for the
        giving of advice on contraception, the medical examination
        of persons seeking advice on contraception, the treatment
        of such persons and the supply of contraceptive substances
        and appliances.'
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">This provision does not define the 'persons'
      who are the subject matter of it, nor is there any definition
      of that expresssion anywhere else in the Act. In these
      circumstances it seems to me that a court, in interpreting
      the provision, must do so in a way which conforms with
      considerations of public policy rather than in a way which
      conflicts with them. For the reasons which I have given
      earlier, I am of the opinion that, in the case of girls under
      16, the giving of advice about contraception medical
      examination with a view to the use of one or other form of
      contraception, and the prescribing of contraceptive treatment
      are all contrary to public policy. It follows that I would
      interpret the expression 'persons' in s 5(1)(b) above as not
      including girls under 16. Alternatively, I would say that the
      expression 'all reasonable requirements', which occurs
      earlier in the provision, cannot be interpreted as including
      the requirements of a girl under 16 which, if satisfied, will
      promote, encourage or facilitate unlawful acts of sexual
      intercourse between a man and her.</p>

      <p class="text1">My Lords, reference was made in the course
      of the argument before you to a decision of Butler-Sloss J in
      <i>Re P</i> (a minor) (1981) LGR 301. In that case the judge,
      in wardship proceedings, ordered that a girl of 15, who had
      been pregnant for the second time and was in the care of a
      local authority, should be fitted with a contraceptive
      appliance because it appeared that it was impossible for the
      local authority, in whose care she was, to control her sexual
      conduct. It was contended that this decision was authority
      for the proposition that, in wardship proceedings at any
      rate, an order could lawfully be made for the supply and
      fitting of a contraceptive appliance to a girl under 16.</p>

      <p class="text1">I do not know what arguments were or were
      not addressed to Butler-Sloss J in that case, and it is, in
      any event, unnecessary for your Lordships to decide in these
      proceedings the limits of the powers of a court exercising
      wardship jurisdiction. As at present advised, however, I am
      of opinion, with great respect to Butler-Sloss J, that the
      order which she made was not one which she could lawfully
      make. My Lords, great play was made in the argument before
      you of the disastrous consequences for a girl under 16 of
      becoming pregnant as a result of her willingly having
      unlawful sexual intercourse with a man. I am fully conscious
      of these considerations, but I do not consider that, if the
      views which I have so far expressed are right in law, those
      considerations can alter the position. &nbsp; It is sometimes
      said that the age of consent for girls is presently 16. This
      is, however, an inaccurate way of putting the matter, since,
      if a man has sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 without
      her consent, the crime which he thereby commits is that of
      rape. The right way to put the matter is that 16 is the age
      of a girl below which a man cannot lawfully have sexual
      intercourse with her. It was open to Parliament in 1956, when
      the Sexual Offences Act of that year was passed, and it has
      remained open to Parliament throughout the 29 years which
      have since elapsed, to pass legislation providing for some
      lower age than 16, if it thought fit to do so. Parliament has
      not thought fit to do so, and I do not consider that it would
      be right for your Lordships' House, by holding that girls
      under 16 can lawfully be provided with contraceptive
      facilities, to undermine or circumvent the criminal law which
      Parliament has enacted. The criminal law and the civil law
      should, as it seems to me, march hand in hand on all issues,
      including that raised in this case, and to allow
      inconsistency or contradiction between them would, in my
      view, serve only to discredit the rule of law as a
      whole.&nbsp; Since I am of opinion that the first question
      which I posed earlier, namely whether the provision of
      contraceptive facilities to girls under 16 was lawful in any
      circumstances at all, should be answered in the negative, the
      second question which I posed, relating to the need for prior
      parental knowledge and consent, does not arise. This is
      because, on the view which I take of the law, making
      contraception available to girls under 16 is unlawful,
      whether their parents know of and consent to it or not.</p>

      <p class="text1">My Lords, it remains for me to indicate what
      order I consider that the House should make on this appeal.
      With regard to the first declaration made by the Court of
      Appeal, I would uphold it, albeit on grounds wider than those
      on which it was founded in that court. With regard to the
      second declaration, there is no appeal against it and I would
      uphold it also, although, for the reasons which I have given,
      I regard the four lines which follow the words 'the age of
      16' (namely 'without the prior knowledge and/or consent of
      the said child's parent or guardian save in cases of
      emergency or with the leave of the Court') as surplusage.</p>

      <p class="text1">In the result, I would dismiss the appeal of
      the DHSS with costs.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>DISSENT BY-2: LORD TEMPLEMAN</b></p>

      <p class="text1"><a id="templeman" name="templeman"></a>
      <b>DISSENT-JDGMT-2:<br />
       LORD TEMPLEMAN.</b> My Lords, this appeal involves
      consideration of the independence of a teenager, the powers
      of a parent and the duties of a doctor. The question is: who
      has the right to decide whether an unmarried girl under the
      age of 16 may practice contraception? An unmarried girl under
      the age of 16 does not, in my opinion, possess the power in
      law to decide for herself to practise contraception. Section
      6 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 makes it an offence for a
      man to have unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the
      age of 16. Consent by the girl does not afford a defence to
      the man or constitute an offence by the girl. Parliament has
      thus indicated that an unmarried girl under the age of 16 is
      not sufficiently mature to be allowed to decide for herself
      that she will take part in sexual intercourse. Such a girl
      cannot therefore be regarded as sufficiently mature to be
      allowed to decide for herself that she will practise
      contraception for the purpose of frequent or regular or
      casual sexual intercourse. Section 6 of the Sexual Offences
      Act 1956 does not, however, in my view, prevent parent and
      doctor from deciding that contraceptive facilities shall be
      made available to an unmarried girl under the age of 16 whose
      sexual activities are recognised to be uncontrolled and
      uncontrollable. Section 6 is designed to protect the girl
      from sexual intercourse. But if the girl cannot be deterred
      then contraceptive facilities may be provided, not for the
      purpose of aiding and abetting an offence under s 6 but for
      the purpose of avoiding the consequences, principally
      pregnancy, which the girl may suffer from illegal sexual
      intercourse where sexual intercourse cannot be prevented. In
      general, where parent and doctor agree that any form of
      treatment, including contraceptive treatment, is in the best
      interests of the girl, there is, in my opinion, no legal bar
      to that treatment.&nbsp; Difficulties arise when parent and
      doctor differ. The parent, claiming the right to decide what
      is in the best interests of a girl in the custody of that
      parent, may forbid the provision of contraceptive facilities.
      A doctor, claiming the right to decide what is in the best
      interests of a patient, may wish to override the parent's
      objections. A conflict which is express may be resolved by
      the court, which may accept the view of either parent or
      doctor or modify the views of both of them as to what is in
      the best interests of the girl. The present appeal is
      concerned with a conflict which is known to the doctor but is
      concealed from the parent and from the court. The girl, aware
      that the parent will forbid contraception, requests the
      doctor to provide and the doctor agrees to provide
      contraceptive facilities and to keep the parent in ignorance.
      A parent is the natural and legal guardian of an infant under
      the age of 18 and is responsible for the upbringing of an
      infant who is in the custody of that parent. The practical
      exercise of parental powers varies from control and
      supervision to guidance and advice depending on the
      discipline enforced by the parent and the age and temperament
      of the infant. Parental power must be exercised in the best
      interests of the infant and the court may intervene in the
      interests of the infant at the behest of the parent or at the
      behest of a third party. The court may enforce parental
      right, control the misuse of parental power or uphold
      independent views asserted by the infant. The court will be
      guided by the principle that the welfare of the infant is
      paramount. But, subject to the discretion of the court to
      differ from the views of the parent, the court will, in my
      opinion, uphold the right of the parent having custody of the
      infant to decide on behalf of the infant all matters which
      the infant is not competent to decide. The prudent parent
      will pay attention to the wishes of the infant and will
      normally accept them as the infant approaches adulthood. The
      parent is not bound by the infant's wishes, but an infant
      approaching adulthood may be able to flout the wishes of the
      parent with ease.&nbsp; A doctor tenders advice and offers
      treatment which the doctor considers to be in the best
      interests of the patient. A patient is free to reject the
      advice and refuse the treatment: see <i>Sidaway v Bethlem
      Royal Hospital Governors</i> [1985] 1 All ER 643 at 665,
      [1985] 2 WLR 480 at 508. Where the patient is an infant, the
      medical profession accept that a parent having custody and
      being responsible for the infant is entitled on behalf of the
      infant to consent to or reject treatment if the parent
      considers that the best interests of the infant so require.
      Where doctor and parent disagree, the court can decide and is
      not slow to act. I accept that if there is no time to obtain
      a decision from the court, a doctor may safely carry out
      treatment in an emergency if the doctor believes the
      treatment to be vital to the survival or health of an infant
      and notwithstanding the opposition of a parent or the
      impossibility of alerting the parent before the treatment is
      carried out. In such a case the doctor must have the courage
      of his convictions that the treatment is necessary and urgent
      in the interests of the patient and the court will, if
      necessary, approve after the event treatment which the court
      would have authorised in advance, even if the treatment
      proves to be unsuccessful.&nbsp; I accept also that a doctor
      may lawfully carry out some forms of treatment with the
      consent of an infant patient and against the opposition of a
      parent based on religious or any other grounds. The effect of
      the consent of the infant depends on the nature of the
      treatment and the age and understanding of the infant. For
      example, a doctor with the consent of an intelligent boy or
      girl of 15 could in my opinion safely remove tonsils or a
      troublesome appendix. But any decision on the part of a girl
      to practise sex and contraception requires not only knowledge
      of the facts of life and of the dangers of pregnancy and
      disease but also an understanding of the emotional and other
      consequences to her family, her male partner and to herself.
      I doubt whether a girl under the age of 16 is capable of a
      balanced judgment to embark on frequent, regular or casual
      sexual intercourse fortified by the illusion that medical
      science can protect her in mind and body and ignoring the
      danger of leaping from childhood to adulthood without the
      difficult formative transitional experiences of adolescence.
      There are many things which a girl under 16 needs to practise
      but sex is not one of them. Parliament could declare this
      view to be out of date. But in my opinion the statutory
      provisions discussed in the speech of noble and learned
      friend Lord Fraser and the provisions of s 6 of the Sexual
      Offences Act 1956 indicate that as the law now stands an
      unmarried girl under 16 is not competent to decided to
      practise sex and contraception. In the present case it is
      submitted that a doctor may lawfully make a decision on
      behalf of the girl and in so doing may overrule or ignore the
      parent who has custody of the girl. It is submitted that a
      doctor may at the request of a girl under 16 provide
      contraceptive facilities against the known or assumed wishes
      of the parent and on terms that the parent shall be kept in
      ignorance of the treatment. The justification is advanced
      that, if the girl's request is not met, the girl may persist
      in sexual intercourse and run the risk of pregnancy. It is
      not in the interests of a girl under 16 to become pregnant
      and therefore the doctor may, in her interests,
      confidentially provide contraceptive facilities unless the
      doctor can persuade the girl to abstain from sexual
      intercourse or can persuade her to ensure that precautions
      are taken by the male participant. The doctor is not bound to
      provide contraceptive facilities but, it is said, is entitled
      to do so in the best interests of the girl. The girl must be
      assured that the doctor will be pledged to secrecy otherwise
      the girl may not seek advice or treatment but will run all
      the risks of disease and pregnancy involved in sexual
      activities without adequate knowledge or mature consideration
      and preparation. The Department of Health and Social Security
      (DHSS) memorandum instructs a doctor to seek to persuade the
      girl to involve the parent but concludes that 'the decision
      whether or not to prescribe contraception must be for the
      clinical judgment of a doctor'.&nbsp; There are several
      objections to this approach. The first objection is that a
      doctor, acting without the views of the parent, cannot form a
      'clinical' or any other reliable judgment that the best
      interests of the girl require the provision of contraceptive
      facilities. The doctor at the family planning clinic only
      knows that which the girl chooses to tell him. The family
      doctor may know some of the circumstances of some of the
      families who form his registered patients but his information
      may be incomplete or misleading. The doctor who provides
      contraceptive facilities without the knowledge of the parent
      deprives the parent of the opportunity to protect the girl
      from sexual intercourse by persuading and helping her to
      avoid sexual intercourse or by the exercise of parental power
      which may prevent sexual intercourse. The parent might be
      able to bring pressure on a male participant to desist from
      the commission of the offence of sexual intercourse with a
      girl under 16. The parent might be able and willing to
      exercise parental power by removing the family or the girl to
      a different neighbourhood and environment and away from the
      danger of sexual intercourse.&nbsp; The second objection is
      that a parent will sooner or later find out the truth,
      probably sooner, and may do so in circumstances which bring
      about a complete rupture of good relations between members of
      the family and between the family and the doctor. It is
      inevitable that, when the parent discovers that the girl is
      practising sexual intercourse, the girl will in
      self-justification and in an attempt to reassure the parent
      reveal that she is relying on contraceptive facilities
      provided by the doctor in order to avoid pregnancy. The girl
      and the doctor will be the loser by this revelation.&nbsp;
      The third and main objection advanced on behalf of the
      respondent parent, Mrs Gillick, in this appeal is that the
      secret provision of contraceptive facilities for a girl under
      16 will, it is said, encourage participation by the girl in
      sexual intercourse and this practice offends basic principles
      of morality and religion which ought not to be sabotaged in
      stealth by kind permission of the national health service.
      The interests of a girl under 16 require her to be protected
      against sexual intercourse. Such a girl is not sufficiently
      mature to be allowed to decide to flout the accepted rules of
      society. The pornographic press and the lascivious film may
      falsely pretend that sexual intercourse is a form of
      entertainment available to females on request and to males on
      demand but the regular, frequent or casual practice of sexual
      intercourse by a girl or a boy under the age of 16 cannot be
      beneficial to anybody and may cause harm to character and
      personality. Before a girl under 16 is supplied with
      contraceptive facilities, the parent who knows most about the
      girl and ought to have the most influence with the girl is
      entitled to exercise parental rights of control, supervision,
      guidance and advice in order that the girl may, if possible,
      avoid sexual intercourse until she is older. Contraception
      should only be considered if and when the combined efforts of
      parent and doctor fail to prevent the girl from participating
      in sexual intercourse and there remains only the possibility
      of protecting the girl against pregnancy resulting from
      sexual intercourse. These arguments have provoked great
      controversy which is not legal in character. Some doctors
      approve and some doctors disapprove of the idea that a doctor
      may decide to provide contraception for a girl under 16
      without the knowledge of the parent. Some parents agree and
      some parents disagree with the proposition that the decision
      must depend on the judgment of the doctor. Those who favour
      doctor power assert that the failure to provide confidential
      contraceptive treatment will lead to an increase in
      pregnancies amongst girls under 16. As a general proposition,
      this assertion is not supported by evidence in this case, is
      not susceptible to proof and in my opinion is of doubtful
      validity. Availability of confidential contraceptive
      treatment may increase the demand for such treatment.
      Contraceptive treatment for females usually requires daily
      discipline in order to be effective and girls under 16
      frequently lack that discipline. The total number of
      pregnancies amongst girls of under 16 may, therefore, be
      increased and not decreased by the availability of
      contraceptive treatment. But there is no doubt that an
      individual girl who is denied the opportunity of confidential
      contraceptive treatment may invite or succumb to sexual
      intercourse and thereby become pregnant. Those who favour
      parental power assert that the availability of confidential
      contraceptive treatment will increase sexual activity by
      girls under 16. This argument is also not supported by
      evidence in the present case and is not susceptible to proof.
      But it is clear that contraception removes or gives an
      illusion of removing the possibility of pregnancy and
      therefore removes restraint on sexual intercourse. Some girls
      would come under pressure if contraceptive facilities were
      known to be available and some girls under 16 are susceptible
      to male domination. Parliament could decide whether it is
      better to have more contraception with the possibility of
      fewer pregnancies and less disease or whether it is better to
      have less contraception with the possibility of reduced
      sexual activity by girls under 16. Parliament could ensure
      that the doctor prevailed over the parent by reducing the age
      of consent or by expressly authorising a doctor to provide
      contraceptive facilities for any girl without informing the
      parent, provided the doctor considered that his actions were
      for the benefit of the girl. Parliament could, on the other
      hand, ensure that the parent prevailed over the doctor by
      forbidding contraceptive treatment for a girl under 16 save
      by or on the recommendation of the girl's general medical
      practitioner and with the consent of the parent who has
      registered the girl as a patient of that general
      practitioner. Some girls, it is said, might pretend to be
      over 16 but a doctor in doubt could always require
      confirmation from the girl's registered medical practitioner.
      &nbsp; This appeal falls to be determined by the existing
      law. No authority has been cited which prevents an infant
      from seeking medical or any other advice or which forbids a
      doctor to advise an infant who has not been tendered by the
      parent as a patient. No authority compels a doctor to
      disclose to a parent, otherwise than in the course of
      litigation, any information obtained as a result of a
      conversation between the doctor and the infant. On the other
      hand, in my opinion, confidentiality owed to an infant is not
      breached by disclosure to a parent responsible for that
      infant if the doctor considers that such disclosure is
      necessary in the interests of the infant. A doctor who gave a
      pledge to a girl under 16 that he would not disclose the fact
      or content of a conversation would no doubt honour that
      pledge, but the doctor ought to hesitate before committing
      himself. A doctor who gave an unconditional pledge of
      confidentiality to a girl under 16 would, for example, be in
      a difficult position if the girl then disclosed information
      which made the doctor suspect that she was being introduced
      to sexual intercourse by a man who was also introducing her
      to drugs.&nbsp; Although a doctor is entitled to give
      confidential advice to an infant, the law will, in my
      opinion, uphold the right of a parent to make a decision
      which the infant is not competent to make. The decision to
      authorise and accept medical examination and treatment for
      contraception is a decision which a girl under 16 is not
      competent to make. In my opinion a doctor may not lawfully
      provide a girl under 16 with contraceptive facilities without
      the approval of the parent responsible for the girl save
      pursuant to a court order, or in the case of emergency or in
      exceptional cases where the parent has abandoned or forfeited
      by abuse the right to be consulted. Parental rights cannot be
      insisted on by a parent who is not responsible for the
      custody and upbringing of an infant or where the parent has
      abandoned or abused parental rights. And a doctor is not
      obliged to give effect to parental rights in an emergency. A
      girl under 16 is usually living with a parent and is usually
      attending school. It is sufficient for the doctor to obtain
      the consent of the parent or guardian with whom the girl is
      living. It seems to me to be contrary to law and offensive to
      professional standards that a doctor should provide
      contraceptive facilities against the known or presumed wishes
      of such a parent and that the doctor should conspire with the
      girl to keep the parent in ignorance of the fact that the
      girl intends to participate in frequent, regular or casual
      sexual intercourse in the belief that the only bar to sexual
      intercourse is the risk of pregnancy and in complacent
      reliance on the doctor's contraceptive facilities to obviate
      that risk.&nbsp; But parental rights may have been abandoned.
      If the doctor discovers, for example, that the girl is not
      living with a parent but has been allowed to live in an
      environment in which the danger of sexual intercourse is
      pressing, the doctor may lawfully provide facilities for
      contraception until the parent has been alerted to the danger
      and has been afforded the opportunity to reassert parental
      rights and to protect the girl by means other than
      contraception. The court will uphold the doctor's actions if
      the doctor reasonably believes that parental rights have, for
      the time being at any rate, been abandoned. Parental rights
      may have been abused. The dangers of sexual intercourse may
      emanate from the girl's home. The doctor would be entitled to
      provide the girl with contraceptive facilities but would then
      be bound to consider whether the local welfare authorities
      should be alerted to the possibility that the girl is in need
      of care and protection. Again, the doctor may be satisfied
      that the parent is a brute and that the girl has been driven
      to seek solace outside the family. The doctor might decide
      that it was necessary to provide contraceptive facilities for
      the girl without informing the parent but the doctor would be
      bound to consider the possible consequences if the parent,
      known to be brutal, discovered the truth.</p>

      <p class="text1">The doctor may also be faced with
      circumstances which could properly be described as a medical
      emergency. The doctor may decide that the girl is unable to
      control her sexual appetite or is acting under an influence
      which cannot be counteracted immediately. The doctor would be
      entitled to provide contraceptive facilities as a temporary
      measure but would, in my opinion, be bound to inform the
      parent. A subsequent decision to continue contraceptive
      treatment would be open to the doctor and the parent acting
      jointly in default of agreement between them, the welfare
      authority or the court could be asked to intervene.&nbsp;
      There may be other exceptional circumstances and emergencies
      which would impel the doctor to provide contraceptive
      facilities without the prior consent of the parent but in
      most cases the doctor would be bound to inform the parent as
      soon as possible in order that the parent might have the
      opportunity of exercising parental rights in such manner as
      to deter or prevent the girl from indulging in sexual
      intercourse. &nbsp; The position seems to me to be as
      follows. A doctor is not entitled to decide whether a girl
      under the age of 16 shall be provided with contraceptive
      facilities if a parent who is in charge of the girl is ready
      and willing to make that decision in exercise of parental
      rights. The doctor is entitled in exceptional circumstances
      and in emergencies to make provision, normally temporary
      provision, for contraception but in most cases would be bound
      to inform the parent of the treatment. The court would not
      hold the doctor liable for providing contraceptive facilities
      if the doctor had reasonable grounds for believing that the
      parent had abandoned or abused parental rights or that there
      was no parent immediately available for consultation or that
      there was no parent who was responsible for the girl. But
      exceptional circumstances and emergencies cannot be expanded
      into a general discretion for the doctor to provide
      contraceptive facilities without the knowledge of the parent
      because of the possibility that a girl to whom contraceptive
      facilities are not available may irresponsibly court the risk
      of pregnancy. Such a discretion would enable any girl to
      obtain contraception on request by threatening to sleep with
      a man.&nbsp; In the present state of the law the DHSS
      memorandum appears to me to be defective. The principal
      defect lies in the assertion that 'the decision whether or
      not to prescribe contraception must be for the clinical
      judgment of a doctor'. In my opinion a decision by a doctor
      to provide contraceptive facilities for an unmarried girl of
      16 against the known or presumed wishes of a parent who has
      custody of the girl and without the knowledge of the parent
      would constitute an unlawful interference with the rights of
      the parent, subject to the intervention of the court, to make
      that decision on behalf of the girl and an unlawful
      interference with the right of the parent to influence the
      conduct of the girl by the exercise of parental powers of
      control, guidance and advice.&nbsp; There are two further
      defects. The memorandum asserts 'that consultations between
      doctors and patients are confidential' without making any
      distinction between adult patients and infant patients. The
      memorandum also suggests that doctors should consider
      providing contraceptive facilities without the knowledge of
      the parent where 'parents are, for example, unconcerned,
      entirely unresponsive or grossly disturbed'. Of course a
      doctor must protect a girl against a parent who is grossly
      disturbed although the doctor must also consider the possible
      consequences if such a parent discovers that the daughter has
      been practising sexual intercourse with the ostensible
      approval of the doctor manifested by the secret supply of
      contraceptives. And if it is plain that the parent is
      'unconcerned' in the sense that parental control has been
      abandoned, then the provision of contraceptive facilities
      without the prior knowledge of the parent would be lawful.
      But any girl who is anxious to practise sexual intercourse
      may plausibly represent that the parent is 'entirely
      unresponsive'. On behalf of Mrs Gillick it was urged with
      some force that the practical effect of the memorandum
      couched in this opaque language was to enable an
      inexperienced doctor in a family planning clinic, exuding
      sympathy and veiled in ignorance of the girl's personality
      and history, to provide contraceptives as if they were sweets
      withheld from a deprived child by an unfeeling parent and
      that any parent who was concerned with the girl's immortal
      soul or with moral or religious principles might be said to
      be 'entirely unresponsive' to a proposal that an unmarried
      girl under the age of 16 should be provided with
      contraceptives. As the memorandum now stands, a 'clinical
      judgment' by the doctor may amount to no more than a belief
      that a parent will not consent to contraception and a fear
      that the girl may practise sex without contraception.</p>

      <p class="text1">These defects in the memorandum constitute
      in my opinion a mistake of law on the part of the DHSS. The
      memorandum assumes and asserts that the doctor is entitled by
      himself to decide whether an unmarried girl under the age of
      16 shall be provided with contraceptive facilities and that
      the doctor is entitled to conceal that decision from the
      parent. In my opinion the decision cannot lawfully be made
      without the consent of the parent in charge of the girl
      unless the parent has abandoned or abused parental powers or
      is not available. If the memorandum is defective by reason of
      a mistake of law and if, in consequence, a doctor making a
      decision in reliance on the views expressed in the memorandum
      may unlawfully interfere with the rights of a parent and make
      and act on a decision which the doctor is in law not entitled
      to make, then in my opinion the DHSS, which is responsible
      for the memorandum, is amenable to the remedies of judicial
      review. It matters not whether the memorandum constitutes an
      order or guidance or advice or a mere expression of views
      directed to the medical profession or directed to doctors who
      are engaged in the national health service. This issue is not
      whether the DHSS is exercising a statutory decretion in a
      reasonable way but whether by mistake of law the DHSS, a
      public authority, purports by the memorandum to authorise or
      approve an unlawful interference with parental rights. In
      this respect I gratefully acknowledge and accept the
      observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Bridge and
      his warning against the involvement of the courts in areas of
      social and ethical controversy or hypothetical questions.
      Nevertheless the questions raised by this appeal must now be
      answered and, differing from a majority of your Lordships, I
      consider that Mrs Gillick has succeeded in her crusade and is
      entitled in judicial review proceedings to a declaration that
      the memorandum is unlawful in so far as it purports to
      authorise or approve of the provision of contraceptive
      facilities for an unmarried girl under the age of 16 without
      the knowledge of a parent who holds custody of the girl and
      has not abandoned or abused the parental right to decide
      whether such facilities shall be provided. The danger that
      other parents or individuals may exploit judicial review
      proceedings by referring social problems to the courts or by
      seeking general pronouncements of law based on hypothetical
      facts can be averted by the exercise of the judicial
      discretion to refuse leave to prosecute judicial review
      proceedings. In the present case the proceedings are not in
      form judicial review proceedings but at this stage the
      technicality can be ignored because the legal issues raised
      in these proceedings cannot be allowed to remain unanswered.
      I would therefore grant the relief I have indicated in
      substitution for the declarations made by the Court of Appeal
      and I would order Mrs Gillick's costs to be paid by the DHSS.
      My Lords, in this appeal social issues are entangled with
      legal issues. In my view the law is consistent with social
