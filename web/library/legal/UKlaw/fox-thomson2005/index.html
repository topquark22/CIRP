          <p>This article offers a critique of the recently revised
          BMA guidance on routine neonatal male circumcision and
          seeks to challenge the assumptions underpinning the
          guidance which construe this procedure as a matter of
          parental choice. Our aim is to problematise continued
          professional willingness to tolerate the non-therapeutic,
          non-consensual excision of healthy tissue, arguing that
          in this context both professional guidance and law are
          uncharacteristically tolerant of risks inflicted on young
          children, given the absence of clear medical benefits. By
          interrogating historical medical explanations for this
          practice, which continue to surface in contemporary
          justifications of non-consensual male circumcision, we
          demonstrate how circumcision has long existed as a
          procedure in need of a justification. We conclude that it
          is ethically inappropriate to subject children&mdash;male
          or female&mdash;to the acknowledged risks of circumcision
          and contend that there is no compelling legal authority
          for the common view that male circumcision is lawful.</p>

      <p><span class="c3"><b>I</b></span>n recognition of the
      growing controversy surrounding neonatal male circumcision,
      the British Medical Association&rsquo;s Medical Ethics
      Committee released new guidance for doctors in 2003.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This is the first professional
      pronouncement in the UK since the General Medical
      Council&rsquo;s guidance in 1997.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Upon its publication, the <i>Journal
      of Medical Ethics</i> published the BMA&rsquo;s advice along
      with two, quite starkly opposing, commentaries.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> This
      article offers a brief assessment of the BMA&rsquo;s response
      to the practice of neonatal circumcision, and suggests that
      certain assumptions underpinning it need to be questioned. In
      particular, we challenge the legal position represented in
      the BMA guidance, arguing that the legality of the practice
      is much less certain than they acknowledge.</p>

      <p class="2">Our focus is on the harm/benefit assessment
      which lies at the heart of the male circumcision debate and
      is central both to the revised guidance and to ethical debate
      on the issue. Specifically, we are concerned to problematise
      the continuing professional willingness to tolerate the
      non-therapeutic, nonconsensual excision of healthy tissue. We
      suggest that infant male circumcision is characterised by an
      acceptance of levels of risk unimaginable in other health
      care contexts. In seeking to account for the permissive
      medicolegal attitude to this practice we argue that it is
      grounded in particular understandings of the male infant
      body. We see two (related) issues as central to the debates.
      First, we examine how risk to the infant male body is
      understood and managed within the debates, and secondly how
      this informs the way in which male circumcision is
      constructed in opposition to female genital modification. The
      infant male body is conferred with particular qualities that
      inform and limit the nature of the debate, and the way in
      which law approaches it.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>The guidance&mdash;an
      overview</b></span><br />
       The guidance that the BMA offers is in many respects
      welcome, and brings the UK position into line with recent
      revisions in other common law jurisdictions.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Thus, it stresses that circumcision is
      rarely clinically indicated and that &lsquo;&lsquo;doctors
      should be aware of this and reassure parents
      accordingly&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 3).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Perhaps more importantly, it states
      that non-therapeutic circumcision should be performed only
      when it is demonstrably in the best interests of the child.
      The responsibility to show this falls to his parents.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Additionally, the guidance provides
      principles of good practice, although most of these should
      already be familiar to anyone working professionally with
      children.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Thus, they note the
      paramountcy of child welfare and the need to act in the
      child&rsquo;s best interests; the need for consent (from
      either parent where the procedure is therapeutic and from
      both where the procedure is non-therapeutic&mdash;see below);
      the importance of including the child in the decision making
      process where possible; and the circumstances where court
      referral would be appropriate. It is recognised that good
      practice also demands accurate and contemporaneous record
      keeping in relation to the discussion, consent, the
      procedure, and aftercare given.</p>

      <p class="2">Yet, the BMA&rsquo;s position is not
      unproblematic. While reflecting shifts that have occurred in
      the development of children&rsquo;s rights and evidence-based
      medicine, it nevertheless largely condones current practice,
      so that a parental request motivated by social, cultural, or
      religious justification is likely to validate non-therapeutic
      male circumcision. In this article we argue that the BMA is
      able to sanction such requests only because it assumes a
      particular understanding of the male child&rsquo;s body, an
      understanding shared by law. Before exploring this, it is
      worth briefly to outline the origins of non-therapeutic,
      non-religious practice, and to examine the justifications for
      it.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>Origins</b></span><br />
       Although a full history of the emergence and subsequent
      development of circumcision within medicine is beyond the
      scope of this article, an outline of the evolution of the
      practice offers an important context to the current debate.
      The BMA guidance makes limited note of the problematic
      history of medical practice in this area. It recognises, for
      instance, the significant misdiagnosis and mistreatment of
      phimosis, an abnormal tightening of the foreskin that limits
      normal function. As the guidance notes: &lsquo;&lsquo;Male
      circumcision in cases where there is a clear clinical need is
      not normally controversial. Nevertheless, normal anatomical
      and physiological characteristics of the infant foreskin have
      in the past been misinterpreted as being
      abnormal&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 2).<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      We would contend that the troubled history of medical
      practice in this area merits fuller recognition.</p>

      <p class="2">The emergence of clinical circumcision owes much
      to the work of the eminent American orthopaedic surgeon Dr
      John Lewis A Sayre. Sayre&rsquo;s first case involved the
      treatment of a 5-year-old for partial paralysis. In 1870, and
      following a number of further successful operations, he
      informed his colleagues that circumcision was the answer to a
      range of ailments: &lsquo;&lsquo;Many of the cases of
      irritable children, with restless sleep, and bad digestion,
      which are often attributed to worms, is [sic] solely due to
      the irritation of the nervous system caused by an adherent or
      constricted prepuce&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 210).<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> This marked the beginning of the rise
      and rise of phimosis, an ill-defined and fluid
      pathology,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> and the recoding of
      the foreskin as pathological. Beyond the ailments of
      children, circumcision came to be seen as a cure for more
      problematic and elusive illnesses, as Geoffrey Miller
      notes:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Within fairly short order, circumcision
      was promoted as a remedy for alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma,
      gout, rheumatism, curvature of the spine and headache
      &hellip; paralysis, malnutrition, night terrors, and
      clubfoot; eczema, convulsions and mental retardation;
      promiscuity, syphilis, and cancer (p. 527).<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">This promotion of circumcision in the USA and
      the UK emerged at the same time as a rekindled interest in
      cliterodectomies and other experiments in sexual surgery.
      Significantly, both male and female circumcision were
      justified in terms of managing sexuality; yet, while
      cliterodectomies soon declined, with other forms of female
      genital mutilation eventually becoming a focus for domestic
      and international outrage, male circumcision became
      routinised in medical practice. In large part this was
      attributable to the belief that male circumcision cured
      masturbation, an accepted cause of degeneracy and insanity.
      Circumcision allowed the Victorians to manage cultural
      anxieties that had prompted an extensive campaign against
      masturbation.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Although this was a transatlantic
      phenomenon it should be noted that anxieties ran higher in
      the USA. As Hodges notes:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">American doctors saw sexuality as more
      of a threat to public health and social stability than did
      their European contemporaries. The American medical
      profession&rsquo;s intense focus on sexuality was due in part
      to economic pressures, the lack of a rigidly defined class
      system, the rise of the middle class, the rise of
      immigration, and other sources of social tension (p.
      41).<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">It was forcefully argued that circumcision
      diminished the incidence of masturbation by removing or
      preventing adhesions that would otherwise lead to the penis
      being handled, and hence to self-abuse.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Arguably, curing masturbation was
      understood as the most important health benefit of
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Another key factor was the stigma created
      through the linkage of those with an uncircumcised penis with
      disease, pollution, and contagion. In professional and lay
      publications of the time the foreskin is typically
      characterised as &lsquo;&lsquo;a harbour for
      filth&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 769)<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Indeed, anyone who has taken the
      trouble to compare the dry, pink-parchment-like, cleanly
      appearance of the glans of the circumcised with the sodden,
      swollen, uncleanly structure which is frequently presented to
      view when the prepuce of the uncircumcised is retracted
      cannot fail to have been struck by the contrast. In the
      latter case the space between the prepuce and the glans forms
      the very beau ideal of a place for the implantation and
      multiplication of bacteria of all kinds, the pent-up
      secretions furnishing them with an efficient nutrient medium
      in which to grow, the heat and moisture favoring their
      development, and the excoriations which are so liable to
      exist forming a ready means whereby their products may gain
      access to the general circulation (p. 1870).<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">This association helps to explain the shift
      evident from the 1880s onwards towards cleanliness as a
      justification for circumcision. In 1914 Abraham Wolbarst
      argued for universal circumcision as a &lsquo;&lsquo;sanitary
      measure&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 92),<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> concluding that &lsquo;&lsquo;the
      vast preponderance of modern scientific opinion on the
      subject is strongly in favor of circumcision as a sanitary
      measure and as a prophylactic against infection with venereal
      disease&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 95).<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> This shift occurred within a social
      move that saw cleanliness identified with good morals, and
      stigmatised the uncircumcised as not only unclean
      but&mdash;by association&mdash;of questionable morals.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> In these terms Szasz locates
      circumcision within his model of the
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Therapeutic State&rsquo;&rsquo;, a political
      system where &lsquo;&lsquo;social controls are legitimised by
      the ideology of health&rsquo;&rsquo;. In this model,
      circumcision is emblematic of the &lsquo;&lsquo;same
      puritanical zeal for health-asvirtue that has fuelled other
      typically American crowd madnesses, such as Prohibition, the
      War on Drugs, and the Mental Health Movement&rsquo;&rsquo;
      (pp. 140&ndash;1).<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Intimately
      tied to these discourses of cleanliness and morality, during
      this period circumcision became embedded as a signifier of
      class and racial differences.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      By 1910 it was the most common operation in the USA,<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> and a routine one in the UK.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>Risky practices and the
      construction of
      &lsquo;&lsquo;harm&rsquo;&rsquo;</b></span><br />
       For all that they now seem spurious, the historical
      justifications for neonatal male circumcision served to
      obscure the violence inherent in the practice and the risks
      it necessarily entailed. Although traditionally male
      circumcision was characterised as a neutral and risk free
      practice, more recently there has been a growing attention in
      the ethical literature to questions of risk.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> The
      BMA&rsquo;s new guidance thus reflects contemporary law and
      practice by attaching greater weight to risks. As numerous
      commentators have attested, throughout health care law, and
      indeed wider social theory, risk is becoming a pervasive
      theme.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> In particular, debates
      about the law&rsquo;s role in regulating violence against the
      person are increasingly framed in terms of risk and
      danger.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> However, although the
      guidance foregrounds risk discourse, it also highlights the
      contested nature of the risk&ndash;benefit analysis. At
      various points evidence for the supposed beneficial effects
      of circumcision is described as
      &lsquo;&lsquo;equivocal&rsquo;&rsquo; (pp. 2,4),<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;inconclusive&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 4),<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> &lsquo;&lsquo;not convincingly
      proven&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 5),<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;contradictory&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 7),<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> causing &lsquo;&lsquo;significant
      disagreement&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 7),<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> lacking consensus1 and, ultimately,
      &lsquo;&lsquo;insufficient&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 7).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The BMA concludes that
      &lsquo;&lsquo;evidence concerning the health benefit from
      non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone
      to be justification&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 7).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Yet, while this is coupled with a
      recognition that there are inherent &lsquo;&lsquo;medical and
      psychological&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 5)<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> risks in the procedure, the dominant
      message is still that parental beliefs should be respected
      despite not being grounded in claims to health benefits:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">The medical harms or benefits have not
      been unequivocally proven but there are clear risks of harm
      if the procedure is done inexpertly. The Association has no
      policy on these issues. Indeed it would be difficult to
      formulate a policy in the absence of unambiguously clear and
      consistent medical data on the implications of the
      intervention. As a general rule, however, the BMA believes
      that the parents should be entitled to make choices about how
      best to promote their children&rsquo;s interests, and it is
      for society to decide what limits should be imposed on
      parental choices (p. 3).<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">A similar position has been defended in the
      American literature by Benatar and Benatar,<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> but it is interesting that the
      BMA&rsquo;s position seems more progressive than that of some
      liberal commentators such as Margaret Brazier, who provides
      the following summary:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">The child suffers momentary pain.
      Although medical opinion may not necessarily regard it as
      positively beneficial, it is in no way medically harmful if
      properly performed. The community as a whole regards it as a
      decision for the infant&rsquo;s parents (p. 350).<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Although the BMA&rsquo;s recognition of both the
      equivocal nature of the claimed benefits and the clear risks
      of harm inherent in the procedure may be interpreted as a
      more progressive position than some of the liberal
      commentators, it nonetheless continues to construct male
      circumcision as an expression of parental privilege. This
      downplays both the pain experienced by the neonate,<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> and
      the fact that, while complication rates from routine
      circumcision are low, the chances of these complications
      being mutilatory, infective, or haemorrhagic are high.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
      Indeed, complications are potentially catastrophic, since
      death, gangrene, and total or partial amputation are known
      adverse outcomes.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Yet, the
      guidance asserts that law legitimises parental choice since
      nontherapeutic circumcision is &lsquo;&lsquo;generally
      accepted&rsquo;&rsquo; to be lawful (p. 3).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> We suggest that legal support for this
      view is somewhat tenuous, consisting of an obiter dicta
      comment by Lord Templeman, a Law Commission report, and two
      cases that tangentially refer to the legality of male
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> In <i>Consent in the criminal
      law</i>, the Law Commission addressed the limits that law
      should impose on the degree of injury to which a victim might
      lawfully consent.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> It was
      generally highly critical of the landmark House of
      Lords&rsquo; decision in <i>R. v. Brown</i>, which
      criminalised the infliction of injury during consensual
      sado-masochistic sex. However, it endorsed an <i>obiter</i>
      comment by Lord Templeman in that case, which lists male
      circumcision as an example of a deliberately inflicted, but
      apparently lawful, injury:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Surgery involves intentional violence
      resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm but
      surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities carried on
      with consent by or on behalf of the injured person have been
      accepted as lawful notwithstanding that they involve actual
      bodily harm or may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual
      circumcision, tattooing, ear piercing and violent sports
      including boxing are lawful activities (pp.
      78&ndash;9).<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The Law Commission concluded that the lawfulness
      of ritual male circumcision should be put beyond
      doubt.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> To date, Parliament
      has not legislated, which leaves open the question of whether
      circumcision is lawful surgery or &lsquo;&lsquo;proper
      medical treatment&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 109).<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> In the main reported case on
      circumcision&mdash;<i>Re J</i>&mdash;the judges in the High
      Court and Court of Appeal confined their observations to the
      particular point of the dispute, which concerned parental
      disagreement.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> J, a 5-year-old
      boy, lived with his mother, a non-practising English
      Christian. His father, a non-practising Turkish Muslim,
      wanted J to be circumcised so as to identify him with his
      father and confirm him as a Muslim. The court refused to
      authorise surgery on the grounds that, since J was not being
      brought up as a Muslim, he was unlikely to derive any social
      or cultural benefit from circumcision. It held that, for
      non-therapeutic circumcision, the consent of both parents
      would be desirable. However, neither court questioned the
      assumption that, where parents agree, they should be able to
      make this decision free of scrutiny.</p>

      <p class="2">The Court of Appeal recently followed this
      approach in the case of <i>Re S</i>, which concerned a
      similar dispute.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> A mother
      applied to the court for her 8-year-old son to be circumcised
      as a member of the Islamic faith, an application opposed by
      the child&rsquo;s father. Here, the deciding factors were
      that the child had been brought up in a predominantly Jain
      household and the mother&rsquo;s primary motivation for
      seeking her son&rsquo;s circumcision seemed to be that her
      new husband was Muslim.</p>

      <p class="2">We suggest that a partial explanation of the
      law&rsquo;s muted response to the risks of infant male
      circumcision lies in the conceptually fluid nature of
      &lsquo;&lsquo;harm&rsquo;&rsquo;. As Carol Smart notes,
      &lsquo;&lsquo;harm&rsquo;&rsquo; is not &lsquo;&lsquo;a
      transcendental notion which is automatically knowable and
      recognisable at any moment in history by any member of a
      culture&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 392).<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> This conceptual fluidity allows
      health care law and ethical guidance differentially to
      construct harms, attaching weight to some, while downplaying
      others. A key factor in determining how harm is constructed
      is rooted in understandings of the body that is harmed. For
      instance, in general, law tends to construct the male body as
      invulnerable to harm.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> By
      contrast, the female body tends to be characterised by
      vulnerability, which leaves it more open to medical
      intervention and management. In relation to children, David
      Evans notes that modern societies typically construct them as
      objects of grave concern.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
      However, we argue that medicolegal responses to harms
      suffered by children are vexed, and
      &lsquo;&lsquo;concern&rsquo;&rsquo; does not necessarily
      translate into sensitivity to harms inflicted on them. Since
      children function as the repository of various contradictory
      meanings, concern often speaks more to the implications for
      adults. For instance, other authors, such as Roger Short in
      his JME article, note that a key motivation for circumcision
      is often a father&rsquo;s desire that his son physically
      resembles him.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n33">33&ndash;35</a></sup> The problem of
      disentangling familial interests compounds the difficulty in
      recognising harm to children, such as child abuse, which
      occurs within the private sphere of the family. In the case
      of circumcision, moreover, this obstacle is compounded by the
      way in which religious or cultural practices sanctify the
      practice of male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="2">Additional factors militating against
      recognition of harm include the age and gender of the
      child&mdash;factors that we argue are crucial in the infant
      male circumcision debate. Since infants are unable to
      articulate their harms, they can more easily be ignored, or
      at least it is more readily accepted that parents are best
      placed to articulate their interests. More significantly, we
      argue that the pain and risks to boy infants are downplayed
      in part because of their place as a rite of passage and
      signifier of masculinity.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>Masculinity and
      pain</b></span><br />
       Within public and legal imaginations there is a dominant
      understanding of the male body as invulnerable and safe.
      Cynthia Daniels has explored this in the context of the
      denial of vulnerability and risk:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">In Western industrial cultures, notions
      of masculinity have been historically associated with the
      denial of men&rsquo;s physical vulnerabilities and bodily
      needs and the projection of these characteristics onto the
      maternal. Men&rsquo;s denial (or dismissal) of bodily risks
      has been a hallmark of masculine status &hellip; (p.
      582).<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Since the time of ancient Greece, willingness to
      bodily sacrifice&mdash;most notably in warfare&mdash;has been
      one side of a &lsquo;&lsquo;covenant&rsquo;&rsquo; that
      affords men fuller participation in the body politic. Today,
      as in the past, warfare is met by the sacrifices/ risks of
      employment, where reproductive and other health hazards are
      routinely denied or minimised, with the
      &lsquo;&lsquo;reward&rsquo;&rsquo; of higher levels of
      social, economic, and political participation. This is, of
      course, shaped by racial and class, as well as gender,
      differences.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The interplay of sacrifice and masculinity is
      complicated by the relationship between masculinity and pain.
      Although pain may be understood as an integral part of the
      relationship between sacrifice and masculinity, it is related
      in a wider sense to ideas of masculinity. In her analysis of
      circumcision, Sarah Waldeck mobilises Timothy Beneke&rsquo;s
      concept of &lsquo;&lsquo;compulsive
      masculinity&rsquo;&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;&lsquo;need to
      relate to, and at times create, stress or distress as a means
      of both proving manhood and conferring on boys and men
      superiority over women and other men&rsquo;&rsquo; (p.
      57).<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> This is relevant in two
      ways. First, circumcision dovetails with deeply embedded
      associations between the endurance of pain/distress and
      proving and defining masculinity. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll
      make a man of you&rsquo;&rsquo; is articulated in many
      different ways and in many different locations. This aspect
      of masculinity is imbricated in a spectrum of
      &lsquo;&lsquo;initiation&rsquo;&rsquo; rites, from early
      moments of parental blindness to the risks of harm (such as
      in the case of routine circumcision) through to the tolerance
      of the homo(anti)sociality of college and military hazing,
      and ultimately to aspects of our responses to warfare. These
      arguments may also help to explain why the Law Commission and
      judges in <i>R. v. Brown</i><sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup>
      grouped nontherapeutic, non-consensual neonatal circumcision
      with other activities that are potentially harmful to a
      consenting (male) adult, such as &lsquo;&lsquo;manly
      diversions&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;rough but innocent
      horse-play&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 97).<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> On this understanding, circumcision
      is privileged as an early moment that associates masculinity
      with endurance and pain. Secondly, such cultural associations
      may well contribute towards the failure to provide adequate
      pain control for this procedure. Although a wealth of
      literature highlights the need for pain relief during
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> leading the
      American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend the use of
      analgesia,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> an
      &lsquo;&lsquo;astonishingly large&rsquo;&rsquo; percentage of
      infants are circumcised without efficient pain
      control.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> It was estimated in
      1999 that 45% of circumcisions occurred without
      anaesthetic.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> However, a
      report from the preceding year suggests lower levels of
      anaesthetic use and, in line with circumcision itself,
      highlights regional variation:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">The debate over whether or not
      circumcision should be performed seemed to overshadow the
      fact that between 64 percent to 96 percent of the time babies
      are circumcised without anesthesia in some areas of North
      America (p. 20).<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">It is also worth noting that Benatar and Benatar
      describe the continued failure to use analgesia as a matter
      of &lsquo;&lsquo;great moral concern&rsquo;&rsquo; (p.
      43).<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> The masculinity/pain
      nexus may thus be implicated in the continuing practice of
      routine neonatal circumcision. The BMA&rsquo;s guidance
      refers to anaesthesia only in the context of consent and
      knowledge of the associated risks, and the need to provide
      full resuscitation facilities if general anaesthesia is
      used.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Neither can be read as a
      statement requiring anaesthesia to be used to minimise pain
      and discomfort.</p>

      <p class="2">Additionally, we would argue that feminist
      critiques of health care, which have foregrounded harms
      specific to women, may have contributed to a marginalisation
      of threats to the male body, a process facilitated by its
      construction as impermeable.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> Thus, as Smart notes, boys
      were seemingly &lsquo;&lsquo;not constituted as part of the
      historical story of child sexual abuse&rsquo;&rsquo; (p.
      395).<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> This also fits with the
      tendency of Anglo- American legal commentators to minimise
      harms inflicted on boys while exacerbating risks to girls.
      Certainly this may play some part in explaining the very
      different stance of both the BMA and English law regarding
      female circumcision.</p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>Ethicolegal responses to female and
      male circumcision</b></span><br />
       The differential treatment of male and female genital
      mutilation is, we would argue, important in understanding the
      nature of the current debate. This dichotomy is perpetuated
      by the BMA&rsquo;s practice of issuing separate guidance on
      the two practices. We suggest that this radical separation
      partially explains why male circumcision has attracted little
      medicolegal discussion in comparison with female
      circumcision, which has &lsquo;&lsquo;captivated the popular
      press, the legal academy and the political
      arena&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 725).<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup>
      Bioethical commentary has been uniformly hostile to female
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n45">45&ndash;49</a></sup> a
      critique reflected both in the terminology employed and in
      Anglo-American laws. Both the UK Female Genital Mutilation
      Act 2003 and the US Federal Prohibition of Female Genital
      Mutilation Act 1997 are notable for their refusal to
      countenance any circumstances in which a competent minor girl
      (or even adult woman in the UK) could choose to be
      circumcised. Nor are parents permitted to justify the
      practice on religious or cultural grounds,<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n">50</a></sup> or,
      in the UK, to take their child abroad for this
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup> By contrast with
      such extraordinarily punitive laws, the absence of any
      statutory regulation governing the practice of male
      circumcision is striking.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">In general, legal commentators have simply
      assumed that the male/female circumcision binary is
      self-evident.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> Others construe
      female circumcision as a barbaric violation of human rights,
      in comparison with which the less radical intervention of
      male circumcision may be characterised as a legitimate
      parental choice.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> Thus,
      Coleman argues that any analogy between the two practices</p>

      <p class="blockquote">can be and has been rejected as
      specious and disingenuous [since] traditional forms of FGM
      [female genital mutilation] are as different from male
      circumcision in terms of procedures, physical ramifications
      and motivations as ear piercing is to a penilectomy (p.
      736).<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">To such arguments we would make three
      rejoinders. First, it is crucial to avoid essentialism; the
      different types of harm occasioned though the range of
      practices covered by the terms
      &lsquo;&lsquo;circumcision&rsquo;&rsquo; must be unpacked
      rather than being represented as &lsquo;&lsquo;a unitary
      whole&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 151).<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup>
      Arguably, the less severe forms of female circumcision, such
      as ritual/ symbolic circumcision (involving the drawing of
      blood but no permanent tissue damage or scarring)<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> or sunna (the cutting away of the
      prepuce of the hood of the clitoris) may be no more
      severe&mdash;or even less severe&mdash;than conventional male
      circumcision, which involves the removal of the foreskin or
      prepuce covering the glans of the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup> Clearly the more extreme forms of
      female circumcision&mdash;excision (about 80% of cases;
      involves the removal of the clitoris and all or part of the
      labia minor) and infibulation (about 15% of cases; involves
      removal of clitoris, labia minor and at least twothirds of
      the labia majora, which are then stitched together leaving
      only a small opening for the passage of urine and menstrual
      blood)&mdash;are radically different in kind from most
      instances of male circumcision. However, it is worth noting
      the range of variation in the practice witnessed in other
      cultures.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Such arguments are obfuscated within the BMA
      guidance, as is particularly evident in the
      Association&rsquo;s guidance for female genital mutilation.
      Referring to the less severe practices, the guidance notes
      that:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">Other mutilations include pricking,
      piercing &hellip; and introduction of &hellip; herbs into the
      vagina &hellip; The age at which such procedures are carried
      out varies from a few days old to just before marriage.</p>

      <p class="2">All forms are mutilating and carry serious
      health risks. Female genital mutilation is not comparable
      with male circumcision, over which there is no consensus
      about the health risks and potential benefits (p. 1).<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> A further problematic distinction
      that also deploys a particular definition of the word
      &lsquo;&lsquo;mutilation&rsquo;&rsquo; is contained in the
      Law Commission&rsquo;s report:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">It is generally accepted that the
      removal of the foreskin of the penis has little if any effect
      on a man&rsquo;s ability to enjoy sexual intercourse, and
      this act is not, therefore, regarded as a mutilation (para
      9.2).<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Nevertheless, if variations in the procedures
      render a simple opposition between male and female
      circumcision problematic, other commentators have suggested
      that a more compelling distinction lies in the justifications
      of the practice. On this view the patriarchal underpinnings
      of female circumcision, which undermine the right of girls
      and women to &lsquo;&lsquo;sexual and corporal
      integrity&rsquo;&rsquo;,<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup>
      accounts for much of the revulsion it provokes. Yet we are
      uneasy with the view that male circumcision is less
      problematic because it cannot be located in some grand theory
      of oppression. As our brief outline of its historical
      emergence highlights, the motivations for and justification
      of male circumcision are more complex than is often allowed.
      Like female circumcision, including practices in the UK and
      the USA into the early twentieth century, it has been used to
      manage sexuality, and needs to be located within a framework
      that recognises how it normalises and privileges the male
      body. In light of this, feminist disinterest in, or
      acceptance of, the procedure may well be short sighted.</p>

      <p class="2">Finally, we would reiterate that artificially
      contrasting the practices in this way serves only to deflect
      attention from the more fundamental issue, which has also
      been obscured in English law, of whether we should be
      subjecting any children to medically approved procedures
      involving the excision of healthy tissue. In this regard it
      is worth remembering that definitions of the prepuce as
      merely a fold of skin covering the glans have been condemned
      as grossly simplistic. Rather the prepuce is a complex
      structure that has a range of significant sexological
      functions playing &lsquo;&lsquo;an important role in the
      mechanical functioning of the penis during sexual acts, such
      as penetrative intercourse and masturbation&rsquo;&rsquo; (p.
      89).<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Given that no clear dichotomy necessarily exists
      between female and male circumcision, in terms of either the
      injury inflicted or the motivation for it, we question the
      lack of will on the part of the medical profession, both
      institutionally and at the level of some individual
      practitioners, to challenge the acceptability of the
      practice. In this respect, attitudes to male circumcision may
      usefully be contrasted with other areas of health care law,
      but it is at this point that the arguments of many
      commentators are seriously flawed, since comparisons chosen
      often involve adult patients capable of consenting to the
      procedure. For instance, Benatar and Benatar draw analogies
      between male circumcision and &lsquo;&lsquo;other surgical
      procedures such as breast reduction, liposuction and
      rhinoplasty&rsquo;&rsquo;, suggesting that, like circumcision
      of infants, such surgeries are not necessarily
      &lsquo;&lsquo;disfiguring&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 36).<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Similar comparisons with elective
      procedures freely chosen by adults underpin the reasoning of
      both the Law Commission<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> and
      the majority judgments in <i>R. v. Brown</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> In our view, more appropriate
      comparisons that explicitly raise the ethics and legality of
      exposing infants to the risk of harm would be the enrolment
      of children in clinical research<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> or vaccination programmes,<sup><a
      href="#n">60</a></sup> where they are clearly vulnerable to
      being used for the benefit of others. By contrast with infant
      male circumcision, in these contexts there is extensive
      debate about the ethics of consenting to these procedures on
      behalf of young children, notwithstanding the much greater
      possibility of benefit to the individual child or other
      children. The lack of tangible individual or societal
      benefits accompanying circumcision, coupled with the known
      risks, makes it surprising that the routine nature of this
      practice has escaped similar medicolegal controversy.
      Law&rsquo;s failure to scrutinise adequately the risks
      inherent in this practice is particularly indefensible, since
      tort actions in the USA have forced law to confront and
      quantify the damage that has resulted from negligently
      performed circumcisions.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n61">61&ndash;63</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="head1"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></span><br />
       In conclusion, we suggest that two elements characterise the
      history of non-therapeutic male circumcision: evangelism and
      the diversity of justifications that evangelical champions of
      circumcision have mobilised. Although justifications have
      shifted, they have generally relied on an enduring
      association between the uncircumcised penis and disease and
      pollution.<sup><a href="#n64">64&ndash;66</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Current disputed justifications follow this
      trend and centre on circumcision as a prophylactic against
      sexually transmitted disease, including HIV. An assessment of
      the merits of the scientific research is not our primary
      concern. In this regard, however, it is worth emphasising
      Benatar and Benatar&rsquo;s conclusion, following their
      review of the literature, that none of the scientific
      evidence &lsquo;&lsquo;is anywhere near
      conclusive&rsquo;&rsquo; (p. 42).<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Yet, for some, it is the prevention
      of HIV/AIDS that legitimates calls for (global) routine male
      circumcision. In this vein, Roger Short concludes his piece
      in the JME in a manner consonant with the earlier evangelism.
      He focuses on circumcision status and the transmission of
      HIV:</p>

      <p class="blockquote">If we believe in evidence-based
      medicine, then there can be no debate about male
      circumcision; it has become a desirable option for the whole
      world. Paradoxically, this simple procedure is a life saver;
      it can also bring about major improvements to both male and
      female reproductive health. Rather than condemning it, we in
      the developed world have a duty to develop better procedures
      that are neither physically cruel nor potentially dangerous,
      so that male circumcision can take its rightful place as the
      kindest cut of all (p. 241).<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Such evangelical commitment to circumcision is
      problematic in a number of respects. First, it ignores the
      complexity of the existing research and fails to question the
      utility of global generalisations from a limited number of
      studies. In terms of sexual health more generally, it fails
      to address the consequences of claiming circumcision as an
      effective prophylactic against HIV/AIDS on the transmission
      of other sexually transmitted diseases. It should be noted
      that, notwithstanding the high rates of routine circumcision
      in the USA since at least the 1950s, this country nonetheless
      has the highest level of sexually transmitted disease and HIV
      infection in the developed world.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> In this regard, in a recent study of
      male circumcision and the risk of HIV and other sexually
      transmitted infections in India it was recognised that,
      although circumcised men may have a lower risk of HIV
      infection, this did not protect them from herpes, syphilis,
      or gonorrhoea.</p>

      <p class="2">This promotion of circumcision as a prophylactic
      raises wider questions about subjecting children to invasive
      procedures on the grounds of public health. It is generally
      accepted that medical intervention is ethically permissible
      only in response to verifiable disease, deformity, or injury.
      In addition, the therapeutic intervention must be reasonably
      believed to result in a net benefit to the patient. While
      prophylactic interventions are obvious exceptions to this
      principle, they are justifiable only where deemed to be in
      the individual&rsquo;s best interests or where aimed at
      avoiding a significant public health disaster. It has been
      convincingly agued in this journal that, when a procedure is
      to be performed on children who are unable to give informed
      consent, a higher level of scrutiny is demanded. This
      requires consideration of whether effective and conservative
      alternative interventions could achieve the intended
      outcome.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> This position
      underpins the BMA&rsquo;s guidance, which states that it
      would be unethical to circumcise where medical research has
      shown other techniques to be at least as effective and less
      invasive.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Obviously, the
      provision of condoms and improved sex education are less
      invasive and more appropriate means of achieving the desired
      outcome. Although cultural attitudes may make this difficult
      to achieve in certain communities, public health should not
      focus on what is attainable in these communities
      (particularly where this is the most invasive option) for the
      construction of a global public health strategy.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Circumcision has long existed as a procedure in
      need of a justification. The most recent focus on sexually
      transmitted disease&mdash;notably with regard to
      HIV/AIDS&mdash;needs to be assessed in light of this. It is
      our contention that no convincing medical justification for
      this practice exists. In the absence of unequivocal evidence
      of medical benefit, we would argue that it is ethically
      inappropriate to subject a child to the acknowledged risks of
      infant male circumcision. Having reached this position, the
      emerging consensus, whereby parental choice holds sway,
      appears ethically indefensible; nor, given emerging
      principles and practice governing medical decision making
      involving children, is there any compelling legal authority
      for the view that it is lawful.</p>

      <p class="2">Rather, in contrast to female circumcision,
      whose advocates would also point to justifications rooted in
      culture and cleanliness, law has failed to confront the risks
      that male circumcision poses to the infant body or to contest
      the nexus between pain and masculinity. The promulgation of
      new professional guidance represented an important
      opportunity to signify that excision of any healthy body
      parts should neither be left to parental choice nor dependent
      on the sex of the child. Ultimately, however, the BMA
      guidelines avoid the issues that should now be at the heart
      of this debate and represent a missed opportunity.</p>
