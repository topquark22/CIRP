          <p><b>HOUSE OF LORDS<br />
           LORD TEMPLEMAN, LORD JAUNCEY OF TULLICHETTLE, LORD
          LOWRY, LORD MUSTILL AND LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY<br />
           1, 2, 3, 7 DECEMBER 1992, 11 MARCH 1993</b></p>

          <p class="text1">The appellants belonged to a group of
          sado-masochistic homosexuals who over a 10-year period
          from 1978 willingly participated in the commission of
          acts of violence against each other, including genital
          torture, for the sexual pleasure which it engendered in
          the giving and receiving of pain. The passive partner or
          victim in each case consented to the acts being committed
          and suffered no permanent injury. The activities took
          place in private at a number of different locations,
          including rooms equipped as torture chambers at the homes
          of three of the appellants. Video cameras were used to
          record the activities and the resulting tapes were then
          copied and distributed amongst members of the group. The
          tapes were not sold or used other than for the
          delectation of members of the group. The appellants were
          tried on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily
          harm, contrary to s 47 of the <a
          href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/UKlaw/oap1861/"
          target="_blank">Offences against the Person Act 1861</a>,
          and unlawful wounding, contrary to s 20 of that Act. The
          Crown&rsquo;s case was based very largely on the contents
          of the video tapes. Following a ruling by the trial judge
          that the consent of the victim afforded no defence to the
          charges, the appellants pleaded guilty and were sentenced
          to terms of imprisonment. The appellants appealed against
          their convictions, contending that a person could not
          guilty be of assault occasioning actual bodily harm or
          unlawful wounding in respect of acts carried out in
          private with the consent of the victim. The Court of
          Appeal dismissed their appeals. The appellants appealed
          to the House of Lords.</p>

          <p class="text1"><b>Held</b> (Lord Mustill and Lord Slynn
          dissenting) &ndash; Consensual sado-masochistic
          homosexual encounters which occasioned actual bodily harm
          to the victim were assaults occasioning actual bodily
          harm, contrary to s 47 of the 1861 Act, and unlawful
          wounding, contrary to s 20 of that Act, notwithstanding
          the victim&rsquo;s consent to the acts inflicted on him,
          because public policy required that society be protected
          by criminal sanctions against a cult of violence which
          contained the danger of the proselytisation and
          corruption of young men and the potential for the
          infliction of serious injury. Accordingly, a person could
          be convicted of unlawful wounding and assault occasioning
          actual bodily harm, contrary to ss 20 and 47 of the 1861
          Act, for committing sado-masochistic acts which inflicted
          injuries which were neither transient nor trifling,
          notwithstanding that the acts were committed in private,
          the person on whom the injuries were inflicted consented
          to the acts and no permanent injury was sustained by the
          victim. It followed that the appellants had been properly
          convicted and that their appeals would be dismissed (see

          appeals against their convictions and sentences on 19
          December 1990 in the Central Criminal Court before Judge
          Rant QC on counts of unlawful wounding, assault

          the same contrary to ss 20 and 47 of the Offences against

          to the charges following rearraignment as a result of a
          ruling by the judge on 2 November 1990. The Court of
          Appeal certified, under s 33(2) of the Criminal Appeal

          <p>11 March 1993. The following opinions were
          delivered.</p>

          <p class="text1"><a id="templeman"
          name="templeman"></a><b>LORD TEMPLEMAN.</b> My Lords, the
          appellants were convicted of assaults occasioning actual
          bodily harm contrary to s 47 of the Offences against the
          Person Act 1861. Three of the appellants were also
          convicted of wounding contrary to s 20 of the 1861 Act.
          The incidents which led to each conviction occurred in
          the course of consensual sado-masochistic homosexual
          encounters. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions
          and certified the following point of law of general
          public importance:<br />
          <br />
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him
            actual bodily harm in the course of a sadomasochistic
            encounter, does the prosecution have to prove lack of
            consent on the part of B before they can establish
            A&rsquo;s guilt under section 20 and section 47 of the
            1861, Offences Against the Person Act?&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">The definition of assault set forth in
          the 14th Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee on
          <i>Offences against the Person</i> (Cmnd 7844 (1980))
          para 158 and adopted by the Law Commission in their
          Consultation Paper No 122, <i>Legislating the Criminal
          Code: Offences against the Person and General
          Principles</i> (1992) para 9.1 is as follows:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;At common law, an assault is an act by which a
            person intentionally or recklessly causes another to
            apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence and
            a battery is an act by which a person intentionally or
            recklessly inflicts personal violence upon another.
            However, the term &ldquo;assault&rdquo; is now, in both
            ordinary legal usage and in statutes, regularly used to
            cover both assault and battery.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">There are now three types of assault in
          ascending order of gravity: first, common assault,
          secondly, assault which occasions actual bodily harm and,
          thirdly, assault which inflicts grievous bodily harm. By
          s 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Common assault and battery shall be summary
            offences and a person guilty of either of them shall be
            liable to a fine &hellip; to imprisonment for a term
            not exceeding six months, or to both.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">By s 47 of the 1861 Act, as amended:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment
            of any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be
            liable [to a maximum penalty of five years&rsquo;
            imprisonment].&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In <i>R v Donovan</i> [1934] 2 KB 498 at
          509, [1934] All ER Rep 207 at 212 Swift J, delivering the
          judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; &ldquo;bodily harm&rdquo; has its
            ordinary meaning and includes any hurt or injury
            calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of
            the prosecutor. Such hurt or injury need not be
            permanent, but must, no doubt, be more than merely
            transient and trifling.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In the present case each appellant
          pleaded guilty to an offence under this section when the
          trial judge ruled that consent of the victim was no
          defence.</p>
          By s 20 of the 1861 Act, as amended:<br />
          <br />

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound
            or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other
            person, either with or without any weapon or
            instrument, shall be guilty of [an offence] &hellip;
            and shall be liable [to a maximum penalty of five
            years&rsquo; imprisonment].&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">To constitute a
          wound for the purposes of the section the whole skin must
          be broken and not merely the outer layer called the
          epidermis or the cuticle: see <i>J J C</i> (<i>a
          minor</i>) <i>v Eisenhower</i> [1983] 3 All ER
          230.</span></p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Grievous bodily harm&rsquo; means simply bodily
            harm that is really serious and it has been said that
            it is undesirable to attempt a further definition: see
            <i>DPP v Smith</i> [1960] 3 All ER 161, [1961] AC 290.
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In s 20 the words
          &lsquo;unlawfully&rsquo; means that the accused had no
          lawful excuse such as self-defence. The word
          &lsquo;maliciously&rsquo; means no more than
          intentionally for present purposes: see <i>R v Mowatt</i>
          [1967] 3 All ER 47, [1968] 1 QB 421.</p>

          <p class="text2">Three of the appellants pleaded guilty
          to charges under s 20 when the trial judge ruled that the
          consent of the victim afforded no defence.</p>

          <p class="text2">In the present case each of the
          appellants intentionally inflicted violence upon another
          (to whom I shall refer as &lsquo;the victim&rsquo;) with
          the consent of the victim and thereby occasioned actual
          bodily harm or in some cases wounding or grievous bodily
          harm. Each appellant was therefore guilty of an offence
          under s 47 or s 20 of the 1861 Act unless the consent of
          the victim was effective to prevent the commission of the
          offence or effective to constitute a defence to the
          charge.</p>

          <p class="text2">In some circumstances violence is not
          punishable under the criminal law. When no actual bodily
          harm is caused, the consent of the person affected
          precludes him from complaining. There can be no
          conviction for the summary offence of common assault if
          the victim has consented to the assault. Even when
          violence is intentionally inflicted and results in actual
          bodily harm, wounding or serious bodily harm the accused
          is entitled to be acquitted if the injury was a
          foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the
          person injured was participating. Surgery involves
          intentional violence resulting in actual or sometimes
          serious bodily harm but surgery is a lawful activity.
          Other activities carried on with consent by or on behalf
          of the injured person have been accepted as lawful
          notwithstanding that they involve actual bodily harm or
          may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual circumcision,
          tattooing, ear-piercing and violent sports including
          boxing are lawful activities.</p>

          <p class="text2">In earlier days some other forms of
          violence were lawful and when they ceased to be lawful
          they were tolerated until well into the nineteenth
          century. Duelling and fighting were at first lawful and
          then tolerated provided the protagonists were voluntary
          participants. But, where the results of these activities
          was the maiming of one of the participants, the defence
          of consent never availed the aggressor: see 1
          <i>Hawkins&rsquo; Pleas of the Crown</i> (8th edn, 1824)
          ch 15. A maim was bodily harm whereby a man was deprived
          of the use of any member of his body which he needed to
          use in order to fight but a bodily injury was not a maim
          merely because it was a disfigurement. The act of maim
          was unlawful because the King was deprived of the
          services of an able-bodied citizen for the defence of the
          realm. Violence which maimed was unlawful despite consent
          to the activity which produced the maiming. In these days
          there is no difference between maiming on the one hand
          and wounding or causing grievous bodily harm on the other
          hand except with regard to sentence.</p>

          <p class="text2">When duelling became unlawful, juries
          remained unwilling to convict but the judges insisted
          that persons guilty of causing death or bodily injury
          should be convicted despite the consent of the
          victim.</p>

          <p class="text2">Similarly, in the old days, fighting was
          lawful provided the protagonists consented because it was
          thought that fighting inculcated bravery and skill and
          physical fitness. The brutality of knuckle fighting
          however caused the courts to declare that such fights
          were unlawful even if the protagonists consented. Rightly
          or wrongly the courts accepted that boxing is a lawful
          activity.</p>

          <p class="text2">In <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 the
          court held that a prize-fight in public was unlawful.
          Cave J said (at 539):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The true view is, I think, that a blow struck in
            anger, or which is likely or is intended to do corporal
            hurt, is an assault, but that a blow struck in sport,
            and not likely, nor intended to cause bodily harm, is
            not an assault, and that an assault being a breach of
            the peace and unlawful, the consent of the person
            struck is immaterial.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Stephen J said (at 549):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;When one person is indicted for inflicting
            personal injury upon another, the consent of the person
            who sustains the injury is no defence to the person who
            inflicts the injury, if the injury is of such a nature,
            or is inflicted under such circumstances, that its
            infliction is injurious to the public as well as to the
            person injured. But the injuries given and received in
            prize-fights are injurious to the public, both because
            it is against the public interest that the lives and
            the health of the combatants should be endangered by
            blows, and because prize-fights are disorderly
            exhibitions, mischievous on many obvious grounds.
            Therefore the consent of the parties to the blows which
            they mutually receive does not prevent those blows from
            being assaults &hellip; In cases where life and limb
            are exposed to no serious danger in the common course
            of things, I think that consent is a defence to a
            charge of assault, even when considerable force is
            used, as, for instance, in cases of wrestling,
            single-stick, sparring with gloves, football and the
            like; but in all cases the question whether consent
            does or does not take from the application of force to
            another its illegal character, is a question of degree
            depending upon circumstances.&rsquo;

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; whatever may be the effect of a consent
            in a suit between party and party, it is not in the
            power of any man to give an effectual consent to that
            which amounts to, or has a direct tendency to create, a
            breach of the peace; so as to bar a criminal
            prosecution. In other words, though a man may by
            consent debar himself from his right to maintain a
            civil action, he cannot thereby defeat proceedings
            instituted by the Crown in the interest of the public
            for the maintenance of good order &hellip; He may

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; I conceive it to be established, beyond
            the power of any argument however ingenious to raise a
            doubt, that as the combatants in a duel cannot give
            consent to one another to take away life, so neither
            can the combatants in a prize-fight give consent to one
            another to commit that which the law has repeatedly
            held to be a breach of the peace. An individual cannot
            by such consent destroy the right of the Crown to
            protect the public and keep the peace.&rsquo;

          <p class="text2">The conclusion is that, a prize-fight
          being unlawful, actual bodily harm or serious bodily harm
          inflicted in the course of a prize-fight is unlawful
          notwithstanding the consent of the protagonists.</p>

          and fought with bare fists Lord Lane CJ, delivering the
          judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; it is not in the public interest that
            people should try to cause or should cause each other
            bodily harm for no good reason. Minor struggles are
            another matter. So, in our judgment, it is immaterial
            whether the act occurs in private or in public; it is
            an assault if actual bodily harm is intended and/or
            caused. This means that most fights will be unlawful
            regardless of consent. Nothing which we have said is
            intended to cast doubt on the accepted legality of
            properly conducted games and sports, lawful
            chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical
            interference, dangerous exhibitions etc. These apparent
            exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise
            of a legal right, in the case of chastisement or
            correction, or as needed in the public interest, in the
            other cases.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Duelling and fighting are both unlawful
          and the consent of the protagonists affords no defence to
          charges of causing actual bodily harm, wounding or

          activity.</p>

          <p class="text2">The appellants and their victims in the
          present case were engaged in consensual homosexual
          activities. The attitude of the public towards homosexual
          practices changed in the second half of this century.
          Change in public attitudes led to a change in the
          law.</p>

          <p class="text2">The <i>Report of the Committee on
          Homosexual Offences and Prostitution</i> (the Wolfenden
          Report) (Cmnd 247 (1957)) ch 2 para 13, declared that the
          function of the criminal law in relation to homosexual
          behaviour&mdash;</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;is to preserve public order and decency, to
            protect the citizen from what is offensive or
            injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against
            exploitation and corruption of others, particularly
            those who are especially vulnerable because they are
            young, weak in body or mind, inexperienced, or in a
            state of special, physical, official or economic
            dependence.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In response to the Wolfenden Report and
          consistently with its recommendations, Parliament enacted
          s 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which provided,
          inter alia, as follows:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;(1) Notwithstanding any statutory or common law
            provision &hellip; a homosexual act in private shall
            not be an offence provided that the parties consent
            thereto and have attained the age of twenty-one
            years.<br />
             (2) An act which would otherwise be treated for the
            purposes of this Act as being done in private shall not
            be so treated if done&mdash;(<i>a</i>) when more than
            two persons take part or are present &hellip;<br />
             (6) It is hereby declared that where in any
            proceedings it is charged that a homosexual act is an
            offence the prosecutor shall have the burden of proving
            that the act was done otherwise than in private or
            otherwise than with the consent of the parties or that
            any of the parties had not attained the age of
            twenty-one years.<br />
             (7) For the purposes of this section a man shall be
            treated as doing a homosexual act if, and only if, he
            commits buggery with another man or commits an act of
            gross indecency with another man or is a party to the
            commission by a man of such an act.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">The offence of gross indecency was
          created by s 13 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 in the
          following terms:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;It is an offence for a man to commit an act of
            gross indecency with another man, whether in public or
            private, or to be a party to the commission by a man of
            an act of gross indecency with another man, or to
            procure the commission by a man of an act of gross
            indecency with another man.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">By the 1967 Act Parliament recognised
          and accepted the practice of homosexuality. Subject to
          exceptions not here relevant, sexual activities conducted
          in private between not more than two consenting adults of
          the same sex or different sexes are now lawful.
          Homosexual activities performed in circumstances which do
          not fall within s 1(1) of the 1967 Act remain unlawful.
          Subject to the respect for private life embodied in the
          1967 Act, Parliament has retained criminal sanctions
          against the practice, dissemination and encouragement of
          homosexual activities.</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, the authorities dealing with
          the intentional infliction of bodily harm do not
          establish that consent is a defence to a charge under the
          1861 Act. They establish that the courts have accepted
          that consent is a defence to the infliction of bodily
          harm in the course of some lawful activities. The
          question is whether the defence should be extended to the
          infliction of bodily harm in the course of
          sadomasochistic encounters. The Wolfenden Committee did
          not make any recommendations about sado-masochism and
          Parliament did not deal with violence in 1967. The 1967
          Act is of no assistance for present purposes because the
          present problem was not under consideration.</p>

          <p class="text2">The question whether the defence of
          consent should be extended to the consequences of
          sado-masochistic encounters can only be decided by
          consideration of policy and public interest. Parliament
          can call on the advice of doctors, psychiatrists,
          criminologists, sociologists and other experts and can
          also sound and take into account public opinion. But the
          question must at this stage be decided by this House in
          its judicial capacity in order to determine whether the
          convictions of the appellants should be upheld or
          quashed.</p>

          <p class="text2">Counsel for some of the appellants
          argued that the defence of consent should be extended to
          the offence of occasioning actual bodily harm under s 47
          of the 1861 Act but should not be available to charges of
          serious wounding and the infliction of serious bodily
          harm under s 20. I do not consider that this solution is
          practicable. Sado-masochistic participants have no way of
          foretelling the degree of bodily harm which will result
          from their encounters. The differences between actual
          bodily harm and serious bodily harm cannot be
          satisfactorily applied by a jury in order to determine
          acquittal or conviction.</p>

          <p class="text2">Counsel for the appellants argued that
          consent should provide a defence to charges under both ss
          20 and 47 because, it was said, every person has a right
          to deal with his body as he pleases. I do not consider
          that this slogan provides a sufficient guide to the
          policy decision which must now be made. It is an offence
          for a person to abuse his own body and mind by taking
          drugs. Although the law is often broken, the criminal law
          restrains a practice which is regarded as dangerous and
          injurious to individuals and which if allowed and
          extended is harmful to society generally. In any event
          the appellants in this case did not mutilate their own
          bodies. They inflicted bodily harm on willing victims.
          Suicide is no longer an offence but a person who assists
          another to commit suicide is guilty of murder or
          manslaughter.</p>

          <p class="text2">The assertion was made on behalf of the
          appellants that the sexual appetites of sadists and
          masochists can only be satisfied by the infliction of
          bodily harm and that the law should not punish the
          consensual achievement of sexual satisfaction. There was
          no evidence to support the assertion that sado-masochist
          activities are essential to the happiness of the
          appellants or any other participants but the argument
          would be acceptable if sado-masochism were only concerned
          with sex as the appellants contend. In my opinion
          sado-masochism is not only concerned with sex.
          Sado-masochism is also concerned with violence. The
          evidence discloses that the practices of the appellants
          were unpredictably dangerous and degrading to body and
          mind and were developed with increasing barbarity and
          taught to persons whose consents were dubious or
          worthless.</p>

          <p class="text2">A sadist draws pleasure from inflicting
          or watching cruelty. A masochist derives pleasure from
          his own pain or humiliation. The appellants are
          middle-aged men. The victims were youths some of whom
          were introduced to sadomasochism before they attained the
          age of 21. In his judgment in the Court of Appeal, Lord
          Lane CJ said that two members of the group of which the
          appellants formed part, namely one Cadman and the
          appellant Laskey&mdash;</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;were responsible in part for the corruption of a
            youth &ldquo;K&rdquo; &hellip; It is some comfort at
            least to be told, as we were, that &ldquo;K&rdquo; has
            now it seems settled into a normal heterosexual
            relationship. Cadman had befriended &ldquo;K&rdquo;
            when the boy was 15 years old. He met him in a
            cafeteria and, so he says, found out that the boy was
            interested in homosexual activities. He introduced and
            encouraged &ldquo;K&rdquo; in &ldquo;bondage&rdquo;
            affairs. He was interested in viewing and recording on
            video tape &ldquo;K&rdquo; and other teenage boys in
            homosexual scenes &hellip; One cannot overlook the
            danger that the gravity of the assaults and injuries in
            this type of case may escalate to even more
            unacceptable heights.&rsquo; (See 94 Cr App R 302 at
            310.)
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">The evidence disclosed that drink and
          drugs were employed to obtain consent and increase
          enthusiasm. The victim was usually manacled so that the
          sadist could enjoy the thrill of power and the victim
          could enjoy the thrill of helplessness. The victim had no
          control over the harm which the sadist, also stimulated
          by drink and drugs, might inflict. In one case a victim
          was branded twice on the thigh and there was some doubt
          as to whether he consented to or protested against the
          second branding. The dangers involved in administering
          violence must have been appreciated by the appellants
          because, so it was said by their counsel, each victim was
          given a code word which he could pronounce when excessive
          harm or pain was caused. The efficiency of this
          precaution, when taken, depends on the circumstances and
          on the personalities involved. No one can feel the pain
          of another. The charges against the appellants were based
          on genital torture and violence to the buttocks, anus,
          penis, testicles and nipples. The victims were degraded
          and humiliated, sometimes beaten, sometimes wounded with
          instruments and sometimes branded. Bloodletting and the
          smearing of human blood produced excitement. There were
          obvious dangers of serious personal injury and blood
          infection. Prosecuting counsel informed the trial judge
          against the protests of defence counsel that, although
          the appellants had not contracted AIDS, two members of
          the group had died from AIDS and one other had contracted
          an HIV infection although not necessarily from the
          practices of the group. Some activities involved
          excrement. The assertion that the instruments employed by
          the sadists were clean and sterilised could not have
          removed the danger of infection, and the assertion that
          care was taken demonstrates the possibility of infection.
          Cruelty to human beings was on occasions supplemented by
          cruelty to animals in the form of bestiality. It is
          fortunate that there were no permanent injuries to a
          victim though no one knows the extent of harm inflicted
          in other cases. It is not surprising that a victim does
          not complain to the police when the complaint would
          involve him in giving details of acts in which he
          participated. Doctors of course are subject to a code of
          confidentiality.</p>

          <p class="text2">In principle there is a difference
          between violence which is incidental and violence which
          is inflicted for the indulgence of cruelty. The violence
          of sadomasochistic encounters involves the indulgence of
          cruelty by sadists and the degradation of victims. Such
          violence is injurious to the participants and
          unpredictably dangerous. I am not prepared to invent a
          defence of consent for sado-masochistic encounters which
          breed and glorify cruelty and result in offences under ss
          47 and 20 of the 1861 Act.</p>

          <p class="text2">The appellants&rsquo; counsel complained
          that some of the group&rsquo;s activities involved the
          appellants in offences of gross indecency which, happily
          for the appellants, became time-barred before the police
          obtained video films made by members of the group of some
          of their activities. Counsel submitted that, since gross
          indecency charges were time-barred, the police acted
          unfairly when they charged the appellants with offences
          under the 1861 Act. But there was no reason for the
          police to refrain from pursuing the charges under the
          1861 Act merely because other charges could not be
          pursued. Indecency charges are connected with sex.
          Charges under the 1861 Act are concerned with violence.
          The violence of sadists and the degradation of their
          victims have sexual motivations but sex is no excuse for
          violence.</p>

          <p class="text2">The appellants&rsquo; counsel relied,
          somewhat faintly, on art 7 of the European Convention on
          Human Rights (see the Convention for the Protection of
          Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Rome, 4 November
          1950; TS 71 (1953); Cmd 8969)). That article, so far as
          material, provides:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;1. No one shall be guilty of any criminal
            offence on account of any act or omission which did not
            constitute a criminal offence under national or
            international law at the time when it was committed
            &hellip;&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">At the relevant time it was a criminal
          offence under English law to inflict actual bodily harm
          or worse. Counsel submitted that the appellants
          reasonably believed that consent was a defence. This was
          an ingenious argument for which there was no foundation
          in fact or principle and which in any event does not seem
          to me to provide a defence under art 7.</p>

          <p class="text2">The appellants&rsquo; counsel relied on
          art 8 of the convention, which is in these terms.</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;1. Everyone has the right to respect for his
            private and family life, his home and his
            correspondence.<br />
             2. There shall be no interference by a public
            authority with the exercise of this right except such
            as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a
            democratic society in the interests of natural
            security, public safety or the economic well-being of
            the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
            for the protection of health or morals, or for the
            protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">It is not clear to me that the
          activities of the appellants were exercises of rights in
          respect of private and family life. But assuming that the
          appellants are claiming to exercise those rights I do not
          consider that art 8 invalidates a law which forbids
          violence which is intentionally harmful to body and
          mind.</p>

          <p class="text2">Society is entitled and bound to protect
          itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from
          the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is
          uncivilised. I would answer the certified question in the
          negative and dismiss the appeals of the appellants
          against conviction.</p>

          <p class="text1"><a id="jauncey"

          My Lords, all five appellants and a number of other
          persons were charged with offences against s 47 of the
          Offences against the Person Act 1861, and the appellants
          Laskey, Jaggard and Lucas were also charged with
          contraventions of s 20 of that Act. The events giving
          rise to all the charges were sado-masochistic homosexual
          activities carried out consensually by the appellants
          with each other and with other persons. Following upon a
          ruling of the trial judge that consent of the other
          participant (the receiver) was no defence to the charges
          the appellants pleaded guilty and were duly sentenced.
          Their appeals against the judge&rsquo;s ruling were
          dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which certified the
          following point of law as being of general public
          importance:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him
            actual bodily harm in the course of a sadomasochistic
            encounter, does the prosecution have to prove lack of
            consent on the part of B before they can establish
            A&rsquo;s guilt under section 20 or section 47 of the
            1861, Offences Against the Person Act.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Although the issue of consent was
          fundamental and indeed common to all five appeals the
          appellants did not lack for representation since no less
          than four Queen&rsquo;s Counsel and one junior counsel
          addressed your Lordships on their behalf on different
          aspects of this matter.</p>

          <p class="text2">The facts giving rise to the charges
          came to light as a result of police investigation into
          other matters. It was common ground that the receivers
          had neither complained to the police nor suffered any
          permanent injury as a result of the activities of the
          appellants. Although the incidents giving rise to each
          charge were the subject of a video-recording, these
          recordings were made not for sale at a profit but for the
          benefit of those members of the &lsquo;ring&rsquo;, if
          one may so describe it, who had not had the opportunity
          of witnessing the events in person. Your Lordships were
          further informed that the activities of the appellants,
          who are middle-aged men, were conducted in secret and in
          a highly controlled manner, that code words were used by
          the receiver when he could no longer bear the pain
          inflicted upon him and that when fish-hooks were inserted
          through the penis they were sterilised first. None of the
          appellants however had any medical qualifications and
          there was, of course, no referee present such as there
          would be in a boxing or football match.</p>

          <p class="text2">The basic argument propounded by all the
          appellants was that the receivers having in every case
          consented to what was inflicted upon them no offence had
          been committed against s 20 or s 47 of the 1861 Act. All
          the appellants recognised however that so broad a
          proposition could not stand up and that there must be
          some limitation upon the harm which an individual could
          consent to receive at the hand of another. The line
          between injuries to the infliction of which an individual
          could consent and injuries to whose infliction he could
          not consent must be drawn it was argued where the public
          interest required. Thus except in the case of regulated
          sports the public interest required that injuries should
          not be inflicted in public where they might give rise to
          a breach of the peace. Baroness Mallalieu QC, for Jaggard
          argued that injuries to which consent would be irrelevant
          were those which resulted in actual expense to the public
          by reason, for example, of the expenses of hospital or
          other medical treatment, or payment of some benefit. Such
          injuries would be likely to be serious and to be
          appropriate to a s 20 charge, whereas the consensual
          infliction of less serious injuries would not constitute
          an offence. Furthermore the presence of hostility was an
          essential element in the offence of assault, which
          element was necessarily lacking where a valid consent was
          present. Miss Worrall QC for Laskey maintained that
          everyone had a right to consent to the infliction on
          himself of bodily harm not amounting to serious harm or
          maiming, at which point public interest intervened. She
          further argued that having regard to the common law
          offence of keeping a disorderly house and to the various
          offences created by the Sexual Offences Acts 1956 to 1976
          it was inappropriate to use the 1861 Act for the
          prosecution of sexual offences because the public
          interest was adequately looked after by the common law
          offence and the later Acts. Mr Kershen QC for Brown also
          argued that the 1861 Act was an inappropriate weapon to
          use in these cases. He submitted that, while deliberate
          infliction of injury resulting in serious bodily harm
          might be an offence whether or not consent was given,
          deliberate consensual wounding would not be an offence if
          it did not cause serious bodily harm. This latter
          proposition would appear to draw the line somewhere down
          the middle of s 20. Mr Kershen further argued that if his
          primary submissions were wrong this House should, having
          regard to the current public interest in freedom of
          sexual expression, lay down new rules for
          sado-masochistic activities. Mr Thwaites QC for Carter
          traced the history of the offence of maiming, which
          deprived the King of possible service, invited your
          Lordships to hold that <i>R v Donovan</i> [1934] 2 KB
          498, [1934] All ER Rep 207 and <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s
          Reference</i>(<i>No 6 of 1980</i>) [1981] 2 All ER 1057,
          [1981] QB 715, to which I shall refer later, were wrongly
          decided and submitted that as a matter of principle a man
          could lawfully consent to the infliction of any injury
          upon himself which fell short of maiming.</p>

          <p class="text2">In concluding that the consent of the
          receivers was immaterial to the offences charged the
          Court of Appeal relied on three cases, namely <i>R v
          Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534, <i>R v Donovan</i> [1934] 2
          KB 498, [1934] All ER Rep 207 and <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s
          Reference</i>(<i>No 6 of 1980</i>) [1981] 2 All ER 1057,
          [1981] QB 715. Before examining these cases it is
          interesting to look at the definitions of
          &lsquo;maim&rsquo; and &lsquo;assault&rsquo; in
          <i>Hawkins&rsquo; Pleas of the Crown</i> (1 Hawk PC (8th
          edn, 1824) ch 15). Maiming is defined as &lsquo;&hellip;
          such a hurt of any part of a man&rsquo;s body whereby he
          is rendered less able, in fighting, either to defend
          himself or to annoy his adversary &hellip;&rsquo; (see p
          107, s 1). Examples are then given. Assault is defined as
          &lsquo;&hellip; an attempt to offer, with force and
          violence, to do a corporal hurt to another&rsquo; (see p
          110, s 1) and battery as &lsquo;&hellip; any injury
          whatsoever be it never so small, being actually done to
          the person of a man in an angry, revengeful, rude, or
          insolent manner &hellip;&rsquo; (see p 110, s 2). It is
          to be noted that lack of consent of the victim is stated
          to be a necessary ingredient neither of assault nor of
          battery. In <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 the 11
          judges who heard the case held that a prize-fight was
          unlawful, that all persons aiding and abetting therein
          were guilty of assault and that consent of the persons
          actually engaged in fighting to the interchange of blows
          did not afford any answer to the criminal charge of
          common assault. The appellants were spectators at an
          organised fight between two men near a public road. Cave
          J said (at 539):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The true view is, I think, that a blow struck in
            anger, or which is likely or is intended to do corporal
            hurt, is an assault, but that a blow struck in sport,
            and not likely, nor intended to cause bodily harm, is
            not an assault, and that, an assault being a breach of
            the peace and unlawful, the consent of the person
            struck is immaterial. If this view is correct a blow
            struck in a prize-fight is clearly an assault; but
            playing with single-sticks or wrestling do not involve
            an assault; nor does boxing with gloves in the ordinary
            way, and not with the ferocity and severe punishment to
            the boxers deposed to in <i>Reg</i>. v. <i>Orton</i>
            ((1878) 39 LT 293).&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Stephen J said (at 549):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The principle as to consent seems to me to be
            this: When one person is indicted for inflicting
            personal injury upon another, the consent of the person
            who sustains the injury is no defence to the person who
            inflicts the injury, if the injury is of such a nature,
            or is inflicted under such circumstances, that its
            infliction is injurious to the public as well as to the
            person injured. But the injuries given and received in
            prize-fights are injurious to the public, both because
            it is against the public interest that the lives and
            the health of the combatants should be endangered by
            blows, and because prize-fights are disorderly
            exhibitions, mischievous on many obvious grounds.
            Therefore the consent of the parties to the blows which
            they mutually received does not prevent those blows
            from being assaults.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">In this passage Stephen J clearly
          considered that prize-fights were likely to cause
          breaches of the peace and that no consent could render
          fights with such a result lawful. In a later passage he
          said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;In cases where life and limb are exposed to no
            serious danger in the common course of things, I think
            that consent is a defence to a charge of assault, even
            when considerable force is used, as, for instance, in
            cases of wrestling, single-stick, sparring with gloves,
            football, and the like; but in all cases the question
            whether consent does or does not take from the
            application of force to another its illegal character,
            is a question of degree depending upon
            circumstances.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In this passage he appears to be
          considering organised sports where danger to life and
          limb is merely incidental to the main purpose of the
          activity. Hawkins J said (at 553):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;As a general proposition it is undoubtedly true
            that there can be no assault unless the act charged as
            such be done without the consent of the person alleged
            to be assaulted, for want of consent is an essential
            element in every assault, and that which is done by
            consent is no assault at all &hellip; it is not in the
            power of any man to give an effectual consent to that
            which amounts to, or has a direct tendency to create, a
            breach of the peace; so as to bar a criminal
            prosecution.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Hawkins J concluded that every fight in
          which the object and intent of each of the combatants was
          to subdue the other by violent blows tending to a breach
          of the peace was illegal and he distinguished friendly
          encounters in the follow passage (at 554):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The cases in which it has been held that persons
            may lawfully engage in friendly encounters not
            calculated to produce real injury to or to rouse angry
            passions in either, do not in the least militate
            against the view I have expressed; for such encounters
            are neither breaches of the peace nor are they
            calculated to be productive thereof &hellip;&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">It is obvious that in concluding that
          prize-fights were unlawful he was influenced mainly, if
          not entirely, by the fact that they were likely to be
          productive of breaches of the peace. Furthermore, it
          would in my view be wrong to treat the first cited dictum
          of Hawkins J as referring to all assaults irrespective of
          the gravity thereof. The court was considering a charge
          of common assault and I do not think that the learned
          judge was intending to lay down a general principle which
          was applicable also to assaults charged under s 47 of the
          1861 Act or to offences under s 20 thereof. Lord
          Coleridge CJ similarly concluded that the combatants in a
          prize-fight could not consent to commit a breach of the
          peace (at 567).</p>

          <p class="text2">Although there was unanimity among the
          judges in <i>R v Coney</i> as to consent in the
          particular circumstances affording no answer to a charge
          of assault, there were differing reasons advanced for
          reaching that conclusion. However, Cave, Stephen and
          Hawkins JJ and Lord Coleridge CJ all considered that
          effectual consent could not be given to blows producing
          or likely to produce a breach of the peace. Stephen J
          specifically referred to prize-fights being injurious to
          the public as disorderly exhibitions and it may be
          assumed that the other three judges also had in mind the
          public interest in preventing breaches of the peace.
          Given the fact that the fight took place before a crowd
          of more than 100 persons the likelihood of a breach of
          the peace would by itself have been sufficient to
          negative consent without considering the nature and
          effect of the blows struck. Nevertheless, Stephen J also
          considered that it was against the public interest that
          blows should endanger the health of the combatants.
          Whether he had in mind only blows which produced a maim
          is not stated although in the editions of his <i>Digest
          of the Criminal Law</i> published before and after <i>R v
          Coney</i> he stated (3rd edn (1883) pp 141&ndash;142, art
          206): &lsquo;Every one has a right to consent to the
          infliction upon himself of bodily harm not amounting to a
          maim.&rsquo; I do not find great assistance in <i>R v
          Coney</i> towards the immediate resolution of the
          questions raised in these appeals where the offences
          charged were statutory and where no question of breach of
          the peace arose. I would therefore sum up my analysis of
          <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 by concluding that it
          is authority for the proposition that the public interest
          limits the extent to which an individual may consent to
          infliction upon himself by another of bodily harm and
          that such public interest does not intervene in the case
          of sports where any infliction of injury is merely
          incidental to the purpose of the main activity.</p>

          <p class="text2">In <i>R v Donovan</i> [1934] 2 KB 498,
          [1934] All ER Rep 207 the appellant was charged with
          indecent and common assault upon a girl whom he had
          beaten with her consent for his own sexual gratification.
          In delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal
          Appeal Swift J, after citing the passage in the judgment
          of Cave J in <i>R v Coney</i> 8 QBD 534 at 539, to which
          I have already referred, said ([1934] 2 KB 498 at 507,
          [1934] All ER Rep 207 at 210):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;If an act is unlawful in the sense of being in
            itself a criminal act, it is plain that it cannot be
            rendered lawful because the person to whose detriment
            it is done consents to it. No person can license
            another to commit a crime. So far as the criminal law
            is concerned, therefore, where the act charged is in
            itself unlawful, it can never be necessary to prove
            absence of consent on the part of the person wronged in
            order to obtain the conviction of the wrongdoer. There
            are, however, many acts in themselves harmless and
            lawful which become unlawful only if they are done
            without the consent of the person affected. What is, in
            one case, an innocent act of familiarity or affection,
            may, in another, be an assault, for no other reason
            than that, in the one case there is consent, and in the
            other consent is absent. As a general rule, although it
            is a rule to which there are well established
            exceptions, it is an unlawful act to beat another
            person with such a degree of violence that the
            infliction of bodily harm is a probable consequence,
            and when such an act is proved, consent is
            immaterial.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Swift J also observed that the passage
          from <i>Stephen&rsquo;s Digest of the Criminal Law</i>
          which I have quoted above needed considerable
          qualification in 1934. He went on to consider exceptions
          to the general rule that an act likely or intended to
          cause bodily harm is an unlawful act. Such exceptions
          included friendly contests with cudgels, foils or
          wrestling which were capable of causing bodily harm,
          rough and undisciplined sports or play where there was no
          anger and no intention to cause bodily harm and
          reasonable chastisement by a parent or a person in loco
          parentis. He might also have added necessary surgery.
          After referring to the fact that if the appellant acted
          so as to cause bodily harm he could not plead the
          gratification of his perverted desires as an excuse,
          Swift J said ([1934] 2 KB 498 at 509, [1934] All ER Rep
          207 at 211&ndash;212):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Always supposing, therefore, that the blows
            which he struck were likely or intended to do bodily
            harm, we are of opinion that he was doing an unlawful
            act, no evidence having been given of facts which would
            bring the case within any of the exceptions to the
            general rule. In our view, on the evidence given at the
            trial, the jury should have been directed that, if they
            were satisfied that the blows struck by the prisoner
            were likely or intended to do bodily harm to the
            prosecutrix, they ought to convict him, and that it was
            only if they were not so satisfied, that it became
            necessary to consider the further question whether the
            prosecution had negatived consent. For this purpose we
            think that &ldquo;bodily harm&rdquo; has its ordinary
            meaning and includes any hurt or injury calculated to
            interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor.
            Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must, no
            doubt, be more than merely transient and
            trifling.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">It is clear from the report that the
          girl did in fact suffer actual bodily harm.</p>

          <p class="text2">In <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s
          Reference</i>(<i>No 6 of 1980</i>) [1981] 2 All ER 1057,

          fist-fight in a public street which resulted in actual
          bodily harm to the victim. The respondent was charged
          with assault causing actual bodily harm and was
          acquitted. The question referred to the Court of Appeal
          was ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at 1058, [1981] QB 715 at

          negative. Lord Lane CJ said ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at
          1059, [1981] QB 715 at 718&ndash;719):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Bearing in mind the various cases and the views
            of the textbook writers cited to us, and starting with
            the proposition that ordinarily an act consented to
            will not constitute an assault, the question is: at
            what point does the public interest require the court
            to hold otherwise?&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">He later said ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at
          1059, [1981] QB 715 at 719):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The answer to this question, in our judgment, is
            that it is not in the public interest that people
            should try to cause or should cause each other actual
            bodily harm for no good reason. Minor struggles are
            another matter. So, in our judgment, it is immaterial
            whether the act occurs in private or in public; it is
            an assault if actual bodily harm is intended and/or
            caused. This means that most fights will be unlawful
            regardless of consent. Nothing which we have said is
            intended to cast doubt on the accepted legality of
            properly conducted games and sports, lawful
            chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical
            interference, dangerous exhibitions etc. These apparent
            exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise
            of a legal right, in the case of chastisement or
            correction, or as needed in the public interest, in the
            other cases.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Although the reasoning in these two
          cases differs somewhat, the conclusion from each of them
          is clear, namely that the infliction of bodily harm
          without good reason is unlawful and that the consent of
          the victim is irrelevant. In <i>R v Boyea</i> (1992) 156
          JP 505 at 512&ndash;513, in which the appellant was
          convicted of indecent assault on a woman, Glidewell LJ,
          giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Criminal
          Division, said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The central proposition in <i>Donovan</i>
            ([1934] 2 KB 498, [1934] All ER Rep 207) is in our view
            consistent with the decision of the court in the
            <i>Attorney-General&rsquo;s Reference</i>
            [<i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i> (<i>No 6 of
            1980</i>) [1981] 2 All ER 1057, [1981] QB 715]. That
            proposition can be expressed as follows: an assault
            intended or which is likely to cause bodily harm,
            accompanied by indecency, is an offence irrespective of
            consent, provided that the injury is not
            &ldquo;transient or trifling&rdquo;.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Glidewell LJ went on to point out that
          having regard to the change in social attitude towards
          sexual relations &lsquo;transient and trivial&rsquo; must
          be understood in the light of conditions prevailing in
          1992 rather than in 1934.</p>

          <p class="text2">Before considering whether the above
          four cases were correctly decided and if so what
          relevance they have to these appeals, I must say a word
          about hostility. It was urged upon your Lordships that
          hostility on the part of the inflicter was an essential
          ingredient of assault and that this ingredient was
          necessarily lacking when injury was inflicted with the
          consent of the receiver. It followed that none of the
          activities in question constituted assault. The answer to
          this submission is to be found in the judgment of the
          Court of Appeal in Wilson v Pringle [1986] 2 All ER 440
          at 447, [1987] QB 237 at 253, where it was said, that
          hostility could not be equated with ill-will or
          malevolence. The judgment went on to state ([1986] 2 All
          ER 440 at 448, [1987] QB 237 at 253):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Take the example of the police officer in
            <i>Collins v Wilcock</i> [1984] 3 All ER 374, [1984] 1
            WLR 1172. She touched the woman deliberately, but
            without an intention to do more than restrain her
            temporarily. Nevertheless, she was acting unlawfully
            and in that way was acting with hostility.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">If the appellants&rsquo; activities in
          relation to the receivers were unlawful they were also
          hostile and a necessary ingredient of assault was
          present.</p>

          <p class="text2">It was accepted by all the appellants
          that a line had to be drawn somewhere between those
          injuries to which a person could consent to infliction
          upon himself and those which were so serious that consent
          was immaterial. They all agreed that assaults occasioning
          actual bodily harm should be below the line but there was
          disagreement as to whether all offences against s 20 of
          the 1861 Act should be above the line or only those
          resulting in grievous bodily harm. The four English cases
          to which I have referred were not concerned with the
          distinction between the various types of assault and did
          not therefore have to address the problem raised in these
          appeals. However it does appear that in <i>R v
          Donovan</i>, <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i>(<i>No 6
          of 1980</i>) and <i>R v Boyea</i> the infliction of
          actual bodily harm was considered to be sufficient to
          negative any consent. Indeed in <i>R v Donovan</i> and
          <i>R v Boyea</i> such injuries as were sustained by the
          two women could not have been described as in any way
          serious. Cave J in <i>R v Coney</i> appeared to take the
          same view. On the other hand, Stephen J in <i>R v
          Coney</i> appeared to consider that it required serious
          danger to life and limb to negative consent, a view which
          broadly accords with the passage in his digest to which I
          have already referred. A similar view was expressed by
          McInerney J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in
          <i>Pallante v Stadiums Pty Ltd</i> (<i>No 1</i>) [1976]
          VR 331.</p>

          <p class="text2">I prefer the reasoning of Cave J in <i>R
          v Coney</i> and of the Court of Appeal in the later three
          English cases which I consider to have been correctly
          decided. In my view the line properly falls to be drawn
          between assault at common law and the offence of assault
          occasioning actual bodily harm created by s 47 of the
          1861 Act, with the result that consent of the victim is
          no answer to anyone charged with the latter offence or
          with a contravention of s 20 unless the circumstances
          fall within one of the well-known exceptions such as
          organised sporting contests and games, parental
          chastisement or reasonable surgery. There is nothing in
          ss 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act to suggest that consent is
          either an essential ingredient of the offences or a
          defence thereto. If consent is to be an answer to a
          charge under s 47 but not to one under s 20, considerable
          practical problems would arise. It was held in <i>R v
          Savage</i>, <i>R v Parmenter</i> [1991] 4 All ER 698 at
          711, [1992] 1 AC 699 at 740 that a verdict of guilty of
          assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a permissible
          alternative verdict on a count alleging unlawful wounding
          contrary to s 20 (per Lord Ackner). A judge charging a
          jury in a s 20 case would therefore not only have to
          direct them as to the alternative verdict available under
          s 47, but also as to the consequences of consent in
          relation to that alternative only. Such direction would
          be more complex if consent was an answer to wounding
          under s 20 but not to the infliction of grievous bodily
          harm under the same section. These problems would not
          arise if consent is an answer only to common assault. I
          would therefore dispose of these appeals on the basis
          that the infliction of actual or more serious bodily harm
          is an unlawful activity to which consent is no answer. In
          reaching this conclusion I have not found it necessary to
          rely on the fact that the activities of the appellants
          were in any event unlawful inasmuch as they amounted to
          acts of gross indecency which, not having been committed
          in private, did not fall within s 1(1) of the Sexual
          Offences Act 1967. Notwithstanding the views which I have
          come to, I think it right to say something about the
          submissions that consent to the activity of the
          appellants would not be injurious to the public
          interest.</p>

          <p class="text2">Considerable emphasis was placed by the
          appellants on the well-ordered and secret manner in which
          their activities were conducted and upon the fact that
          these activities had resulted in no injuries which
          required medical attention. There was, it was said, no
          question of proselytising by the appellants. This latter
          submission sits ill with the following passage in the
          judgment of Lord Lane CJ (94 Cr App R 302 at 310):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;They [Laskey and Cadman] recruited new
            participants: they jointly organised proceedings at the
            house where much of this activity took place; where
            much of the pain inflicting equipment was stored.
            Cadman was a voyeur rather than a sado-masochist, but
            both he and Laskey through their operations at the
            Horwich premises were responsible in part for the
            corruption of a youth &ldquo;K&rdquo; to whom the
            judge, rightly in our view, paid particular attention.
            It is some comfort at least to be told, as we were,
            that &ldquo;K&rdquo; is now it seems settled into a
            normal heterosexual relationship.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Be that as it may, in considering the
          public interest it would be wrong to look only at the
          activities of the appellants alone, there being no
          suggestion that they and their associates are the only
          practitioners of homosexual sado-masochism in England and
          Wales. This House must therefore consider the possibility
          that these activities are practised by others and by
          others who are not so controlled or responsible as the
          appellants are claimed to be. Without going into details
          of all the rather curious activities in which the
          appellants engaged, it would appear to be good luck
          rather than good judgment which has prevented serious
          injury from occurring. Wounds can easily become septic if
          not properly treated, the free flow of blood from a
          person who is HIV positive or who has AIDS can infect
          another and an inflicter who is carried away by sexual
          excitement or by drink or drugs could very easily inflict
          pain and injury beyond the level to which the receiver
          had consented. Your Lordships have no information as to
          whether such situations have occurred in relation to
          other sado-masochistic practitioners. It was no doubt
          these dangers which caused Baroness Mallalieu to restrict
          her propositions in relation to the public interest to
          the actual rather than the potential result of the
          activity. In my view such a restriction is quite
          unjustified. When considering the public interest
          potential for harm is just as relevant as actual harm. As
          Mathew J said in <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 at
          547:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;There is, however, abundant authority for saying
            that no consent can render that innocent which is in
            fact dangerous.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Furthermore, the possibility of
          proselytisation and corruption of young men is a real
          danger even in the case of these appellants and the
          taking of video-recordings of such activities suggests
          that secrecy may not be as strict as the appellants
          claimed to your Lordships. If the only purpose of the
          activity is the sexual gratification of one or both of
          the participants what then is the need of a
          video-recording?</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords I have no doubt that it would
          not be in the public interest that deliberate infliction
          of actual bodily harm during the course of homosexual
          sado-masochistic activities should be held to be lawful.
          In reaching this conclusion I have regard to the
          information available in these appeals and of such
          inferences as may be drawn therefrom. I appreciate that
          there may be a great deal of information relevant to
          these activities which is not available to your
          Lordships. When Parliament passed the Sexual Offences Act
          1967 which made buggery and acts of gross indecency
          between consenting males lawful it had available the
          <i>Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offences and
          Prostitution</i> (the Wolfenden Report) (Cmnd 247
          (1957)), which was the product of an exhaustive research
          into the problem. If it is to be decided that such
          activities as the nailing by A of B&rsquo;s foreskin or
          scrotum to a board or the insertion of hot wax into
          C&rsquo;s urethra followed by the burning of his penis
          with a candle or the incising of D&rsquo;s scrotum with a
          scalpel to the effusion of blood are injurious neither to
          B, C and D nor to the public interest then it is for
          Parliament with its accumulated wisdom and sources of
          information to declare them to be lawful.</p>

          <p class="text2">Two further matters only require to be
          mentioned. There was argument as to whether consent,
          where available, was a necessary ingredient of the
          offence of assault or merely a defence. There are
          conflicting dicta as to its effect. In <i>R v Coney</i>
          (1882) 8 QBD 534 at 549 Stephen J referred to consent as
          being &lsquo;no defence&rsquo;, whereas in
          <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i> (No 6 of 1980) [1981]
          2 All ER 1057 at 1058, [1981] QB 715 at 718 Lord Lane CJ
          referred to the onus being on the prosecution to negative
          consent. In <i>Collins v Wilcock</i> [1984] 3 All ER 374
          at 378, [1984] 1 WLR 1172 at 1177 Robert Goff LJ referred
          to consent being a defence to a battery. If it were
          necessary, which it is not, in this appeal to decide
          which argument was correct I would hold that consent was
          a defence to but not a necessary ingredient in
          assault.</p>

          <p class="text2">The second matter is the argument that
          the appellants should have been charged under the Sexual
          Offences Act 1956 and not under the 1861 Act. The
          appellants could within the time limit have been charged
          under the 1956 Act with committing acts of gross
          indecency. However that Act contained no provision
          limiting the effect of ss 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act to
          offences unconnected with sex. The Wolfenden Report in
          considering gross indecency between males took the view
          that it usually took one of three forms, of which none
          involved the deliberate infliction of injury. Your
          Lordships were referred to no material which suggested
          that Parliament, when enacting the 1967 Act, had in
          contemplation the type of activities engaged in by the
          appellants. These activities necessarily comprehended
          acts of gross indecency as referred to in s 13 of the
          1956 Act and s 1(7) of the 1967 Act. However, the
          Wolfenden Report para 105 states that from police reports
          seen by the committee and other evidence acts of gross
          indecency usually take one of the three forms in which
          none involves violence or injury. The activities of the
          appellants thus went far beyond the sort of conduct
          contemplated by the legislature in the foregoing
          statutory provisions and I consider that they were
          unlawful even when carried out in private. In these
          circumstances there exists no reason why the appellants
          should not have been charged under the 1861 Act.</p>

          <p class="text2">I cannot usefully add anything to what
          my noble and learned friend Lord Templeman has said in
          relation to the appellants&rsquo; argument on arts 7 and
          8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
          and Fundamental Freedom (Rome, 4 November 1950; TS 71
          (1953); Cmd 8969).</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, I would answer the certified
          question in the negative and dismiss the appeals.</p>

          <p class="text1"><a id="lowry" name="lowry"></a><b>LORD
          LOWRY.</b> My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading
          in draft the speeches of your Lordships. I agree with the
          reasoning and conclusions of my noble and learned friends
          Lord Templeman and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and I,
          too, would answer the certified question in the negative
          and dismiss the appeals.</p>

          <p class="text2">In stating my own further reasons for
          this view I shall address myself exclusively to the cases
          in which, as has been informally agreed, one person has
          acted upon another in private, occasioning him actual
          bodily harm but nothing worse.</p>

          <p class="text2">The appellants&rsquo; main point is
          that, contrary to the view of the trial judge and the
          Court of Appeal, the consent of the victim, as I shall
          call the willing recipient of the sado-masochistic
          treatment, constitutes a defence to the charges of
          assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 47
          of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and of
          wounding contrary to s 20 of the 1861 Act (no more than
          actual bodily harm being occasioned) or, to put it
          another way, that, when the victim consents, no such
          offence of assault or wounding as I have described takes
          place.</p>

          <p class="text2">Under the law which formerly held sway
          (and which has been thoroughly described and analysed by
          my noble and learned friend Lord Mustill) consent was a
          defence to a charge of common assault but not to a charge
          of mayhem or maiming. Everyone agrees that consent
          remains a complete defence to a charge of common assault
          and nearly everyone agrees that consent of the victim is
          not a defence to a charge of inflicting really serious
          personal injury (or &lsquo;grievous bodily harm&rsquo;).
          The disagreement concerns offences which occasion actual
          bodily harm: the appellants contend that the consent of
          the victim is a defence to one charged with such an
          offence, while the respondent submits that consent is not
          a defence. I agree with the respondent&rsquo;s contention
          for reasons which I now explain.</p>

          <p class="text2">The 1861 Act was one of several laudable
          but untidy Victorian attempts to codify different areas
          of the law. From the accusation of untidiness I must
          exempt such measures as the Bills of Exchange Act 1882
          and the Sale of Goods Act 1893, but in regard to the 1861
          Act I would adopt the words of para 7.4 of the Law
          Commission&rsquo;s Consultation Paper No 122,
          <i>Legislating the Criminal Code</i>: <i>Offences against
          the Person and General Principles</i> (1992):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act are not
            part of a comprehensive legislative code, were not
            drafted with a view to setting out the various offences
            with which they deal in a logical or graded manner; in
            some cases do not create offences, but merely state the
            punishment for what is regarded as an existing common
            law offence; and, above all, in so doing employ
            terminology that was difficult to understand even in
            1861. The sections are virtually the only significant
            part of the extensive series of criminal law statutes
            passed in 1861 that still remains on the statute book.
            Those Acts as a whole attracted early criticism, not
            least from Sir [James] Fitzjames Stephen [in a letter
            to Sir John Holker, 20 January 1877 cited by Sir Rupert
            Cross in Glazebrook (ed) <i>Reshaping the Criminal
            Law</i> (1978) p 10]: &ldquo;Their arrangement is so
            obscure, their language so lengthy and cumbrous, and
            they are based upon and assume the existence of so many
            singular common law principles that no-one who was not
            already well acquainted with the law would derive any
            information from reading them.&rdquo; More recent
            critics have agreed with these strictures describing
            the 1861 Act as &ldquo;piece-meal legislation&rdquo;,
            which is a &ldquo;rag-bag of offences brought together
            from a wide variety of sources with no attempt, as the
            draftsman frankly acknowledged, to introduce
            consistency as to substance or as to form&rdquo; [see
            Professor J C Smith in his commentary on <i>R v
            Parmenter</i> [1991] 2 All ER 225, [1992] 1 AC 699, CA
            ([1991] Crim LR 43) cited in <i>R v Savage</i>, <i>R v

            699 at 752, HL].&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">The 1861 Act has not the form or
          substance of a true consolidation but, with
          acknowledgments to the work of C S Greaves QC
          (<i>Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts</i>
          (2nd edn, 1862) pp xxvi, 52&ndash;53, 76), Law Commission
          Consultation Paper No 122 traces s 18 of the 1861 Act to
          s 4 of the Act 7 Will 4 &amp; 1 Vict c 85 (offences
          against the person (1837)), s 20 to s 29 of the Act 10
          Geo 4, c 34 (offences against the person (Ireland)
          (1829)) and s 47 to s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act
          1851). I do not think, however, that it would be helpful
          to your Lordships for me to go further back than the 1861
          Act itself.</p>

          <p class="text2">It follows that the indications to be
          gathered from the 1861 Act are not precise. Nevertheless,
          I consider that it contains fairly clear signs that, with
          regard to the relevance of the victim&rsquo;s consent as
          a defence, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and
          wounding which results in actual bodily harm are not
          offences &lsquo;below the line&rsquo;, to be ranked with
          common assault as offences in connection with which the
          victim&rsquo;s consent provides a defence, but offences
          &lsquo;above the line&rsquo;, to be ranked with
          inflicting grievous bodily harm and the other more
          serious offences in connection with which the
          victim&rsquo;s consent does not provide a defence. The
          sections in question, in their original form, read as
          follows:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>18.</b> Whosoever shall
            unlawfully and maliciously by any Means whatsoever
            wound or cause any grievous bodily Harm to any Person,
            or shoot at any Person, or, by drawing a Trigger or in
            any other Manner, attempt to discharge any Kind of
            loaded Arms at any Person, with Intent, in any of the
            Cases aforesaid, to maim, disfigure, or disable any
            Person, or to do some other grievous bodily Harm to any
            Person, or with Intent to resist or prevent the lawful
            Apprehension or Detainer of any Person, shall be guilty
            of Felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable,
            at the Discretion of the Court, to be kept in Penal
            Servitude for Life or for any Term not less than Three
            Years,&mdash;or to be imprisoned for any Term not
            exceeding Two Years, with or without Hard Labour, and
            with or without Solitary Confinement
            &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>20.</b> Whosoever shall
            unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any
            grievous bodily Harm upon any other Person, either with
            or without any Weapon or Instrument, shall be guilty of
            a Misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be
            liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be kept in
            Penal Servitude for the Term of Three Years, or to be
            imprisoned for any Term not exceeding Two Years, with
            or without Hard Labour &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>47.</b>
            Whosoever shall be convicted upon an Indictment of any
            Assault occasioning actual bodily Harm shall be liable,
            at the discretion of the Court, to be kept in Penal
            Servitude for the Term of Three Years, or to be
            imprisoned for any Term not exceeding Two Years, [with]
            or without Hard Labour; and whosoever shall be
            convicted upon an Indictment for a common Assault shall
            be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be
            imprisoned for any Term not exceeding One Year, with or
            without Hard Labour.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">I suggest that the following points
          should be noted. (1) Offences against s 18 were felonies,
          but offences against ss 20 and 47 were misdemeanours.
          Therefore s 20 was not associated with s 18 and separated
          from s 47 by categorisation. (2) Although s 47 appears to
          describe a less serious offence than s 20, the maximum
          penalty was the same. Equality was maintained at five
          years&rsquo; imprisonment after the distinction between
          felony and misdemeanour was abolished. (3) Wounding is
          associated in ss 18 and 20 with the infliction of
          grievous bodily harm and is naturally thought of as a
          serious offence, but it may involve anything from a minor
          breaking or puncture of the skin to a near fatal injury.
          Thus wounding may simply occasion actual bodily harm or
          it may inflict grievous bodily harm. If the
          victim&rsquo;s consent is a defence to occasioning actual
          bodily harm, then, so far as concerns the proof of guilt,
          the line is drawn, as my noble and learned friend Lord
          Jauncey of Tullichettle puts it, &lsquo;somewhere down
          the middle of s 20&rsquo;, which I would regard as a most
          unlikely solution. (4) According to the appellants&rsquo;
          case, if an accused person charged with wounding relies
          on consent as a defence, the jury will have to find
          whether anything more than actual bodily harm was
          occasioned, something which is not contemplated by s 20.
          (5) The distinction between common assault and all other
          attacks on the person is that common assault does not
          necessarily involve significant bodily injury. It is much
          easier to draw the line between significant injury and
          some injury than to differentiate between degrees of
          injury. It is also more logical, because for one person
          to inflict any injury on another without good reason is
          an evil in itself (malum in se) and contrary to public
          policy. (6) That consent is a defence to a charge of
          common assault is a common law doctrine which the 1861
          Act has done nothing to change.</p>

          <p class="text2">The proposition that the line of
          &lsquo;victim&rsquo;s consent&rsquo; is regarded as drawn
          just above common assault gains support from the wording
          of cl 8(1) of the Bill attached to Law Commission
          Consultation Paper No 122 (see para 9.10):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;A person is guilty of assault if&mdash;(/a/) he
            intentionally or recklessly applies force to or causes
            an impact on the body of another, (i) without the
            consent of the other; or (ii) where the act is likely
            or intended to cause injury, with or without the
            consent of the other; or (/b/) he intentionally or
            recklessly, without the consent of the other, causes
            the other to believe that any such force or impact is
            imminent.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, on looking at the cases, I get
          little help from <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534, which
          was much canvassed at the hearing of the appeal and on
          which your Lordships, necessarily, have commented. The
          case contains a number of inconclusive and sometimes
          conflicting statements, but it was generally agreed (the
          charge being one of common assault) that consent was no
          defence to that which amounted to, or had a direct
          tendency to create, a breach of the peace. The only
          support for the present appellants is found in the
          judgment of Stephen J (at 549):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;In cases where life and limb are exposed to no
            serious danger in the common course of things, I think
            that consent is a defence to a charge of assault, even
            when considerable force is used &hellip;&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">The learned judge developed this view in
          his <i>Digest of the Criminal Law</i>, where he stated
          that consent was a defence to a charge of assault
          occasioning actual bodily harm. <i>Archbold Criminal
          Pleading Evidence and Practice</i> adopted that
          statement, for which there is no other judicial
          authority, until it was disapproved in <i>R v Donovan</i>
          [1934] 2 KB 498, [1934] All ER Rep 207 and the editor of
          later editions of <i>Stephen&rsquo;s Digest of the
          Criminal Law</i> has abandoned the distinguished
          author&rsquo;s proposition.</p>

          <p class="text2">In <i>R v Donovan</i> the appellant had
          been convicted on two counts, indecent assault and common
          assault. The only issue of fact was whether the victim
          consented. The chairman of quarter sessions rightly told
          the jury that the case depended on the issue of consent.
          The jury must have rejected the appellant&rsquo;s
          evidence, but the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the
          chairman had misdirected the jury as to the burden of
          proof on the consent issue and quashed the conviction. It
          was obvious what had to be done once the court found
          misdirection on the vital issue, but it is instructive to
          note what happened. Lord Hewart CJ is reported as saying
          at the conclusion of argument (25 Cr App R 1 at 4):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;We have come to the conclusion that this trial,
            dealing as it did with a revolting matter, was in
            various ways unsatisfactory. The Court is compelled,
            however reluctantly, to take the view that in the
            circumstances this conviction cannot safely be upheld
            and that this appeal must be allowed. The matter
            involves, however, more than one question of importance
            and we propose therefore to give our reasons for our
            decision upon a later day.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Five weeks later Swift J delivered the
          judgment of the court, disposing first of the consent
          issue and another point (see [1934] 2 KB 498, [1934] All
          ER Rep 207). He then dealt with the question which has
          some relevance to the present appeals and which he
          introduced as follows ([1934] 2 KB 498 at 506, [1934] All
          ER Rep 207 at 210):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;This conclusion would have been enough to
            dispose of the case were it not for the fact that the
            learned counsel for the Crown relied in this Court upon
            the submission which he had unsuccessfully made at the
            trial, and argued that, this being a case in which it
            was unnecessary for the Crown to prove absence of
            consent, this Court ought not to quash the
            conviction.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">A doctor who gave evidence for the Crown
          had said that marks on the girl&rsquo;s body two days
          after the incident indicated &lsquo;a fairly severe
          beating&rsquo;; therefore clearly actual bodily harm had
          been caused. The judgment continued: &lsquo;We have given
          careful consideration to the question of law which this
          submission raises.&rsquo; Then, having noted observations
          of Cave J in <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 334 at 539,
          the judge said ([1934] 2 KB 498 at 507, [1934] All ER Rep
          207 at 210&ndash;211):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;We have considered the authorities upon which
            this view of the learned judge was founded, and we
            think it of importance that we should state our opinion
            as to the law applicable in this case. If an act is
            unlawful in the sense of being in itself a criminal
            act, it is plain that it cannot be rendered lawful
            because the person to whose detriment it is done
            consents to it. No person can license another to commit
            a crime. So far as the criminal law is concerned,
            therefore, where <i>the act charged</i> is in itself
            unlawful, it can never be necessary to prove absence of
            consent on the part of the person wronged in order to
            obtain the conviction of the wrongdoer &hellip; As a
            general rule, although it is a rule to which there are
            well established exceptions, it is an unlawful act to
            beat another person with such a degree of violence that
            the infliction of bodily harm is a probable
            consequence, and when such an act is proved, consent is
            immaterial. We are aware that the existence of this
            rule has not always been clearly recognised. In his
            Digest of the Criminal Law (6th edn, 1904), Art. 227,
            Sir James FitzJames Stephen enunciates the proposition
            that &ldquo;every one has a right to consent to the
            infliction upon himself of bodily harm not amounting to
            a maim.&rdquo; This may have been true in early times
            when the law of this country showed remarkable leniency
            towards crimes of personal violence, but it is a
            statement which now needs considerable
            qualification.&rsquo; (My emphasis.)
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Having referred to <i>East&rsquo;s Pleas
          of the Crown</i> and <i>Foster&rsquo;s Crown Law</i> (3rd
          edn, 1809) p 259, Swift J stated ([1934] 2 KB 498 at 508,
          [1934] All ER Rep 207 at 211):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;If an act is malum in se in the sense in which
            Sir Michael Foster used the words, that is to say, is,
            in itself, unlawful, we take it to be plain that
            consent cannot convert it into an innocent act.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Having then mentioned the &lsquo;well
          established exceptions&rsquo; to the general rule that an
          act likely or intended to cause bodily harm is an
          unlawful act, he continued ([1934] 2 KB 498 at 509,
          [1934] All ER Rep 207 at 211&ndash;212):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;In the present case it was not in dispute that
            the motive of the appellant was to gratify his own
            perverted desires. If, in the course of so doing, he
            acted so as to cause bodily harm, he cannot plead his
            corrupt motive as an excuse, and it may truly be said
            of him in Sir Michael Foster&rsquo;s words that
            &ldquo;he certainly beat him with an intention of doing
            him some bodily harm, he had no other intent,&rdquo;
            and that what he did was malum in se. Nothing could be
            more absurd or more repellent to the ordinary
            intelligence than to regard his conduct as comparable
            with that of a participant in one of those &ldquo;manly
            diversions&rdquo; of which Sir Michael Foster wrote.
            Nor is his act to be compared with the rough but
            innocent horse-play in <i>Reg</i>. v. <i>Bruce</i>
            ((1847) 2 Cox CC 262). Always supposing, therefore,
            that the blows which he struck were likely or intended
            to do bodily harm, we are of opinion that he was doing
            an unlawful act, no evidence having been given of facts
            which would bring the case within any of the exceptions
            to the general rule. In our view, on the evidence given
            at the trial, the jury should have been directed that,
            if they were satisfied that the blows struck by the
            prisoner were likely or intended to do bodily harm to
            the prosecutrix, they ought to convict him, and that it
            was only if they were not so satisfied, that it became
            necessary to consider the further question whether the
            prosecution had negatived consent.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">This passage is followed by an
          explanation why, the question not having been put to the
          jury, the court did not feel that, consistently with its
          practice, it could uphold the conviction on the ground
          argued by Crown counsel.</p>

          <p class="text2">I find this part of the court&rsquo;s
          judgment hard to follow, when I recall the protest made
          at his trial by Sir Walter Raleigh to Sir Edward Coke
          ((1603) 2 State Tr 1 at 26): &lsquo;Mr Attorney, you
          should speak secundum allegata et probata.&rsquo; The
          rule that the Crown cannot otherwise recover is a
          universal proposition, not confined to trials of the high
          and mighty for treason. The prosecution must both
          <i>allege</i> and <i>prove</i>. There were two counts in
          the indictment, to which consent of the victim was a
          complete defence. If the jury, properly directed, had
          found that consent was not disproved, they must have
          acquitted the appellant of the only charges brought
          against him. How, then, could they have convicted the
          appellant of either of those charges or of the offence of
          assault, occasioning actual bodily harm, with which he
          was <i>not</i> charged? It will not be overlooked that
          the judgment ran, &lsquo;where <i>the act charged</i> is
          in itself unlawful&rsquo; (see [1934] 2 KB 498 at 507,
          1934] All ER Rep 207 at 210).</p>

          <p class="text2">Does the second part of the Court of
          Criminal Appeal&rsquo;s judgment therefore stand
          condemned in all respects? My Lords, I suggest not. It
          clearly indicates the view of the court that assault,
          occasioning actual bodily harm, is malum in se, an
          offence for which, absent one of the recognised
          exceptions, the accused will be convicted, even though
          the victim consents.</p>

          1980/) [1981] 2 All ER 1057, [1981] QB 715 was relied on
          by both sides before your Lordships. The charge was one
          of assault, occasioning actual bodily harm; the fight,
          between youths of 18 and 17 years, took place in the
          street; and the question referred was concerned with
          fighting <i>in public</i>. In giving judgment, however,
          the court expressly made no distinction between fighting
          in public and in private. Lord Lane CJ introduced the
          subject by saying ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at 1058, [1981]
          QB 715 at 718):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;We think that it can be taken as a starting
            point that it is an essential element of an assault
            that the act is done contrary to the will and without
            the consent of the victim; and it is doubtless for this
            reason that the burden lies on the prosecution to
            negative consent. Ordinarily, then, if the victim
            consents, the assailant is not guilty.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Then he said ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at
          1059, [1981] QB 715 at 718&ndash;719):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Bearing in mind the various cases and the views
            of the textbook writers cited to us, and starting with
            the proposition that ordinarily an act consented to
            will not constitute an assault, the question is: at
            what point does the public interest require the court
            to hold otherwise?&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">I would concede that the natural way in
          which to construe these passages is to the effect that
          (1) there is no assault if the act is consented to by the
          victim and (2) where the victim has consented, a factor
          directed to the public interest is needed in order to
          make the court hold that an offence has been committed.
          No doubt this is what caused Professor Glanville Williams
          in <i>Textbook of Criminal Law</i> (2nd edn, 1983) pp
          582&ndash;589 to express the view that, by vitiating the
          effect of the victim&rsquo;s consent in cases where the
          occasioning of physical harm seemed to be against the
          public interest, the courts were extending the law
          against assault and were legislating judicial
          paternalism.</p>

          <p class="text2">Lord Lane CJ then spoke of the need for
          a &lsquo;partly new approach&rsquo; (compared with that
          found in <i>R v Coney</i> and <i>R v Donovan</i>). He
          continued ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at 1059, [1981] QB 715 at
          719):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The answer to this question [at what point does
            the public interest require the court to hold
            otherwise?], in our judgment, is that it is not in the
            public interest that people should try to cause, or
            should cause, each other actual bodily harm for no good
            reason. Minor struggles are another matter. So, in our
            judgment, it is immaterial whether the act occurs in
            private or in public; it is an assault if actual bodily
            harm is intended and/or caused. This means that most
            fights will be unlawful regardless of consent.<br />
             

            <p class="text2">Nothing which we have said is intended
            to cast doubt upon the accepted legality of properly
            conducted games and sports, lawful chastisement or
            correction, reasonable surgical interference, dangerous
            exhibitions etc. These apparent exceptions can be
            justified as involving the exercise of a legal right,
            in the case of chastisement or correction, or as needed
            in the public interest, in the other cases.<br />
            </p>

            <p class="text2">Our answer to the point of law is No,
            but not (as the reference implies) because the fight
            occurred in a public place, but because, wherever it
            occurred, the participants would have been guilty of
            assault (subject to self-defence) if (as we understand
            was the case) they intended to and or did cause actual
            bodily harm.&rsquo;</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">The appellants submitted that this
          pronouncement was confined to fighting but, as Professor
          Glanville Williams pointed out, the contents of the
          second paragraph cited above appear to contradict this
          view. Thus we are left with the proposition that it is
          not in the public interest that people should try to
          cause, or should cause, each other actual bodily harm for
          no good reason and that it is an assault if actual bodily
          harm is caused (except for good reason).</p>

          <p class="text2">This principle was adopted in <i>R v
          McCoy</i> 1953 (2) SA 4 [SR] (although it was not
          required in order to decide the case), where the manager
          of an airline caned an air hostess, allegedly with her
          consent, as a punishment for failing to secure her seat
          belt when landing, and also by the Court of Appeal in
          <i>R v Boyea</i> (1992) 156 JP 505. I think that
          consideration of the 1861 Act and the indications to be
          derived from the cases together provide strong support
          for the Crown&rsquo;s case on the effect of consent on
          charges involving actual bodily harm. While saying this,
          I do not forget the danger of applying to a particular
          situation cases decided by judges who, in reaching their
          decisions, were not thinking of that situation at
          all.</p>

          <p class="text2">Let me now consider the judgment of the
          Court of Appeal in this case, delivered by Lord Lane CJ
          (see [1992] 2 All ER 552, [1992] QB 491). First, I agree
          with the disposal, brief as it was, of the
          appellants&rsquo; argument directed to the word
          &lsquo;hostility&rsquo;. On this point I gladly adopt
          everything which has been said by my noble and learned
          friend Lord Jauncey. I also concur in the summary
          dismissal of the argument that it was inappropriate for
          the Crown to have proceeded under the 1861 Act. There was
          a considerable delay and one may speculate that the
          prosecuting authorities had cast around for a suitable
          vehicle for their accusations before finally deciding to
          proceed under the 1861 Act in this unusual case, but the
          only way of meeting these charges otherwise than on the
          merits was to contend that they amounted to an abuse of
          process. This procedure was not resorted to, which is not
          surprising in the state of the authorities.</p>

          <p class="text2">Predictably, the appeal and the judgment
          in the Court of Appeal were mainly occupied with the
          effect of the victim&rsquo;s consent (see [1992] 2 All ER
          552 at 557&ndash;560, [1992] QB 491 at 497&ndash;500).
          Having cited <i>R v Donovan</i> [1934] 2 KB 498, [1934]
          All ER Rep 207 Lord Lane CJ drew attention to
          <i>Kenny&rsquo;s Outline of Criminal Law</i> (19th edn,
          1966) p 209 and <i>Archbold&rsquo;s Pleading Evidence and
          Practice in Criminal Cases</i> (43rd edn, 1988) para
          20&ndash;124 (see [1992] 2 All ER 552 at 558&ndash;599,
          [1992] QB 491 at 499) and went on to consider
          <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i>(<i>No 6 of 1980</i>)
          [1981] 2 All ER 1057, [1981] QB 715. Commenting on that
          case ([1981] 2 All ER 1057 at 1059, [1981] QB 715 at
          719), he said ([1992] 2 All ER 552 at 559, [1992] QB 491
          at 500):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;What may be &ldquo;good reason&rdquo; it is not
            necessary for us to decide. It is sufficient to say, so
            far as the instant case is concerned, that we agree
            with the trial judge that the satisfying of
            sado-masochistic libido does not come within the
            category of good reason nor can the injuries be
            described as merely transient or trifling.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">In the immediately following paragraph
          of his judgment Lord Lane CJ shows that what he said in
          <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i> (<i>No 6 of 1980</i>)
          was intended by him to be of general application:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;It was submitted to us that the facts in that
            case were so different from those in the instant case
            that the principle which is expressed in the answer to
            the Attorney General&rsquo;s question does not apply to
            the present circumstances. We disagree. In our judgment
            the principle as expressed in the reference does apply.
            Consequently for those reasons the question of consent
            was immaterial. The judge&rsquo;s ruling was
            accordingly correct.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">If, as I, too, consider, the question of
          consent is immaterial, there are prima facie offences
          against ss 20 and 47 and the next question is whether
          there is good reason to add sado-masochistic acts to the
          list of exceptions contemplated in <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s
          Reference</i>. In my opinion, the answer to that question
          is No.</p>

          <p class="text2">In adopting this conclusion I follow
          closely my noble and learned friends Lord Templeman and
          Lord Jauncey. What the appellants are obliged to propose
          is that the deliberate and painful infliction of physical
          injury should be exempted from the operation of statutory
          provisions the object of which is to prevent or punish
          that very thing, the reason for the proposed exemption
          being that both those who will inflict and those who will
          suffer the injury wish to satisfy a perverted and
          depraved sexual desire. Sado-masochistic homosexual
          activity cannot be regarded as conducive to the
          enhancement or enjoyment of family life or conducive to
          the welfare of society. A relaxation of the prohibitions
          in ss 20 and 47 can only encourage the practice of
          homosexual sado-masochism, with the physical cruelty that
          it must involve, (which can scarcely be regarded as a
          &lsquo;manly diversion&rsquo;) by withdrawing the legal
          penalty and giving the activity a judicial imprimatur. As
          well as all this, one cannot overlook the physical danger
          to those who may indulge in sado-masochism. In this
          connection, and also generally, it is idle for the
          appellants to claim that they are educated exponents of
          &lsquo;civilised cruelty&rsquo;. A proposed general
          exemption is to be tested by considering the likely
          general effect. This must include the probability that
          some sado-masochistic activity, under the powerful
          influence of the sexual instinct, will get out of hand
          and result in serious physical damage to the participants
          and that some activity will involve a danger of infection
          such as these particular exponents do not contemplate for
          themselves. When considering the danger of infection,
          with its inevitable threat of AIDS, I am not impressed by
          the argument that this threat can be discounted on the
          ground that, as long ago as 1967, Parliament, subject to
          conditions, legalised buggery, now a well-known vehicle
          for the transmission of AIDS.</p>

          <p class="text2">So far as I can see, the only
          counter-argument is that to place a restriction on
          sado-masochism is an unwarranted interference with the
          private life and activities of persons who are indulging
          in a lawful pursuit and are doing no harm to anyone
          except, possibly, themselves. This approach, which has
          characterised every submission put forward on behalf of
          the appellants, is derived from the fallacy that what is
          involved here is the restraint of a lawful activity as
          opposed to the refusal to relax existing prohibitions in
          the 1861 Act. If in the course of buggery, as authorised
          by the 1967 Act, one participant, either with the other
          participant&rsquo;s consent or not, deliberately causes
          actual bodily harm to that other, an offence against s 47
          has been committed. The 1967 Act provides no shield. The
          position is as simple as that, and there is <i>no legal
          right to cause actual bodily harm</i> in the course of
          sado-masochistic activity.</p>

          <p class="text2">As your Lordships have observed, the
          appellants have sought to fortify their argument by
          reference to the European Convention on Human Rights (see
          the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
          Fundamental Freedoms (Rome, 4 November 1950; TS 71
          (1953); Cmd 8969)). On the view which I have taken, art 7
          has no relevance since the question of retrospective
          legislation or a retrospective judicial decision does not
          arise. Article 8(1) of the convention states that
          everyone has the right to respect for his private and
          family life, his home and his correspondence. The attempt
          to rely on this article is another example of the
          appellants&rsquo; reversal of the onus of proof of
          legality, which disregards the effect of ss 20 and 47. I
          would only say, in the first place, that art 8 is not
          part of our law. Secondly, there has been no legislation
          which, being post-convention and ambiguous, falls to be
          construed so as to conform with the convention rather
          than to contradict it. And thirdly, if one is looking at
          art 8(2), no public authority can be said to have
          interfered with a <i>right</i> (to indulge in
          sado-masochism) by enforcing the provisions of the 1861
          Act. If, as appears to be the fact, sado-masochistic acts
          inevitably involve the occasioning of at least actual
          bodily harm, there cannot be a <i>right</i> under our law
          to indulge in them.</p>

          <p class="text2">For all these reasons I would answer No
          to the certified question and would dismiss the
          appeals.</p>

          <p class="text1"><a id="mustill"
          name="mustill"></a><b>LORD MUSTILL.</b> My Lords, this is
          a case about the criminal law of violence. In my opinion
          it should be a case about the criminal law of private
          sexual relations, if about anything at all. Right or
          wrong, the point is easily made. The speeches already
          delivered contain summaries of the conduct giving rise to
          the charges under the Offences against the Person Act
          1861 now before the House, together with other charges in
          respect of which the appellants have been sentenced, and
          no longer appeal. Fortunately for the reader my Lords
          have not gone on to describe other aspects of the
          appellants&rsquo; behaviour of a similar but more extreme
          kind which was not the subject of any charge on the
          indictment. It is sufficient to say that whatever the
          outsider might feel about the subject matter of the
          prosecutions&mdash;perhaps horror, amazement or
          incomprehension, perhaps sadness&mdash;very few could
          read even a summary of the other activities without
          disgust. The House has been spared the video tapes, which
          must have been horrible. If the criminality of sexual
          deviation is the true ground of these proceedings, one
          would have expected that these above all would have been
          the subject of attack. Yet the picture is quite
          different.</p>

          <p class="text2">The conduct of the appellants and of
          other co-accused was treated by the prosecuting
          authorities in three ways. First, there were those acts
          which fell squarely within the legislation governing
          sexual offences. These are easily overlooked, because
          attention has properly been concentrated on the charges
          which remain in dispute, but for a proper understanding
          of the case it is essential to keep them in view. Thus,
          four of the men pleaded guilty either as principals or as
          aiders and abettors to the charges of keeping a
          disorderly house. It is worth setting out, with
          abbreviations, the particulars of a typical charge:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;[GWC] on divers days between the 1st day of
            January 1979 and the 5th day of November 1987 at
            &hellip; Bolton, kept a disorderly house to which
            numerous persons resorted in order to take part in, and
            who did take part in, acts of sadistic and masochistic
            violence, and in accompanying acts of a lewd, immoral
            and unnatural kind. [IW, PJG, Colin Laskey and PJK] at
            the same times and at the same place did aid, abet,
            counsel and procure [GWC] to commit the said
            offence.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Laskey also pleaded guilty to two counts
          of publishing an obscene article. The articles in
          question were video tapes of the activities which formed
          the subject of some of the counts laid under the 1861
          Act.</p>

          <p class="text2">The pleas of guilty to these counts,
          which might be regarded as dealing quite comprehensively
          with those aspects of Laskey&rsquo;s sexual conduct which
          impinged directly on public order, attracted sentences of
          four years reduced on appeal to 18 months&rsquo;
          imprisonment and three months&rsquo; imprisonment
          respectively. Other persons, not before the House, were
          dealt with in a similar way.</p>

          <p class="text2">The two remaining categories of conduct
          comprised private acts. Some were prosecuted and are now
          before the House. Others, which I have mentioned, were
          not. If repugnance to general public sentiments of
          morality and propriety were the test, one would have
          expected proceedings in respect of the most disgusting
          conduct to be prosecuted with the greater vigour. Yet the
          opposite is the case. Why is this so? Obviously because
          the prosecuting authorities could find no statutory
          prohibition apt to cover this conduct. Whereas the sexual
          conduct which underlies the present appeals, although
          less extreme, could at least arguably be brought within
          ss 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act because it involved the
          breaking of skin and the infliction of more than trifling
          hurt.</p>

          <p class="text2">I must confess that this distribution of
          the charges against the appellants at once sounds a note
          of warning. It suggests that the involvement of the 1861
          Act was adventitious. This impression is reinforced when
          one considers the title of the statute under which the
          appellants are charged, &lsquo;Offences against the
          Person&rsquo;. Conduct infringing ss 18, 20 and 47 of the
          1861 Act comes before the Crown Court every day.
          Typically it involves brutality, aggression and violence,
          of a kind far removed from the appellants&rsquo;
          behaviour which, however worthy of censure, involved no
          animosity, no aggression, no personal rancour on the part
          of the person inflicting the hurt towards the recipient
          and no protest by the recipient. In fact, quite the
          reverse. Of course we must give effect to the statute if
          its words capture what the appellants have done, but in
          deciding whether this is really so it is in my opinion
          legitimate to assume that the choice of the 1861 Act as
          the basis for the relevant counts in the indictment was
          made only because no other statute was found which could
          conceivably be brought to bear upon them.</p>

          <p class="text2">In these circumstances I find it easy to
          share the opinion expressed by Wills J in <i>R v
          Clarence</i> (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 33, [1886&ndash;90] All
          ER Rep 133 at 137, a case where the accused had
          consensual intercourse with his wife, he knowing and she
          ignorant that he suffered from gonorrhoea, with the
          result that she was infected. The case is of general
          importance, since the Court for Crown Cases Reserved held
          that there was no offence under ss 47 and 20, since both
          sections required an assault, of which the wound or
          grievous bodily harm was the result, and that no assault
          was disclosed on the facts. For present purposes,
          however, I need only quote from the report (22 QBD 23 at
          30, [1886&ndash;90] All ER Rep 133 at 137):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; such considerations lead one to pause
            on the threshold, and inquire whether the enactment
            under consideration could really have been intended to
            apply to circumstances so completely removed from those
            which are usually understood when an assault is spoken
            of, or to deal with matters of any kind involving the
            sexual relation or act.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">I too am led to pause on the threshold.
          Asking myself the same question, I cannot but give a
          negative answer. I therefore approach the appeal on the
          basis that the convictions on charges which seem to me so
          inapposite cannot be upheld unless the language of the
          statute or the logic of the decided cases positively so
          demand. Unfortunately, as the able arguments which we
          have heard so clearly demonstrate, the language of the
          statute is opaque, and the cases few and unhelpful. To
          these I now turn.</p>

          <p class="text1">I. THE DECIDED CASES</p>

          <p class="text2">Throughout the argument of the appeal I
          was attracted by an analysis on the following lines.
          First, one would construct a continuous spectrum of the
          infliction of bodily harm, with killing at one end and a
          trifling touch at the other. Next, with the help of
          reported cases one would identify the point on this
          spectrum at which consent ordinarily ceases to be an
          answer to a prosecution for inflicting harm. This could
          be called &lsquo;the critical level&rsquo;. It would soon
          become plain however that this analysis is too simple and
          that there are certain types of special situation to
          which the general rule does not apply. Thus, for example,
          surgical treatment which requires a degree of bodily
          invasion well on the upper side of the critical level
          will nevertheless be legitimate if performed in
          accordance with good medical practice and with the
          consent of the patient. Conversely, there will be cases
          in which even a moderate degree of harm cannot be
          legitimated by consent. Accordingly, the next stage in
          the analysis will be to identify those situations which
          have been identified as special by the decided cases, and
          to examine them to see whether the instant case either
          falls within one of them or is sufficiently close for an
          analogy to be valid. If the answer is negative, then the
          court will have to decide whether simply to apply the
          general law simply by deciding whether the bodily harm in
          the case under review is above or below the critical
          level, or to break new ground by recognising a new
          special situation to which the general law does not
          apply.</p>

          <p class="text2">For all the intellectual neatness of
          this method I must recognise that it will not do, for it
          imposes on the reported cases and on the diversities of
          human life an order which they do not possess. Thus, when
          one comes to map out the spectrum of ordinary consensual
          physical harm, to which the special situations form
          exceptions, it is found that the task is almost
          impossible, since people do not ordinarily consent to the
          infliction of harm. In effect, either all or almost all
          the instances of the consensual infliction of violence
          are special. They have been in the past, and will
          continue to be in the future, the subject of special
          treatment by the law.</p>

          <p class="text2">There are other objections to a general
          theory of consent and violence. Thus, for example, it is
          too simple to speak only of consent, for it comes in
          various sorts. Of these, four spring immediately to mind.
          First, there is an express agreement to the infliction of
          the injury which was in the event inflicted. Next, there
          is express agreement to the infliction of some harm, but
          not to that harm which in the event was actually caused.
          These two categories are matched by two more, in which
          the recipient expressly consents not to the infliction of
          harm, but to engagement in an activity which creates a
          risk of harm; again, either the harm which actually
          results, or to something less. These examples do not
          exhaust the categories, for corresponding with each are
          situations of frequent occurrence in practice where the
          consent is not express but implied. These numerous
          categories are not the fruit of academic
          over-elaboration, but are a reflection of real life. Yet
          they are scarcely touched on in the cases, which just do
          not bear the weight of any general theory of violence and
          consent.</p>

          <p class="text2">Furthermore, when one examines the
          situations which are said to found such a theory it is
          seen that the idea of consent as the foundation of a
          defence has in many cases been forced on to the theory,
          whereas in reality the reason why the perpetrator of the
          harm is not liable is not because of the
          recipient&rsquo;s consent, but because the perpetrator
          has acted in a situation where the consent of the
          recipient forms one, but only one, of the elements which
          make the act legitimate. This concept is clearly
          expressed in the following extract from the judgment of
          Robert Goff LJ in <i>Collins v Wilcock</i> [1984] 3 All
          ER 374 at 378, [1984] 1 WLR 1172 at 1177:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;We are here concerned primarily with battery.
            The fundamental principle, plain and incontestable, is
            that every person&rsquo;s body is inviolate. It has
            long been established that any touching of another
            person, however slight, may amount to a battery. So
            Holt CJ held in 1704 that &ldquo;the least touching of
            another in anger is a battery&rdquo;: see <i>Cole v
            Turner</i> (1704) Holt KB 108, 90 ER 958. The breadth
            of the principle reflects the fundamental nature of the
            interest so protected; as Blackstone wrote in his
            Commentaries, &ldquo;the law cannot draw the line
            between different degrees of violence, and therefore
            totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it;
            every man&rsquo;s person being sacred, and no other
            having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest
            manner&rdquo; (see 3 Bl Com (17th edn, 1830) 120). The
            effect is that everybody is protected not only against
            physical injury but against any form of physical
            molestation. But so widely drawn a principle must
            inevitably be subject to exceptions. For example,
            children may be subjected to reasonable punishment;
            people may be subjected to the lawful exercise of the
            power of arrest; and reasonable force may be used in
            self-defence or for the prevention of crime. But, apart
            from these special instances where the control or
            constraint is lawful, a broader exception has been
            created to allow for the exigencies of everyday life.
            Generally speaking, consent is a defence to battery;
            and most of the physical contacts of ordinary life are
            not actionable because they are impliedly consented to
            by all who move in society and so expose themselves to
            the risk of bodily contact. So nobody can complain of
            the jostling which is inevitable from his presence in,
            for example, a supermarket, an underground station or a
            busy street; nor can a person who attends a party
            complain if his hand is seized in friendship, or even
            if his back is (within reason) slapped (see
            <i>Tuberville v Savage</i> (1669) 1 Mod Rep 3, 86 ER
            684). Although such cases are regarded as examples of
            implied consent, it is more common nowadays to treat
            them as falling within a general exception embracing
            all physical contact which is generally acceptable in
            the ordinary conduct of daily life. We observe that,
            although in the past it has sometimes been stated that
            a battery is only committed where the action is
            &ldquo;angry, or revengeful, or rude, or
            insolent&rdquo; (see 1 Hawk PC (8th edn, 1824) ch 15, s
            2), we think that nowadays it is more realistic, and
            indeed more accurate, to state the broad underlying
            principle, subject to the broad exception.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In these circumstances I must accept
          that the existing case law does not sustain a
          step-by-step analysis of the type proposed above. This
          being so I have considered whether there is some common
          feature of those cases in which consent has been held
          ineffectual whose presence or absence will furnish an
          immediate solution when the court is faced with a new
          situation. The only touchstone of this kind suggested in
          argument was the notion of &lsquo;hostility&rsquo;
          without which, as Mr Kershen QC maintained, no offence of
          violence can be made out. This argument, which equates
          hostility with antagonism, is attractive because
          antagonism felt by the perpetrator against the recipient,
          and expressed in terms of violence, is present in the
          great majority of the offences dealt with by the courts
          under the 1861 Act. Nevertheless I cannot accept it as a
          statement of the existing law which leads automatically
          to a conclusion on the present appeals. It is true that
          counsel was able to cite a series of cases on indecent
          conduct with consenting children, beginning with
          <i>Fairclough v Whipp</i> [1951] 2 All ER 832, in which
          the absence of hostility formed a ground for holding that
          indecent assaults were not proved. It is however clear to
          my mind that whatever precise meaning the word was
          intended to bear in the judgments there delivered it must
          have been different from the one for which Mr Kershen now
          contends. The facts were far removed from the present,
          for the accused persons did nothing to the children but
          merely persuaded them to do certain acts. They used no
          force, nor inflicted any physical harm. It is not
          surprising that no assault was made out, and the
          decisions do no more than furnish a useful reminder of
          the care to be taken before punishing repugnant sexual
          conduct under laws aimed at violence. Furthermore this
          theory does not fit the situations at the upper end of
          the scale. The doctor who hastens the end of a patient to
          terminate his agony acts with the best intentions, and
          quite without hostility to him in any ordinary sense of
          the word, yet there is no doubt that notwithstanding the
          patient&rsquo;s consent he is guilty of murder. Nor has
          it been questioned on the argument of the present appeal
          that someone who inflicts serious harm, because (for
          example) he is inspired by a belief in the efficacy of a
          pseudo-medical treatment, or acts in conformity with some
          extreme religious tenet, is guilty of an offence
          notwithstanding that he is inspired only by a desire to
          do the best he can for the recipient. Hostility cannot,
          as it seems to me, be a crucial factor which in itself
          determines guilt or innocence, although its presence or
          absence may be relevant when the court has to decide as a
          matter of policy how to react to a new situation.</p>

          <p class="text2">I thus see no alternative but to adopt a
          much narrower and more empirical approach, by looking at
          the situations in which the recipient consents or is
          deemed to consent to the infliction of violence upon him,
          to see whether the decided cases teach us how to react to
          this new challenge. I will take them in turn.</p>
          1. <i>Death</i> 

          <p class="text2">With the exception of a few exotic
          specimens which have never come before the courts,
          euthanasia is in practice the only situation where the
          recipient expressly consents to being killed. As the law
          stands today, consensual killing is murder. Why is this
          so? Professor Glanville Williams (<i>Textbook of Criminal
          Law</i> (2nd edn, 1983) pp 579&ndash;580, &sect;25.16)
          suggests that the arguments in support are
          transcendental, and I agree. Believer or atheist, the
          observer grants to the maintenance of human life an
          overriding imperative, so strong as to outweigh any
          consent to its termination. Some believers and some
          atheists now dissent from this view, but the controversy
          as to the position at common law does not illuminate our
          present task, which is to interpret a statute which is
          aimed at non-lethal violence.</p>

          <p class="text2">Nor is anything gained by a study of
          duelling, an activity in which the recipient did not
          consent to being killed (quite the reverse) but did
          consent to running the risk. The nineteenth century
          authorities were not too concerned to argue the
          criminality of the practice as between principals, but to
          stamp out this social evil by involving in the
          criminality those others, such as seconds and surgeons,
          who helped to perpetuate it. A series of nineteenth
          century cases, such as <i>R v Rice</i> (1803) 3 East 581,
          102 ER 719, reiterated that the dueller who inflicted the
          fatal wound was guilty of murder, whether he was the
          challenger or not, and regardless of the fact that the
          deceased willingly took the risk, but by then it was
          already very old law&mdash;certainly as old as <i>R v
          Taverner</i> (1619) 3 Bulstr 171, 81 ER 144 where Coke CJ
          and Croke J expounded the heinousness of the offence with
          copious reference to the ancients and to Holy Scripture.
          Killing in cold blood was the sin of Cain, and that was
          that. There is nothing to help us here.</p>

          <p>2. <i>Maiming</i></p>

          <p class="text2">The act of maiming consisted of
          &lsquo;such a hurt of any part of a man&rsquo;s body,
          whereby he is rendered less able, in fighting either to
          defend himself or to annoy his adversary&rsquo; (see 1
          Hawk PC (8th edn, 1824) ch 15, p 107, s 1). Maiming was a
          felony at common law. Self-maiming was also a crime, and
          consent was no defence to maiming by another. Maiming was
          also, in certain circumstances, a statutory offence under
          a series of Acts, now repealed, beginning with the
          so-called &lsquo;Coventry Act&rsquo; (22 &amp; 23 Car 2 c
          1 (1670) (maiming)), and continuing as part of a more
          general prohibition of serious offences against the
          person until an 1803 Act (43 Geo 3 c 58 (malicious
          shooting or stabbing)). Then it seems to have
          disappeared. There is no record of anyone being indicted
          for maim in modern times, and I doubt whether maiming
          would have been mentioned in the present case but for the
          high authority of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, who as
          late as 1883, in his <i>Digest of the Criminal Law</i>
          (3rd edn) pp 141&ndash;142, art 206, stated:
          &lsquo;Everyone has a right to consent to the infliction
          upon himself of bodily harm not amounting to a
          maim.&rsquo; No reported decision or statute was cited in
          support of this proposition, and the reasoning (according
          to a footnote) rested upon the assertion that below the
          level of maiming an injury was no more than an assault,
          to which consent was a defence.</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, I cannot accept that this
          antique crime any longer marks a watershed for the
          interrelation of violence and consent. In the first place
          the crime is obsolete. The 1861 Act says nothing about
          it, as it must have done if Parliament had intended to
          perpetuate maiming as a special category of offence.
          Furthermore, the rationale of maiming as a distinct
          offence is now quite out of date. Apparently the
          permanent disablement of an adult male was criminal
          because it cancelled him as a fighting unit in the
          service of his King. I think it impossible to apply this
          reasoning to the present case.</p>

          <p class="text2">Finally, the practical results of
          holding that maim marks the level at what consent ceases
          to be relevant seem to me quite unacceptable. The point
          cannot be better made than in terms of the only
          illustration given by Stephen J in art 206 of his work:
          &lsquo;It is a maim to strike out a front tooth. It is
          not a maim to cut off a man&rsquo;s nose.&rsquo;
          Evidently consent would be a defence in the latter
          instance, but not in the former. This is not in my view a
          sound basis for a modern law of violence.</p>

          <p>3. <i>Prize</i>-<i>fighting</i>, <i>sparring and
          boxing</i></p>

          <p class="text2">Far removed as it is from the present
          appeal, I must take a little time over prize-fighting,
          for it furnishes in <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 one
          of the very few extended judicial analyses of the
          relationship between violence and consent. By the early
          part of the nineteenth century it was firmly established
          that prize-fighting was unlawful notwithstanding the
          consent of the fighters. It nevertheless continued to
          flourish. It is therefore not surprising to find that the
          few and meagrely reported early cases at nisi prius were
          concerned with the efforts of the courts to stamp out the
          practice by prosecuting those who were thought to
          encourage it by acting as seconds or promoters, or just
          by being present. Although it was at that stage taken for
          granted that the activity was criminal per se, it is
          significant that in almost all the cases the accused were
          charged with riot, affray or unlawful assembly, and that
          emphasis was given to the tendency of prize-fights to
          attract large and unruly crowds. We encounter the same
          theme when at a later stage, in cases such as <i>R v
          Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534, <i>R v Young</i> (1866) 31 JP
          215 and <i>R v Orton</i> (1878) 39 LT 293, the courts
          were forced to rationalise the distinction between
          prize-fighting (unlawful) and sparring between amateurs
          (lawful). Of these cases much the most important was <i>R
          v Coney</i>. Burke and Mitchell fought in a ring of posts
          and ropes on private land a short distance from a
          highway. Upwards of 100 people were present. There was no
          evidence that the fight was for money or reward. Coney,
          Gilliam and Tully were in the crowd. Originally, Burke,
          Mitchell and three spectators and others who did not
          appeal were charged under an indictment which contained
          counts against all the accused for riot and other
          offences against public order, but these were dropped and
          the trial proceeded on two counts alone, one alleging
          (against all the accused except Burke) a common assault
          upon Burke, and the other a kindred count relating to
          Mitchell. The chairman of quarter sessions left to the
          jury the question whether this was a prize-fight, with a
          direction that if so it was illegal and an assault. He
          also directed that all persons who go to a prize-fight to
          see the combatants strike each other and who are present
          when they do so are guilty of an assault. The jury
          convicted all the accused. The chairman stated for
          decision by the Court of Crown Cases Reserved the
          question whether in relation to the three last-named
          accused his direction was right.</p>

          <p class="text2">Two issues arose. First, whether the
          fighting between Burke and Mitchell was an assault. If it
          was not, none of the accused were guilty of any offence.
          Second, whether the direction as to the participation of
          the other three appellants as aiders and abettors was
          correct. The court was divided on the second issue. But
          on the first all the judges were agreed that if the
          proceedings constituted a prize-fight then Burke and
          Mitchell were guilty of assault irrespective of the fact
          that they had agreed to fight.</p>

          <p class="text2">Even at first sight it is clear that
          this decision involved something out of the ordinary, for
          the accused were charged, not with any of the serious
          offences of violence under the 1861 Act but with common
          assault; and as all concerned in the argument of the
          present appeal have agreed, in common with the judges in
          <i>R v Coney</i> itself, consent is usually a defence to
          such a charge. Furthermore it seems that the degree of
          harm actually inflicted was thought to be immaterial, for
          no reference was made to it in the case stated by quarter
          sessions or (except tangentially) in the judgments of the
          court. What then was the basis for holding that a
          prize-fight stood outside the ordinary rules of criminal
          violence? Of the 11 judges only five went further than to
          say that the law was well-established. Their reasons were
          as follows. (1) Prize-fighting is a breach of the peace.
          The parties may consent to the infliction of blows as a
          civil wrong, but cannot prevent a breach of the peace
          from being criminal (see 8 QBD 534 at 538, 549, 553, 567
          per Cave, Stephen, Hawkins JJ and Lord Coleridge CJ
          respectively). As Stephen J put it, prize-fights were
          &lsquo;disorderly exhibitions, mischievous on many
          obvious grounds&rsquo;. (2) The participants are at risk
          of suffering ferocity and severe punishment, dreadful
          injuries and endangerment of life, and are encouraged to
          take the risk by the presence of spectators. It is
          against the public interest that these risks should be
          run, whether voluntarily or not (see per Cave and Mathew
          JJ (at 539, 544)). (3) Fists are dangerous weapons like
          pistols, and prize-fighting should be proscribed for the
          same reasons as duelling (see per Mathew J (at 547)).</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, there is nothing here to found
          a general theory of consensual violence. The court simply
          identifies a number of reasons why as a matter of policy
          a particular activity of which consent forms an element
          should found a conviction for an offence where the level
          of violence falls below what would normally be the
          critical level. As Stephen J made clear, the question
          whether considerations of policy are strong enough to
          take the case outside the ordinary law depends on whether
          &lsquo;the injury is of such nature or is inflicted under
          such circumstances that its infliction is injurious to
          the public&rsquo; (at 549). Speaking of duels, Bramwell
          LJ was later to say in <i>R v Bradshaw</i> (1878) 14 Cox
          CC 83, at 84&ndash;85:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; no person can by agreement go out to
            fight with deadly weapons, doing by agreement <i>what
            the law says shall not be done</i>, and thus shelter
            themselves from the consequences of their acts.&rsquo;
            (My emphasis.)
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">Precisely the same reliance on an
          empirical or intuitive reference to public policy in
          substitution for any theory of consent and violence are
          seen in discussions of amateur sparring with fists and
          other sports which involve the deliberate infliction of
          harm. The matter is put very clearly in <i>East&rsquo;s
          Pleas of the Crown</i> (1 East PC (1803) ch v,
          &sect;&sect; 41&ndash;42, pp 268&ndash;270):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; if death ensue from such [sports] as
            are innocent and allowable, the case will fall within
            the rule of excusable homicide; but if the sport be
            unlawful in itself, or productive of danger, riot, or
            disorder, from the occasion, so as to endanger the
            peace, and death ensue; the party killing is guilty of
            manslaughter &hellip; manly sports and exercises which
            tend to give strength, activity, and skill in the use
            of arms, and are entered into merely as private
            recreations among friends, are not unlawful; and
            therefore persons playing by consent at cudgels, or
            foils, or wrestling, are excusable if death ensue. For
            though doubtless it cannot be said that such exercises
            are altogether free from danger; yet are they very
            rarely attended with fatal consequences; and each party
            has friendly warning to be on his guard. And if the
            possibility of danger were the criterion by which the
            lawfulness of sports and recreations were to be
            decided, many exercises must be proscribed which are in
            common use, and were never heretofore deemed unlawful
            &hellip; But the latitude given to manly exercises of
            the nature above described, when conducted merely as
            diversions among friends, must not be extended to
            legalise prize fightings, public boxing matches and the
            like, which are exhibited for the sake of lucre, and
            are calculated to draw together a number of idle
            disorderly people &hellip; And again, such meetings
            have a strong tendency in their nature to a breach of
            the peace &hellip;&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In his work on <i>Crown Law</i> (3rd
          edn, 1809) p 230 Sir Michael Foster put the matter in a
          similar way when he distinguished beneficial recreations
          such as single-stick fighting from&mdash;</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;prize-fighting and &hellip; other exertions of
            courage, strength and activity &hellip; which are
            exhibited for lucre, and can serve no valuable purpose,
            but on the contrary encourage a spirit of idleness and
            debauchery.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">Thus, although consent is present in
          both cases the risks of serious violence and public
          disorder make prize-fighting something which &lsquo;the
          law says shall not be done&rsquo;, whereas the lesser
          risk of injury, the absence of the public disorder, the
          improvement of the health and skills of the participants,
          and the consequent benefit to the public at large combine
          to place sparring into a different category, which the
          law says &lsquo;may be done&rsquo;.</p>

          <p class="text2">That the court is in such cases making a
          value judgment, not dependent upon any general theory of
          consent is exposed by the failure of any attempt to
          deduce why professional boxing appears to be immune from
          prosecution. For money, not recreation or personal
          improvement, each boxer tries to hurt the opponent more
          than he is hurt himself, and aims to end the contest
          prematurely by inflicting a brain injury serious enough
          to make the opponent unconscious, or temporarily by
          impairing his central nervous system through a blow to
          the midriff, or cutting his skin to a degree which would
          ordinarily be well within the scope of s 20 of the 1861
          Act. The boxers display skill, strength and courage, but
          nobody pretends that they do good to themselves or
          others. The onlookers derive entertainment, but none of
          the physical and moral benefits which have been seen as
          the fruits of engagement in manly sports. I intend no
          disrespect to the valuable judgment of McInerney J in
          <i>Pallante v Stadiums Pty Ltd</i> (<i>No 1</i>) [1976]
          VR 331 when I say that the heroic efforts of that learned
          judge to arrive at an intellectually satisfying account
          of the apparent immunity of professional boxing from
          criminal process have convinced me that the task is
          impossible. It is in my judgment best to regard this as
          another special situation which for the time being stands
          outside the ordinary law of violence because society
          chooses to tolerate it.</p>
          4. &lsquo;<i>Contact</i>&rsquo; <i>sports</i> 

          <p class="text2">Some sports, such as the various codes
          of football, have deliberate bodily contact as an
          essential element. They lie at a mid-point between
          fighting, where the participant knows that his opponent
          will try to harm him, and the milder sports where there
          is at most an acknowledgement that someone may be
          accidentally hurt. In the contact sports each player
          knows and by taking part agrees that an opponent may from
          time to time inflict upon his body (for example by a
          rugby tackle) what would otherwise be a painful battery.
          By taking part he also assumes the risk that the
          deliberate contact may have unintended effects,
          conceivably of sufficient severity to amount to grievous
          bodily harm. But he does not agree that this more serious
          kind of injury may be inflicted deliberately. This simple
          analysis conceals a number of difficult problems, which
          are discussed in a series of Canadian decisions,
          culminating in <i>R v Ciccarelli</i> (1989) 54 CCC (3d)
          121, on the subject of ice hockey, a sport in which an
          ethos of physical contact is deeply entrenched. The
          courts appear to have started with the proposition that
          some level of violence is lawful if the recipient agrees
          to it, and have dealt with the question of excessive
          violence by inquiring whether the recipient could really
          have tacitly accepted a risk of violence at the level
          which actually occurred. These decisions do not help us
          in the present appeal, where the consent of the
          recipients was express, and where it is known that they
          gladly agreed, not simply to some degree of harm but to
          everything that was done. What we need to know is
          whether, notwithstanding the recipient&rsquo;s implied
          consent, there comes a point at which it is too severe
          for the law to tolerate. Whilst common sense suggests
          that this must be so, and that the law will not license
          brutality under the name of sport, one of the very few
          reported indications of the point at which tolerable harm
          becomes intolerable violence is in the direction to the
          jury given by Bramwell LJ in <i>R v Bradshaw</i> (1878)
          14 Cox CC 83 that the act (in this case a charge at
          football) would be unlawful if intended to cause
          &lsquo;serious hurt&rsquo;. This accords with my own
          instinct, but I must recognise that a direction at nisi
          prius, even by a great judge, cannot be given the same
          weight as a judgment on appeal, consequent upon full
          argument and reflection. The same comment may be made
          about <i>R v Moore</i> (1898) 14 TLR 229.</p>

          <p>5. <i>Surgery</i></p>

          <p class="text2">Many of the acts done by surgeons would
          be very serious crimes if done by anyone else, and yet
          the surgeons incur no liability. Actual consent, or the
          substitute for consent deemed by the law to exist where
          an emergency creates a need for action, is an essential
          element in this immunity; but it cannot be a direct
          explanation for it, since much of the bodily invasion
          involved in surgery lies well above any point at which
          consent could even arguably be regarded as furnishing a
          defence. Why is this so? The answer must in my opinion be
          that proper medical treatment, for which actual or deemed
          consent is a prerequisite, is in a category of its
          own.</p>

          <p>6. <i>Lawful correction</i></p>

          <p class="text2">It is probably still the position at
          common law, as distinct from statute, that a parent or
          someone to whom the parent has delegated authority may
          inflict physical hurt on his or her child, provided that
          it does not go too far and is for the purpose of
          correction and not the gratification of passion or rage:
          see <i>R v Conner</i> (1835) 7 C &amp; P 438, 173 ER 194,
          <i>R v Cheeseman</i> (1836) 7 C &amp; P 455, 173 ER 202,
          <i>R v Hopley</i> (1860) 2R v Brown [1993] 2 All ER 75 F
          &amp; F 202, 175 ER 1024, <i>R v Griffin</i> (1869) 11
          Cox CC 402. These cases have nothing to do with consent,
          and are useful only as another demonstration that
          specially exempt situations can exist and that they can
          involve an upper limit of tolerable harm.</p>

          <p>7. <i>Dangerous pastimes</i>; <i>bravado</i>;
          <i>mortification</i></p>

          <p class="text2">For the sake of completeness I should
          mention that the list of situations in which one person
          may agree to the infliction of harm, or to the risk of
          infliction of harm by another includes dangerous
          pastimes, bravado (as where a boastful man challenges
          another to try to hurt him with a blow) and religious
          mortification. These examples have little in common with
          one another and even less with the present case. They do
          not appear to be discussed in the authorities although
          dangerous pastimes are briefly mentioned and I see no
          advantage in exploring them here.</p>
          8. <i>Rough horseplay</i> 

          <p class="text2">The law recognises that community life
          (and particularly male community life), such as exists in
          the school playground, in the barrack-room and on the
          factory floor, may involve a mutual risk of deliberate
          physical contact in which a particular recipient (or even
          an outsider, as in <i>R v Bruce</i> (1847) 2 Cox CC 262)
          may come off worst, and that the criminal law cannot be
          too tender about the susceptibilities of those involved.
          I think it hopeless to attempt any explanation in terms
          of consent. This is well illustrated by <i>R v Jones</i>
          (<i>Terence</i>) (1986) 83 Cr App R 375. The injured
          children did not consent to being thrown in the air at
          all, nor to the risk that they might be thrown so high as
          to cause serious injury. They had no choice. Once again
          it appears to me that as a matter of policy the courts
          have decided that the criminal law does not concern
          itself with these activities, provided that they do not
          go too far. It also seems plain that as the general
          social appreciation of what is tolerable and of the
          proper role of the state in regulating the lives of
          individuals changes with the passage of time, so we shall
          expect to find that the assumptions of the criminal
          justice system about what types of conduct are properly
          excluded from its scope, and about what is meant by going
          &lsquo;too far&rsquo;, will not remain constant. 9.
          <i>Prostitution</i></p>

          <p class="text2">Prostitution may well be the commonest
          occasion for the voluntary acceptance of the certainty,
          as distinct from the risk, of bodily harm. It is very
          different from the present case. There is no pretence of
          mutual affection. The prostitute, as beater or beaten,
          does it for money. The dearth of reported decisions on
          the application of the 1861 Act clearly shows how the
          prosecuting authorities have (rightly in my view) tended
          to deal with such cases, if at all, as offences against
          public order. Only in <i>R v Donovan</i> [1934] 2 KB 498,
          [1934] All ER Rep 207 amongst the English cases, has the
          criminality of sexual beating been explored.</p>

          <p class="text2">The facts were as follows. The accused
          met the complainant and immediately asked her:
          &lsquo;Where would you like to have your spanking, in
          Hyde Park or in my garage?&rsquo; Previous telephone
          conversations had made it clear that he wanted to beat
          her for sexual gratification. She went with him to his
          garage, where he caned her in a manner which left seven
          or eight marks indicative, as a medical witness said, of
          &lsquo;a fairly severe beating&rsquo;. He was charged
          with indecent assault and common assault. The defence was
          that the girl consented and that it was for the
          prosecution to prove that she did not. The chairman of
          quarter sessions directed the jury that the vital issue
          was &lsquo;consent or no consent&rsquo;, apparently
          without giving any guidance on burden of proof. After
          retiring for an hour the jury asked a question about
          reasonable belief and consent, which again the chairman
          answered without reference to burden of proof.</p>

          <p class="text2">The Court of Criminal Appeal (Lord
          Hewart CJ, Swift and du Parcq JJ) quashed the conviction.
          The judgment fell into two entirely distinct parts. The
          first was concerned with the direction on consent and
          proceeded on the footing that consent was material to
          guilt and that the burden was on the Crown to disprove
          it. This part of the judgment concluded ([1934] 2 KB 498
          at 506, [1934] All ER Rep 207 at 210):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;It is, in our view, at least possible that [a
            correct direction] would have resulted in the acquittal
            of the appellant, and we are, therefore, compelled to
            come to the conclusion &hellip; that the trial was not
            satisfactory.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">On the face of it this conclusion was
          fatal to the conviction, but the court went on to
          consider an argument for the Crown that this was not so,
          because on the facts the striking of the girl was not an
          act for which consent afforded a defence; so that the
          absence of a proper direction upon it made no difference.
          On this question the court held that it was for the jury
          to decide whether the situation was such that the consent
          of the girl was immaterial, and that since the issue had
          never been left to the jury and the trial had proceeded
          on the footing that consent was the key to the case, the
          appeal ought to be decided on the same basis.
          Accordingly, the direction on consent being
          unsatisfactory the conviction must be quashed.</p>

          <p class="text2">How did the court arrive at the opinion
          that there was an issue for the jury which ought to have
          been tried? As I understand it, the course of reasoning
          was as follows. (1) On the basis of a statement of Cave J
          in <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 at 539 and the old
          authorities on which it was founded the court was of the
          opinion&mdash;:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;If an act is unlawful in the sense of being in
            itself a criminal act, it is plain that it cannot be
            rendered lawful because the person to whose detriment
            it is done consents to it. No person can license
            another to commit a crime. So far as the criminal law
            is concerned, therefore, where the act charged is in
            itself unlawful, it can never be necessary to prove
            absence of consent on the part of the person wronged in
            order to obtain the conviction of the wrongdoer.&rsquo;
            (See [1934] 2 KB 498 at 507, [1934] All ER Rep 207 at
            210.)
          </blockquote>
          (2) &lsquo;There are, however, many acts in themselves
          harmless and lawful which become unlawful only if they
          are done without the consent of the person
          affected&rsquo; (see [1934] 2 KB 498 at 507, [1934] All
          ER Rep 207 at 210). (3) &lsquo;As a general rule,
          although it is a rule to which there are well established
          exceptions, it is an unlawful act to beat another person
          with such a degree of violence that the infliction of
          bodily harm is a probable consequence, and when such an
          act is proved, consent is immaterial&rsquo; (see [1934] 2
          KB 498 at 507, [1934] All ER Rep 207 at 210). (4) The
          former distinction between maim and other types of injury
          was out of date. Beating with the intent of doing some
          bodily harm is malum in se to which consent is not a
          defence. (5) There are exceptions to this general rule,
          such as sparring, sport or horseplay. (6) But what
          happened in the instant case did not fall within any of
          the established exceptions. (7) For the purpose of the
          general rule bodily injury meant any hurt or injury
          calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the
          prosecutor; it need not be permanent, but must be more
          than merely transient or trifling. (8) It was for the
          jury to decide whether the appellant had inflicted or
          intended to inflict bodily injury in this sense. 

          <p class="text2">My Lords, the first two of these
          propositions have more than once been criticised as
          tautologous. I do not accept this, but will not stay to
          discuss the point for its seems to me that they are
          right, as the instances of prize-fighting and duelling
          make plain, and as all the counsel appearing in the
          present appeal have agreed. The law simply treats some
          acts as criminal per se irrespective of consent.</p>

          <p class="text2">It is with the next stages in the
          reasoning that I part company. Donovan was charged only
          with indecent assault, and the latter is an offence to
          which, it is common ground, consent is a defence. Yet the
          Court of Criminal Appeal proceeded on the basis that the
          critical level of violence was that of actual bodily
          harm, and that the jury should have been directed to
          decide whether he was guilty of facts establishing an
          offence under s 47 of the 1861 Act: an offence with which
          he had not been charged. There is something amiss here.
          What is amiss is that the dictum of Cave J in <i>R v
          Coney</i> and the old cases said to support it are taken
          out of their context, which was in each instance the kind
          of battery regarded for reasons of public policy as being
          in a special category which is automatically criminal.
          Plainly the court in <i>R v Donovan</i> did not put the
          beating of the complainant into that category, or the
          appeal would have taken a quite different course. All
          that the court had to say about the nature of the beating
          was that it was not, as the present appellants would have
          us say, in a category which is automatically
          innocent.</p>

          <p>10. <i>Fighting</i></p>

          <p class="text2">I doubt whether it is possible to give a
          complete list of the situations where it is conceivable
          that one person will consent to the infliction of
          physical hurt by another, but apart from those already
          mentioned only one seems worth considering, namely what
          one may call &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; fighting. This was
          the subject of <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i> (/No 6
          of 1980/) [1981] 2 All ER 1057, [1981] QB 715. The
          accused fell into an argument with another youth in a
          street. They agreed to settle it there and then by a
          fight, which they did, and as a result the other person
          suffered a bleeding nose and a bruised face. The accused
          was charged with common assault. There was no evidence
          that anyone was present except one bystander, nor that
          there was any public disorder other than the fight
          itself. The judge directed the jury that the fight did
          not necessarily amount to an assault, and that they
          should consider whether it was a case of both parties
          agreeing to fight and use only reasonable force. The
          Attorney General referred for the opinion of the Court of
          Appeal the question&mdash;</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Where two persons fight (otherwise than in the
            course of sport) in a public place can it be a defence
            for one of those persons to a charge of assault arising
            out of the fight that the other consented to
            fight?&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">When answering this question the court
          consciously broke new ground. No reliance was placed on
          the unsystematic old cases on sparring, or on <i>R v
          Donovan</i>, or even as I understand it on <i>R v
          Coney</i>, except as showing that public interest may
          demand a special response to a special situation. Indeed,
          the protection of public order, which had been the
          principal ground for the recognition of prize-fighting as
          a special category in <i>R v Coney</i> was explicitly
          discarded. Instead, the court began by stating that in
          general consent is a defence to a charge of assault, and
          went on to observe that there might be cases where the
          public interest demanded otherwise. Such a case existed
          &lsquo;where people &hellip; try to cause or &hellip;
          cause each other bodily harm for no good reason&rsquo;
          (see [1981] 2 All ER 1057 at 1059, [1981] QB 715 at
          719).</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, I am not sure that I can
          detect here the inconsistency for which this judgment has
          been criticised. Perhaps it is unduly complicated to
          suggest that the public interest might annul the defence
          of consent in certain situations and then in the shape of
          &lsquo;good reason&rsquo; recreate it. Nevertheless I am
          very willing to recognise that the public interest may
          sometimes operate in one direction and sometimes in the
          other. But even if it be correct that fighting in private
          to settle a quarrel is so much against the public
          interest as to make it automatically criminal even if the
          fighter is charged only with assault (a proposition which
          I would wish to examine more closely should the occasion
          arise), I cannot accept that the infliction of bodily
          harm, and especially the private infliction of it, is
          invariably criminal absent some special factor which
          decrees otherwise. I prefer to address each individual
          category of consensual violence in the light of the
          situation as a whole. Sometimes the element of consent
          will make no difference and sometimes it will make all
          the difference. Circumstances must alter cases. For these
          reasons I consider that the House is free, as the Court
          of Appeal in the present case was not (being bound by
          <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s Reference</i> (<i>No 6 of
          1980</i>)), to consider entirely afresh whether the
          public interest demands the interpretation of the 1861
          Act in such a way as to render criminal under s 47 the
          acts done by the appellants.</p>

          <p class="text1">II. AN UNLAWFUL ACT</p>

          <p class="text2">A question has arisen, not previously
          canvassed, whether the appellants are necessarily guilty
          because their acts were criminal apart from the Offences
          against the Person Act 1861, and that accordingly a
          defence of consent which might otherwise have been
          available as an answer to a charge under s 47 is to be
          ruled out. This proposition if correct will have some
          strange practical consequences. First of all, it means
          that solely because the appellants were guilty of
          offences under the Sexual Offences Act 1967, with which
          they had not been charged and of which they could not
          (because of the time limit) be convicted they can
          properly be convicted of crimes of violence under a
          different statute carrying a much larger maximum penalty.
          The logic of this argument demands that if the
          prosecution can show that a sexual harming constitutes
          some other offence, however trifling and however
          different in character, the prosecution will be able to
          establish an offence of common assault or an offence
          under the 1861 Act, even if in its absence the defendant
          would not be guilty of any offence at all. Surely this
          cannot be right.</p>

          <p class="text2">Moreover, if one returns to offences of
          the present kind further practical anomalies may be
          foreseen. Not all grossly indecent acts between males are
          indictable under the Sexual Offences Act 1956. Thus, if
          the criminality of conduct such as the present under the
          Offences against the Person Act 1861 is to depend on
          whether the conduct is criminal on other grounds, one
          would find that the penal status of the acts for the
          purposes of s 47 would depend upon whether they were done
          by two adult males or three adult males. I can understand
          why, in relation to a homosexual conduct, Parliament has
          not yet thought fit to disturb the compromise embodied in
          the Sexual Offences Act 1967, but am quite unable to see
          any reason to carry a similar distinction into the
          interpretation of a statute passed a century earlier, and
          aimed at quite different evil. Since the point was not
          raised before the trial judge, and the House has properly
          not been burdened with all the committal papers, it is
          impossible to tell whether, if advanced, it might have
          affected the pleas offered and accepted at the Central
          Criminal Court, but its potential for creating anomalies
          in other cases seems undeniable.</p>

          <p class="text2">I would therefore accede to this
          argument only if the decided cases so demand. In my
          opinion they do not, for I can find nothing in them to
          suggest that the consensual infliction of hurt is
          transmuted into an offence of violence simply because it
          is chargeable as another offence. Even in the
          prize-fighting cases, which come closest to this idea,
          the tendency of these events to attract a disorderly
          crowd was relevant not because the fighters might have
          been charged, if anyone had cared to do so, with the
          separate offence of causing a breach of the peace, but
          rather because this factor was a reason why the events
          were placed as a matter of policy in a category which the
          law treated as being <i>in itself</i> intrinsically
          unlawful notwithstanding the presence of consent. I am
          satisfied that it was in this sense that the courts made
          reference to the unlawfulness of the conduct under
          examination, and not to its criminality aliunde.</p>

          <p class="text1">III. THE EUROPEAN CONVENTI0N ON HUMAN
          RIGHTS</p>

          <p class="text2">The appellants relied on the Convention
          for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
          Freedoms (Rome, 4 November 1950; TS 71 (1953); Cmd 8969)
          for two reasons. First, because it was said to support an
          argument that the law as it now stood should be
          interpreted or developed in a sense favourable to the
          appellants, and, secondly, because in the event of
          failure before the House the appellants intend to pursue
          the matter before the European Court of Human Rights, and
          for this purpose must show that their local remedies have
          been exhausted.</p>

          <p class="text2">Two provisions of the convention are
          called in aid. The first is art 7, the proposition being
          that the convictions cannot be upheld without making the
          appellants guilty in respect of acts which were not
          criminal when they were committed. I am satisfied that
          this argument is unsound. Many of the acts relied on took
          place after the decision in <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s
          Reference</i>(<i>No 6 of 1980</i>) [1981] 2 All ER 1057,
          [1981] QB 715, and all of them long postdated <i>R v
          Donovan</i> [1934] 2 KB 498, [1934] All ER Rep 207. The
          ruling of the trial judge was perfectly comprehensible in
          the light of these and other decisions. The law was being
          applied as it was then understood. If the view which I
          now propose were to prevail the law would be understood
          differently. If this happened the appeals would succeed,
          without any reference to art 7. And if, as I understand
          to be the case, your Lordships hold that on the law as it
          already exists the trial judge&rsquo;s ruling was right,
          there is no change of any kind, whether retrospective or
          otherwise, that could possibly infringe art 7.</p>

          <p class="text2">The second argument, ably presented by
          Miss Sharpston, is altogether more substantial. Not of
          course because the enunciation of a qualified right of
          privacy in art 8 leads inexorably to a conclusion in the
          appellants&rsquo; favour, since even after all these
          years the United Kingdom has still failed to comply with
          its treaty obligation to enact the convention. Nor
          because I consider that the individual provisions of the
          convention will always point unequivocally to the right
          answer in a particular case. Far from it. Emphasis on
          human duties will often yield a more balanced and
          sharply-focused protection for the individual than the
          contemporary preoccupation with human rights. The
          sonorous norms of the convention, valuable as they
          unquestionably are in recalling errant states to their
          basic obligations of decency towards those in their
          power, are often at the same time too general and too
          particular to permit a reasoned analysis of new and
          difficult problems. Article 8 provides a good example.
          The jurisprudence with which this article, in common with
          other terms of the convention, is rapidly becoming
          encrusted shows that in order to condemn acts which
          appear worthy of censure they have had to be forced into
          the mould of art 8, and referred to the concept of
          privacy, for want of any other provision which will
          serve. I do not deny that the privacy of the conduct was
          an important element in the present case, but I cannot
          accept that this fact on its own can yield an answer.</p>

          <p class="text2">Nevertheless, I believe that the general
          tenor of the decisions of the European Court of Human
          Rights does furnish valuable guidance on the approach
          which the English courts should adopt, if free to do so,
          and I take heart from the fact that the European
          authorities, balancing the personal considerations
          invoked by art 8(1) against the public interest
          considerations called up by art 8(2), clearly favour the
          right of the appellants to conduct their private lives
          undisturbed by the criminal law: a conclusion at which I
          have independently arrived for reasons which I must now
          state.</p>

          <p class="text1">IV. PUBLIC POLICY</p>

          <p class="text2">The purpose of this long discussion has
          been to suggest that the decks are clear for the House to
          tackle completely anew the question whether the public
          interest requires s 47 of the 1861 Act to be interpreted
          as penalising an infliction of harm which is at the level
          of actual bodily harm, but not grievous bodily harm;
          which is inflicted in private (by which I mean that it is
          exposed to the view only of those who have chosen to view
          it); which takes place not only with the consent of the
          recipient but with his willing and glad co-operation;
          which is inflicted for the gratification of sexual
          desire, and not in a spirit of animosity or rage; and
          which is not engaged in for profit.</p>

          <p class="text2">My Lords, I have stated the issue in
          these terms to stress two considerations of cardinal
          importance. Lawyers will need no reminding of the first,
          but since this prosecution has been widely noticed it
          must be emphasised that the issue before the House is not
          whether the appellants&rsquo; conduct is morally right,
          but whether it is properly charged under the 1861 Act.
          When proposing that the conduct is not rightly so charged
          I do not invite your Lordships&rsquo; House to indorse it
          as morally acceptable. Nor do I pronounce in favour of a
          libertarian doctrine specifically related to sexual
          matters. Nor in the least do I suggest that ethical
          pronouncements are meaningless, that there is no
          difference between right and wrong, that sadism is
          praiseworthy, or that new opinions on sexual morality are
          necessarily superior to the old, or anything else of the
          same kind. What I do say is that these are questions of
          private morality; that the standards by which they fall
          to be judged are not those of the criminal law; and that
          if these standards are to be upheld the individual must
          enforce them upon himself according to his own moral
          standards, or have them enforced against him by moral
          pressures exerted by whatever religious or other
          community to whose ethical ideals he responds. The point
          from which I invite your Lordships to depart is simply
          this, that the state should interfere with the rights of
          an individual to live his or her life as he or she may
          choose no more than is necessary to ensure a proper
          balance between the special interests of the individual
          and the general interests of the individuals who together
          comprise the populace at large. Thus, whilst
          acknowledging that very many people, if asked whether the
          appellants&rsquo; conduct was wrong, would reply
          &lsquo;Yes, repulsively wrong&rsquo;, I would at the same
          time assert that this does not in itself mean that the
          prosecution of the appellants under ss 20 and 47 of the
          Offences against the Person Act 1861 is well founded.</p>

          <p class="text2">This point leads directly to the second.
          As I have ventured to formulate the crucial question, it
          asks whether there is good reason to impress upon s 47 an
          interpretation which penalises the relevant level of harm
          irrespective of consent: ie to recognise sado-masochistic
          activities as falling into a special category of acts,
          such as duelling and prize-fighting, which &lsquo;the law
          says shall not be done&rsquo;. This is very important,
          for if the question were differently stated it might well
          yield a different answer. In particular, if it were to be
          held that as a matter of law all infliction of bodily
          harm above the level of common assault is incapable of
          being legitimated by consent, except in special
          circumstances, then we would have to consider whether the
          public interest required the recognition of private
          sexual activities as being in a specially exempt
          category. This would be an altogether more difficult
          question and one which I would not be prepared to answer
          in favour of the appellants, not because I do not have my
          own opinions upon it but because I regard the task as one
          which the courts are not suited to perform, and which
          should be carried out, if at all, by Parliament after a
          thorough review of all the medical, social, moral and
          political issues, such as was performed by the Wolfenden
          Committee (see the <i>Report of the Committee on
          Homosexual Offences and Prostitution</i> (Cmnd 247
          (1957)). Thus, if I had begun from the same point of
          departure as my noble and learned friend Lord Jauncey of
          Tullichettle I would have arrived at a similar
          conclusion; but differing from him on the present state
          of the law, I venture to differ.</p>

          <p class="text2">Let it be assumed however that we should
          embark upon this question. I ask myself, not whether as a
          result of the decision in this appeal, activities such as
          those of the appellants should cease to be criminal, but
          rather whether the 1861 Act (a statute which I venture to
          repeat once again was clearly intended to penalise
          conduct of a quite different nature) should in this new
          situation be interpreted so as to make it criminal. Why
          should this step be taken? Leaving aside repugnance and
          moral objection, both of which are entirely natural but
          neither of which are in my opinion grounds upon which the
          court could properly create a new crime, I can visualise
          only the following reasons.</p>

          <p>(1) Some of the practices obviously created a risk of
          genito-urinary infection, and others of septicaemia.
          These might indeed have been grave in former times, but
          the risk of serious harm must surely have been greatly
          reduced by modern medical science.<br />
           (2) The possibility that matters might get out of hand,
          with grave results. It has been acknowledged throughout
          the present proceedings that the appellants&rsquo;
          activities were performed as a prearranged ritual, which
          at the same time enhanced their excitement and minimised
          the risk that the infliction of injury would go too far.
          Of course things might go wrong and really serious injury
          or death might ensue. If this happened, those responsible
          would be punished according to the ordinary law, in the
          same way as those who kill or injure in the course of
          more ordinary sexual activities are regularly punished.
          But to penalise the appellants&rsquo; conduct even if the
          extreme consequences do not ensue, just because they
          might have done so, would require an assessment of the
          degree of risk, and the balancing of this risk against
          the interests of individual freedom. Such a balancing is
          in my opinion for Parliament, not the courts; and even if
          your Lordships&rsquo; House were to embark upon it the
          attempt must in my opinion fail at the outset for there
          is no evidence at all of the seriousness of the hazards
          to which sado-masochistic conduct of this kind gives
          rise. This is not surprising, since the impressive
          argument of Mr Purnell QC for the Crown did not seek to
          persuade your Lordships to bring the matter within the
          1861 Act on the ground of special risks, but rather to
          establish that the appellants are liable under the
          general law because the level of harm exceeded the
          critical level marking off criminal from non-criminal
          consensual violence which he invited your Lordships to
          indorse.<br />
           (3) I would give the same answer to the suggestion that
          these activities involved a risk of accelerating the
          spread of auto-immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and
          that they should be brought within the 1861 Act in the
          interests of public health. The consequence would be
          strange, since what is currently the principal cause for
          the transmission of this scourge, namely consenting
          buggery between males, is now legal. Nevertheless, I
          would have been compelled to give this proposition the
          most anxious consideration if there had been any evidence
          to support it. But there is none, since the case for the
          Crown was advanced on an entirely different ground.<br />
           (4) There remains an argument to which I have given much
          greater weight. As the evidence in the present case has
          shown, there is a risk that strangers (and especially
          young strangers) may be drawn into these activities at an
          early age and will then become established in them for
          life. This is indeed a disturbing prospect but I have
          come to the conclusion that it is not a sufficient ground
          for declaring these activities to be criminal under the
          1861 Act. The element of the corruption of youth is
          already catered for by the existing legislation; and if
          there is a gap in it which needs to be filled the remedy
          surely lies in the hands of Parliament, not in the
          application of a statute which is aimed at other forms of
          wrongdoing. As regards proselytisation for adult
          sado-masochism the argument appears to me circular. For
          if the activity is not itself so much against the public
          interest that it ought to be declared criminal under the
          1861 Act then the risk that others will be induced to
          join in cannot be a ground for making it criminal.</p>

          <p class="text2">Leaving aside the logic of this answer,
          which seems to me impregnable, plain humanity demands
          that a court addressing the criminality of conduct such
          as that of the present should recognise and respond to
          the profound dismay which all members of the community
          share about the apparent increase of cruel and senseless
          crimes against the defenceless. Whilst doing so I must
          repeat for the last time that in the answer which I
          propose I do not advocate the decriminalisation of
          conduct which has hitherto been a crime; nor do I rebut a
          submission that a new crime should be created, penalising
          this conduct, for Mr Purnell has rightly not invited the
          House to take this course. The only question is whether
          these consensual private acts are offences against the
          existing law of violence. To this question I return a
          negative response.</p>

          <p class="text1">V. CONCLUS10N</p>

          <p class="text2">Accordingly I would allow these appeals
          and quash such of the convictions as are now before the
          House.</p>

          <p class="text1"><a id="slynn" name="slynn"></a><b>LORD
          SLYNN OF HADLEY.</b> My Lords, the Court of Appeal,
          Criminal Division when granting leave to the appellants
          to appeal to the House of Lords certified that a point of
          law of general importance was involved in its decision to
          dismiss the appeal, namely:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him
            actual bodily harm in the course of a sadomasochistic
            encounter, does the prosecution have to prove lack of
            consent on the part of B before they can establish
            A&rsquo;s guilt under section 20 and section 47 of the
            1861, Offences Against the Person Act?&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">By s 20: &lsquo;Whosoever shall
          unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous
          bodily harm upon any other person &hellip; shall be
          liable [to imprisonment]&rsquo; and by s 47:
          &lsquo;Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment of
          any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be
          liable [to imprisonment].&rsquo; The trial judge ruled as
          a preliminary issue that:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;1. It is an assault deliberately to strike or
            touch another person other than in self-defence with
            the intention thereby to cause bodily harm, or a
            fortiori so to act so that bodily harm is thereby
            caused intentionally or recklessly. 2. Such an act or
            touching can be excused on the grounds that it was
            lawfully carried out. Therefore whether consent is an
            element of the offence itself, or whether it is to be
            treated as a defence in exception to the general rule
            that I have stated, it is, accordingly, in some cases a
            defence to the charge that the subject consented. The
            circumstances of this case do not permit these
            defendants to rely on consent as a defence in law if
            any of them have carried out acts satisfying the
            conditions under my first heading.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">On the basis of that ruling the
          appellants pleaded guilty to the charges under s 47 of
          the 1861 Act (actual bodily harm) and to wounding (though
          not to inflicting grievous bodily harm) under s 20 of
          that Act.</p>

          <p class="text2">Some of the appellants and certain
          others also pleaded guilty to other offences concerned
          with keeping a disorderly house, for which longer
          sentences were imposed than those on the assault charges,
          and with the publication and possession of obscene or
          indecent articles, for which sentences of imprisonment
          were also imposed.</p>

          <p class="text2">The argument on both sides has proceeded
          on the basis of earlier authorities that bodily harm
          means any hurt or injury that is calculated to or does
          interfere with the health or comfort of the subject but
          must be more than transient or trifling, that grievous
          bodily harm means really serious bodily harm and that
          wounding involves the breaking of the whole skin. Common
          assault would include any physical touching which did not
          fall within these categories.</p>

          <p class="text2">The facts upon which the convictions
          under appeal were based are sufficiently and clearly set
          out in the judgment of Lord Lane CJ and fortunately it is
          not necessary to repeat them. Nor is it necessary to
          refer to other facts which are mentioned in the papers
          before the House which can only add to one&rsquo;s
          feeling of revulsion and bewilderment that anyone (in
          this case men, in other cases mutatis mutandis, men and
          women or women) should wish to do or to have done to him
          or her the acts so revealed. Some of those other facts,
          though no less revolting to most people than the facts
          set out in the charges, could not possibly have
          constituted an assault in any of the degrees to which I
          have referred.</p>

          <p class="text2">The determination of the appeal,
          however, does not depend on bewilderment or revulsion or
          whether the right approach for the House in the appeal
          ought to be liberal or otherwise. The sole question is
          whether, when a charge of assault is laid under the two
          sections in question, consent is relevant in the sense
          either that the prosecution must prove a lack of consent
          on the part of the person to whom the act is done or that
          the existence of consent by such person constitutes a
          defence for the person charged.</p>

          <p class="text2">If, as seems clear on previous
          authority, it was a general rule of the common law that
          any physical touching could constitute a battery, there
          was an exception where the person touched expressly or
          impliedly consented. As Robert Goff LJ put it in
          <i>Collins v Wilcock</i> [1984] 3 All ER 374 at 378,
          [1984] 1 WLR 1172 at 1177: &lsquo;Generally speaking,
          consent is a defence to battery &hellip;&rsquo; As the
          word &lsquo;generally&rsquo; suggests, the exception was
          itself subject to exceptions. Thus in <i>Stephen&rsquo;s
          Digest of the Criminal Law</i> (3rd edn, 1883) pp
          141&ndash;142, art 206 it is stated: &lsquo;Every one has
          a right to consent to the infliction upon himself of
          bodily harm not amounting to a maim.&rsquo; By way of
          footnote it is explained: &lsquo;Injuries short of maims
          are not criminal at common law unless they are assaults,
          but an assault is inconsistent with consent.&rsquo; Maim
          could not be the subject matter of consent since it
          rendered a man less able to fight or defend himself (see
          1 <i>Hawkin&rsquo;s Pleas of the Crown</i> (8th edn,
          1824) p 107, s 1). Nor could a person consent to the
          infliction of death (see <i>Stephen&rsquo;s Digest of the
          Criminal Law</i> (3rd edn, 1883) p 142, art 207) or to an
          infliction of bodily harm in such manner as to amount to
          a breach of the peace (art 208). It was &lsquo;uncertain
          to what extent any person has a right to consent to his
          being put in danger of death or bodily harm by the act of
          another&rsquo; (art 209), where the example given
          suggests that dangerous acts rendering serious bodily
          harm likely were contemplated.</p>

          <p class="text2">The law has recognised cases where
          consent, expressed or implied, can be a defence to what
          would otherwise be an assault and cases where consent
          cannot be a defence. The former include surgical
          operations, sports, the chastisement of children,
          jostling in a crowd, but all subject to a reasonable
          degree of force being used, tattooing and ear-piercing;
          the latter include death and maiming. None of these
          situations, in most cases pragmatically accepted, either
          covers or is analogous to the facts of the present
          case.</p>

          <p class="text2">It is, however, suggested that the
          answer to the question certified flows from the decisions
          in three cases.</p>

          <p class="text2">The first is <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8
          QBD 534. This is a somewhat remarkable case in that not
          only the two participants in a prize-fight but a number
          of observers were convicted of a common assault. The case
          was said to be relevant to the present question since it
          was decided that consent was not a defence to common
          assault. It is, however, accepted in the present appeal
          that consent can be a defence to common assault. Moreover
          it is plain from the judgment as a whole that a fight of
          this kind, since in public, either did, or had a direct
          tendency to, create a breach of the peace. It drew large
          crowds who gambled, who might have got excited and have
          fought among themselves. Moreover it was plain that such
          fights were brutal&mdash;the fighters went out to kill or
          very gravely injure their opponents and they fought until
          one of them died or was very gravely injured. As Mathew J
          put it (at 544):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;&hellip; the chief incentive to the wretched
            combatants to fight on until (as happens too often)
            dreadful injuries have been inflicted and life
            endangered or sacrificed, is the presence of spectators
            watching with keen interest every incident of the
            fight.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">This emphasis on the risk of a breach of
          the peace and the great danger to the combatants is to be
          found in all of the judgments in the case (for example,
          at 538, 544, 546, 554, 562, 567). I cite only the
          judgment of Stephen J (at 549):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;The principle as to consent seems to me to be
            this: When one person is indicted for inflicting
            personal injury upon another, the consent of the person
            who sustains the injury is no defence to the person who
            inflicts the injury, if the injury is of such a nature,
            or is inflicted under such circumstances, that its
            infliction is injurious to the public as well as to the
            person injured. But the injuries given and received in
            prize-fights are injurious to the public, both because
            it is against the public interest that the lives and
            the health of the combatants should be endangered by
            blows, and because prize-fights are disorderly
            exhibitions, mischievous on many obvious grounds.
            Therefore the consent of the parties to the blows which
            they mutually receive does not prevent those blows from
            being assaults.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">The second case is <i>R v Donovan</i>
          [1934] 2 KB 498, [1934] All ER Rep 207. Here the
          appellant, in private for his sexual gratification, caned
          a girl, who consented and was paid. The appeal was
          allowed because the question of consent was not left to
          the jury, yet it was said that, if the act done was
          itself unlawful, consent to the act could not be a
          defence. This, however, was a long way from <i>R v
          Coney</i>, upon which the essential passage in the
          judgment was largely based, where the act was held to be
          unlawful in all circumstances regardless of consent. In
          <i>R v Donovan</i> there was accepted to be an issue for
          the jury as to whether the prosecution had proved that
          the girl had not consented and whether the consent was
          immaterial.</p>

          <p class="text2">The third case is <i>A</i>-<i>G&rsquo;s
          Reference</i>(<i>No 6 of 1980</i>) [1981] 2 All ER 1057,
          [1981] QB 715. Here two youths fought following an
          argument. There was one bystander but no suggestion of
          public disorder as in <i>R v Coney</i>. If the judgment
          had been limited to the fact that the fight took place in
          public then there would clearly have been a possibility
          of a breach of the peace being caused; but the court laid
          down that even consensual fighting in private constitutes
          an assault on the basis that consent is no defence where
          &lsquo;people &hellip; try to cause or &hellip; cause
          each other bodily harm for no good reason&rsquo; (see
          [1981] 2 All ER 1057 at 1059, [1981] QB 715 at 719).</p>

          <p class="text2">I am not satisfied that fighting in
          private is to be treated always and necessarily as so
          much contrary to the public interest that consent cannot
          be a defence. In any event I think that the question of
          consent in regard to a fight needs special consideration.
          If someone is attacked and fights back he is not to be
          taken as consenting in any real sense. He fights to
          defend himself. If two people agree to fight to settle a
          quarrel the persons fighting may accept the risk of being
          hurt; they do not consent to serious hurt, on the
          contrary the whole object of the fight is to avoid being
          hurt and to hurt the opponent. It seems to me that the
          notion of &lsquo;consent&rsquo; fits ill into the
          situation where there is a fight. It is also very strange
          that a fight in private between two youths where one may,
          at most, get a bloody nose should be unlawful, whereas a
          boxing match where one heavyweight fighter seeks to knock
          out his opponent and possibly do him very serious damage
          should be lawful.</p>

          <p class="text2">Accordingly I do not consider that any
          of these three cases is conclusive in resolving the
          present question.</p>

          <p class="text2">These decisions are not in any event
          binding upon your Lordships&rsquo; House and the matter
          has to be considered as one of principle.</p>

          <p class="text2">Three propositions seem to me to be
          clear.</p>

          <p class="text2">It is &lsquo;&hellip; inherent in the
          conception of assault and battery that the victim does
          not consent&rsquo; (see Glanville Williams &lsquo;Consent
          and Public Policy&rsquo; [1962] Crim LR 74 at 75).
          Secondly, consent must be full and free and must be as to
          the actual level of force used or pain inflicted.
          Thirdly, there exist areas where the law disregards the
          victim&rsquo;s consent even where that consent is freely
          and fully given. These areas may relate to the person (eg
          a child); they may relate to the place (eg in public);
          they may relate to the nature of the harm done. It is the
          latter which is in issue in the present case.</p>

          <p class="text2">I accept that consent cannot be said
          simply to be a defence to any act which one person does
          to another. A line has to be drawn as to what can and as
          to what cannot be the subject of consent. In this regard
          it is relevant to recall what was said by Stephen J in
          <i>R v Coney</i> (1882) 8 QBD 534 at 549. Even though he
          was referring to the position at common law, his words
          seem to me to be of relevance to a consideration of the
          statute in question.</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;In cases where life and limb are exposed to no
            serious danger in the common course of things, I think
            that consent is a defence to a charge of assault, even
            when considerable force is used that, as, for instance,
            in cases of wrestling, single-stick, sparring with
            gloves, football, and the like; but in all cases the
            question whether consent does or does not take from the
            application of force to another its illegal character,
            is a question of degree depending upon
            circumstances.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">There are passages in the judgment of
          McInerney J in the Australian case of <i>Pallante v
          Stadiums Pty Ltd</i>(<i>No 1</i>) [1976] VR 331, where a
          boxing match was in issue, which also seem to me to be
          helpful. Thus (at 340):</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;It is easy to understand the proposition that if
            the harm to which consent is alleged to have been given
            is really grievous, as, for instance, in a case of
            maiming, the consent should be treated as nugatory:
            see, for instance, <i>Stephen&rsquo;s Digest of
            Criminal Law</i> (7th edn, 1926, art 290). In <i>Cross
            and Jones</i>&rsquo; &ldquo;/An Introduction to
            Criminal Law/&rdquo; (7th edn, 1972, p 40) it is
            suggested as a reason for this conclusion that the
            injured person is likely to become the charge of
            society. This may be a good enough reason, though I
            would think it is not the primary reason. The primary
            reason, I would think, is that, as a general
            proposition, it injures society if a person is allowed
            to consent to the infliction on himself of such a
            degree of serious physical harm &hellip; Grievous
            bodily harm is now to be understood as meaning
            &ldquo;really serious bodily harm&rdquo;. So
            understood, the dictum of Stephen, J., in
            <i>Coney&rsquo;s Case</i> ((1882) 8 QBD 534 at 549) [ie
            that the infliction of the blows is regarded as
            injurious to the public as well as to the person
            injured] may, as Cross and Jones point out in the work
            cited (at p 40), require to be understood as meaning
            that a person can lawfully consent to the infliction of
            bodily harm upon himself provided it falls short of
            being grievous bodily harm.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">I do not think a line can simply be
          drawn between &lsquo;maiming&rsquo; and death on the one
          hand and everything else on the other hand. The rationale
          for negating consent when maiming occurred has gone. It
          is, however, possible to draw the line, and the line
          should be drawn, between really serious injury on the one
          hand and less serious injuries on the other. I do not
          accept that it is right to take common assault as the
          sole category of assaults to which consent can be a
          defence and to deny that defence in respect of all other
          injuries. In the first place the range of injuries which
          can fall within &lsquo;actual bodily harm&rsquo; is
          wide&mdash;the description of two beatings in the present
          case show that one is much more substantial than the
          other. Further, the same is true of wounding where the
          test is whether the skin is broken and where it can be
          more or less serious. I can see no significant reason for
          refusing consent as a defence for the lesser of these
          cases of actual bodily harm and wounding.</p>

          <p class="text2">If a line has to be drawn, as I think it
          must, to be workable it cannot be allowed to fluctuate
          within particular charges and in the interests of legal
          certainty it has to be accepted that consent can be given
          to acts which are said to constitute actual bodily harm
          and wounding. Grievous bodily harm I accept to be
          different by analogy with and as an extension of the old
          cases on maiming. Accordingly, I accept that, other than
          for cases of grievous bodily harm or death, consent can
          be a defence. This in no way means that the acts done are
          approved of or encouraged. It means no more than that the
          acts do not constitute an assault within the meaning of
          these two specific sections of the Offences against the
          Person Act 1861.</p>

          <p class="text2">None of the convictions in the present
          cases have been on the basis that grievous bodily harm
          was caused. Whether some of the acts done in these cases
          might have fallen within that category does not seem to
          me to be relevant for present purposes.</p>

          <p class="text2">Even if the act done constitutes common
          assault, actual bodily harm or wounding, it remains to be
          established that the act was done otherwise than in
          public and that it was done with full consent. I do not
          accept the suggested test as to whether an offence is
          committed, to be whether there is expense to the state in
          the form of medical assistance or social security
          payments. It seems to me better to ask whether the act
          was done in private or in public: is the public harmed or
          offended by seeing what is done or is a breach of the
          peace likely to be provoked? Nor do I consider that
          &lsquo;hostility&rsquo; in the sense of
          &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; is a necessary element to an
          assault. It is sufficient if what is done is done
          intentionally and against the will of the person to whom
          it is done. These features in themselves constitute
          &lsquo;hostility&rsquo;.</p>

          <p class="text2">In <i>R v Wollaston</i> (1872) 26 LT 403
          at 404 (where indecent assault was charged) Kelly CB,
          with whom the rest of the court concurred, said:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <span class="yellow">&lsquo;If anything is done by one
            being upon the person of another to make the act a
            criminal assault, it must be done without the consent
            and against the will of the person upon whom it is
            done. Mere submission is not consent, for there may be
            submission without consent, and while the feelings are
            repugnant to the act being done. Mere submission is
            totally different from consent.</span> But in the
            present case there was actual participation by both
            parties in the act done, and complete mutuality.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">In the present cases there is no doubt
          that there was consent; indeed there was more than mere
          consent. Astonishing though it may seem, the persons
          involved positively wanted, asked for, the acts to be
          done to them, acts which it seems from the evidence some
          of them also did to themselves. All the accused were old
          enough to know what they were doing. The acts were done
          in private. Neither the applicants nor anyone else
          complained as to what was done. The matter came to the
          attention of the police &lsquo;coincidentally&rsquo;; the
          police were previously unaware that the accused were
          involved in these practices though some of them had been
          involved for many years. The acts did not result in any
          permanent or serious injury or disability or any
          infection and no medical assistance was required even
          though there may have been some risk of infection, even
          injury.</p>

          <p class="text2">There has been much argument as to
          whether lack of consent is a constituent of the offence
          which must be proved by the prosecution or whether
          consent is simply raised by way of defence. Reliance is
          placed on the Canadian case of <i>R v Ciccarelli</i>
          (1989) 54 CCC (3d) 121 at 123, where it is said that in
          the absence of express consent the Crown must prove that
          the victim did not impliedly consent to the act done.
          That decision, however, is in the context of s 244 of the
          Criminal Code (Revised Statutes of Canada 1970), which
          provides:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;A person commits an assault when, without the
            consent of another person, or with consent (a) he
            applies force intentionally to the person of the other,
            directly or indirectly &hellip;&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text1">In the present statute there is no such
          provision, but it seems to me that here too the onus is
          on the prosecution to prove that there was no consent on
          the part of the person said to have been assaulted.</p>

          <p class="text2">It has been suggested that if the act
          done is otherwise unlawful then consent cannot be a
          defence, but it can be a defence, if the act is otherwise
          lawful, in respect of injury which is less than really
          serious injury. That would produce the result in the
          present case that if these acts are done by two men they
          would be lawful by reason of s 1 of the Sexual Offences
          Act 1967, even though the acts are far away from the
          kinds of homosexual acts which the Wolfenden Report had
          in mind (see the <i>Report of the Committee on Homosexual
          Offences and Prostitution</i> (Cmnd 247 (1957)) para
          105); in that situation, consent, it is said, would be a
          defence. If on the other hand three men took part, the
          activity would be unlawful under the 1967 Act, so that
          there could be no consent to the acts done. But it would
          also appear to mean that if these acts were done mutatis
          mutandis by a man and a woman, or between two men and a
          woman, or a man and two women, where the activity was
          entirely heterosexual, consent would prevent there being
          an offence. I do not find that this distinction produces
          an acceptable result.</p>

          <p class="text2">My conclusion is thus that, as the law
          stands, adults can consent to acts done in private which
          do not result in serious bodily harm, so that such acts
          do not constitute criminal assaults for the purposes of
          the 1861 Act. My conclusion is not based on the
          alternative argument that for the criminal law to
          encompass consensual acts done in private would in itself
          be an unlawful invasion of privacy. If these acts between
          consenting adults in private did constitute criminal
          offences under the 1861 Act, there would clearly be an
          invasion of privacy. Whether that invasion would be
          justified and in particular whether it would be within
          the derogations permitted by art 8(2) of the European
          Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
          Fundamental Freedoms (Rome, 4 November 1950; TS 71
          (1953); Cmd 8969) it is not necessary, on the conclusion
          to which I have come, to decide, despite the interesting
          arguments address to your Lordships on that question and
          even on the basis that English law includes a principle
          parallel to that set out in the European Convention on
          Human Rights.</p>

          <p class="text2">Mr Kershen QC contended in a very
          helpful argument that the answer to the question should
          be on the basis (a) of existing law or (b) that a new
          ruling was to be given. My conclusion is on the basis of
          what I consider existing law to be. I do not consider
          that it is necessary for the House in its judicial
          capacity to give what is called &lsquo;a new
          ruling&rsquo; based on freedom of expression, public
          opinion and the consequences of a negative ruling on
          those whom it is said can only get satisfaction through
          these acts; indeed the latter I regard as being of no or
          at best of little relevance to the decision in this case.
          Nor do I think that it is for your Lordships to make new
          law on the basis of the position in other states so that
          English law can &lsquo;keep in line&rsquo;. All these are
          essentially matters, in my view, to be balanced by the
          legislature if it is thought necessary to consider the
          making criminal of sadomasochistic acts per se. The
          problems involved are carefully analysed by Dr L H Leigh
          in &lsquo;Sado-masochism, consent and the reform of the
          criminal law&rsquo; (1976) 39 MLR 130.</p>

          <p class="text2">The Director of Public Prosecution
          contends in her written submissions:</p>

          <blockquote>
            &lsquo;In the end it is a matter of policy. Is/are the
            state/courts right to adopt a paternalistic attitude as
            to what is bad or good for subjects, in particular as
            to deliberate injury.&rsquo;
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text2">I agree that in the end it is a matter
          of policy. It is a matter of policy in an area where
          social and moral factors are extremely important and
          where attitudes can change. In my opinion it is a matter
          of policy for the legislature to decide. If society takes
          the view that this kind of behaviour, even though sought
          after and done in private, is either so new or so
          extensive or so undesirable that it should be brought now
          for the first time within the criminal law, then it is
          for the legislature to decide. It is not for the courts
          in the interests of &lsquo;paternalism&rsquo;, as
          referred to in the passage I have quoted, or in order to
          protect people from themselves, to introduce, into
          existing statutory crimes relating to offences
          <i>against</i> the person, concepts which do not properly
          fit there. If Parliament considers that the behaviour
          revealed here should be made specifically criminal, then
          the Offences against the Person Act 1861 or, perhaps more
          appropriately, the Sexual Offences Act 1967 can be
          amended specifically to define it. Alternatively, if it
          is intended that this sort of conduct should be lawful as
          between two persons but not between more than two persons
          as falling within the offence of gross indecency, then
          the limitation period for prosecution can be extended and
          the penalties increased where sado-masochistic acts are
          involved. That is obviously a possible course; whether it
          is a desirable way of changing the law is a different
          question.</p>

          <p class="text2">I would therefore answer the question
          certified on the basis that, where a charge is brought in
          respect of acts done between adults in private under s 20
          of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 in respect of
          wounding and under s 47 in respect of causing actual
          bodily harm, it must be proved by the prosecution that
          the person to whom the act was done did not consent to
          it.</p>

          <p class="text2">Accordingly, I consider that these
          appeals should be allowed and the convictions set
          aside.</p>
