      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This file contains the text of
      the British Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which, as
      the title indicates, was enacted into law by Parliament in
      1861. It has been extensively amended by later enactments and
      large sections have been either deleted or replaced by later
      acts of Parliament. The deletions are indicated by ellipses:
      [. . .]. This act is effective in England, Wales, and
      Northern Ireland. Scotland has a separate body of law.
      Several legal commentators have argued that non-therapeutic
      male circumcison violates portions of this criminal law and
      that no consent can be given for a criminal act. This
      reasoning is based on the case of <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/UKlaw/rvbrown1993/"><i>
      R v Brown</i> [1993]</a>. Sections <a href="#sec20">20</a>
      and <a href="#sec47">47</a> remain in effect and are cited by
      their Lordships.]</p>
