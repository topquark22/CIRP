      <h1>Circumcision: Legal issues</h1>

      <p>This page indexes legal material relevant to the
      performance of male circumcision. Documents are indexed in
      chronological order of publication.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The English-speaking nations share the English language,
      the common law, and male circumcision as part of their
      history and culture since the late 19th century. This page
      incorporates relevant legal reference material from the
      several English-speaking nations.</p>

      <p>Some definitions: A "botched" circumcision is one that is
      poorly done and has obvious unexpected results. "Wrongful
      circumcision" is circumcision done without valid informed
      consent. Botched circumcision and wrongful circumcision
      constitute malpractice.</p>

      <p>Prior to 1984, circumcision law was included under
      malpractice law: Doctors who "botched" circumcisions could
      only be sued for failing to adhere to the "standard of
      care."<sup>3,4,5</sup> There were, however, a number of
      circumcision malpractice cases that succeeded on these
      grounds.</p>

      <p>Starting in 1984, academics began to apply general
      principles of health care law and medical ethics to examine
      the legality of male circumcision. Children are legally
      regarded as <cite>incompetent persons</cite> who are unable
      to give consent. These principles imply that circumcision of
      male children (or any other operation done under proxy
      consent), when unnecessary and performed for other than
      express therapeutic purposes, may not be legal regardless of
      the standard of care. There are no valid medical indications
      for male circumcision in the neonatal period; <sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/">*</a></sup>
      therefore routine male neonatal circumcision constitutes a
      non-therapeutic procedure &mdash; and now the American
      Medical Association has identified male neonatal circumcision
      as a <cite>non-therapeutic procedure</cite> in its <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/">policy
      statement</a>.</p>

      <p>All persons enjoy a general right to bodily integrity.
      This has been true from at least as far back as the time of
      Blackstone; it has been affirmed by the United States Supreme
      Court in <cite>Union Pacific Railway Company v.
      Botsford</cite>, 141 U.S. 250 (1891), and reaffirmed in
      <cite>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</cite>, <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/505/833.html">505 U.S.
      833</a> (1992). Male neonatal non-therapeutic circumcision
      removes healthy functional tissue and is viewed by many as an
      infringement upon the right to bodily integrity.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/somerville/">Somerville</a>
      discussed the legal distinction between therapeutic and
      non-therapeutic procedures and between operations on
      competent and incompetent people in a 1980 paper.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/brigman/">William E.
      Brigman</a> used new medical evidence to argue that
      circumcision is child abuse, and discussed possible legal
      remedies.<sup>8</sup> Recent medical articles have documented
      the actual injury of circumcision, making it possible for a
      knowledgable attorney to win damages for wrongful
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Recent legal commentary in the several nations has pointed
      out numerous legal problems with the practice of circumcision
      of male children in general, even when done with parental
      consent and not botched. There is increasing concern that
      (forcible) child circumcision is a violation of numerous
      provisions of international human rights
      law.<sup>17,18,23</sup> Legal writers in the several
      English-speaking nations have been expressing concern in law
      review articles.<sup>6,7,8,9,23,24,25,26,27</sup></p>

      <p>Interpreting the legal status of circumcision objectively
      is difficult, owing to the cultural background and long
      history of the practice. A 1961 New York case (<cite>Kalina
      vs General Hospital of the City of Syracuse</cite> (100 NYS2d
      226, 18 A.D.2d 757 (1962)) classifies circumcision as an
      assault; furthermore, it finds that the assaulted child has a
      right of recovery.<sup>2,3,5</sup></p>

      <p>A 1980s California case questioned the power of parents in
      California to consent to surgical procedures (in this case
      male circumcision) which had no medical purpose.<sup>10</sup>
      Exceptionally, California statute law allows parents to
      consent to surgical procedures "regardless of purpose." The
      right of parents in that state to consent to male
      circumcision was upheld by the appellate court on that narrow
      ground while ignoring other applicable law. The California
      Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Apparently, the
      courts were not yet ready to address the issue. A case on
      circumcision (Re "J") has been decided in the United Kingdom.
      The court determined that circumcision is not in the best
      interest of the child concerned.</p>

      <p>Lynn E. Lebit, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/lebit/">in a 1992
      article,<sup>11</sup></a> stressed the need for courts to
      protect the rights of minors and other legally incompetent
      persons. The power of parental proxy consent is much more
      limited than that of adult personal consent. There has been a
      general trend in society and in the courts to accord more
      recognition to the rights of minors, rights that exist
      independently of their parents.<sup>11,14</sup> It is not at
      all clear that parental consent to the removal of healthy
      functional tissue from the body of an incompetent minor child
      is valid: If parental proxy consent to non-therapeutic
      circumcision of minor children were to be found to be invalid
      or vitiated, then almost all circumcisions of minor children
      are wrongful circumcisions.</p>

      <p>The Law Reform Commission of Queensland (Australia)
      published a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/QLRC/">research
      paper</a> on the lawfulness of male circumcision in 1993. <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/QLRC/"><sup>12</sup></a>
      The paper cited the Australian High Court case of
      <cite>Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services
      v JWB and SMB</cite> (1992) <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/">175 CLR 218</a> and
      concluded that male circumcision was unlawful; but failed to
      propose further action which would enforce the rights of
      children.</p>

      <p>Solicitor Christopher P. Price, M.A., prepared a
      significant <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/price-uklc/">brief</a>
      for the Law Commission of England and Wales<sup>17</sup>. A
      <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/price/">condensed
      version</a> was later published by the <cite>Bulletin of
      Medical Ethics</cite>.<sup>18</sup></p>

      <p>In 1997, Margaret A. Somerville, founder and director of
      the McGill Center for Medicine, Ethics and Law in
      Montr&eacute;al, characterized male circumcision as
      "technically criminal assault" under the Canadian criminal
      code.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/chessler/">Chessler</a>
      published a major review of the circumcision issues in the
      Buffalo Law Review.<sup>24</sup></p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/povenmire/">Povenmire</a>
      argues that any parental rights should be subordinated to the
      child's right to bodily integrity; a court order should be
      required before the forcible circumcision of a child is
      allowed.<sup>25</sup></p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/smith/">Smith</a> of
      the Netherlands Institute of Human Rights has published a
      report on the human rights violations inherent in neonatal
      male circumcision.<sup>26</sup></p>

      <p>Two papers that were published in early 1999 are relevant,
      in that they challenge the validity of parental consent and
      the lawfulness of male neonatal circumcision as it is
      customarily performed in the United States and several other
      English-speaking nations.<sup>27,29</sup>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/price2/">Price</a>
        elaborated the distinctions between therapeutic and
        non-therapeutic procedures.<sup>29</sup></li>

        <li><a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/vanhowe5/">Van
        Howe, Svoboda, Dwyer, and Price</a> maintain that parents
        do not have the right to consent to the removal of healthy,
        functional tissue from a healthy child, and therefore,
        physicians who continue to perform circumcisions, not only
        are in violation of law, but undertake appreciable legal
        risks as all neonatal non-therapeutic circumcisions are
        unconsented injuries.<sup>27</sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, in a recent <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">circumcision
      policy statement</a>, declared circumcision to be
      non-essential to child health; male circumcision must now be
      viewed in an entirely different light legally from that of an
      essential and necessary procedure.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/">Boyle,
      Svoboda, Price, and Turner</a> argue that non-therapeutic
      circumcision of healthy boys is criminal assault, and that
      legal action is needed to protect boys from this kind of
      assault.<sup>33</sup></p>

      <p>The American Medical Association has issued a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/">statement
      on neonatal circumcision</a> in which it defines neonatal
      male circumcision as a <cite>non-therapeutic</cite>
      procedure</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/">Hodges</a>
      reports on the legal protection given to the prepuce in the
      ancient world.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <p>Martin comments on changing standards regarding informed
      consent in cases of intersexed children. Her comments also
      appear to be applicable to informed consent for
      circumcision.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/#n38">38</a></sup></p>

      <p>As of this writing, however, no court in any jurisdiction
      (to our knowledge) has considered forcible involuntary male
      circumcision to fall under existing laws against assault.
      This means that, for the moment, the legality of male
      circumcision is in a gray area. This situation seems destined
      to change as lawyers who are interested in the welfare of
      children are increasingly concerned about the lack of
      resolution of the legal status of male child circumcision.
      Recently, an 18-year-old man brought a lawsuit in New York
      against the doctor who neonatally circumcised him and the
      hospital in which the circumcision was carried out.</p>

      <h2>State Medical Boards</h2>
      Persons who believe a medical doctor has been negligent, or
      otherwise has behaved improperly or in an unethical fashion
      in relation to the circumcision of male infants, may wish to
      file a suit against a medical doctor and/or a hospital,
      especially if a person has been seriously injured. If this is
      the case, one should consult appropriate knowledgeable legal
      counsel. 

      <p>If the complaint does not involve an actual injury,
      persons may wish to report the behavior to the appropriate
      medical licensing board for appropriate disciplinary
      action.</p>

      <p>The regulation of medical practice is a function of state
      government in the USA. The <a
      href="http://www.fsmb.org/">Federation of State Medical
      Boards</a>, a federation of 69 member boards, maintains a
      website with a listing of the <a
      href="http://www.fsmb.org/members.htm">addresses of the
      various state medical boards</a>. Doctors who behave in an
      unethical or unlawful fashion should be reported to the
      appropriate state board for disciplinary action. This is for
      the benefit of the medical profession and the protection of
      the public. These actions may also be the subject of
      litigation especially if the malpractice results in personal
      injury. One should consult appropriate knowledgable
      counsel.</p>

      <p>In the case of male circumcision, such actions as</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provision of false medical information to the
        public</li>

        <li>solicitation for surgery</li>

        <li>promotion of unnecessary circumcision</li>

        <li>use of coercion to obtain consent</li>

        <li>failure to provide complete and accurate <a
        href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/">informed
        consent</a>,</li>

        <li>failure to provide information on <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/">conservative
        alternatives</a> to male circumcision including no
        circumcision,</li>

        <li>performance of circumcision without consent,</li>

        <li>failure to use <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/">appropriate
        analgesia</a>,</li>

        <li>delegation of the practice of medicine to an unlicensed
        individual, and</li>

        <li>negligent performance of circumcision which results in
        a botched circumcision</li>
      </ul>

      <p>are examples of misbehavior which should be reported to
      the appropriate state board.</p>

      <p>Intact boys are frequently the subject of maltreatment by
      ill-trained physicians. Premature forcible retraction of the
      foreskin is injurious to the boy and is contraindicated. It
      is actionable malpractice. It should also be reported to the
      State Medical Board.</p>

      <h4>Information for the United Kingdom</h4>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/gmc/">General
      Medical Council</a> receives complaints and regulates the
      practice of medicine in the United Kingdom. Complaints should
      be sent to:</p>

      <blockquote>
        General Medical Council<br />

         Fax 0171 915 3641
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Information for Australia</h4>
      In Australia, each state or territory has its own medical
      board to regulate medical practice. Addresses of the various
      boards are listed at <a
      href="http://www.amc.org.au/board.asp">Medical Boards</a>.
      Persons in Australia should lodge complaints against medical
      doctors with the appropriate medical board. 

      <h4>Information for Canada</h4>
      In Canada, medical practice is regulated by the provincial
      Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. Addresses and links to
      the various Colleges are available on the <a
      href="http://www.cfpc.ca/CPS.htm">College of Family
      Physicians of Canada</a> Web site. Persons in Canada should
      lodge complaints against medical doctors with the appropriate
      Provincial college.
