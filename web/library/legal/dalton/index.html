      <h3>GUIDELINES ON CIRCUMCISION<br />
      <br />
       Legal Position is Unclear</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>EDITOR- In the news item by Linda Beecham the chairman of
      the General Medical Council standards committee, Professor
      Sir Cyril Chantler, assures readers that male circumcision is
      legal<sup>1</sup>. The position is not, however, as clear as
      he claims. There is no doubt that parents have the power to
      give proxy consent for removal of an incompetent child's
      foreskin or any other tissue when removal is strictly
      necessary for therapeutic reasons. When the removal of tissue
      is not necessary for treating or diagnosing disease a parent
      only has the legal power of consent to a procedure which
      causes negligible risk and minimal burden <sup>2</sup>. Male
      circumcision causes at least a 2% risk of clinically
      important complications<sup>3</sup>, removes specialised
      tissue<sup>4</sup>, and may be later regretted by the
      patient<sup>5</sup>. It therefore meets neither the
      requirement for negligible risk nor that for minimal
      burden.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to see how the GMC could escape the
      conclusion that it is impossible for doctors to obtain valid
      consent for the non-therapeutic circumcision of healthy
      infants. The claim that parents would turn to people "who
      lacked the skills to perform the procedure competently" is
      superficially attractive, but the therapeutic context does
      not render ethical surgery which has no therapeutic intent
      and which is performed without the consent of the patient. No
      matter how great the benefits of the procedure it is bad
      medicine if it is performed without consent.</p>
