        <h2>INFORMED CONSENT AND INFANT MALE CIRCUMCISION</h2>

        <p class="author">Les Haberfield*</p>
      </center>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Very little legal literature has been written on the issue
      of infant male circumcision. This paper discusses the concept
      of informed consent generally and as it applies to infant
      male circumcision. It is suggested that without disclosing
      the material risks of this procedure to parents, doctors face
      an appreciable risk a negligence action should something go
      wrong.</p>

      <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</p>

      <p>Infant male circumcision has been the focus of some media
      attention[<a href="#n1">1</a>] and legal writing[<a
      href="#n2">2</a>] in recent times, suggesting that due to
      medical risks, parents cannot give an effective consent to
      the procedure, and that doctors and parents are at risk of an
      injured child or representative bringing a civil action
      against either or both of them.</p>

      <p>In previous publications,[<a href="#n3">3</a>] this author
      disagreed with the conclusion that a parental consent might
      be vitiated and hence held ineffective by a court. It was
      argued that parents and doctors are not acting unreasonably
      while some medical justification can be shown for the
      procedure, and that the State is currently not justified in
      prohibiting the practice of infant male circumcision.</p>

      <p><font color="navy">[CIRP Note: Haberfield argued in 1997
      that parents should have a right to circumcise children
      because there may be some medical benefit attached to
      neonatal circumcision. Several medical societies in the
      United States and the United Kingdom have issued position
      statements since 1997 that generally state that neonatal
      circumcision is a non-therapeutic procedure that has no
      medical indication and cannot be recommended on any medical
      basis and furthermore that the risks, complications, and
      drawbacks outweigh any possible benefit. These medical
      societies include the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a>, the <a
      href="/library/statements/ama2000/">American Medical
      Association</a>, and the <a
      href="/library/statements/aafp2002/">American Academy of
      Family Physicians</a> in the United States, and a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/RCS2001/">joint
      statement</a> by the Royal College of Surgeons, the British
      Association of Paediatric Surgeons and other organisations in
      the United Kingdom. Haberfield's major premise (that male
      neonatal circumcision has medical value) for his argument
      seems increasingly dubious.]</font></p>

      <p>Where doctors may be at risk of litigation, however, is
      where they perform a circumcision procedure without giving
      appropriate information (including the risks of the
      procedure) to parents to enable them to give an informed
      consent. Should something go wrong in these circumstances,
      doctors may find themselves liable in negligence.</p>

      <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Informed Consent</p>

      <p>The question of doctors providing adequate information to
      patients to make appropriate decisions concerning surgery
      arose in a number of Australian courts and in other common
      law jurisdictions in the 1980s.[<a href="#n4">4</a>]</p>

      <p>The need for a definitive statement on the law in this
      area was finally disclosed when the issue reached the High
      Court in <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/do/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr479.html?query=%20Rogers%20v%20Whitaker">
      <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i></a>[<a href="#n5">5</a>] in
      1992.</p>

      <p>In that case, a patient underwent an elective operation on
      her right eye for both therapeutic and cosmetic purposes. At
      a consultation prior to surgery, the patient persistently
      questioned the surgeon about possible complications and
      accidental interference to her left eye. The subsequent
      operation failed to improve sight in her right eye as a
      result of the surgery, and the patient contracted a condition
      known as "sympathetic opthalmia" affecting her left eye and
      leaving her virtually blind.</p>

      <p>While the patient failed to specifically ask about the
      possibility of sympathetic ophthalmia, her persistent
      questioning of the doctor should have been sufficient
      indication to him to reveal the risk of this complication,
      however small. It had been accepted at the trial that the
      condition occurred on average only once every fourteen
      thousand such procedures.[<a href="#n6">6</a>]</p>

      <p>The High Court held, in the case, that a doctor has a duty
      to exercise reasonable care both in the provision of
      professional advice as well as treatment.[<a
      href="#n7">7</a>] A doctor has a duty to warn a patient of
      material risks inherent in a proposed procedure or treatment.
      A risk is material if, in the circumstances of the particular
      case, reasonable person in the patients condition, if warned
      of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it.
      Alliteratively, a risk is also material if the doctor is, or
      should have been aware from the circumstances that the
      particular patient would have attached significance to the
      risk. In this case, "the fact that the patient asked
      questions revealing concern about the risk [to her good eye]
      made the doctor aware that this patient did in fact attach
      significance to the risk."[<a href="#n8">8</a>] Accordingly,
      the surgeon was negligent in failing to disclose the risk of
      sympathetic ophthalmia.</p>

      <p>The High Court specifically rejected the English approach
      of <i>Bolam V. Friern Hospital Management Committee</i>[<a
      href="#n9">9</a>] which suggests that a doctor is not
      negligent if he acts in accordance with a practice of
      disclosure accepted as appropriate by a responsible body of
      medical opinion, even if other doctors adopt a different
      practice. The High Court majority stated that "while evidence
      of acceptable medical practice is a useful guide for the
      courts, it is for the courts to adjudicate on what is the
      appropriate standard of care"[<a href="#n10">10</a>] after
      giving weight to a person's right to make decisions about his
      own life.</p>

      <p>In the few years since the decision of <i>Rogers v.
      Whitaker</i>,[<a href="#n11">11</a>] a number of courts in
      Australia have applied the principles of that case. In
      <i>Teik Huat Tai v. Saxon</i>,[<a href="#n12">12</a>] for
      example, the Western Australian Supreme Court found an
      obstetrician and gynaecologist negligent in failing to advise
      that recto-vaginal fistula could occur following hysterectomy
      and vaginal damage. The Court accepted that the risk of
      recto-vaginal damage following hysterectomy was not high. In
      the opinion of one expert called for he appellant doctor, the
      risk of perforation of the bowel during vaginal hysterectomy
      was at most one in 500, and once repaired there was only one
      in 200 chance of the repaired perforation leaking. While not
      life-threatening, the leakage of faeces through the vagina
      may be a very unpleasant experience affecting the woman's
      self-esteem. The Court was prepared to accept that, had the
      respondent been warned of the risk, she would not have had
      the operation.</p>

      <p>In <i>Dunning v. Scheiber</i>,[<a href="#n13">13</a>] the
      plaintiff, in electing to have tatoos removed from her back
      and arms by laser treatment, suffered severe pain following
      treatment, significant scarring (sensitive to heat and
      painful when bumped), and altered skin appearance. The Court
      found that the patient was not given a sufficient explanation
      of the effects of laser treatment and associated risks, and
      accordingly held the doctor negligent.</p>

      <p>Two Queensland decisions also demonstrate the application
      of these principles in cases of elective or cosmetic surgery.
      In <i>Shaw v. Langley</i>,[<a href="#n14">14</a>] a surgeon
      was found negligent in failing to disclose all material risks
      where a plaintiff seeking breast augmentation mammaplasty was
      left with scarring, asymmetrical breasts following the
      procedure. In <i>Tekanawa v. Millican</i>,[<a
      href="#n15">15</a>] a doctor had failed to tell a patient of
      the potential and likely range of results following a "tummy
      tuck" operation. While the medical evidence showed that her
      level of subsequent scarring was not totally unexpected
      following surgery,[<a href="#n16">16</a>] the plaintiff had
      reasonably believed on the basis of her discussions with the
      surgeon that the scar would hardly be noticeable within a
      year of surgery. In these circumstances, the doctor was held
      to be negligent. It is worth noting in this case that while
      the doctor had given the patient an information circular on
      the procedure, it was insufficient and misleading in relation
      to the likely scarring the patient eventually suffered, and
      accordingly failed to protect the medical practitioner from
      liability.</p>

      <p>Further application of these principles are found in
      <i>Chappel v Hart</i>,[<a href="#n17">17</a>] where an ENT
      surgeon was held to be negligent in failing to warn a patient
      having throat surgery, that the operation could seriously
      affect the quality of her voice.</p>

      <p>Similarly in <i>Hribar v. Wells</i>[<a href="#n18">18</a>]
      a dental surgeon who performed an osteotomy on the
      plaintiff's jaw to correct a malocclusion was found to be
      negligent in failing to advise her of the risk of permanent
      numbness around her lips and mouth.</p>

      <p>Most of the cases following <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>[<a
      href="#n19">19</a>] have involved elective surgery of a
      cosmetic nature. It would seem that a plaintiff will find it
      easier to succeed in these circumstances since the necessary
      element of causation is more readily demonstrated. That is,
      if a patient is warned of a serious risk of an adverse result
      (from his or her point of view) in elective surgery, he or
      she would be less likely to consent to a procedure.
      Additionally, the standard of care expected might increase in
      such cases. In <i>Tekanawa v. Millican</i>, for example, the
      Court suggested that the duty of care is perhaps even higher
      when the procedure being contemplated is truly elective and
      not required for therapeutic purposes.[<a
      href="#n20">20</a>]</p>

      <p>In <i>Karpati v. Spira &amp; Ors</i>,[<a
      href="#n21">21</a>] on the other hand, the New South Wales
      Supreme Court found that a surgeon was not negligent in the
      provision of advice prior to performing a stereotactic
      thalamotomy to treat a Parkinsonian tremor in the plaintiff's
      right arm. This procedure is performed only as a last resort
      when medication is no longer controlling Parkinsonian
      tremors. While the evidence showed that there was a five
      percent risk of stroke associated with the procedure
      (eventually suffered by the plaintiff, there was substantial
      evidence that the plaintiff was prepared to accept the risk
      of stroke in view of the operation's high success rate and
      the discomfort associated with his condition. In these
      circumstances, the plaintiff could not establish causation
      since, he could not show that the lack of warning concerning
      the risk of stroke influenced his decision to consent to
      surgery.</p>

      <p>The recent New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in
      <i>Lowns v. Woods</i>[<a href="#n22">22</a>] is also
      instructive on this point. The majority of Kirby P and
      Mahoney JA found that a specialist was not negligent in
      failing to advise a patient's mother about the possibility of
      using rectal Valium to stop the epileptic fit the plaintiff
      (given an assessment and understanding of the prevailing
      medical opinions concerning such treatment at the time). The
      majority however were persuaded by the additional reason of
      the lack of causation in the case. The court considered that
      it was improbable, even if the advice was given, that the
      plaintiff's mother would have acquired the rectal Valium
      before the critical seizure of the child.</p>

      <p>In general, however, it is clear that doctors should
      disclose material information relevant to a particular
      patient. The High Court in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>[<a
      href="#n23">23</a>] suggested that what should be disclosed
      depended upon a complex of factors including the nature of
      the treatment, the nature of the matter to be disclosed, the
      desire of the patient for information, the temperament and
      health of the patient, and the general surrounding
      circumstances. While this has some "ring of conceptual
      certainty, in practice deciding the level of necessary
      disclosure is problematic.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/nhmrc/">National
      Health and Medical Council</a> has produced much-needed
      general <a
      href="http://www.health.gov.au/nhmrc/publications/fullhtml/cp60.htm">
      guidelines</a>[<a href="#n24">24</a>] for doctors which
      summarises, and to some extent expands, the general duty of
      disclosure owed by medical practitioners to their
      patients.</p>

      <p>This publication is both a direct result of the
      significance of <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>[<a
      href="#n25">25</a>] to medical practice and the
      recommendations of a joint Law Reforms Commission Study on
      "Informed Decisions about Medical Practice" published in
      1989.[<a href="#n26">26</a>]</p>

      <p>The Law Reforms Commission study surveyed a number of
      doctors and patients and found that less than half the
      doctors surveyed recognised a patient's "right to know"
      information[<a href="#n27">27</a>]. The report further found
      that only two-thirds of doctors surveyed could give even a
      minimal definition of informed consent, and less than half
      thought it necessary or important.[<a href="#n28">28</a>] In
      contrast, however, 92 percent of surveyed patients indicated
      that they want to be told everything about their treatment,
      even if unfavorable.[<a href="#n29">29</a>]</p>

      <p>It might be interesting to perform a follow-up empirical
      study or survey to see what effect, if any, the above
      litigation and professional literature has had on the medical
      profession's attitude to the dissemination of information to
      the consent of patients to medical treatment.</p>

      <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Informed Consent and Infant Male
      Circumcision</p>

      <p>While the popularity of routine infant male circumcision
      has fallen significantly in the past two decades,
      conservative estimates show that the procedure is performed
      on about ten percent of male infants in Australia today.[<a
      href="#n30">30</a>]</p>

      <p>The fall in the rate of infant routine male circumcision
      reflects a decreased enthusiasm for the procedure by the
      medical profession in Australia in that period. The
      Australian Medical Association stated in 1993 that the
      practice of circumcision of newborn males is generally
      discouraged by the medical profession.[<a href="#n31">31</a>]
      The position of the <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1983/">Australian College of
      Paediatrics</a> in 1991 was one which, while allowing that
      some parents will still opt for the procedure after
      considering all relevant factors, discouraged the
      practice.[<a href="#n32">32</a>]</p>

      <p>Since that time, new benefits have been claimed for infant
      male circumcision including a reduction in the risk of
      urinary tract infection in infants. Other benefits claimed
      include greater hygiene, a decreased risk of penile cancer,
      and while the evidence is inconclusive, some studies show a
      decrease in the likelihood of sexually transmitted diseases
      in the circumcised male.[<a href="#n33">33</a>]</p>

      <p>Accordingly, the <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian College of
      Paediatrics</a> has again altered its stance to a more
      neutral position and stated that "it is not possible to be
      dogmatic on the exact risk/benefit ratio."[<a
      href="#n34">34</a>] It neither recommends nor discourages the
      practice.</p>

      <p>While this is the case, there are clearly a number of
      health risks and disadvantages associated with the practice.
      These are comprehensively listed in the <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">Queensland Law Reform Commission
      Research Paper</a> on male circumcision.[<a
      href="#n35">35</a>] They include pain, unsightly appearance,
      damage to the shaft, damage to the urethra, urethral
      fistulas, haemorrhage, infection of the incision line,
      phimosis as a result of inadequate circumcision, infection of
      meatus, and even amputation or death.</p>

      <p>It is clear since <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>[<a
      href="#n36">36</a>] that a doctor must disclose material
      risks inherent in a medical procedure, and the failure to do
      so might leave a doctor liable in negligence should something
      go wrong. The particular risks that should be disclosed in a
      circumcision procedure are somewhat problematic given the
      large number of them.</p>

      <p>The Australian College of Paediatrics now encourages
      informed "consent" by parents. Its <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Position Statement</a>
      says that "[t]he College believes informed discussion with
      parents regarding the possible health benefits of routine
      male circumcision and the risks associated with the operation
      is essential."[<a href="#n37">37</a>] The only risks
      mentioned in the Position Statement, however, are infection,
      bleeding and damage to the glans penis. To limit the
      statement on risks is understandable given that death[<a
      href="#n38">38</a>] or amputation,[<a href="#n39">39</a>] for
      example, is most unlikely.</p>

      <p>It should be remembered in <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/do/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr479.html?query=%20Rogers%20v%20Whitaker">
      <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i></a> itself, the chance of
      sympathetic ophthalmia was accepted as being only one chance
      in fourteen thousand.[<a href="#n40">40</a>] Of significance
      in that case, however, was the persistent questioning by the
      patient. The High Court majority included in material risk
      which ought to be disclosed, that which a doctor was, or
      should have been from the circumstances, aware was of
      significance to the particular patient.[<a
      href="#n41">41</a>] Accordingly, where parents are anxious
      about the circumcision procedure, and make it clear that they
      are concerned to a doctor about the possibility of serious
      consequences, doctors may be well advised to mention matters
      such as the risk of amputation and death, however small.</p>

      <p>In this context, it is problematic that the exact benefits
      or risks of complications are not always known exactly and
      studies may vary in results. For example, while a number of
      studies indicate that lack of circumcision is a risk factor
      for HIV infection, a number of other studies indicate little
      or inconclusive relationship between circumcision status and
      risk of HIV infection.[<a href="#n42">42</a>] While one
      recent United States study showed no deaths from 500,000
      circumcisions, a 1949 reported British study referred to a
      United Kingdom mortality rate of 1.8 per 1000
      circumcisions.[<a href="#n43">43</a>] This reported rate is
      nearly three times the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia
      reported in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>.[<a
      href="#n44">44</a>]</p>

      <p>While doctors are often "pressed" for time in their
      consultations, where a patient is specifically concerned
      about serious harms (and perhaps even if they don't directly
      ask about the possibility of death), doctors may be
      well-served to mention the range of statistics in relation to
      death. Really defensive practice might suggest that a doctor
      routinely mention the low incidence of death to all parents
      before circumcising their child.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that except where circumcision is
      medically indicated for phimosis, paraphimosis, a
      non-retractable prepuce, recurrent balanitis, or
      complications from a previous inadequate circumcision,[<a
      href="#n45">45</a>] in is generally regarded as elective
      surgery and sometimes even cosmetic surgery, for aesthetic
      reasons. Some boys are simply circumcised to avoid the
      discomfort or embarassment of looking different from other
      males in their family.[<a href="#n46">46</a>]</p>

      <p>In these circumstances, the cases discussed above have
      shown greater willingness by courts to hold a doctor liable
      for failure to disclose sufficient information. In
      <i>Tekanawa v. Millican</i>,[<a href="#n47">47</a>] discussed
      above, the Court suggested that an even higher duty of care
      might be owed in truly elective surgery.[<a
      href="#n48">48</a>] The National Health and Medical Research
      Council guidelines, alluded to above also suggest this. The
      guidelines state that "[c]omplex interventions require more
      information, as do interventions where the patient has not
      illness."[<a href="#n49">49</a>] Accordingly, doctors
      probably need to consider mentioning the most serious
      consequences of circumcision to all parents considering this
      surgery.</p>

      <p>A number of infant boys in Australia are circumcised for
      religious reasons. Circumcision of males is mandatory in both
      Judaism and Islam in accordance with Abraham's covenant with
      God found in Genesis 17 in the Old Testament. Jewish boys are
      required to be circumcised at eight days of age. So integral
      to circumcision to Jewish life, the procedure is even
      performed on the Sabbath if this should be the eight day of
      life. Jewish law even requires an infant who dies before the
      eight day of life to be circumcised at the grave.[<a
      href="#n50">50</a>] In Islam, on the other hand, circumcision
      is regarded as a tradition of the prophet, Mohammed, and is
      generally performed on the newborn. In some communities, it
      may be performed just prior to puberty.[<a
      href="#n51">51</a>]</p>

      <p>Of relevance to Jewish ritual circumcision, in particular,
      it should be noted that the <a
      href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons</a> takes the view that routine
      circumcision should not be performed on a child prior to the
      age of six months.[<a href="#n52">52</a>] For Jewish parents
      using a medical practitioner to perform routine circumcision
      on a baby eight days old, it may be appropriate for the
      Association's view to at least be communicated.</p>

      <p>Very orthodox and religious Jews or Muslims may find it
      more difficult than other parents to succeed at a negligence
      action where they are not advised of all the material risks
      in a circumcision procedure. This is not to suggest that they
      are not owed the same duty of care; the problem here is one
      of causation. The more compliant a parent is to religious
      doctrine, the more likely a parent is likely to consent to
      the circumcision regardless of risk. In that scenario, the
      failure to provide appropriate information cannot be said to
      be the cause of a child's injury should something go
      wrong.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian
      College of Pediatrics</a> has made the useful recommendation
      in relation to informed consent and circumcision, that
      up-to-date, unbiased material summarizing the evidence in
      plain English should be widely available to parents.[<a
      href="#n53">53</a>] While this is a positive step, there is
      no guarantee that published educational material and
      subsequent discussion will exempt a doctor from liability. It
      is a question of the material's contents and level of
      communication between doctor and patient that the courts will
      ultimately be concerned with. This accords with the decision
      of <i>Tekanawa v. Millican</i>[<a href="#n54">54</a>]
      discussed above. In that case, the inadequacy of the
      information circular received by the patient meant that the
      doctor concerned could not escape liability for
      negligence.</p>

      <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion</p>

      <p>The decision of <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>[<a
      href="#n55">55</a>] and subseqent cases has brought the clear
      message to doctors that they must disclose material
      information about the risks of any proposed treatment or face
      the possibility of liability in negligence should something
      go wrong.</p>

      <p>While the benefits of infant male circumcision are
      somewhat uncertain, there clearly are risks to the procedure.
      The recent <a href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Position
      Statement</a> of the Australian College of Paediatrics[<a
      href="#n56">56</a>] goes someway towards encouraging an
      informed discussion with parents about these risks. The
      comments made by the College, however are brief and
      general.</p>

      <p>Doctors who perform circumcision procedures need to give
      some thought as to the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/form.html">detailed
      information</a> that parents should receive, including the
      risk and consequences of serious harms. Practitioners need to
      be flexible enough to tailor their discussions to the more
      anxious parents and to parents who circumcise their children
      for religious reasons. In the end, a routine circumcision may
      not be so "routine."</p>
