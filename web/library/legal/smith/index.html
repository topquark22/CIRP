      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="justify">In this article, I will address the issue
      of male circumcision relating to the rights of the child. In
      most countries the issue is hardly discussed or even ignored.
      In the Netherlands, only rarely male circumcision is the
      subject of debate. The Netherlands Government worries more
      about the safety and hygiene of the circumcisions taking
      place, resulting, inter alia, in subsidising education for
      circumcisers.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> This is in sharp contrast to
      the intensive debate on genital mutilation of girls, which
      took place in 1992 and 1993.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> This discussion formed the
      direct reason for a study carried out by the <a
      href="http://www.uu.nl/faculty/leg/EN/organisation/schools/schooloflaw/organisation/departments/studieeninformatiecentrummensenrechten/Pages/default.aspx"
       target="_blank">Netherlands Institute of Human Rights</a>
      (SIM).<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> In
      the latter study, the only explicit mentioning of male
      circumcision concerned the fact that genital mutilation of
      girls frequently goes further than mere circumcision, a small
      incision or the removal of the prepuce of the clitoris. The
      only form of female genital mutilation which is anatomically
      comparable with the circumcision of boys is that form of
      circumcision in which the clitoral prepuce is cut away. This
      form, however, occurs very rarely.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice to
      make a dissociation between the two practices was at that
      time a pragmatic, political decision, related to the
      vehemently discussion in the Netherlands,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> and because
      the fight against female genital mutilation would be more
      difficult if male circumcision were also to be
      challenged.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> The main conclusion of the
      study was that female genital mutilation is a harmful
      traditional practice in the sense of Article 24(3) of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> and that the States Parties
      accordingly should take all effective and appropriate
      measures to abolish this practice.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In discussing the
      results of the research with Peter Baehr, he asked me whether
      the conclusions drawn in the report would also apply to male
      circumcision. Although the issue of male circumcision was not
      dealt with in the research on female genital mutilation, it
      was frequently mentioned in the literature and other material
      studied at that time.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></font> I take this opportunity to
      address the issue of male circumcision, using mainly the
      material collected for the study on female genital
      mutilation. Studying additional literature on male
      circumcision, I learned that this custom has been as much the
      subject of extreme controversy as is the case with female
      genital mutilation and that the debate on routine neonatal
      male circumcision is intensifying, particularly, but not only
      in the USA.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a
      description of male circumcision in section 1, section 2 will
      give some examples of what authors on female genital
      mutilation have said about male circumcision. Sections 3 and
      4 will deal with the human rights and legal aspects of male
      circumcision. Finally, some concluding observations will be
      made.</p>

      <h3>1. A Description of Male Circumcision</h3>

      <p class="justify"><i>History and Prevalence</i><br />
       Male circumcision is probably one of the oldest of all
      surgical procedures.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></font> Male circumcision preceded
      female genital mutilation, both operations existed long
      before Judaism and Islam were introduced.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> In the
      absence of any historic, medically confirmed documentation,
      the origins of the practices have provided much room for
      speculation but have revealed very few facts. Although the
      origin of the practice is not entirely clear, it almost
      certainly began as a religious rite.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></font> In all societies where female
      genital mutilation is practised, male circumcision is also
      performed.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> But throughout history the
      male operation has existed in many more societies than
      operations on females.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> Currently, approximately
      one-fifth of the world's male population is circumcised,
      particularly on religious grounds. In Western society, mostly
      in the Anglo-Saxon countries like Australia, Canada, the
      United Kingdom and especially the USA, circumcision is
      usually performed for non-religious, "medical" reasons. There
      is, however, enormous variation between the circumcision rate
      in the UK (5-6 percent) and that in the USA (60 percent). In
      Britain neonatal circumcision declined from an incidence of
      around 30 percent in the 1940's to a very low level at
      present. Still, it remains a common operation, with over
      30.000 procedures annually.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> To compare, it is estimated
      that there are between 85 and 115 million girls and women
      throughout the world whose genitals have been mutilated.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can
      distinguish several types of male circumcision of which the
      simple or routine infant circumcision, which is the removal
      of the foreskin or prepuce, is most commonly practised.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></font> In most
      cases, no anaesthesia is used. In general, the operation is
      perceived by the medical staff as a relatively minor
      procedure, with no or hardly any risks for the child.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> Regarding
      the risks of male circumcision, some authors have reported a
      complication rate as low as 0.06 percent, while at the other
      extreme rates of up to 55 percent have been quoted. This
      reflects the differing and varying diagnostic criteria
      employed. A realistic figure seems to be 2-10 percent.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> Although
      haemorrhage (bleeding) and sepsis (infection) are the main
      causes of morbidity, the variety of complications is
      enormous. The literature abounds with reports of morbidity
      and even mortality as a result of circumcision. Other
      complications mentioned in the literature are, <i>inter
      alia</i>, psychological and possible sexual
      complications.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify"><i>Religious Reasons for Male
      Circumcision</i><br />
       In the Jewish community circumcision (<i>brit milah</i>) is
      a religious ritual and is usually performed on the child's
      eight day<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></font> of life by a <i>Mohel</i>.
      The rite of circumcision is one of the most ancient practices
      of Judaism. The commandment to circumcise male children was
      given to Abraham in the Torah (Genesis 17:7-14).<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> Circumcision
      is (in general) a common denominator among movements: Reform,
      Conservative, Re-constructio-nist, Orthodox, all circumcise
      their male children and require male converts to undergo some
      form of circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></font> Anaesthetic is not used.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United
      States, the Jewish community has begun to question the
      practice, using arguments based on the religion. For
      instance, according to Jewish law, it is forbidden to hurt
      living things. Even the necessary causing of pain is
      considered cruel in Judaism. Also the fact that circumcision
      involves the surgical alteration of a perfectly natural God's
      given part of the body, which stems from Jewish thought plays
      a role. The opinions range from supporting the view that a
      carefully considered decision against circumcision can be
      reconciled within Jewish tradition to the statement that "the
      ritual of circumcision is one of the mistakes Judaism carries
      within it and should be considered not differently from the
      way they are considered by society in general, no matter how
      centrally important they seem to Jewish culture".<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> Bringing a
      Jewish boy into the covenant symbolically in a ceremony
      officiated by a rabbi is an alternative proposed by some
      authors.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Religious
      circumcision is also practised by Muslims: the procedure is
      performed between the ages of four and 13 years. Curiously,
      however, the Koran contains no specific ordinance on this
      subject.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></font> However, according to the
      Sunnah (sayings and practices of the Prophet) "circumcision
      is a sunnah for men and excision an honour for women".<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> In the
      literature, also medical reasons are mentioned (removal of
      the prepuce under which impurities may gather and allow germs
      to spread and cause infection),<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup></font> and historic, pragmatic
      reasons.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup></font> Also within the Islamic
      doctrine, arguments against circumcision can be found, either
      based on the Koran itself,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> or on the Sunnah. However,
      these arguments are, to my knowledge, only used against
      female genital mutilation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within Christianity, male
      circumcision has no religious significance.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></font> Other
      religions and cultures practice male circumcision especially
      as a requirement for "manhood" within certain puberty
      rites.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify"><i>Non-Religious Reasons for
      Circumcision</i><br />
       Male circumcision evolved from a religious ritual or puberty
      rite into routine surgery for health reasons in the
      Anglo-Saxon countries. During the existence of the
      non-religious circumcision different reasons have been
      adopted ranging from prevention from masturbation, which, it
      was believed, caused blindness and/or insanity (mid 19th
      Century), to most recently HIV prevention. Initially, it was
      also advocated as a cure to prevent alcoholism, asthma,
      hernia and, for instance, headaches. Since the turn of the
      century, other reasons have been given to perpetuate the
      practice: hygiene,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></font> avoidance of sexually
      transmitted diseases, prevention of penile cancer and of
      cervical cancer, protection against urinary tract infections
      in infancy, and decreasing the risk of AIDS. Until today,
      male circumcision remains in the medical literature a very
      controversial issue. Many advantages for circumcision have
      been claimed, but as one is disproved and discarded, others
      are found.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The medical
      debate centres around the controversy whether male
      circumcision can be regarded as harmless. With regard to
      whether or not routine neonatal circumcision has health
      benefits, the medical literature contains contradictions<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></font> and also the
      professional groups find it difficult to reach a
      conclusion.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup></font> A good example is the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> (AAP) which issued several statements on
      routine neonatal circumcision, contradicting one
      another.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> Also, mainly in the United
      Kingdom, controversy exists on whether too many circumcisions
      are being performed to manage minor foreskin (phimosis)
      problems in childhood, which could be managed
      conservatively.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the
      United States, where neonatal circumcision in 90 percent of
      the cases is performed as a routine medical procedure,
      numerous activist groups have emerged in the past decade, in
      response to the demand by parents for more accurate
      information in order to have the possibility of an informed
      choice on circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup></font> The similarity with the
      grassroots level organisations in Africa, which are in the
      forefront in the fight against female genital mutilation, is
      striking.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup></font> Most of the organisations are
      of the opinion that, whilst the consequences of the
      circumcision of boys and the circumcision of girls differ,
      the violence involved is the same.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup></font></p>

      <h3>2. Authors on Female Genital Mutilation about Male
      Circumcision</h3>

      <p>"As the clitoris is regarded as the masculine element in
      the [girl] child, it is believed that the foreskin on the
      penis which is regarded as the female element in a male
      should be removed."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup></font> From a biological and health
      view the operations on girls are not the counterpart of male
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup></font> However, although perhaps the
      extent and also the complications of the operation are
      different, the fact remains that healthy tissue is removed
      from a healthy person without his or her consent.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,
      there are many parallels between female genital mutilation
      and male circumcision, especially with regard to the
      background (religious requirement or tribal tradition) and
      the reasons and justifications given to perform the
      operation. According to Lightfoot-Klein:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify"><font size="-1">"[c]hildhood genital
          mutilations are anachronistic blood rituals inflicted on
          the helpless bodies of non-consenting children of both
          sexes. The reasons given for female circumcision in
          Africa and for routine male circumcision in the U.S. are
          essentially the same. Both falsely touch the positive
          health benefits of the procedures. Both promise
          cleanliness and the absence of "bad" genital odours, as
          well as greater attractiveness and acceptability of the
          sex organs. The affected individuals in both cultures
          have come to view these procedures as something that was
          done for them and not to them."<sup><a href="#n45"><font
          size="2">45</font></a></sup></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="justify">Toubia wrote: "The unnecessary removal of
      a functioning body organ in the name of tradition, custom, or
      any other non-disease related cause should never be
      acceptable to the health profession. All childhood
      circumcisions are violations of human rights, and a breach of
      the fundamental code of medical ethics."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup></font> Also Hosken
      states that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify"><font size="-1">"It is self-evident
          that any deliberate physical mutilation especially of the
          female genital organs is a violation of this person's
          integrity and her human right to health as much as the
          mutilation of male genital organs is. The excision of the
          penis which is equivalent of excision of the clitoris is
          instantly recognized as a severe physical genital
          mutilation with permanent consequences and is a criminal
          offense. The same is true of what is done to female
          children resulting in permanent health and psychological
          trauma. Both are human rights violations."</font><font
          size="2"><sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>3. Human Rights and Legal Aspects of Male
      Circumcision</h3>

      <p class="justify">From the literature, it becomes apparent
      that there are two opposite sides in the debate on routine
      male circumcision. One side advocates the practice, primarily
      on a preventative health basis or on religious grounds (see
      supra). The other side opposes the practice, primarily on
      human rights and preservation of bodily integrity grounds. In
      the remaining of this article, I will elaborate on the
      arguments presented by the latter group.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify"><i>Human Rights</i><br />
       A number of rights are raised in the legal discussion
      concerning the phenomenon male circumcision: the rights of
      the child in general, the right to health, wherein
      legal-ethical arguments with regard to the actions of the
      medical profession play a role, the right to physical
      integrity, the right of parents to bring up their children
      according to their own traditions and culture and, as the
      continuation of that, the right to cultural
      self-determination.</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Rights of the Child in
      General</i><br />
       Taking as a basis the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a> and the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration on the
      Rights of the Child</a>, male circumcision can be conceived
      as being a breach of the universally accepted human rights
      and rights of the child.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></font> The Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></font> which is nowadays generally
      accepted as customary international law, prohibits in Article
      5 acts of torture and inhuman treatment. Article 12 provides
      for a right to privacy and Article 3 reads: "Everyone has the
      right to life, liberty and security of person."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a>, in Article 19(1) provides that the
      States party to the Convention</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify"><font size="-1">"shall take all
          appropriate legislative, administrative, social and
          educational measures to protect the child against every
          form of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse,
          neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or
          exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care
          of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who
          has the care of the child."</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Article 37 provides that the States shall ensure that a
      child is not subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment. For present purposes,
      Article 24(3) of the Convention is the most important. This
      paragraph reads:</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Prohibition of Torture</i><br />
       Male circumcision can be conceived as a form of cruel,
      inhuman or degrading treatment, in view of the way in which
      it often takes place and in view of the pain which
      accompanies it. In the <a
      href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/h2catoc.htm">Convention
      against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
      Treatment or Punishment</a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup></font> it is stated that: "The
      States party to this Convention undertake to take all
      effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other
      measures for the prevention of and eventual punishment for
      torture." The States also may not deport or return a person
      to his native country if there are grounds to believe that
      that person shall run the risk of torture. In addition,
      Article 16(1) expressly provides that each State party
      undertakes: "to prevent in any territory under its
      jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as
      defined in Article 1, when such acts are committed by or at
      the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a
      public official or other person acting in official capacity
      (...)"</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Right to Health</i><br />
       A number of the documents on international human rights,
      including the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the <a
      href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm">International
      Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> and the
      <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a>, contain provisions which lay down
      the right to health. If one adheres to the opinion that male
      circumcision is medically unnecessary, and that consequently
      the procedure carries an unnecessary danger of complications,
      certainly where this takes place under unhygienic conditions,
      it can be argued that the procedure forms a threat to the
      health of the child. Because of the procedure, without any
      necessity the natural anatomy and physiology of the child is
      changed, and this can lead to life-threatening health
      problems.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="justify">From a legal perspective, parents carry
      the primary responsibility for the health of their child, and
      must take decisions in these matters on the basis of the fact
      that the child is not yet capable of doing so because of his
      "diminished capacity."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup></font> Parental consent is required
      for all forms of medical treatment. However, there is also
      the parental right to refuse medical treatment, on religious
      grounds, for example. Just as in the case of male
      circumcision, the parents are, in refusing medical treatment
      of the child on religious grounds, convinced that their
      decision is in the interest of the child. In this latter
      case, it is argued that the decision to adhere to a religion
      and to accept the consequences thereof suggests a degree of
      intellectual adulthood. Children are not in a position to
      take this decision, so parents take this decision for them.
      When the health consequences of refusing medical treatment
      are, for instance, threatening the life of a child, in
      practice it can happen that parents are divested of their
      parental authority during the period of the medical
      procedure.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup></font> One of the arguments for this
      action is that the child has no choice in a matter which
      concerns his health, welfare and physical existence. The
      child has no say in the matter. This argumentation is also
      employed by various authors in respect of male circumcision
      and female genital mutilation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup></font> According to them, the
      decision to undergo the operation can better be postponed
      until the individual is able to make its own choice, that is,
      when it has reached adulthood. The situation changes when an
      adult, after having been informed of the consequences,
      decides to follow tradition and undergo the operation.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup></font> It is also
      advocated that parents should be fully informed about the
      functions of the foreskin,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup></font> the pain, complications and
      possible disadvantages of the procedure, in order to be able
      to make a more carefully considered decision on whether or
      not to circumcise their child.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup></font> When the necessary
      information is given, it is ultimately the responsibility of
      parents to knowingly put their children at risk.</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Right to Physical
      Integrity</i><br />
       The right to physical integrity has two components:
      protection against violation of and offenses against the body
      by others, thus from outside, and the right to determine over
      one's own body, the right to self-determination. The right to
      physical integrity is one of the fundamental civil rights. It
      is a right to "freedom." The government should therefore
      refrain from interference. However, the government also has a
      relevant duty of care, namely the stimulation of a climate in
      which civil rights can achieve a substantive form.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In activist
      literature in particular, male circumcision is seen as a
      violation of the right of self-determination of the child
      over its own body.</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Right of Parents to Bring Up their
      Children According to their Own Traditions and
      Culture</i><br />
       Parents have the right to bring up their children according
      to their own traditions and culture. Parents have the desire
      to give their children the best possible upbringing, an
      upbringing in "the best interests" of their child,
      independent of governmental interference. These interests can
      be in bringing the child up according to their own culture
      and traditions, or can be influenced by economic, social and
      cultural advantages, as well as by strong social and cultural
      pressures.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup></font> One problem with genital
      mutilation is that the parents do not carry out the practice
      in order to hurt or abuse their child. Consequently, the
      parents do not see it as a form of child abuse. The procedure
      is carried out because it is judged to be in the "best
      interests of the child," socially or physically. The rights
      of the child can conflict with the right of parents to bring
      up their children according to their own traditions and
      culture. Most cultures are in agreement that it is not good
      to endanger the health or welfare of people who cannot make
      their own decisions. It is generally accepted that a harmful
      and disfiguring practice may not be carried out upon someone
      who has no capacity to consent. Children do not judge
      independently or expertly, there is no question of
      "permission."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup></font> There is no question of free
      will. This last argument can be a reinforcement in respect of
      the contention that the operation can better be postponed
      until the individual is able to make his or her own choice,
      that is, when he or she has reached adulthood.</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Right to Cultural
      Self-Determination</i> Versus <i>Universally Accepted Human
      Rights</i><br />
       It would be going too far within the framework of this
      article to make an indepth examination of the possible
      controversy between the right to cultural self-determination
      and universally-accepted human rights. However, it is
      important to make a number of remarks about this subject,
      since this can clarify the dilemma facing some cultures.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice of
      male circumcision and female genital mutilation is part of an
      intricate and complex cultural system. The elimination of the
      practice could mean the disturbance of the cultural balance,
      and the attempts of outsiders to alter or eliminate the
      practice are often seen as an irresponsible interference in a
      people's culture and as moral imperialism. The question is,
      however, whether a community has the right to maintain a
      tradition, simply because it is a tradition.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is the
      "tradition" a violation of human rights which justifies the
      pressures of others to end it? When is a practice
      sufficiently harmful or dangerous to warrant being called a
      violation of human rights? Does male circumcision fall within
      this description? All these questions are concerned with the
      controversy between cultural self-determination and human
      rights. One of the most important aspects in determining
      whether a cultural practice can be deemed to be a violation
      of human rights is the extent to which innocent people are
      wounded or killed as a result of that practice.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup></font> At the same
      time, an important consideration is the extent to which the
      "victim" participates at his or her own free will.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The controversy
      can be brought back to that between tradition and children's
      rights: the right to maintain a tradition versus the right to
      physical integrity and the right of children to be protected
      from unnecessary pain, complications to their health,
      permanent disfigurement of their bodies, and even death. What
      should prevail and how would this be determined, and by
      whom?</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last
      question raises the issue as to whether the concept of human
      rights is a Western concept, and whether there are universal
      human rights, which could be applied without cultural value
      judgment? Here one can, in general terms, again distinguish
      two trends. Firstly, that of cultural relativism, in which it
      is said that there are many different cultures in the world
      and that it is impossible to apply one and the same set of
      values to them.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></font> The other conception
      demonstrates that a universal standard is not only possible,
      but indeed necessary, basing this on the idea that the
      concept of human rights is not just a western ideology, but
      that human rights are "inalienable, entitled to all human
      beings, and cannot be denied by a state or government."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup></font> Countries
      cannot withhold these rights from their subjects or deprive
      them of these rights, and it is the duty of governments to
      implement and uphold these rights.</p>

      <h3>4. Legal Measures</h3>

      <p class="justify">The demand for a legal prohibition of all
      forms of male circumcision as well as of female genital
      mutilation is a very tricky point of discussion. This is
      because a number of opponents of legal measures are of the
      opinion that such measures would only force the custom to go
      "underground," increasing the health risks. The problem with
      laws and regulations, particularly in the case of a
      deeply-rooted practice is that, without clear enforcement
      mechanisms and without the support of education, information
      and consciousness-raising, no clear effects can be expected
      from the law. Laws forbidding behaviour which is deeply
      rooted in a culture will neither receive extensive support
      nor bring about much change.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup></font> If effective legislative
      action is to be achieved, the following prerequisites must be
      fulfilled. On one side there must be active, consistent
      support for the legislation, followed by governmental
      enforcement of the laws. On the other side, the laws must be
      concurrent with other activities, such as education and
      information.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this context,
      it is interesting to note, that two countries in which
      non-religious routine neonatal male circumcision frequently
      takes place have adopted strict laws against female genital
      mutilation. Both laws explicitly, in almost the same wording,
      state that in order to determine whether an operation is
      necessary for the health of the person "no account shall be
      taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to
      be performed of any belief on the part of that or any other
      person that <i>the operation is required as a matter of
      custom or ritual</i>."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup></font></p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="justify">At what point should a practice be deemed
      dangerous enough to be a violation of human rights, in this
      case the rights of the child, worthy of freedom from external
      interference? How is this determined and by whom? Comparing
      male circumcision and female genital mutilation, in my
      opinion, the severity of the operation should not be an
      issue.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup></font>
      Fact is that in all cases healthy tissue from a person
      without the consent of that person is removed. The focus must
      be placed on the children who are forced to suffer without
      consent. Male circumcision is, like female genital
      mutilation, a "harmful traditional practice" and as such in
      violation with the rights of the child. It is necessary to
      advocate full respect for these human rights for all
      children, boys and girls alike. By condemning one practice
      and not the other, another basic human right, namely the
      right to freedom from discrimination, is at stake. Regardless
      whether a child is a boy or a girl, neither should be subject
      to a harmful traditional practice.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attitude of
      Western societies to oppose to female genital mutilation, but
      not to condemn male circumcision (perhaps because they are
      afraid that they will be considered as anti-semitic<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup></font>), suggests a
      double standard of the acceptance<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup></font> and implies (racial)
      discrimination of circumcised boys (Jewish and Moslem) by not
      trying to protect them against useless pain as is the case
      with girls and non-circumcised boys.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was stated in
      the study on female genital mutilation, moral condemnation is
      not the best solution to the problem. International and
      domestic legislation are not enough to stop all forms of
      harmful traditional practice. The problem with laws and
      regulations, particularly in the case of a deeply-rooted
      practice, is that, without clear enforcement mechanisms and
      without the support of education and information, no clear
      effects can be expected. Laws forbidding behaviour which is
      deeply rooted in a culture will neither receive extensive
      support nor bring about much change. Laws can, however, play
      a supportive role, alongside information and education. These
      measures must be combined with efforts to raise the level of
      awareness.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      questionable whether, in the majority of cases of routine
      neonatal circumcision, the parents are fully informed as to
      the function of the foreskin, and the pain, possible
      complications and risks and consequences of the operation. It
      is the responsibility of doctors and health care
      professionals involved as well as religious leaders and
      practitioners to inform the parents.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the
      best way to do justice to the rights of the child is to do no
      harm, to let it enjoy life in every aspect and to protect it
      against influences not asked for. Regardless of whether a
      child is a boy or a girl, neither should be subject to a
      tradition which is harmful. When the child is of consenting
      age, fully informed about all possibilities which lay ahead
      of him or her, it can make up his or her own mind and choose
      the way he or she thinks is best.</p>

        <!--39-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
        in Canada, the debate over routine male circumcision is
        intensifying. See, for instance, the recent statement of
        Dr. Margaret Somerville, director of the McGill Centre for
        Medicine, Ethics and Law, that non-medical infant male
        circumcision is technically criminal assault, cited in:
        Sharon Kirkey, "Circumcising baby boys 'criminal assault,'"
        <i>Ottawa Citizen Online</i>, 17 October 1997. The Canadian
        Pediatric Society issued recently a <a
        href="http://www.nocirc.org/position/cps.html">statement</a>
        saying there is no valid medical reason to justify routine
        infant male circumcision and recommending that:
        "Circumcision of newborns should not be routinely
        performed."</font></li>

        <i>Ibidem</i>, p. 32: "But what is done to girls has a
        different purpose and results: a healthy and most sensitive
        organ is removed. From a biological viewpoint the genital
        mutilations performed on females are the equivalent of the
        amputation of part or all of the penis - with very similar
        physical and sexual results and quite different from what
        is done to boys. With boys the foreskin is cut, though both
        operations may result in deadly infection." "The equivalent
        of removing the tip of the clitoris (sunna circumcision) is
        the same as the removal of the glans of the penis - both
        are most sensitive and full of nerve endings,"
        <i>ibidem</i>, p. 47. Hosken in her fight against female
        genital mutilation even goes further in proposing to have
        the excision of the penis introduced as a means to sexual
        control of males, instead of female genital mutilation
        (<i>ibidem</i>, p. 47). On the differences between male
        circumcision and female genital mutilation, see also
        Assaad, <i>op.cit</i>. (note 32), p. 14, who states that
        there is a "principle difference between male circumcision
        and female circumcision. In male circumcision no parts of
        the male sex organs are being mutilated, only the foreskin
        - the outer cover of the male sex organs - is being
        removed, without touching the male sex organ

        of the Arab Child, promulgated by the Arab League of which
        the exact date of its acceptance by the Council of
        Ministers of the Arab League is not clear. See Veerman,
        op.cit. (note 56), pp. 260-263. Text of the Charter in
        <i>idem</i>, pp. 517-526. The Charter does not contain an
        explicit reference to harmful traditional practices.
        However, it is included in the fundamental rights that the
        States "confirm and guarantee the right of the child to
        have State protection from abuse and exploitation both
        physically and psychologically even if it were from members
        of his family." In June 1992, the European Parliament
        discussed and approved the Draft European Charter on the
        Rights of the Child. See minutes of the Assembly of 8 July
        1992, European Parliament, p. 13 and pp. 29-38. Article 19
        of this Draft contains the right of every child to physical
        and moral integrity: "No child shall be subjected to
        torture, inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment by any
        public or private person." Article 25 stipulates the right
        of every child to have his own culture, to practise his own
        religion or belief and to use his own
        language."</font></li>

        to Lightfoot-Klein, op.cit. (note 9), pp. 43-45 a law can
        have some potential in the strife for change where the
        desire to abandon the practice already exists. Ogiamen
        advocates an approach which supports a gradual abolition,
        by means of a process of official recognition of the
        practice. According to him, the legal considerations should
        shift from the negative approach (prohibition) to the
        positive approach (regulation). Tony B.E. Ogiamen, "Legal

        mutilation, entitled the "Prohibition of Female

        United States, see the <a

        only in the USA, but also, for instance, in the
        Netherlands. In March 1993, the Dutch Government issued an
        official statement condemning all forms of female genital
        mutilation. At the outset, it was again stressed in this
        statement that female circumcision is a practice contrary
        to the prevailing attitudes in the Netherlands on the
        equality of women and their place in society: "It is viewed
        here as a form of repression, and as Dutch policy aims to
        combat the repression of women, it opposes all forms of
        female circumcision. (...) With regard to the
        recommendation that policy should draw a distinction
        between mutilating and non-mutilating forms of female
        circumcision, we have ascertained that this leads to
        confusion, as the concepts are vague, and that to
        distinguish between the two forms is no simple matter." See
