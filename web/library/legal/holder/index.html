    <h1 align="center">Circumcisions</h1>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="init"><font size="6">C</font>ircumcision of newborn
      boys is, of course, an extremely common procedure. It is
      undoubtly done hundreds of times a day in American hospitals.
      Considering the number of instances in which it is done, the
      number of actions alleging negligence in its performance,
      either with babies or adult men, is so small as to be
      considered almost non-existent. There are however, a few
      decisions on various aspects of the problem.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Lack of Consent</h4>

      <p class="text">Two decisions deal with decisions in which
      infant boys were circumcised without <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/"
      target="_blank">parental consent</a>.</p>

      <p class="text">In <i>Noe vs Kaiser Foundation Hospitals</i>
      (435 P 2d 306, Ore 1967), the baby was not supposed to be
      circumcised at all. When his mother was admitted to the
      hospital for delivery, she gave instructions that if the baby
      were a boy, he was not to be circumcised. This information
      was placed on her chart. A resident delivered her without
      reading the record and circumcised the baby. The resident
      later denied to the mother that she had either delivered the
      baby or circumcised him, but the facts were easy to
      establish. There was no claim by the parents that the
      circumcision was done negligently or improperly. The parents
      sued and asked for punitive damages. Punitive damages are
      those awarded over and above "actual damages," and are
      expressly designed to punish the defendant. They are
      extremely unusually in any sort of professional liability
      suits. Although the appeals court in this case agreed that
      the parents were entitled to recover nominal actual damages,
      it refused to allow recovery of punitive damages as a matter
      of law. It was held that gross negligence must be present to
      allow punitive damages in a professional liability action.
      The court said that the determinative factor is the present
      or lack of an aggravated disregard of the professional duties
      and standards for the medical treatment of patients. It was
      found that such a flagrant disregard, as opposed to an honest
      mistake had not occurred in this case.</p>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">In <i>Kalina vs General Hospital of
      Syracuse</i> (220 NYS 2d 733, NY 1961, aff'd, 233 NYS 2d 808,
      1962), the baby was supposed to be circumcised by a mohel in
      accordance with Jewish ritual at the age of eight days. By
      mistake he was circumcised by a physician when he was four
      days old. Again, there was no allegation that the circumision
      was performed in a negligent manner. The parents, however
      sought damages for their mental anguish. The baby was not a
      party plaintiff, through a guardian or otherwise. The court
      denied recovery. It was held that the parents did not have a
      legally protected right. It pointed out that damages for
      mental anguish are recoverable only by the party who has been
      assaulted--in this case the infant. It should be noted that
      in some few jurisdictions in this counry, mental anguish
      damages have been recovered by parents for damage done to
      minor children, and it is at least arguable that a different
      conclusion could have been reached in this situation had it
      occurred in a state other than New York.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Negligence</h4>

      <p class="text">All the other decisions involving negligence
      dealt with situations in which negligence in the manner in
      which the operation was performed was alleged.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Lippard vs Johnson</i> (1 SE 2d 889, NC
      1939), for example, involved circumcision of an adult
      patient. A local anesthetic was used, which the physician
      told the patient was procaine hydrochloride (Novacain). A
      blister appeared at the site of the injection and an
      infection resulted. The patient's condition was finally cured
      when he consulted a specialist. The patient sued and alleged
      that the procaine must have been contaminated. The court
      found that he had not presented any evidence of negligence on
      the part of the physician and did not allege any way in which
      the physician had failed to use his best judgment. The court
      further found that it was just as likely that the patient had
      an allergy to procaine as it was that the substance used was
      contaminated. A nonsuit in favor of the physician
      resulted.</p>

      <p class="text">In <i>Johnson vs Colp</i> (300 NW 791, Minn
      1941), an infant boy developed a large scar at the site of
      the circumcision. It required surgical removal. In holding
      that the plaintiff had no cause of action, the court noted
      that the physician is not required to insure a good result
      when he treats a patient. He must merely conform to the
      standards of due care expected of him. The court held that
      the child's mother had produced on evidence of the standard
      of care for the procedure in the geographical area in which
      she lived. She also did not produce any evidence to show that
      the defendant had ben unskillful when he treated her son. It
      was also noted that the physician had told her to bring the
      baby back for a checkup and that she admittedly failed to do
      so.</p>

      <p class="text">On the other hand, in <i>McNabb vs Mason</i>
      (264 NE 2d 623, Ind 1970) the court held that the patient did
      state a cause for action which would allow him to take the
      matter to the jury for its determination of the facts. The
      case had been filed more than five years before the decision,
      during which time the patient changed attorneys several
      times, obtained continuances, and asked for two changes of
      venue. During this period, the patient himself died of cancer
      and his widow became the plaintiff. The complaint stated that
      the patient had consulted the physician about a circumcision.
      At the time it was supposed to be performed, the physician
      cut his urethra and excised two large sections of his penis.
      In a second operation the patient alleged that further
      excisions were performed, again instead of a circumcision.
      The physician maintained that the patient had consulted him
      about an inflammation and that surgery was performed to
      determine its cause. At that time he found a condition which
      appeared to him to be precancerous and he excised two small
      segments for biopsy. The second procedure, electrocautery,
      was designed to remove warts. The urologist who had been
      consulted about the case by the physician admitted that the
      specimens showed no malignancy (although the patient had died
      of cancer by the time the decision was reached) and that he
      would have preferred to remove the warts surgically, not be
      electrocautery. The trial court granted the physician's
      motion for summary judgment. The appeals court reversed. It
      held that the matter should be brought to trial because a
      genuine issue of fact existed as to the purpose of the first
      surgery and the skill which had been exercised during it
      regardless of the delays and difficulties caused by the
      patient in bringing this matter to court.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Proof</h4>

      <p class="text">The general rule appears that expert
      testimony must be presented on behalf of the patient in these
      cases. (<i>Johnson vs Colp; Lippard vs Johnson; Bates vs
      Newman</i>, 264 P 2d 197, Cal 1953). However in one decision,
      the court held that the doctrine of res ipsa locquitur could
      be applied. In <i>Valentine vs Kaiser Foundation
      Hospitals</i> (15 Cal Rptr 26, Cal 1961), an infant boy was
      the patient. He was circumcised a few days after birth. A
      black spot appeared on his penis and his parents alleged that
      it was there before he was dismissed from the hospital and
      should have been noticed by hospital personnel. A severe
      infection occurred and the child was brought back to the
      hospital, where consultations were finally held with
      specialists. Eventually he lost his glans penis. The trial
      court held that there was ample evidence to allow the jury to
      assume that the child was infected before he was released
      from the hospital. Since this type of accident does not,
      according to the appeals court decision, occur without
      negligence, it approved of allowing the lower court to apply
      the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. It should be noted,
      however, that decision does not appear to have been followed
      in any other cases involving circumcision since it was
      decided ten years ago. Furthermore, the basic concept of res
      ipsa loquitur applied in the decision, that the rarity of the
      occurrence is an indication that negligence existed
      somewhere, was specifically disapproved in the decision of
      <i>Silverson vs Weber</i> (372 P 2d 97, Cal 1962), although
      that casse did not deal with the same subject matter.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Conclusion</h4>

      <p class="text">As can be seen, a lawsuit arising from a
      circumcision is extremely unlikely, statistically. Such a
      simple procedure is, of course, not likely to produce great
      <a href="/library/complications/">complications</a>. The
      usual requirements of standards of skill and care and
      knowledge, however, do apply to this, as to any other
      surgery. It should be noted, however, that if parents of a
      newborn boy do not want him circumcised, make this fact known
      to the obstetrician or the hospital, and the procedure is
      carried out by mistake or failure to read the patient's
      records, a suit for assault on behalf of the baby may well
      succeed. Damages, however, would be comparitively minimal
      unless the parents could prove negligence in the manner in
      which the procedure was carried out. In a few states which
      have very liberal decisions on allowing damages for mental
      anguish, it is at least possible that the parents would also
      have a cause for action for mental anguish, although no
      decisions on the subject can be found in those states. Care,
      therefore, should be taken to note in the mother's hospital
      records that she has not, in fact, consented to the
      procedure. --A<small>NGELA</small> R<small>ODDEY</small>
