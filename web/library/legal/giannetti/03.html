In the wake of the 1989 task force report and a decade of increasing controversy surrounding the medical practice of circumcision, the AAP issued the findings of a third Task Force on Circumcision on March 1, 1999.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n138">138</A></SUP></font> On the surface, the 1999 task force appeared to take a step toward opposing circumcision. It reported that the data was insufficient to endorse circumcision, and that "the procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n139">139</A></SUP></font> The 1999 AAP report made no mention of cervical cancer. Thus, the AAP appears to have fully exonerated the foreskin for cervical cancer. Notwithstanding these improvements, the AAP devoted the overwhelming majority of the report, once again, to asserting that "[e]xisting scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n140">140</A></SUP></font><P><a name="p"></a><a name="p1534"></a><center>

Unlike the silence concerning cervical cancer, the <A HREF="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999 AAP report</A>, like its predecessor, links the risk of penile cancer to an intact foreskin. While evidence had accumulated since 1989 that clearly demonstrated that neonatally circumcised men were not immune to penile cancer, the 1999 report presented the "strong association" and "threefold risk" for developing penile cancer from foregoing neonatal circumcision as authoritative.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n141">141</A></SUP></font> The task force reported this elevated risk, notwithstanding its own admission that "there have been few rigorous hypothesis testing investigations," and "it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n142">142</A></SUP></font><P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The 1989 presumption that neonatal circumcision provided virtual immunity from penile cancer was thoroughly refuted when a single 1993 <A HREF="/library/disease/cancer/maden/">study</A> on subjects from the state of Washington and British Columbia found twenty-two cases of penile cancer among men circumcised at birth.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n143">143</A></SUP></font> This study, while surmising that circumcision status may play some role in the etiology of penile cancer concluded, "at least some cases of cancer occur in circumcised men as well."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n144">144</A></SUP></font> Some of these "other conditions," which all produced a higher risk for penile cancer than did lack of circumcision, included a history of genital warts, penile tear, penile rash, smoking and more than thirty sexual partners.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n145">145</A></SUP></font> Interestingly, in reporting the statistical effect of circumcision status, the authors only adjusted the results for the variables of age and penile tear, but not with the other concurrent variables.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n146">146</A></SUP></font> A statistical adjustment of the variable of circumcision status with the variables of the number of lifetime partners and a history of viral STDs was a necessity in order to assess fully the role of circumcision status, because the other variables were more strongly correlated with penile cancer. Still, due largely to these findings, the 1999 task force had to acknowledge that circumcised men get penile cancer, the the overall incidence of penile cancer is extremely low, and that other factors such as cigarette smoking, viral STDs, and sexual promiscuity are risk factors.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n147">147</A></SUP></font> 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although the AAP report contained a sentence addressing the wide differences in penile cancer among countries where circumcision is not performed,<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n148">148</A></SUP></font> the 1999 task force, like its counterpart in 1989, did not cite statistics gathered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer for the World Health Organization's publication, Cancer Incidence in Five Countries, vol. IV, from 1982, listed the non-circumcising Scandinavian countries reporting incidences of penile cancer equal to or less than the incidence in the United States.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n149">149</A></SUP></font> In volume VI, from 1992, this same publication listed the incidence of penile cancer in Israel and Japan--where Israel circumcises at birth while Japan does not--both with lower cancer rates than the United States.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n150">150</A></SUP></font> Because of this wide variation between nations, and the fact that the figures do not clearly group according to whether a country does or does not practice neonatal circumcision, it was untenable for the AAP to assert or imply that circumcision status was a casual variable for penile cancer. Genetic predispositions, exposure to causative agents, and cultural practices other than circumcision must account for susceptibility to penile cancer.<P><a name="p1536"></a><center>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As with the long-standing suspected link between circumcision status and penile cancer, the possibility of a link between circumcision status was once again addressed in the 1999 AAP task force's report. The 1999 AAP report's section on STDs admitted that evidence for a possible relationship between STDs and circumcision is complex and conflicting."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n151">151</A></SUP></font> This complexity has increased since the 1989 report, because the 1999 task force had to address HIV, in addition to the other STDs.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since 1989, circumcision advocates had added HIV to the list of STDs from which circumcision supposedly offered some protection. The 1999 AAP report focused on studies that asserted a prophylactic effect for circumcision against HIV, while ignoring evidence of methodological flaws in such studies.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n152">152</A></SUP></font> The report did not cite a thorough editorial <A HREF="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/">review</A> by researchers Isabelle de Vincenzi and Theiry Mertens, in the journal <I>AIDS</I>.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n153">153</A></SUP></font> This article noted that articles published on the geographical distribution of AIDS in Africa had used outdated data on circumcision from "anthropological studies of rural areas written between 1930 and 1950."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n154">154</A></SUP></font> This article detailed other methodological flaws in AIDS and circumcision studies such as a "lack of distinction between susceptibility and infectivity, inadequote control for confounding  variables, potential selection bias and misclassification of exposure, inappropriate choice of a comparison group, and publication bias."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n155">155</A></SUP></font> De Vincenzi and Mertens further noted that "the magnitude of the association, when present, varie[d] strongly between studies, and its crude measure [wa]s overestimated in some reports by the use of OR [odds ratio instead of RR [relative risk]."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n156">156</A></SUP></font> They found that this problem in the statistical measuring may have been "misleading toward causality."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n157">157</A></SUP></font> De Vincenzi and Mertens ultimately concluded that circumcision was not warranted as a measure to combat the spread of HIV.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n158">158</A></SUP></font> 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Returning to other STDs, the <A HREF="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999 AAP report</A> selectively reported only those findings suggesting circumcision's prophylactic effect. One example was the report's omission of the results reported in an <A HREF="/library/general/laumann/">article</A> by researchers Laumann et al., which found a higher rate of chlamydia among circumcised men, while no higher STD rates occurred in intact men.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n159">159</A></SUP></font> Even though the 1999 AAP task force cited this article, it was only mentioned to support the general statement that the "relationship of circumcision to STD in general is complex and conflicting."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n160">160</A></SUP></font> Thus a reader of the report would be unaware that the Laumann article found that circumcision conferred no benefit against any STD, and may, in fact, have been a risk factor for contracting chlamydia. This was STD information that the 1999 task force should have included in its report.<P><a name="p1537"></a><center>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While circumcision provides no clear benefits in protecting against the contraction of STDs, like the 1989 AAP report, the 1999 report found UTI prevention as the best reason to defend circumcision. However, by 1999, Wiswell's poorly designed studies were superceded by the less spectacular, but more reliable results of a 1998 <A HREF="/library/disease/UTI/to2/">article</A> by a Canadian research team, which used a large prospective three-year research design.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n161">161</A></SUP></font> These Canadian researchers found that foregoing a neonatal circumcision produced a 3.7 relative risk of hospital intake for UTI over the first three years of a boy's life, which was much less than the 10.1 to 19.8 risk factor Wiswell had obtained in methodologically problematic retrospective studies.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n162">162</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moreover, unlike previous studies on circumcision and UTI, which addressed inpatient care, the Canadian researchers also examined physician billing records to estimate outpatient UTI treatment rates. Here, the heightened risk from not circumcising resulted in only a 1.73 relative risk for a UTI.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n163">163</A></SUP></font> The finding was that, "for every circumcised infant admitted for UTI, there were 11 outpatient billings for UTI compared with five for the uncircumcised infants."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n164">164</A></SUP></font> The article noted the lack of any information that UTI severity differed between circumcised and intact boys.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n165">165</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The almost negligible relative risk observed in outpatient records may indicate that physicians were biased toward hospitalizing intact baby boys, instead of circumcised boys, for UTIs. Further research on physician treatment decisions for UTIs in boys might reveal that the treatment recommendations for intact boys include circumcision. This surgery would probably involve general anesthesia,<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n166">166</A></SUP></font> due to the boy's age, and possibly also due to the awakened physician sensitivity for reducing behavioral disturbance to the attachment between the now communicative child and his parents. In contrast, the option of circumcision was already performed on the neonatally circumcised boys, so physicians might have required a more serious UTI before recommending hospitalization. The possible confounding effect of physician bias was left out of the 1999 AAP report. Likewise, neither the Canadian <A HREF="/library/disease/UTI/to2/">article</A> nor the <A HREF="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999 AAP report</A> considered inappropriate physician, or parental forced retraction of the foreskin as a possible causal variable for UTIs in intact boys.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Potential confounding variables that might have intervened in measuring circumcision's effect on UTI rates, recognized in the 1999 AAP report, were prematurity, lack of breastfeeding, and method of urine collection.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n167">167</A></SUP></font> The report conceded that one Italian <A HREF="/library/disease/UTI/pisacane1992/">case-control study</A> demonstrated that breastfeeding had "a threefold protective effect on the incidence of UTI in a sample of uncircumcised infants."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n168">168</A></SUP></font> In the next sentence, the 1999 AAP report appeared to hide the significance of breastfeeding by stating that "breastfeeding has not been evaluated systematically in studies assessing UTI and circumcision status."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n169">169</A></SUP></font> Assuming the 3.7 relative risk for UTI in foregoing neonatal circumcision, as Dr. David Alwin observed, a circumcision is an unfavorable preventive strategy since the protective effect of breastfeeding is roughly equivalent to that of circumcision but poses no risk."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n170">170</A></SUP></font><P><a name="p1539"></a><center>

<I>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; C<font size="2">OMPLICATIONS</font></I></center>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Contrary to the relatively large amount of new material regarding the supposed benefits of neonatal circumcision between 1989 and 1999, there was little new material published concerning circumcisions. Unfortunately, twenty-four years after the first AAP task force report on circumcision and a decade after the 1989 report, the AAP still could not authoritatively cite a complication rate for circumcision. The task force once again provided an estimated complication rate of 0.2% to 0.6%, citing the figures obtained by Harkavy and Gee &amp; Ansell.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n171">171</A></SUP></font> First, the AAP again avoided or missed the fact that the Gee and Ansell study had already discounted the occurrence of what were considered minor (but signficant beyond the normal tissue trauma to warrant intervention and recording) complications.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n172">172</A></SUP></font> Second, following the AAP report's lead, the 1999 AAP report ignored the 4% immediate complication rate and the 13% late complication rate, published in the 1993 Metcalf <A HREF="/library/procedure/metcalf/">article</A>.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n173">173</A></SUP></font> the task force failed to take seriously the phenomena of surgical corrections of circumcision such as that which led to Dustin Evan's Jr.'s death in October of 1998, terming them "isolated case reports" and failing to list death as a possible outcome.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n174">174</A></SUP></font> Finally, the 1999 task force completely ignored a comprehensive 1993 review of estimates for circumcision's complication rates authored by British researcher's N. Williams and L. Kapila.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#175n">175</A></SUP></font> If the AAP task force had found the study's conclusion that "realistic figure [for the complication rate] is 2-10 percent"<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n176">176</A></SUP></font> was flawed, it should have at least cited the study and provided reasons for not crediting it.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interestingly, in stating that the "data are not sufficient to recommend" circumcision as routine care, the 1999 report essentially concluded that the risks of circumcision outweigh the benefits.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n177">177</A></SUP></font> The report, therefore, essentially admitted that leaving a boy intact could not be proven to be a sufficient risk factor for UTIs, STDs and penile cancer warranting the intervention of circumcision. However, the task force provided no cost-benefit studies or figures to support this ultimate conclusion. The 1999 AAP report did not cite Robert S. Thompson's 1990 UTI/circumcision risk/benefit analysis,<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n178">178</A></SUP></font> yet Thompson's <A HREF="/library/disease/UTI/thompson/">article</A> would appear to support the report's conclusion that the data on the benefits of circumcision were not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n179">179</A></SUP></font> After expounding for almost the entire length of the report on the alleged benefits of circumcision, the AAP incongruously concluded that the data was insufficient to recommend the procedure. The AAP appeared to be inviting physicians to credit a lengthy and heavily cited recitation of alleged benefits and to find the task force's brief and final recommendation insufficient. Due to the lack of cited support for the report's ultimate conclusion, it seemingly encouraged physicians to continue the amputation of normal, healthy, functional foreskins. One possible motive that could explain this approach was a disingenuous attempt to shield the AAP from liability while still listing medical sources supporting circumcision. The 1999 AAP report will likely result in the perpetuation of the "cultural" preference for circumcision among medical practitioners and parents.<P><a name="p1540"></a><center>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Unlike the paucity of new material coming from the medical profession concerning circumcision's true physical complication rates, in the decade following the 1989 AAP talk force report, psychological investigators conducted numerous studies and published a great deal on infant abilities in memory, including memory of pain. For example, in 1998, researcher Charles Nelso electronically recorded brain activity in infants during memory experiments.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n180">180</A></SUP></font> He discussed his results and reviewed various studies conducted in the 1990s, most notably that of psychologist Carolyn Rovee-Collier, which demonstrated that three-month-old infants can remember a picture for weeks after a brief exposure.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n181">181</A></SUP></font> Nelson came to the conclusion that infants have "covert" long-term memory. "even if there no <I>overt</I> evidence of such memory."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n182">182</A></SUP></font> Proposing that more work should be performed measuring brain activity in infants, he expressed the hope that "we may be able to examine how early life experiences come to shape our brain and ultimately our behavior."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n183">183</A></SUP></font> However, the 1999 AAP talk force, like its predecessors, neglected to devote any meaningful effort toward examining the research on long-term behavioral effects of painful experiences in infancy.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The 1999 task force's omission of psychological research was all the more shocking in light of the findings of a 1997 article, which it did cite.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n184">184</A></SUP></font> Researchers Anna Taddio et al., demonstrated that neonatal circumcision increased the pain exposure of infants to vaccination at four and six months.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n185">185</A></SUP></font> This result held even for those boys given Emla cream as a pain prevention measure during their neonatal circumcisions.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n186">186</A></SUP></font> This article soundly proved that neonatal circumcision does have long-term behavioral aspects. Despite the results of this study and the task force's admission that even the most effective  pain measure, the subcutaneous ring block, also failed to fully eliminate operative pain, the report concluded, "analgesia is safe and effective in reducing the procedural pain."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n187">187</A></SUP></font> Although the 1999 task force no longer claimed, like the 1989 task force, that behavioral effects are short-term and transitory, the 1999 task force's dismissive treatment of Taddio's <A HREF="/library/pain/taddio2/">findings</A> was irresponsible.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n188">188</A></SUP></font> In light of these results, the 1999 task force should have instituted a literature search into long-term psychological effects of infant pain. This should have lead them to the <A HREF="/library/psych/jacobsen1/">findings</A> of Jacobsen et al.,<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n189">189</A></SUP></font> concerning choice of suicide method and its relation to perinatal pain.<P><a name="p1542"></a><center>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Another moderation of the 1989 AAP position, but one that also failed to fully relate the evidence, was the 1999 taskforce's abandonment of circumcision as the treatment of choice for phimosis. The report stated, "[m]edical therapy has been successful [i.e. medication] has been successful in resolving both secondary phimosis and paraphimosis, but surgical intervention is sometimes indicated.'<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n190">190</A></SUP></font> An  <A HREF="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/102/4/e43">article</A> electronically published by the AAP itself, compared the phimosis treatments of topical steroids, prepucial plasty [surgery which does not amputate the foreskin], and circumcision for cost effectiveness.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n191">191</A></SUP></font> This article found topical steroid treatment to be the most cost effective and circumcision to be least cost effective.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n192">192</A></SUP></font> However, this article was not cited in the 1999 AAP report, nor did the report mention the non-circumcision surgical alternatives examined in this article.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The 1999 task force also unprofessionally dismissed the growing body of evidence that foreskin tissue has characteristics beyond that of regular skin. The report presented the <A HREF="/library/anatomy/taylor/">research</A> of J.R. Taylor as merely suggesting the presence of specialized sensory cells on the inner foreskin.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n193">193</A></SUP></font> The 1999 AAP task force report distinguished the foreskin from outer penile skin only because it did not characterize the foreskin simply as "skin".<P><a name="p1542a"></a><center>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, although the 1999 AAP task force report in <I>Pediatrics</I> did not label the foreskin simply "skin," the AAP continues to refer to it simply as "skin" in the information it provides to specifically to parents. At the AAP web-site, the online brochure <A HREF="http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZJZMEMH4C&amp;sub_cat=108"><I>Circumcision: Information for Parents</I></A> omits any mention of the specialized tissues and structures that constitute the foreskin. The online brochure simply calls the foreskin, "skin that covers the end of the penis."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n194">194</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This online brochure suffers from other mischaracterizations as well. The brochure presents a ten-fold UTI risk factor, reflecting the results of Wiswell's retrospective studies, rather than the more methodologically sound 3.7 relative risk figure.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#195n">195</A></SUP></font> The online brochure downplays complications as "rare and usually minor,"<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n196">196</A></SUP></font> with no mention of the possibility of serious complications. The brochure neither presents complication rates, nor does it provide any explanation for the profession's lack of knowledge about such rates.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additonally, in its section labeled <I>Reasons Parents May Choose Not to Circumcise</I>, the brochure overlooks the growing number of parents and professionals that consider infant male circumcision a human rights issue.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n197">197</A></SUP></font> This section also incorrectly characterizes the statement that the foreskin is necessary to protect the tip of the penis," as a belief."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n198">198</A></SUP></font> However, the AAP disseminated a similar position as fact in the 1980s<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n199">199</A></SUP></font> Likewise the word "belief" in the heading appears to be strategically placed by the AAP so as to cast doubt on and downplay statistically proven informaton which relates to the increased risk for meatitis and meatal stenosis after circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#200n">200</A></SUP></font> Additionally, the 1999 AAP online brochure erroneously claims that available pain measures are "effective," implying that they can eliminate the pain of circumcision. Additionally, the online brochure fails to advise parents that long-term behavioral effects have been demonstrated, the extent of which are unknown.<P><a name="p1543"></a><center>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The 1999 AAP online brochure ends with a section on female circumcision. The brochure lists some of the cultural reasons why some immigrant parents from Africa desire the range of female genital alterations.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n201">201</A></SUP></font> It fails to mention that many medical practitioners, as well as parents form these cultures, assert unproven rationales of health and cleanliness--similar to rationales which are presented in this country in support of male circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n202">202</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The AAP Committee on Bioethics published a 1998 position statement entitled <A HREF="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9749.html"><I>Female Genital Mutilation</I></A> (FGM) in which the AAP specifically "encourage[d] its members to . . . decline performing all medically unnecessary procedures to alter female genitalia."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n203">203</A></SUP></font> There are varying degrees of FGM. However, the AAP noted that the rough equivalent to male circumcision, removing only the clitoral hood, as well as simply a ceremonial incising of any part of the female genitalia, would likely be held as violation of United States criminal law.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n204">204</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This encouragement to practitioners was in congruence with the approach of another AAP Committee on Bioethics <A HREF="/library/ethics/AAP/">article</A> on informed consent and parental permission in pediatric care . . . ."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n205">205</A></SUP></font> Similarly, the authors of <A HREF="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/94/4/433"><I>Caring for Gravely Ill Children</I></A>, also published in  <I>Pediatrics</I>, were quite aware that "professionals must maintain an independent obligation to protect the child's interests," not those of the parents.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n206">206</A></SUP></font> Encouragement to place the best interests of the child over the cultural wishes of parents was justly present for any type of FGM, yet such encouragement to avoid surgery was utterly lacking from the now admittedly medically unnecessary alteration of male genitalia. The AAP apparently considered awareness of ethical conflicts, particularly regarding an awareness of to whom the physician owes a duty (the child, i.e., the patient, not to the parents), as pertinent in the case of an immigrant cultural practice such as female circumcision. This consideration appears to be considered by the AAP as immaterial in the case of our own culture's practice of not-medically-necessary infant male circumcision.

Ironically, what may have ultimately induced the grudging change in the AAP's policy on circumcision may not have been a sense of professional responsibility, but a growing sense of international professional isolation. The 1999 AAP task force cited position statements of Canadian and Australian medical organizations in 1996, which found no medical rationale for the support of routine infant male circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n207">207</A></SUP></font> The Fetus and Newborn Committee of the Canadian Paediatric Society examined and cited, existing cost-benefit analyses for circumcision in relation to UTI and penile cancer.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n208">208</A></SUP></font> Even with the inflated and flawed UTI risk information available in 1996, the Society recommended simply and clearly in the abstract of their <A HREF="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">report</A> that "[c]ircumcision of newborns should not be routinely be performed."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n209">209</A></SUP></font><P>

	     Additionally, the 1999 task force received a <A HREF="http://www.fathermag.com/health/circ/acs/">letter</A> from two Vice Presidents of the American Cancer Society. See Fathermag.com, <I>Letter from the American Cancer Society</I>  (visited Mar. 9, 2000) &lt;http://www.fathermag.com/health/circ/acs/&gt; (relating a public letter from Hugh Shingleton, M.D. National Vice President Detection &amp; Treatment American Cancer Society, and Clark W. Heath, Jr. M.D., Vice President Epidemiology and Surveillance Research American Cancer Society, to Dr. Peter Rappo, Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics (February 16, 1996)). The letter stated:
Portraying routine circumcision as an effective means of prevention distracts the public from the task of avoiding behaviors proven to contribute to penile and cervical cancer; especially cigarette smoking, and unprotected sexual relations with multiple partners. Perpetuating the mistaken belief that circumcision prevents cancer is inappropriate.
