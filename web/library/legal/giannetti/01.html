	On October 16, 1998, three-week-old <A HREF="http://www.noharmm.org/evansdeath.htm">Dustin Evans, Jr.</A> died in Cleveland, Ohio during anesthetized surgery necessary to repair his urethra, which had become blocked when his circumcision failed to heal.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n1">1</A></SUP></font> The boy's father is quoted as having said, "you think, 'what could go wrong with a circumcision?'"<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n2">2</A></SUP></font> It appears that no physician fully informed Dustin's parents that serious complications can occur with circumcision, and that such complications can lead to further surgical procedures. However, the entire medical establishment, as well as individual physicians and hospitals must share part of the blame for needless tragedies that occur, such as that which befell Dustin Evans. Circumcision, while being a widespread and long-standing surgery in American medical practice, has never been the subject of a comprehensive, prospective investigation into its complication rates.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n3">3</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">
	Modern American medicine's reputation and esteem depend upon its adherence to scientific methodology and reasoning in making causal inferences. However, the initial practice of American medicine predated the ascendancy of microbial theories of certain diseases. Consequently, a procedure that may have come into use prior to a thorough examination of its scientific validity and may remain an inadequately proven procedure today. Routine infant male circumcision is one example.
<P align="justify">
	Nineteenth century physicians used circumcision as a "medical" cure for masturbation, which was thought to cause disease.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n4">4</A></SUP></font> Amazingly, as medicine became more scientific, circumcision was never thoroughly reevaluated. Instead, the medical community developed alternate causal hypotheses of disease related to the presence of the foreskin of the penis to clinically justify its removal by circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n5">5</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">
	The medical necessity of circumcision was successfully questioned in 1949. That year, an influential <A HREF="/library/general/gairdner/">article</A> published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I> reviewed the rationales regarding the benefits of circumcision and failed to attribute medical utility to any of them.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n6">6</A></SUP></font> The article examined the development of the foreskin and its physiological importance and also exposed the varieties and types of complications attendant to circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n7">7</A></SUP></font> When the British National Health Service discontinued coverage for circumcision in response to these findings, the surgery essentially disappeared from that country.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n8">8</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">
	Contrary to the events in the United Kingdom, the United States experienced an increase in circumcision rates after World War II.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n9">9</A></SUP></font> It was not until 1975 that the American Academy of Pediatrics Report of the Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision (<A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975 AAP Report</A>), in a review of available research, reached a conclusion similar to that in Britain, stating that "[t]here is no absolute medical indication for routine circumcision of the newborn."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n10">10</A></SUP></font> The 1975 AAP report, published in the AAP's journal <I>Pediatrics</I>, also concluded that good personal hygiene could replace this surgery in maintaining the health of the male genital organs.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n11">11</A></SUP></font> However, because the 1975 AAP report deemed the surgery unnecessary but not harmful when balanced against surgical complications, physicians continued to circumcise.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n12">12</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">
	Fourteen years later, a new AAP Task Force on Circumcision (<A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1989">1989 AAP report</A>) revised the organization's position, stating that "new evidence has suggested possible medical benefits from newborn circumcision."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n13">13</A></SUP></font> While retaining the now quite old--but still unproven justifications of reducing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and cancer, the "new evidence" for a benefit from circumcision primarily consisted of studies asserting lower rates of urinary tract infections (UTIs) among circumcised infants.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n14">14</A></SUP></font> Unlike the AAP report, the 1989 version cited medical literature to support its conclusions.
<P align="justify">
	However, on closer analysis, the 1989 AAP report's medical authority provides stronger support for the findings of the 1975 report. The 1989 AAP task force deemed almost all of the cited articles showing STD and UTI benefits from circumcision to be flawed, but found none of the cited articles with findings adverse to circumcision flawed.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n15">15</A></SUP></font> If the 1989 AAP task force chose to credit STD and UTI research that it knew to be methodologically flawed as it appears to have done, it would have breached scientific protocol. Methodological soundness is the preeminent consideration for those engaged in scientific investigation.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n16">16</A></SUP></font> It would be a failure to act in a scientifically responsible manner to give more credit to a larger number of flawed studies supporting the medical utility of circumcision than a smaller number of sound studies finding no medical utility from circumcision.
<P align="justify">
	The AAP also drew questionable conclusions concerning infant pain during and after circumcision. The 1989 AAP report described the now acknowledged , but for many decades disputed, physiological pain responses as "transient and disappear[ing]" within 24 hours after surgery."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n17">17</A></SUP></font> This statement ignored the increasing knowledge of infant perceptive abilities and warnings concerning the unknown long-term effects of perinatal pain.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n18">18</A></SUP></font>.<P align="justify">
	After a decade of continuing debate about circumcision, both inside and outside the medical field the AAP established another task force to review the controversial practice of routine neonatal circumcision. The new AAP task force issued a report in March of 1999 (<A HREF="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999 AAP report</A>) that ultimately concluded, "[e]xisting scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n19">19</A></SUP></font> Though this statement was an improvement over the 1989 position, many of the research failings of the 1989 report recurred in the 1999 report.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n20">20</A></SUP></font> More importantly, the AAP equivocated in its duty to decide whether this surgery should be considered valid preventive medicine; instead, it left the decision to the "cultural" desires of parents.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n21">21</A></SUP></font> In doing so, the AAP failed to realize that decades of asserted medical utility had created these prevailing cultural "norms."
<P align="justify">
	Another oddity of the medical practice of circumcision is that is is usually obstetricians, not pediatricians who perform circumcisions.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n22">22</A></SUP></font> This practice results in the anomalous situation of having physicians with experience in female reproductive anatomy performing unanesthetized surgery on a male reproductive organ. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (<A HREF="http://www.acog.org/">ACOG</A>) historically has deferred to the latest AAP circumcision task force position statement on the medical utility of circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n23">23</A></SUP></font> Although much of the negligence asserted against the AAP may also attach to ACOG for its deference to the AAP's position, a discussion of whether any liability is appropriate lies beyond the scope of this Note. In any case, ACOG's deference to the AAP's analysis and recommendations concerning circumcision is evidence of professional reliance, suggesting that the AAP should be subject to a duty of care.
<P align="justify">

	This note examines the possibility of bringing a claim against a medical professional society or trade association, such as the AAP, for negligent promulgation of recommendations. Trade Association liability may be predicated on section 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n24">24</A></SUP></font> Section 324 A allows for the imposition of liability upon a trade association for gratuitous services, such as a professional standard setting, if the association renders those services negligently.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n25">25</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">

	Trade association liability for issuing faulty guidelines was also addressed in 1996 by the New Jersey Supreme Court in the case of <A HREF="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/courts/supreme/a-97-95.opn.html"><I>Snyder v. American Ass'n of Blood Banks</I></A>.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n26">26</A></SUP></font> The plaintiff, a recipient of blood platelet transfusions performed in 1984 contracted AIDS.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n27">27</A></SUP></font> In order to address the liability of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the court examined the role that the AABB played in the blood banking industry. The court found that "[b]y words and conduct, the AABB invited blood banks, hosptials, and patients to rely on the AABB's recommended procedures."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n28">28</A></SUP></font> The court held that the AABB owed a duty of care to individuals, like Snyder, because it was foreseeable that blood banks would follow the AABB's recommended procedures.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n29">29</A></SUP></font> The court also found that at the time of Snyder's transfusions, ample evidence existed that blood products could transmit AIDs, and therefore, the AABB was negligent.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n30">30</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">
	This Note will delineate how the  <I>Snyder</I> decision and section 324A of the the Restatement can be used to extend tort liability to the AAP. However, much of the case against the AAP depends on a thorough understanding of the research findings available to the AAP and its choices in interpreting them. Therefore Parts I and II of this Note will address at length the medical rationales and issues surrounding circumcision at the time of the 1989 and 1999 AAP reports. Part III examines a number of legal theories by which the AAP could be held liable for its role in promoting circumcision as a viable medical practice. This Note concludes by recommending that the AAP face liability in order to force it to act in a scientifically responsible manner when investigating scientific evidence and issuing guidelines concerning the possible benefits and known harms of circumcision.<P>

Both articles reflect the interviewed physician's decision to assert that a rare reaction to anesthesia was at fault and to discount any possibility that circumcision as a medical practice had any role in the patient's death.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Routine circumcision of infant boys usually takes place during the first two days of life, before the infant is returned home with his mother. The child is immobilize, by being strapped down on a formed plastic board, and a physician proceeds to tear the foreskin from the glans with a flat metal probe inserted between the two attached structures.
