Following more than a decade of argument in the wake of an equivocal 1975 AAP task force <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1975">statement</A>, the 1989 Report re-examined the medical justifications for infant circumcision. Most of the utility claimed for circumcision was of a preventive nature. The maladies supposedly reduced or prevented by circumcision consisted of various STDs, cancers, UTIs, and abnormal conditions of the foreskin. Preventive surgery is not troubling if proven benefits of the procedure outweigh the costs and risks, as reflected through reliable complication rates. However, in the case of circumcision, the American medical profession has failed for half a century to institute a sufficiently comprehensive prospective research and evaluation program.<P><a name="p1514"></a><center>
<I>
A.&nbsp;&nbsp; P<font size="2">HIMOSIS</font></I></center>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In adulthood, the foreskin is able to retract back from the glans down onto the shaft of the penis. Phimosis is the abnormal condition of a non-retractable foreskin, diagnosed from the occurrence of the hardening of opening of the foreskin or from prolonged adherence of the foreskin to the glans.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n31">31</A></SUP></font> Circumcision has long been recommended to parents as a preventive measure for phimosis.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n32">32</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Edward Wallerstein, a former Communications Coordinator in the Department of Community Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in his book <I>Circumcision: An American Health Fallacy</I>, forcefully argued that circumcision as both a curative and preventive therapy for phimosis is unwarranted.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n33">33</A></SUP></font> He cited the groundbreaking 1949 <A HREF="/library/general/gairdner/">study</A> by the British researcher Douglas Gairdner, which demonstrated that foreskin retraction is a gradual process of development that can take years.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n34">34</A></SUP></font> Gairdner concluded that a diagnosis of phimosis "cannot be properly applied to the infant."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n35">35</A></SUP></font> Additionally, Wallerstein cited an eight-year <A HREF="/library/general/oster/">study</A> of 1,968 intact<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n36">36</A></SUP></font> Danish boys that found 63% of the six to seven year-old boys did not have fully retractable foreskins.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n37">37</A></SUP></font> The study also found that by sixteen to seventeen years of age only 3% of these boys could not fully retract their foreskins.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n38">38</A></SUP></font> Out of the total of 1,968 boys, only three (.15%) eventually were circumcised to correct phimosis.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n39">39</A></SUP></font> In retrospect, the author of the study, Dr. Jakob Oster, was not convinced that circumcision was necessary even in the three cases where it had been performed.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n40">40</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975 AAP report</A> stated neonatal phimosis "is not a valid medical indication for circumcision."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n41">41</A></SUP></font> The <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1989">1989 AAP report</A>, without preventing any new information that clearly called for circumcision to prevent phimosis, simply warned that circumcision later in life "may be a more complicated procedure."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n42">42</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP task force was aware of Gairdner's article and findings because it cited him for his information concerning the progressive development of foreskin retractability.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n43">43</A></SUP></font> However, the 1989 AAP report does not mention Dr. Oster's findings or conclusions regarding phimosis.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n44">44</A></SUP></font> The logical inference from the AAP's omissions is that it is better to perform painful, unanesthestized surgery within the first several days of every infant boy's life than to circumcise a rare few later in life. The AAP task force did not weigh the incidence of foreskin condition, such as phimosis against the complication rates for neonatal circumcision. Likewise, the task force failed to examine any alternative therapies for phimosis. As a result, the 1989 AAP task force could not justifiably use the prevention of phimosis to support its alteration of the 1975 AAP statement.

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although the threat of phimosis might not be enough to convince parents to circumcise, the threat of cancer obviously ought to be more influential. The rationale of using circumcision to prevent cancer had been around since the 1930s, but the 1975 AAP report found no solid support for using circumcision to prevent cervical or prostate cancer and found that good hygiene was a preferable method for preventing penile cancer.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n45">45</A></SUP></font> However, the 1989 AAP report resurrected the rationales of using circumcision to prevent both penile and cervical cancer.
<P><A name="p1516a"><center>
1. Cervical Cancer</center>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1989">1989 AAP report</A> omitted two well-designed studies that found no statistical effect between a husband's circumcision status and the incidence of cervical cancer in his wife.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n46">46</A></SUP></font> In addition, the 1989 AAP report did not review the international epidemiological evidence contained in Edward Wallerstein's book on circumcision, which eventually renders any link between male circumcision status and cervical cancer unsupported.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n47">47</A></SUP></font> The 1989 task force did observe that cervical cancer appears to be related to the age that a woman begins sexual relations and the number of sexual partners she has throughout life.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n48">48</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP task force, in making this observation did not give any citation. Thus readers of the 1989 AAP report were not alerted to sources of evidence unfavorable to theories linking a male partner's circumcision status to cervical cancer.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aside from its omissions of pertinent evidence, the <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1989">1989 AAP report</A> used language that appears to have been chosen to induce readers to make faulty inferences. Were it not for the misleading sentence construction in the summary section of the 1989 report which stated, "[a]n increased incidence of cancer of the cervix has been found in sexual partners of uncircumcised men infected with the human papillomavirus,"<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n49">49</A></SUP></font> the report would have clearly acknowledged a stronger linkage of cervical cancer to viral STDs. The sentence appears to have been constructed to draw attention to "uncircumcised men" and to rhetorically conceal "infected with the human papillomavirus." Thus the summary section fails to reiterate better supported hypotheses that human papillomavirus and other viral STDs are causal agents of cervical cancer in women, irrespective of the circumcision status of their partners.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n50">50</A></SUP></font>
<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The section of the 1989 report addressing cervical cancer contained further misleading language. The 1989 AAP report stated:
<blockquote><blockquote>
Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 are the viruses most commonly associated with cancer of the cervix; Herpes simplex virus type 2 has also been linked with cervical cancer. <I>Although human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 are also associated with cancer of the penis, evidence linking uncircumcised men to cervical cancer is inconclusive</I>.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n51">51</A></SUP></font>
</blockquote></blockquote>
The second sentence leads with a clause addressing the linkage between human papillomavirus infection and cancer of the penis, but the second part of this sentence substituted "uncircumcised men" for men infected with the human papillomavirus, without supporting an equivalence for the two groups. Reliable evidence for a higher rate of viral infection due to lack of circumcision was not presented anywhere in the report's section on STDs.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n52">52</A></SUP></font> The section of the 1989 AAP report devoted to penile cancer did cite a Brazilian <A HREF="/library/disease/cancer/mccance/">study</A> that reported finding human papillomavirus in 31 of 53 cases of penile cancer.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n53">53</A></SUP></font> However, the penile cancer section of the report did not cite this study to support the proposition that viral STD infections are higher in intact men.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n54">54</A></SUP></font> The word "although" which begins the sentence further conceals the rhetorical substitution. These rhetorical maneuvers appear to have been designed to divert attention from the "inconclusive"<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n55">55</A></SUP></font> linkage between cervical cancer and circumcision status, while subtly reinforcing a suspicion of linkage between foreskins and human papillomavirus, and, consequently, a male with a foreskin and cervical cancer in his partner.
<P><a name="p1518"></a><center>
2. Penile Cancer</center>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although the prevention of <I>cervical</I> cancer through the circumcision of male infants has always been questionable, the prevention of <I>penile</I> cancer has always been circumcision advocates strongest argument.. The <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1989">1989 AAP report</A> stated that penile cancer "occurs" almost exclusively in uncircumcised men," and continued by stating that "in five major reported series since 1932, not one man had been circumcised neonatally.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n56">56</A></SUP></font> The report cites a 1975 article by researchers Elliot Leiter and Albert Lefkovits to support the contention that circumcision provides virtual immunity from penile cancer.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n57">57</A></SUP></font> However, the main purpose of the Leiter and Lefkovits article, which was labelled a "case report" was to report penile cancer in a man circumcised neonatally and to cite other reported cases.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n58">58</A></SUP></font> It appears that the 1989 AAP task force in failing to enumerate the nine "reported" cases that occurred in men circumcised neonatally, was uncritically parroting an industry opinion. Additionally, the task force appears not to have considered the possibility that there were only nine reported cases due to an industry-wide reporting bias. This failure to consider reporting bias as a possible confounding variable could result in readers erroneously concluding that circumcised men are immune to penile cancer.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 1989 report, citing a 1980 estimate derived in a study by Mosze Kochen and Steven McCurdy, then stated that one in six hundred intact men will develop penile cancer in their lifetime.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n59">59</A></SUP></font> Kochen and McCurdy based their estimate on the assumption that all cases of penile cancer would occur in intact men.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n60">60</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP task force reported the estimate even though it was based on this assumption. In the very next paragraph, however, the task force, citing an <A HREF="/library/general/wallerstein/">article</A> by Edward Wallerstein, admitted that countries which do not routinely circumcise have rates less than, equal to, and greater than the rate in the U.S.--whereas the majority of males are circumcised.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n61">61</A></SUP></font> It was not valid for the 1989 task force to report a one in six hundred lifetime risk for penile cancer among intact males when a major premise for the estimate, that only intact males get penile cancer, was clearly erroneous.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Additionally, Edward Wallerstein identified multiple incidences of faulty research design and wild hypothesizing in the search for a link between the retention of an intact foreskin, the presence of smegma, and the occurrence of penile cancer.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n62">62</A></SUP></font> It was irresponsible for the 1989 AAP task force, as reviewers of medical research, to have uncritically parroted a conclusion that neonatal circumcision provides virtual immunity from penile cancer in light of the pattern of researcher bias that Wallerstein exposed. The task force's underreporting of penile cancer cases in neonatally circumcised males, unfortunately, fit well into this historical pattern of bias on the part of the American medical profession.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n63">63</A></SUP></font>
<P><a name="p1519"></a><center>
3.  Prostate Cancer</center>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whereas penile cancer made it onto the first page of the <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1989">1989 AAP report</A>, cancer of the prostate was not even mentioned. The <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975 report</A> mentioned it, but solely for the purpose of debunking any theory that prostate cancer occurs more frequently among intact men.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n64">64</A></SUP></font> As with theories linking circumcision with other cancers, Wallerstein demonstrated that findings connecting circumcision to prostate cancer were the result of badly designed and conducted research.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n65">65</A></SUP></font> By failing to present the fact of the discredited link between circumcision status and prostate cancer, the 1989 AAP task force, unlike its 1975 counterpart, did not alert the medical community to the full magnitude of the panacean claims for circumcision. Thus, a physician relying on the AAP's analysis was not put on guard in reviewing the claims for circumcision in the fight against cancer.<a name="p1520"></a>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For many decades, circumcision advocates tried to use the prevention of cancer to justify circumcision. A new justification emerged in the 1980s--the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) The 1989 AAP Task Force on Circumcision modified the 1975 statement, primarily using the reduction of urinary tract infections as its rationale, by stating in the introductory section, "[n]ew evidence has suggested possible medical benefits from newborn circumcision. Preliminary data suggest the incidence of urinary tract infection in male infants may be reduced."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n66">66</A></SUP></font> However, the section of the report  devoted to UTIs ended with the admission that the UTI studies suggesting the utility of circumcision "are retrospective and may have methodologic [sic] flaws," and "the study population may have been influenced by selection bias."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n67">67</A></SUP></font> A 1990 <A HREF="/library/disease/UTI/thompson/">article</A> by Robert Thompson more thoroughly explained the methodological flaws in these UTI studies.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n68">68</A></SUP></font> He noted that these studies neither controlled for population variables among the boys' families nor accounted for "differences in the health-care-providing behavior of physicians."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n69">69</A></SUP></font> 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Notwithstanding the AAP's own worries over methodological flaws, the results of these UTI studies formed the impetus for the 1989 AAP review of circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n70">70</A></SUP></font> Once again, it appears that when the benefit of circumcision was the topic of investigation, the AAP task force was willing to overlook methodological flaws in research. The task force used the UTI findings to support their change in the position statement, even when such flaws consisted of failure to control subject variables, failure to control for physician biases, and the elimination of data that provided problems for the hypotheses.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n71">71</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Additionally, the 1989 AAP task force readily adopted a theory championed by Thomas Wiswell--the main author of these problematic studies asserting UTI benefits from circumcision.--that the presence of a foreskin provides a site for bacterial colonization leading to UTIs.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n72">72</A></SUP></font> A hypothetical alternate explanation could be that some UTIs result from a lack of proper information on the care of the foreskin. Well meaning, but misinformed parents might have attempted to forcefully retract the foreskin's for cleaning underneath due to a lack of understanding of the foreskin's natural structural development. Forced retraction might have resulted in tissue irritation and avenues of entry for the germs that caused the UTIs. Neither Dr. Wiswell nor the AAP appear to have considered this possibility as an intervening causal variable in the results.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The AAP was aware of the forced retraction problem in 1989. In 1984 it had published a brochure called <I><A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/aap/">Care of the Uncircumcised Penis</A></I>, largely to address the shocking lack of knowledge physicians displayed in surveys conducted in the early 1980s.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n73">73</A></SUP></font> The AAP brochure may have begun to educate physicians and parents to stop forcibly retracting children's foreskins and to stop unnecessarily cleaning under the foreskin with cotton swabs and antiseptics. However, the problem has not disappeared,<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n74">74</A></SUP></font> and the AAP still suggests the daily use of soap under the foreskin once retraction has occurred.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n75">75</A></SUP></font> Anne Briggs, in <I>Circumcision: What Every Parent Should Know</I>, relates the story of Dr. William Mitchell, who was warned that smegma was a carcinogen, while attending medical school during the 1940s, and subsequently started washing under his foreskin with soap daily.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n76">76</A></SUP></font> It was only after changing from a daily rinse with water to this cleansing method that he developed his first foreskin infection.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n77">77</A></SUP></font> The ensueing series of infections and constant irritation unfortunately led him to choose circumcision as a cure.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n78">78</A></SUP></font> Dr. Paul M. Fleiss, in a 1997 <A HREF="/news/Mothering1997/">article</A> published in the magazine <I>Mothering</I>, recommends simply rinsing underneath the foreskin with water once it is retractable<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n79">79</A></SUP></font>--the method that kept Dr. Michell free of problems for 29 years.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n80">80</A></SUP></font> In view of its knowledge of the forced retraction problem, and the possibility that some cleaning behaviors themselves may be at fault, the AAP should have remained skeptical of Wiswell's causal hypothesis for UTIs.

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Another non-cancer rationale for circumcision, but one which has been proposed since the nineteenth century, is the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even though the 1989 AAP report retained a section addressing circumcision a possible preventive measure for STDs, the task force admitted that the "[e]vidence regarding the relationship of circumcision to sexually transmitted diseases is conflicting."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n81">81</A></SUP></font> Two studies that the report cited indicated that both gonorrhea and nonspecific urethritis occurred with greater frequency in intact men.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n82">82</A></SUP></font> However, in the next sentence of the report described both of these studies as inconclusive due to methodological problems.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n83">83</A></SUP></font> Other studies cited in the 1989 report, purporting to link intact penises to higher rates of viral STDs, such as human papillomaviruses and genital herpes are also listed as likely to have methodological flaws.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n84">84</A></SUP></font> In fact, every study that the task force cited for the proposition that circumcision lessens the risk of contracting STDs was also cited as methodologically troubled.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n85">85</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The 1989 task force as also void of an analysis of the availability and cost effectiveness of alternate means of treatment and prevention of STDs. The analysis further lacked any comparison of medical utility between neonatal circumcision and alternate therapies. These two omissions served to undermine any implication that circumcision should be considered as prophylactic therapy for STDs. In view of the uncertainty in the data that purported to link circumcision status and numerous STDs, a responsible health organization should have reiterated the fact that avoiding sexual promiscuity and using condoms are the best methods of protection against STDs. The 1989 AAP report failed to do this.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only methodologically non-problematic study cited in the STD section of the report found no difference in the incidence of gonorrhea between circumcised and intact groups and, in fact found "a higher incidence of nonspecific urethritis in circumcised men."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n86">86</A></SUP></font> Based on its own cited material, the 1989 task force could have scientifically concluded that avoiding circumcision confers a benefit against the risk of contracting STDs. In any case, similar to the situation for UTIs, the flawed studies, claiming circumcision reduced the risk of contracting an STD, failed to justify the 1989 task force's change in policy on circumcision.

<I>E.&nbsp;&nbsp; P<font size="2">HYSICAL</font> C<font size="2">OMPLICATIONS OF</font> C<font size="2">IRCUMCISION</font></I></center>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Turning from a benefit examination of circumcision to a risk examination of circumcision, the 1989 AAP report continued the practice of ignoring sound evidence while crediting flawed evidence supporting the procedure. The report stated that "[t]he most common complications are local infection and bleeding."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n87">87</A></SUP></font>  Though severe complications following circumcisions are rare, they should have been mentioned in the AAP's report when it mentioned three deaths that were openly attributed to circumcision complications in the last forty years.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n88">88</A></SUP></font> The report failed to warn that infections resulting from a circumcision can become quite serious and have impacts on other parts of the body. This has been documented in a four-year case study of four infants who were admitted to one Australian hospital for meningitis following their circumcisions and in a press release concerning the Alaskan lawsuit of Jacob Sweet.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n89">89</A></SUP></font> The AAP should have warned parents that infections from this type of surgery do not always remain local.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Aside from "local infection and bleeding," there is a striking range of complications that can result from circumcision. Rosemary Romberg, in her 1985 book, <I>Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma</I>, devoted over thirty pages to reviewing reports of various clinical conditions and surgical mishaps that can occur as a result of circumcision and can result in the loss of part or all of the penis.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n90">90</A></SUP></font> The 1989 report did not cite Romberg's book and failed to address the lengthy list of complications that she compiled from the medical literature.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	At the very least, the 1989 report should have included what was mentioned in the "Surgical Risks and Aftermaths of the 1975 report, which informed parents and physicians that "[t]he immediate hazards of circumcision include local infection <I>which may progress to septicemia, significant hemorrhage, and mutilation</I>."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n91">91</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP report skipped directly from, "the most common complications are local infection and bleeding to mentioning three reported deaths in the last forty years.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n92">92</A></SUP></font> Thus, the AAP appeared to imply that there was no range of harmful effects between the two extremes.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Even though it postdated the 1989 AAP report on circumcision, the 1995 AAP Committee on Bioethics statement, entitled <I><A HREF="/library/ethics/AAP/">Informed Consent, Parental Permission, and Assent in Pediatric Practice</A></I>, recommended that all known potential risks should be presented to parental decision makers: 
<blockquote><blockquote>
[P]atients should have explanation, in understandable language, of the nature of the ailment or condition; the nature of the proposed diagnostic steps and/or treatment(s) and the probability of their success; the existence and nature of the risks involved; and the existence, potential risks of recommended alternative treatments (including the choice of no treatment)...[and] assurance... that the patient has the freedom to choose among the medical alternatives without coercion or manipulation.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n93">93</A></SUP></font>
</blockquote></blockquote><P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This policy statement appeared to underscore the duty to avoid "manipulation" by omission, which was probably not different in 1989 just six years before. The 1975 AAP report explicitly stated that possible adverse outcomes should be discussed with parents "well in advance of delivery, when the capacity for clear response is more likely."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n94">94</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP task force should have been urging physicians to present parents with information concerning all possible adverse outcomes of the surgery, the uncertain nature of circumcision's benefits, and the benefits of remaining intact.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	In addition to failing to include a discussion of the full variety of complications that can result from circumcision, the 1989 AAP report also understated the statistical rate of complications. The report stated: "The exact incidence of post operative complications is unknown, but large series indicate that the rate is low, approximately 0.2 to 0.6%. The most common complications are local infection and bleeding."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n95">95</A></SUP></font> The AAP task force was able to provide this low estimate of complications by screening the research with the requirement of a "large series" study. It thereby avoided citation of an immediate complication rate of 4% on a smaller subject pool of 361 infants in Utah, published by researchers Thomas Metcalf et al. in 1983.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n96">96</A></SUP></font> The task force also neglected to report the phenomenena of "late" complications circumcision--those that manifest themselves farther into the first year of the infant's life--which Metcalf et al. reported at the astonishing rate of 13%.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n98">97</A></SUP></font>

Aside from omitting Metcalf's <A HREF="/library/procedure/metcalf/">findings</A> from its survey of published complication rates, the 1989 AAP report also misstated the results obtained by researchers William Gee and Julian Ansell in a 1976 retrospective study. The AAP apparently quoted a figure of 0.2% for "really significant" complications from the article's discussion section and abstract, without examining the information provided in the main body of the article which gave an overall immediate complication rate of 2.0% for the subject pool of 5882 infants.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n99">98</A></SUP></font> Ignoring the 2.0% figure, the 1989 AAP report then implied that the 0.2% complication figure can be discounted further because it included the "most common complications [which] are local infection and bleeding."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n99">99</A></SUP></font> However the task force failed to acknowledge that Gee and Ansell had already removed what they considered minor infections and bleeding from their total complication rate of 2.0%, to arrive at the 0.2% figure.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n100">100</A></SUP></font> In compiling their data, Gee and Ansell noted that "most complications were <I>not</I> indexed, and only by careful perusal of the nurses notes were they ferreted out."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n101">101</A></SUP></font> Amazingly, Gee and Ansell's decision to focus on what they characterized as "really significant" complications subsequently enabled the 1989 AAP task force to pare away many of the complications--complications that these two researchers had carefully ferreted out.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aside from citing Gee and Ansell, in providing a complication range of 0.2-0.6%, the 1989 AAP report also cited two 1987 letters to the editor of <I>Pediatrics</I>.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n102">102</A></SUP></font> Thomas Wiswell, who had conducted the methodologically problematic UTI studies which had led to the task force's change of policy, estimated a complication rate of 0.3% from a review of 175,000 male births in Army hospitals over ten years.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n103">103</A></SUP></font> His findings were later reported, adter the 1989 AAP report was published, to be a complication rate of 0.19% of over 100,000 male infants from a six-year period.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n104">104</A></SUP></font> Similar to Gee and Ansell's discounting of an overall rate of 2.0% to arrive at a reported rate of 0.2%, Wiswell's low rate, reviewer Thompson noted, may have also been due to a restrictive filtering and defining of complications as only those "complications specifically recorded as such" by medical persononnel.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n105">105</A></SUP></font> The upper end of the 1989 AAP report's complication range came from another letter to the editor in a 1987 issue of <I>Pediatrics</I>, submitted by a physician who reviewed the records of 4000 births in his hospital over at two year period.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n106">106</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 1989 AAP task force displayed an unscientific selection bias in giving more weight to two letters to the editor--those of Wiswell and Harkavy--over the scientifically designed and published research of Metcalf et al. and Gee &amp; Ansell. Presumably, the raw data and operations deficitions for complications of the Metcalf et al. and Gee &amp; Ansell research were available for peer review by the AAP task force, whereas the data that Wiswell and Harkavy provided in their letters to the editor was not. Additionally, unlike George Kaplan's 1983 <A HREF="/library/complications/kaplan/">review</A> of published literature on circumcision, the 1989 AAP report completely ignored complication rates gathered from other countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n107">107</A></SUP></font> The standard of medical care in those countries has to be comparable to that in the United States. To avoid an appearance of selection bias, researchers findings from those countries should also have been included in the task force's investigation of physical complication rates.

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to the possibility of potentially devastating physical complications, circumcision has negative effects on behavior. Until the last couple of decades, the widespread belief was that an infant was either incapable of perceiving pain, or that, because such pain would not be remembered, it had no effect on  behavior.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#108n">108</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP task force, unable to avoid addressing this misconception concerning infant cognition, devoted a section of its report to infant pain.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n108">109</A></SUP></font> The 1989 authoritatively stated that infants can feel pain; it supported this conclusion with citation to the thorough 1987 <A HREF="/library/pain/anand/">review</A> on infant pain authored by researchers Anand and Hickey in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n110">110</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However the 1989 AAP report went on to state that while behavioral changes occurred, such as crying from surgical trauma, irritability, altered sleep and feeding patterns, and altered maternal-child social interaction, "[t]hese behavioral changes were transient and disappear[ed] with in 24 hours after surgery."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n111">111</A></SUP></font> There is a great difference between the statement that experimentally measured behaviors return to pre-operative levels and the report's summary section conclusion that "[I]nfants respond[ed] to the procedure with transient behavioral and psychological changes."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n112">112</A></SUP></font> In addressing the question of neonatal memory, the 1989 task force missed or ignored Anand and Hickey's warning:
<blockquote><blockquote>
In the long term, painful experiences in neonates could possibly lead to psychological sequelae, since several workers have shown that newborns may have a much greater capacity for memory than was previously thought. . . .long-term memory requires the functional integrity of the limbic system and disencphalon. . . these structures are well developed and functioning during the newborn period . . . [M]emory and learning depend on brain plasticity, which is known to be highest during the prenatal and neonatal periods. Apart from excellent studies in animals demonstrating the long-term effects of sensory experience in the neonatal period, evidence for memories of pain in human infants must, by necessity, be anecdotal. Early painful experiences may be stored in the phylogenically old "procedural memory," which is not accessible to conscious recall.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n113">113</A></SUP></font>
</blockquote></blockquote>
This warning should have discouraged the task force from making any affirmative statements that circumcision has no enduring effects.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Indeed, during the 1980s, researchers had accumulated evidence of the remarkable abilities of infants to retain memory. In 1986, researchers Anthony DeCasper and Melanie Spence published the results of an experiment designed to to measure fetal and neonatal memory for speech sounds.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n114">114</A></SUP></font> They found that in utero subjects, who were read a target story twice daily by their mothers, would later as neonates respond perferentially to their target story as opposed to similar sounding stories, regardless of who recited it to them.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n115">115</A></SUP></font> By 1987 researchers had begun to see that the view that infants were incapable of experiencing memory or pain had more to do with the failings of researcher's study designs than it had to do with the failings of infants.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n116">116</A></SUP></font> the 1989 AAP task force should have at least investigated these studies and mentioned them in their report.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, at the time of the 1989 AAP report, information was available that neonatal pain experiences might have a deleterious effect on future behavior. For example, a 1985 issue of the <I>Lancet</I> contained an article that found a significantly higher percentage of adolescent suicides among subjects that had experienced respiratory distress at birth, compared to adolescents who experienced no problems at birth.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n117">117</A></SUP></font> A pattern of distressed behaviors, similar to those of "of infants born at risk," occurs during the trauma of circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n118">118</A></SUP></font> In another retrospective epidemiological <A HREF="/library/psych/jacobsen1/">study</A> conducted in Sweden, researchers also found a significant correlation between the type of suicide method chosen by suicide victims and the type of complications they experienced at birth.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n119">119</A></SUP></font> Researchers of both studies dealing with adolescent suicide carefully pointed out the correlational, rather than causal, certainty of their findings.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n120">120</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lesson the 1989 AAP task force should have gleaned from these findings was that psychologists were only beginning to devise ways to measure infants' amazing ability for memory and its effects on later behavior. In view of these research findings, the 1989 task force either failed in its duty to investigate the state of knowledge on infant memory and perception or failed to report on its investigation. It also breached its duty of care to provide scientific guidance to physicians and parents, because it simply dismissed neonatal circumcision's behavioral effects as "transient" and "disappearing."

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Returning to the physical issues surrounding the foreskin and circumcision, a logical scientific investigation should start with an inquiry into why nature created the foreskin. A short-lived paragraph in the 1984 AAP brochure <I>Care of the Uncircumcised Penis</I> described the protective functions of the foreskin and the adverse consequences of its loss after circumcision.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n121">121</A></SUP></font> That paragraph was deleted in subsequent printings of the brochure.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n122">122</A></SUP></font> The 1989 AAP report acknowledged, in its sections on local infections and STDs that certain clinical conditions are found more frequently in circumcised boys and men.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n123">123</A></SUP></font> It gave examples of meatitis, an inflammation of urinary opening, and nonspecific urethritis.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n124">124</A></SUP></font> However the AAP displayed a bias in favor of circumcision by altering its brochure for parents. The AAP also displayed bias in omitting the higher prevalence of meatitis and non-specific urethritis in circumcised men from its introductory and summary sections of the 1989 report, while supposed lesser rates of UTI and cancer.
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The AAP task force did not inquire into nature's reasons for the foreskin, but some medical researchers are seeking to understand why the foreskin is more than just skin, continuing the efforts pioneered by the British researcher Douglas Gairdner in the late 1940s.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n125">125</A></SUP></font> In a 1997 article published in <I>Mothering</I> magazine, physician Paul M. Fleiss reviewed the accumulated knowledge about the specialized tissue of which the foreskin is made, and the functions it serves.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n126">126</A></SUP></font> A <A HREF="/library/anatomy/taylor/">study</A> in the <I>British Journal of Urology</I> noted that the presence of "Meissner's corpuscles firmly separate prepucial [meaning of the foreskin] epithelium from true skin," and that these specialized receptors are comparable "with similar nerve-endings in the finger-tips and lips"<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n127">127</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Medical practitioners should have at least some knowledge of what it is they are surgically removing. However, for many years the AAP and the profession as a  whole have viewed the prepuce as merely extra skin.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n128">128</A></SUP></font> To view the foreskin as a mistake of nature is analogous to attitudes formerly held concerning tonsils and adenoids.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n129">129</A></SUP></font> However, whereas the AAP has corrected the rush among physicians to surgically remove the tonsils,<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n130">130</A></SUP></font> the AAP has failed to correct this same clinical mistake for the foreskin. The AAP should have inquired for what purpose nature created the foreskin before classifying it as a perilous mistake.

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any examination of the medical efficacy of circumcision should also have included some reference to cost-benefit analysis. The 1989 AAP report did not refer to or engage in, or call for any cost-benefit analysis.  In response to the 1989 AAP report, physician Robert S. Thompson applied risk-benefit analysis to Thomas Wiswell's assertion that circumcision lessens the occurrence of UTIs.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n131">131</A></SUP></font> Thompson found that when accounting for Metcalf's 1% figure for late complications requiring surgical revision--which the AAP task force had failed to consider--Wiswell's UTI benefit would not outweigh the surgical risks, even accepting Wiswell's immediate complication rate at 0.2%.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n132">132</A></SUP></font> Two other economic cost-benefit analyses were published in 1991, but neither could find utility for routine circumcision in assessing essentially the same data that would have been before the 1989 task force.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n133">133</A></SUP></font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prior to the issuance of the report from the 1989 task force, the AAP appears to have been aware of the necessity to justify circumcision, like any other preventive therapy, on a cost-benefit basis. This is demonstrated in the AAP's own publications. The AAP authored, in conjunction with ACOG, three book editions of <I>Guidelines for Perinatal Care</I>, in 1983, 1988, and 1992.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n134">134</A></SUP></font> Both the 1983 and 1988 editions maintained that "there is no absolute medical indication for circumcision in the neonatal period"--thereby reflecting the findings of the 1975 task force.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n135">135</A></SUP></font> However, the 1988 edition mentioned the pending report from the AAP Task Force on Circumcision to be published the following year: "the present policy. . .will be modified only if data conclusively demonstrates the value of the procedure."<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n136">136</A></SUP></font> Wiswell's methodologically problematic studies hardly qualified as data "conclusively demonstrat[ing] the value of the procedure." Nevertheless, the AAP, in the 1992 edition of <I>Guidelines for Perinatal Care</I>, adopted the view of circumcision's value reflected in the 1989 task force's report.<font size="2"><SUP><A HREF="#n137">137</A></SUP></font> Thus, the AAP as a whole, with respect to cost-benefit analysis, failed to scrutinize the 1989 task force report as it professed it would, and instead proceeded directly to disseminate its findings.<P>

<blockquote> 	
The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision, this protection is lost. In such cases [i.e., when circumcision is performed], the glans and especially the urinary opening can become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis, (inflammation of the meatus) and meatal stenosis (a narrowing of the urinary opening). Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life.

[I]s often observed that the prepuce is a vestigal structure devoid of function. However, it seems to be no accident that during the years when the child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury. . . . Meatal ulcer is almost entirely confined to circumcised male infants.

<a name="n136"></a>136. AAP G<font size="1">UIDELINES</font> 1988, <I>supra</I> note 134, at 93-94. One can only assume that the drafters of the 1988 guidelines were aware of continued debate regarding the efficacy of circumcision. In view of the demonstrated risks attendant to any surgery, as well as occasional severe complications reported in the medical literature, the drafters must have determined that the responsible course of action in lending advice to practitioners, and subsequently parents, would be to claim medical benefits for this elective surgery only if the 1989 AAP circumcision task force found research data that clearly supported such a claim. Until then, the guideline drafters decided to adhere to the established policy that the uncertainty of the data supported.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

See AAP G<font size="1">UIDELINES</font> 1992, <I>supra</I> note 134, at 103 ("Circumcision may also result in a reduced incidence of urinary tract infection, although prospectively collected data in this regard are lacking.") The AAP 1992 guidelines classify circumcision as an elective procedure. <I>Id</I>. UTI prevention is the only benefit mentioned in the paragraph on circumcision contained in the guidelines. Yet this uncertain benefit, reported by the 1989 task force, <I>supra</I> notes 66-72 and accompanying text, somehow qualified as the "conclusively" demonstrated value that the 1988 guidelines professed to require of the 1989 task force report in order to change the AAP and ACOG's policy.</font>
