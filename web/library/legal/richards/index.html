      <p align="justify"><i>This article discusses the history and
      reasoning behind male circumcision; identifies overwhelming
      medical evidence against the performance of non-medical
      (ritual) circumcision; and argues that the medical profession
      may be ignoring modern medical law through a combination of
      medical opinion, negligence, and vitiated consent. It also
      suggests that the legal distinction between male and female
      circumcision should be removed and that the Australian
      executive is indirectly authorising and encouraging ritual
      male circumcision.</i></p>

      <h3>History</h3>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision may be the
      oldest form of surgery, with records indicating that the
      Egyptians practised this ritual as early as 4000 years BC.<a
      id="BB1" href="#1" name="BB1"><font
      size="2"><sup>1</sup></font></a> Anthropologists,
      psychologists, and psychiatrists have offered various
      explanations for its practice, including enhanced or
      decreased sexual performance, societal prestige, sacrifice to
      fertility gods, tribal signs, tests for endurance,
      reincarnation, and the modern and commonly argued
      justification of hygiene.<a id="BB2" href="#2"
      name="BB2"><font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font></a> <a
      href="../brigman/">Brigman</a> suggests that circumcision was
      primarily grounded in the anti-masturbation hysteria of the
      late 1800s when it was feared that a boy with a foreskin
      which had to be pulled back while cleaning would learn to
      masturbate.<a id="BB3" href="#3" name="BB3"><font
      size="2"><sup>3</sup></font></a> Masturbation at this time
      was believed to lead to insanity and numerous other
      illnesses.</p>

      <h3>Medical or ritual surgery</h3>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although physicians were
      the proponents of early neonatal circumcision, justified by
      hygiene, the preponderance of medical opinion today is
      opposed to the practice.<a id="BB4" href="#4"
      name="BB4"><font size="2"><sup>4</sup></font></a> The
      National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia has
      stated that there is no medical indication for undertaking
      routine circumcision of newborn male infants and that the
      hazards of the operation at this age outweigh any possible
      advantages.<a id="BB5" href="#5" name="BB5"><font
      size="2"><sup>5</sup></font></a> The British Medical
      Association has recommended that male circumcision should be
      performed only for medical reasons, indicating that
      complications, including rare deaths, may result from a
      generally unnecessary surgical procedure.<a id="BB6"
      href="#6" name="BB6"><font size="2"><sup>6</sup></font></a>
      Medical reports have suggested that the complication rate may
      be as high as 55 percent for hospital-performed, routine male
      circumcision, with approximately 10 percent of all
      circumcisions having to be repeated.<a id="BB7" href="#7"
      name="BB7"><font size="2"><sup>7</sup></font></a> These
      complications may include death, damage to the shaft, damage
      to the urethra, amputation, unsightly appearance, urethral
      fistulas, haemorrhage, infected incision line, phimosis, and
      infections of the meatus.<a id="BB8" href="#8"
      name="BB8"><font size="2"><sup>8</sup></font></a> An example
      of litigation resulting from a circumcision complication was
      an award of $275,000 by the Supreme Court of New South Wales
      to an infant plaintiff who had been negligently circumcised
      causing the loss of the glans of the penis.<a id="BB9"
      href="#9" name="BB9"><font
      size="2"><sup>9</sup></font></a></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
      href="../brigman/">Brigman</a> argues that ritual male
      circumcision is not medically warranted, has no significant
      physiological benefits, is painful because it is often
      performed without anaesthesia and leaves a wound in which
      urinary salts burn, carries significant risk of surgical
      complications, including death, and deforms the penis. He
      suggests that it would seem that as a non-accidental physical
      injury, it is properly included in the definition of child
      abuse.<a id="BB10" href="#10" name="BB10"><font
      size="2"><sup>10</sup></font></a></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Queensland Law Reform Commission, in a 1993 report on male
      circumcision, found that, unless there are immediate health
      benefits to a particular child from circumcision, it is
      unlikely that the procedure itself could be considered
      therapeutic. <a id="BB11" href="#11" name="BB11"><font
      size="2"><sup>11</sup></font></a> The report concludes that
      the procedure of circumcision is invasive, irreversible, and
      major, and involves the removal of an otherwise health organ
      part.<a id="BB12" href="#12" name="BB12"><font
      size="2"><sup>12</sup></font></a></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research has suggested
      that there is a correlation between circumcision and sexually
      transmitted diseases such as HIV infection. However, a <a
      href="../QLRC/">Queensland Law Reform Commission Report</a>
      has identified a large body of medical evidence indicating
      strong arguments in favour,<a id="BB13" href="#13"
      name="BB13"><font size="2"><sup>13</sup></font></a> and
      against,<a id="BB14" href="#14" name="BB14"><font
      size="2"><sup>14</sup></font></a> a correlation between
      circumcision and infection.<a id="BB15" href="#15"
      name="BB15"><font size="2"><sup>15</sup></font></a> The
      report lists more than 35 international research papers which
      conflict in opinion and result. There is also a suggestion
      that circumcision may reduce a man's risk of developing
      cancer of the penis.<a id="BB16" href="#16" name="BB16"><font
      size="2"><sup>16</sup></font></a> However, research indicates
      that there are more factors involved than circumcision or
      non-circumcision, as personal hygiene seems to be the most
      consistently relevant factor in penile cancers.<a id="BB17"
      href="#17" name="BB17"><font
      size="2"><sup>17</sup></font></a></p>

      <h3>Distinction between male circumcision and female
      circumcision</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      distinction is wrongfully made at a medical and intellectual
      level between male circumcision, which is generally accepted,
      and female circumcision, which is not.<a id="BB18" href="#18"
      name="BB18"><font size="2"><sup>18</sup></font></a> The term
      female circumcision is often used to describe the procedure
      of either scraping or nicking of the clitoris and is a form
      of female genital mutilation.<a id="BB19" href="#19"
      name="BB19"><font size="2"><sup>19</sup></font></a> Male
      circumcision consists of total or partial excision of the
      foreskin.<a id="BB20" href="#20" name="BB20"><font
      size="2"><sup>20</sup></font></a> Under New South Wales
      legislation, female circumcision is now an offence punishable
      by up to seven years' imprisonment.<a id="BB21" href="#21"
      name="BB21"><font size="2"><sup>21</sup></font></a> Other
      legislation prohibiting female circumcision includes the
      <i>Female Genital Mutilation Prohibition Act</i> 1994 (Qld);
      the <i><a
      href="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/statutes/pfca85.htm">
      Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act</a></i> 1985 (UK); and
      the Swedish <i>Prohibiting the Circumcision of Women
      Act</i>.<a id="BB22" href="#22" name="BB22"><font
      size="2"><sup>22</sup></font></a> As female circumcision is
      likely to be completely prohibited by legislation throughout
      Australia in the near future, it is illogical that male
      circumcision has not been considered with this prohibition.
      Surgical cutting and disfiguring of a healthy genital organ
      is consistent with both male and female circumcision. Female
      circumcision was founded on religious and cleanliness
      grounds, as was male circumcision. The loss of sexual
      stimulation can occur from forms of both male and female
      circumcision.<a id="BB23" href="#23" name="BB23"><font
      size="2"><sup>23</sup></font></a> However, there may be a
      distinction on this issue as female circumcision, unlike male
      circumcision, can cause a total loss of stimulation depending
      on the type of surgery performed.<a id="BB24" href="#24"
      name="BB24"><font size="2"><sup>24</sup></font></a> Evidence
      suggests that both male and female ritual circumcision is
      unnecessary, sometimes dangerous, painful and based not on
      medical grounds but purely on historical, societal values.
      Therefore, as the differences appear to be based largely on
      socially constructed ideals, and not on facts, it is
      suggested that there should be no distinction based purely on
      gender.</p>

      <h3>Consent</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every
      person, including infants, has a right to bodily integrity.<a
      id="BB25" href="#25" name="BB25"><font
      size="2"><sup>25</sup></font></a> Consent ordinarily has the
      effect of transforming what would otherwise be unlawful into
      acceptable conduct. The sources of parental and guardian
      power, including the power to consent to medical treatment of
      a child, are found in the <i>Family Law Act</i> 1975 (Cth)<a
      id="BB26" href="#26" name="BB26"><font
      size="2"><sup>26</sup></font></a> and the common law.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      majority of the High Court in <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/do/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank"><i>Marion's Case</i></a>,<a id="BB27"
      href="#27" name="BB27"><font
      size="2"><sup>27</sup></font></a> referring to an earlier
      decision,<a id="BB28" href="#28" name="BB28"><font
      size="2"><sup>28</sup></font></a> held that parental consent
      will not justify all kinds of medical treatment. The majority
      identified procedures such as clitoridectomy, a form of
      female circumcision, as not permitted by law regardless of
      parental consent.<a id="BB29" href="#29" name="BB29"><font
      size="2"><sup>29</sup></font></a> Brennan J held that the
      invasion of a child's personal integrity can be justified
      only if it can be shown that a non-therapeutic purpose
      possesses some higher value than the preservation of the
      child's physical integrity. He further held:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "[W]here there is a doubt about the therapeutic character
          of a proposed procedure, those who would be involved in
          the procedure may be at risk if they act merely upon a
          purported authorisation given by the parent or other
          guardian."<a id="BB30" href="#30" name="BB30"><font
          size="2"><sup>30</sup></font></a>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      Modern medical<a id="BB31" href="#31" name="BB31"><font
      size="2"><sup>31</sup></font></a> and legal<a id="BB32"
      href="#32" name="BB32"><font
      size="2"><sup>32</sup></font></a> opinion indicates that
      ritual male circumcision is non-therapeutic. 

      <p align="justify">Dean J stated that there is a need to
      protect the weak and vulnerable from eugenic and utilitarian
      theories which discount the importance of human integrity and
      complete personality and which are "repugnant to the
      standards of our community".<a id="BB33" href="#33"
      name="BB33"><font size="2"><sup>33</sup></font></a> This need
      to protect the weak may extend to the vitiated consent of a
      parent or guardian if ritual male circumcision is found to be
      against public policy. In 1993 the House of Lords held that
      it was not in the public interest that a person should cause
      actual bodily harm to another for <i>no good reason</i> and,
      in the absence of such a reason, consent could be
      immaterial.<a id="BB34" href="#34" name="BB34"><font
      size="2"><sup>34</sup></font></a> Lord Lowry found that acts
      which inevitably involve the occasioning of at least actual
      bodily harm cannot be performed as of right under the law.<a
      id="BB35" href="#35" name="BB35"><font
      size="2"><sup>35</sup></font></a> Therefore, ritual male
      circumcision, which as a surgical procedure necessarily
      involves actual bodily harm, if performed for <i>no good
      reason</i> other than traditional societal values, may not be
      permitted by the law, irrespective of consent to the
      procedure.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McHugh
      J stated that a parent has no authority to consent to medical
      treatment unless it can be found objectively that the
      treatment is for the welfare of the child.<a id="BB36"
      href="#36" name="BB36"><font
      size="2"><sup>36</sup></font></a> The Family Court in <i>Re
      Marion (No 2)</i><a id="BB37" href="#37" name="BB37"><font
      size="2"><sup>37</sup></font></a> found that the factors in
      determining the best interests of the child include the
      individual's particular condition; the nature of the
      procedure; alternatives to the procedure; the physical,
      psychological and social implications of the procedure; he
      nature of any risk involved in the procedure; and the views
      of parents or guardians with respect to the procedure. When
      comparing the benefits and risks associated with performing
      ritual male circumcision and <i>not</i> performing ritual
      male circumcision, the procedure would be unlikely to be
      found to be in the best interests of the child unless for
      specific medical reasons. Therefore parental consent for male
      circumcision is likely to be vitiated as not in the best
      interests of the child, unless the child has a special
      medical condition. McHugh J stated that if a parent purports
      to give consent to a treatment which is not for the welfare
      of the child, the consent is of no effect, and that a "person
      who acts on such 'consent' is guilty of assaulting the child
      if the treatment involves any physical interference with the
      child".<a id="BB38" href="#38" name="BB38"><font
      size="2"><sup>38</sup></font></a></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      above interpretations by the courts of consent at common law
      indicate that a parent cannot consent to a medical procedure
      on a child which is non-therapeutic, unless there are clear
      benefits for the child. The authority also suggests that
      consent to a procedure which is against public policy or
      consent to a procedure which is not objectively in the best
      interests of the child may be vitiated. Male circumcision is
      generally now regarded as a non-therapeutic procedure<a
      id="BB39" href="#39" name="BB39"><font
      size="2"><sup>39</sup></font></a> with associated risks and
      little known benefits. Therefore <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/do/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank"><i>Marion's Case</i></a> is authority that
      there may be a risk involved to persons who perform
      non-medical ritual male circumcision. This leads to the
      conclusion that persons performing ritual male circumcision
      on purported consent, which is vitiated, may be liable in
      negligence.</p>

      <h3>Adequate information</h3>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, a medical
      practitioner may be liable in negligence if adequate
      information is not given to the parent prior to conducting
      ritual circumcision. The law imposes on a medical
      practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in
      the provision of professional advice as well as treatment.<a
      id="BB40" href="#40" name="BB40"><font
      size="2"><sup>40</sup></font></a> The standard of reasonable
      care and skill required by that duty is that of an ordinary
      skilled person exercising and professing to have that
      skill.<a id="BB41" href="#41" name="BB41"><font
      size="2"><sup>41</sup></font></a></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      parent's consent to ritual male circumcision may be valid
      once he or she is informed in broad terms of the nature of
      the procedure, but this choice may be meaningless unless made
      on the basis of relevant information and advice.<a id="BB42"
      href="#42" name="BB42"><font
      size="2"><sup>42</sup></font></a> The question of whether the
      parent has been given all the relevant information to choose
      between circumcision performed on their child or not, does
      not depend entirely on medical standards or practices, as no
      special medical skill is involved in disclosing this
      information.<a id="BB43" href="#43" name="BB43"><font
      size="2"><sup>43</sup></font></a> A practitioner has a duty
      to warn a parent of the material risks involved in ritual
      circumcision and to inform a parent of the current medical
      classification of ritual circumcision as non-therapeutic
      surgery. This duty exists because a reasonable person in the
      parent's position would be likely to attach significance to
      this information.<a id="BB44" href="#44" name="BB44"><font
      size="2"><sup>44</sup></font></a> It can therefore be
      concluded that a medical practitioner who fails to give this
      information on the risks associated with circumcision, prior
      to surgery, may be liable in negligence.</p>

      <h3>Freedom of religion</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the
      Australian Constitution expressly protects freedom of
      religion,<a id="BB45" href="#45" name="BB45"><font
      size="2"><sup>45</sup></font></a> it may be argued that male
      circumcision, if part of a religious practice, would not be
      subject to criminal or civil law as it would be protected by
      the veil of the Constitution. However, freedoms, such as
      freedom of religion, cannot include acts or practices against
      public policy. The High Court, when considering the extent of
      the power of <a
      href="http://www.statusquo.org/constitution/Constitution.html/#Chapter%20FIVE"
       target="_blank">s 116</a> of the Constitution, held that it
      is for the court to determine whether a particular law is an
      infringement of religious freedom.<a id="BB46" href="#46"
      name="BB46"><font size="2"><sup>46</sup></font></a> As the
      courts have interpreted acts of assault occasioning battery
      to be against public policy and not vitiated by consent,<a
      id="BB47" href="#47" name="BB47"><font
      size="2"><sup>47</sup></font></a> it could be convincingly
      argued that such acts could not be substantiated by the
      freedom of religion provision, as expressed in s 116 of the
      Constitution. The High Court, when considering this issue in

      href="../brigman/">Brigman</a>, a United States legal jurist,
      has since argued that ritual male circumcision would not be

      of religion as expressed in the United States Bill of
      Rights.<a id="BB49" href="#49" name="BB49"><font
      size="2"><sup>49</sup></font></a> It is unlikely that <a
      href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/chapter5.htm"
       target="_blank">s 116</a> of the Constitution would
      authorise ritual male circumcision.</p>

      <h3>Medicare</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ritual
      circumcision is covered, and therefore authorised, by
      Medicare, which includes this surgical procedure in the
      Medical Benefits Schedule.<a id="BB50" href="#50"
      name="BB50"><font size="2"><sup>50</sup></font></a> There are
      presently no requirements that medical reasons be given for
      the procedure prior to a payment being made to a surgeon. For
      a child under six months, Medicare will presently reimburse
      the surgeon at a fee schedule rate $A34.10 for each
      operation.<a id="BB51" href="#51" name="BB51"><font
      size="2"><sup>51</sup></font></a> This indicates that
      Medicare, and therefore the Australian executive, is
      continuing to endorse non-medical, ritual male circumcision.
      A 1992 report of the Australian Institute of Health ranks
      circumcision in the top 40 frequently performed surgical
      procedures, occurring in Australia more frequently than the
      surgical removal of a tooth.<a id="BB52" href="#52"
      name="BB52"><font size="2"><sup>52</sup></font></a> In
      1992-1993, 14,604 neonatal circumcisions were performed in
      Australia at a cost to Medicare of more than $A380,000.<a
      id="BB53" href="#53" name="BB53"><font
      size="2"><sup>53</sup></font></a> Responsible government must
      be accountable for its allocation of resources. The
      continuation of Medicare-funded neonatal circumcision, now
      more frequently to be described as a cosmetic, unnecessary,
      and hazardous procedure, contradicts this accountability.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has
      been established that where a health fund refuses to pay the
      cost of circumcision, the rate of circumcision falls
      dramatically.<a id="BB54" href="#54" name="BB54"><font
      size="2"><sup>54</sup></font></a> An insurance scheme in
      Canada which ceased to subsidise male circumcision
      drastically reduced the number of Canadian circumcisions by
      this decision.<a id="BB55" href="#55" name="BB55"><font
      size="2"><sup>55</sup></font></a> In 1948 the British
      National Health Service reclassified newborn circumcision as
      cosmetic surgery and ceased to pay for the procedure.<a
      id="BB56" href="#56" name="BB56"><font
      size="2"><sup>56</sup></font></a> As a result of this
      reclassification, the rate of circumcision has dropped in
      Britain to 0.5 percent.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      1985 the Australian Federal Health Minister removed the
      rebate for newborn circumcision from the Medical Benefits
      Schedule as a direct result of the 1983 recommendations of
      the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council
      which found ritual circumcision was unnecessary and
      hazardous.<a id="BB57" href="#57" name="BB57"><font
      size="2"><sup>57</sup></font></a> The rebate was returned to
      the Medical Benefits Schedule after a community outcry.
      Medical evidence and opinion continues to grow in favour of
      the abolition of ritual circumcision and it could be argued
      that an informed public would now favour the ministerial
      removal of newborn ritual circumcision from the Medical
      Benefits Schedule.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ritual
      male circumcision is non-therapeutic and is not warranted or
      justified by medical evidence. This form of mutilation should
      not be legally distinguished from female circumcision which
      is a form of female genital mutilation presently in the
      process of being prohibited throughout Australia and the
      Western world. As ritual male circumcision is
      non-therapeutic, may be against public policy, and clearly is
      not in the best interests of the child, a parent's consent
      may be vitiated, leaving persons involved in the procedure
      liable in negligence, notwithstanding parental religious
      beliefs. Alternatively, if a medical practitioner fails to
      give the parent reasonable information on the risks of and
      alternatives to ritual circumcision, the practitioner may
      also be liable in negligence.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the best way to
      eliminate such an antiquated and unnecessary surgical
      procedure would be to remove it from the Medical Benefits
      Schedule. Evidence clearly indicates that the incidence of
      ritual male circumcision would reduce dramatically if not
      funded by Medicare. If this "soft approach" is not
      implemented, there is the likelihood of future litigation
      associated with ritual male circumcision which will lead to
      extra costs being imposed on the medical profession and on
      Australia's health systems.</p>
