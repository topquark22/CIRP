Judge 1

JUDGMENT MAHONEY JA: The plaintiff lost the glans on his penis. The jury
awarded him $275,000. The question to be determined is whether that sum is
beyond the bounds of fair compensation: Precision Plastics Pty Limited v
Demir 132 CLR 362 at 369.

In my view it is. My brethren take a contrary view. The question raises an
issue of principle which is of importance. I shall therefore state, in
principle, why I take the view I do.

The  basic facts were  not in  dispute. It was  for the jury to  decide how
they  valued the actual loss  and the possibilities to  which the plaintiff
was  subject. To summarise  is to omit  but, stated in general  terms, what
the jury could take from the facts was the following.

The injury had caused, and was apt to cause, no physical pain.

The  plaintiff had the  pleasure of  sexual activity but had  lost whatever
was   the  pleasure  to  be   had  from  the  sensitivity   of  the  glans.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 2
Except in one respect, the injury had caused, and was apt to cause, no
actual loss of function. The plaintiff could achieve erection. He was
physically able to have sexual intercourse. He could ejaculate and could
father children. And he could urinate. The qualification was (I shall
follow the judge's summing up) that "he has a problem with the urine
spraying"; if he had an operation he would have "a better cosmetic
appearance and possibly even a better functional result".

The essential  loss claimed was psychological. "His personality development
had  been markedly distorted":  "he had become socially  isolated, sexually
frustrated  and felt quite unable  to see any way out  of his predicament".
Unless  he received some  assistance, he  was "highly likely" to  develop a
neurotic  reaction  of  severe degree,  probably  a  depressive type.  With
psychiatric  or psychological counselling "there was a good  chance that he
would  make a good adjustment  were he fortunate enough to  meet a suitable
girl".  As  to his  "long  term adjustment",  the  psychiatrist thought  it
"probable  that  he will  continue to  avoid social  situations that  might
allow  him to  develop emotional  relationships with  the opposite sex  and
that in  consequence he is potentially vulnerable to depressive and anxiety
reactions as  the time goes on and he becomes progressively more frustrated
emotionally and sexually".

This condition derived from two things: the fact that his penis was
"deformed"; and the fact that he was "constantly preoccupied with worries
about" whether he could have sexual relations with girls and father
children.
This second derived essentially from the size of his penis.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 3
In  fact, there was little  evidence either as to the size of  his penis or
as to whether there was a basis for such worries.

The only evidence as to the size of his penis was that, in its "flaccid
state", it was 9 cms (3.6") long. There was no evidence of its length in
its erect state. The only other evidence was that one doctor said that the
plaintiff had lost one third of the length of the penis.

It is not in doubt that he can father children.

There  was no evidence upon  which the conclusion could be  formed that his
penis  was in fact outside  the normal or the range of the  normal in size.
No effort  was made to prove it to be so  or the extent to which it was so.

The psychological loss was relied on in two respects: it might cause
economic loss; and it had caused a psychiatric state.

As  the judge  said, the  plaintiff had  made "no  quantifiable claim"  for
economic  loss. The  plaintiff had  suffered none to  trial. The claim  was
only for  a possibility that the psychiatric condition, if it developed so,
"may  interfere with"  "his work orientation  or application". The  learned
judge  suggested to the  jury that  the part that  could play was  "small".

The  psychiatric condition was real.  But the effect of it  depended upon a
"myth" or,  as has frequently been described, "the phallic fallacy". It is,
I  think,  permissible in  discussing the  fallacy,  to refer  to fact.  WH
Masters  and VE Johnson "Human  Sexual Response" (1966, 1st ed),  is a work
of  reference: see  <I>McQuaker v  Goddard</I> [1940]  1 KB 687  at 700; <I>Cross  on
Evidence</I>  (3rd Aust ed) par  2.5. At 191 et seq, the position  is stated as
follows:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 4
"PENILE FALLACIES  Another widely accepted `phallic fallacy' is the concept
that  the larger  the penis  the more  effective the male  as a partner  in
coital  connection. The size  of the male  organ both in flaccid  and erect
state  has been presumed  by many  cultures to reflect directly  the sexual
prowess of the individual male.
Dickinson  (RL Dickinson <I>Atlas  of Human  Sex Anatomy</I> (2nd  ed), Baltimore:
Williams &  Wilkins, 1949) was one of the first to record dimensions of the
penis with  some degree of objectivity. He supported Loeb's report (H Loeb,
Harnrohrencapacitat  und  Tripperspritzen,  <I>Munchen. Med.  Wschr</I>.  46:1016,
1899)  that the normal range  of penile length varies from 8.5  to 10.5 cm.
in  the flaccid state, with  the general average in the 9.5  cm. range. The
range  of normalcy suggested by these measurements also  has been supported
by  measurements returned  from examinations of  individual members of  the
male  study-subject  population  (VE Johnson  and  WH Masters.  Unpublished
data).
The  delusion  that penile  size is  related  to sexual  adequacy has  been
founded  in  turn  upon yet  another  phallic  misconception. It  has  been
presumed  that full erection of  the larger penis provides  a significantly
greater penile  size increase than does erection of the smaller penis. This
premise  has  been  refuted by  a  small  group of  men  selected from  the
study-subject  population for clinical evaluation. Forty  men whose penises
measured  7.5-9  cm. in  length in  the flaccid  state were  compared to  a
similar  number  of  study subjects  whose  penises  in the  flaccid  state
measured 10-11.5  cm. Measurement was crudely clinical at best and can only
be presumed  suggestive and certainly not specific in character. The length
of  the  smaller penises  increased by  an  average of  7.5-8  cm. at  full
(plateau-phase)  erection.  This  full  erection  essentially  doubled  the
smaller organs in length over flaccid-size standards.
In  contrast,  in  the men  whose  organs were  significantly  larger in  a
flaccid  state (10-11.5 cm.), penile  length increased by an  average 7-7.5
cm. in the fully erect (plateau-phase) stage.
These  measurements of full  penile erection  are so crudely  clinical that
they  have been adjusted arbitrarily  to the nearest 0.5  cm. to facilitate
presentation.  In each  instance, measurement was  taken from the  anterior
border of  the symphysis at the base of the penis  along the dorsal surface
to  the distal  tip of  the glans.  All 80 penises  were measured on  three
different  occasions   both  in  flaccid  and  erect  states  by  the  same
individual.  Only one investigator  conducted this clinical  measurement so
that  any  idiosyncrasy of  measurement technique  would be  common to  all
results.  One  of the  measurements  of penile  erection  was taken  during
automanipulation,  and  two measurements  were  initiated immediately  upon
withdrawal  of the plateau-phase penis from active  coition. Measurement of
an  erect  penis was  not attempted  until  the final  engorgement of  late
plateau  phase had been  accomplished. Since  full penile engorgement  is a
short-term  process before  ejaculation intervenes, measurement  frequently
was rushed and, therefore, additionally unreliable.
While   the  information  returned  obviously  is   not  definitive,  there
certainly  is no  statistical support  for the  `phallic fallacy' that  the
larger  penis  increases in  size  with full  erection  to a  significantly
greater  degree  than does  the smaller  penis. The  difference in  average
erective  size increase between  the smaller  flaccid penis and  the larger
flaccid penis is not significant.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 5
Of  clinical interest is  the fact  that the greatest  observed penile-size
increase from  flaccid to erect state occurred in a male study subject with
an  average flaccid measurement of 7.5 cm. (not included  in the experiment
reported above).  The increase in size from flaccid to erect state was just
over  9  cm. This  penis more  than doubled  in length  when reacting  from
flaccid  to erect  state. The  smallest increase  in size  from flaccid  to
erect state  was observed in one of the larger organs.  This penis measured
just under  11 cm. in its flaccid state, yet at  full erection only 5.5 cm.
had  been added to the  length of this larger organ.  At full plateau-phase
erection  the  two  organs were  measured  at  identical lengths  on  three
separate occasions.
As   Piersol  has   stated  (GA   Piersol,  <I>Human  Anatomy</I>.   Philadelphia:
Lippincott,  1907), the  size of  the penis has  less constant relation  to
general  physical development  than that  of any other  organ of the  body.
This  statement  has  been made  in  recognition  of yet  another  `phallic
fallacy'. It  has been presumed by many cultures that the bigger the man in
skeletal  and muscular  development, the  bigger the penis,  not only in  a
flaccid but also in an erect state.
Detailed examination  of the study-subject population of 312 men aged 21 to
89  years supported Piersol's contention that there is  no relation between
man's  skeletal  framework and  the  size of  his  external genitalia.  The
largest  penis in the study-subject population,  measuring approximately 14
cm. long  in the flaccid state, was in a man 5 feet, 7 inches tall weighing
152  pounds. The smallest penis,  measuring just over 6 cm.  in the flaccid
state,  was  in  a  man  5  feet,  11  inches  tall  weighing  178  pounds.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 6
Although  there is  little to  support the  concept that  erective size  is
proportionally  greater  for  the  larger  than  the smaller  penis,  there
remains the  theoretical concern of the man with the small  penis as to his
potential  coital effectiveness. Even with erective ability  of the smaller
penis  (less than 9 cm.)  presumed equal to that of the  larger penis (more
than  10  cm.), the  smaller penis  in  the flaccid  state usually  remains
somewhat  smaller  in  an  erect  state.  The  factor  that  constantly  is
overlooked  in theoretical  discussions of  penile coital effectiveness  is
the  involuntary accommodative  reactions of the  vagina in its  functional
role  under coital stimulation as a seminal receptacle (see  Pt2 of Chapter
6)."

In this context, two things may be said about the award of $275,000.

First, whatever  amount be appropriated to the possibility of economic loss
at  some time in  the future, the amount  left for general damages  is very
large.
The court  does not compare particular verdicts. But it can - in my opinion
it  should - observe  the level of  awards for different kinds  of injuries
and  its  duty  is to  maintain  an  appropriate relativity  between  them.

The present  award, less the economic component, is at a  level achieved by
few  of the most  serious of  injuries. The limits  of general damages  for
paraplegia would,  in my opinion, be in this area: see, for example, Watson
v  Haines (10 April  1987) in  which Allen J  awarded $195,000 for  general
damages   to  a  boy  of  twenty  years  who   was  "permanently  partially
quadriplegic". It  would exceed the general damages for, eg, the loss of an
arm or  a leg. I cannot see that the present effects of this injury or such
possibilities  as  there may  be for  future deterioration  can warrant  an
award of this size.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 7
Second, the  award raises an issue of principle in relation  to the role of
an  appellate  court  and  the  nature of  its  duty  in setting  aside  an
excessive award.

The court  has the duty to intervene if the jury's verdict is "so excessive
or  so inadequate that no  jury could reasonably have awarded  them, or, as
is  sometimes  said, out  of all  proportion  to the  circumstances of  the
case".  The  use  of  the  conventional terms,  "excessive",  "inadequate",
"reasonably"  and  "proportion"  poses  the  question:  According  to  what
standards?

The  standards on which  an appellate court must  act are not those  of the
particular  jury: they  are those  which the  court itself formulates.  The
court  has the power and  the duty to set aside what the  jury has awarded.
In  doing so, it  must therefore  - at least  in cases where  standards are
involved -
formulate   its  own  standards   of  what  is  adequate,   reasonable  and
proportionate  and give effect to its standards rather than  those on which
the jury has acted.

The standards which the court formulates for determining what is adequate,
reasonable and proportionate are neither derived from tariffs or
arithmetical calculations nor deduced from abstract principles. They come
from what, according to prevailing community values, the court sees as
appropriate to compensate a member of this community for the instant
injury: compare <A HREF="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high%5fct/104clr57.html?query=%22thatcher+v+charle%22"><I>Thatcher v Charles</I></A> 104 CLR 57 at 63; <A HREF="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high%5fct/138clr563.html?query=%22sharman+v+evan%22"><I>Sharman v Evans</I></A> 138
CLR 563 at 573, 590; <I>Jag Singh v Toong Fong Omnibus Co Ltd</I> [1964] 1 WLR
1382 at 1385.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 8
In  formulating such standards,  the court  can and, in my  opinion, should
take  into account the  fact that (if it  be so) the particular  verdict is
based on  fallacy rather than fact. If it did not  see it as its duty to do
so,  the court would  be abdicating an  important part of its  function. To
accept  a verdict  as proportionate  notwithstanding that  it was based  on
myth  or fallacy would,  in my opinion, be  wrong. To require the  court to
ignore that  it was so based would put the law  upon an unacceptable basis.

But this does not, in itself, dispose of the plaintiff's case. The
plaintiff's belief in the myth has produced, as the jury could accept, a
real psychiatric condition. Must the court, in determining what is
reasonable compensation for that condition, ignore the basis of it? I do
not think that it must.

It is  not the function of a dissenting judgment to pursue these matters in
detail. It  is sufficient to say that there are distinctions  to be made. A
psychiatric  condition may be  irrational or  be based on  imaginings. That
does not  disqualify it from compensation. But it does not exempt the basis
of  it  from  examination.  Some  conditions  have bases  which  cannot  be
disproved  or  dispelled. This  is not  that case.  The main  basis of  the
plaintiff's condition  is his belief that the shape and/or the  size of his
penis  will  prevent him  having intercourse  and  fathering children.  The
effect of  that, as the pyschiatrist said, "will be determined very much by
what happens  to him". He can have intercourse. When once  he does have it,
the fallacy  of that part of his belief will be  different. Whether he does
will,  as the psychiatrist  said, depend  on the "suitable female"  and her
reaction  to him. A condition  which depends on such  contingencies cannot,
in my opinion, warrant the present award.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 9
And,  although it is not  necessary to my conclusion, I would  add this. It
should  be recognized that the resources available  to provide compensation
for  injuries - whether the resources be those of  the individual wrongdoer
or,  through insurance, the community  - are not unlimited.  In determining
what,  for the purpose of general damages, is  reasonable or proportionate,
the  community may, and  the courts should,  say that a condition  so based
has a  lower priority in the distribution of those resources than one which
is more factually based.

In my opinion, the appeal should be upheld, with costs. The proceeding
should be returned to the Common Law Division for a further, albeit a
third, trial.

Judge 2

PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with McHugh JA.

Judge 3

McHUGH  JA: <B>St Margarets Hospital for Women</B> (the  hospital) appeals against
an award  by a jury of $275,000 damages on the ground that they were out of
all proportion  to the circumstances of the case. The jury consisted of two
men  and  two  women.  The  plaintiff's claim  arose  out  of a  negligent
circumcision  for which the hospital  was responsible. As a  result of that
negligence,  the plaintiff,  then six  days old, suffered  the loss of  the
head of  his penis. This is the second time that the defendant has appealed
to  this Court. The Court  has already set aside a verdict  for $500,000 on
the ground that it was excessive.

The  facts On 10  February 1966 a  circumcision operation was  performed on
the plaintiff.
Three days  after the operation he was found to have gangrene of the end of
his  penis. The head of  the penis was black. It no longer had  a meatus or
normal  opening. Urine  came out  of a  fistula or  hole in the  gangrenous
portion. As  there was a clear line between the dead tissue and the healthy
tissue  of  the  penis, the  dead  flesh  was allowed  to  "slough off".  A
catheter  was inserted to drain the urine from the  plaintiff's bladder. In
April  1966 an operation  was performed  which made a permanent  opening in
the  penile stump  to allow  the plaintiff  to pass  urine. He  is able  to
urinate  but, if  he does  so while  standing, the  urine sprays his  legs.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 2
The plaintiff has lost about one third of his penis. The artificial
"meatus" is adequate, but there is slight bending in the penile stump. The
cosmetic deformity of the penis cannot be improved by surgery. However,
further surgery can and is to be performed to correct a minor tethering of
the skin under the penis. The plaintiff is able to achieve an erection and
masturbates. He has not had sexual intercourse. Sexual penetration, if it
ever occurs, will be more difficult than for a normal male; his disability
will also cause a diminution in sexual pleasure. But he is able to father
children.

The  plaintiff's injury has occasioned  a number of social  and psychiatric
problems.  He is extremely embarrassed  about other persons knowing  of his
deformed penis.  Throughout his life he has gone to great  lengths to avoid
being  placed in situations where  others might see it. He  has never known
his  father and, consequently,  has not  been able to discuss  his problems
with him.
Nor has  he been able to bring himself to discuss  them with his brother or
sisters. Although  he has tried to discuss his problems with his mother, he
cannot  bring himself to  do so.  This causes him  distress. He is  shy and
introverted.  He seems to  have no  friends outside his family  although in
1984  he   began  to  do  voluntary  social  work  helping  underprivileged
children.  He wants  to marry  and have  a family  but he  has avoided  any
physical  contact  with females.  He is  socially isolated  and feels  that
there  is no way out  of his predicament. He feels  sexually frustrated. In
addition  he  is  frequently depressed.  He  has  had counselling  on  five
occasions  since 1982. The counselling sessions made him feel  better for a
time. However,  at the time of the second trial in  August 1985, he had had
no counselling  since February 1985. By August, the benefit of  it had been
lost.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                            BC8701368 at 3
Dr  Greenberg,  a  psychiatrist,  who  first  saw  the  plaintiff  in  1982
expressed the  opinion in that year that the personality development of the
plaintiff  had been markedly  distorted. Dr Greenberg thought  that without
treatment the  plaintiff would progressively develop a neurotic reaction of
severe  degree. He believed  at the  time, however, that  there was a  good
chance that  the plaintiff would make a "good adjustment" as  the result of
counselling  and if  he were  "fortunate enough to  meet a suitable  girl".
When Dr  Greenberg last saw the plaintiff in 1985 he  said that, because of
counselling,  the  plaintiff  was  less  anxious  and depressed  about  his
condition.  But  the doctor  was much  less  optimistic in  1985 about  the
plaintiff   making   a   long   term   adjustment.   Dr   Greenberg   said:
"I  think it  probable that  he will  continue to  avoid social  situations
which might  allow him to develop emotional relationships with the opposite
sex and  that in consequence he is potentially vulnerable to depressive and
anxiety  reactions  as  time goes  on  and  he becomes  progressively  more
frustrated emotionally and sexually."

The plaintiff  left school when he was fifteen years of age. At the time of
the  second trial he  was employed as  a steel fixer. Dr  Greenberg thought
that the  plaintiff had little life outside his job and that it had assumed
an importance  for him not normally to be found in a teenager. Dr Greenberg
said  that in  the future  the depressive and  anxiety state may  interfere
with    the   plaintiff's   work    orientation   and    application".   In
cross-examination  the doctor agreed that the plaintiff  had benefited from
counselling  and would continue to  do so. However, Dr  Greenberg also said
that there was no certainty of its outcome.

The  award was open to  the jury This Court  can only set aside  the jury's
verdict if  it was out of all proportion to the  circumstances of the case:
<A HREF="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high%5fct/132clr362.html?query=%22precision+plastic+pty+ltd+v+demir%22">Precision  Plastics Pty Ltd v  Demir</A> (1975) 132 CLR 362  at 369. Assessment
of damages  for the loss of the penis or a  part thereof is not unique. But
it  is  an injury  which rarely  comes before  a court  for assessment.  It
belongs to  a class of case where a court should hesitate to interfere with
a  jury's assessment of damages,  since the collective opinion  of the jury
at  the very least  is as likely to  reflect the community standard  as the
opinion  of a section  of the  community such as  the judiciary. While  the
correctness  of the verdict  depends on its reasonableness,  its components
admit of  a very wide range of opinion as to  what is the proper assessment
of the plaintiff's injury.

In  my  opinion  it was  reasonably  open  to the  jury  to  find that  the
plaintiff's   psychiatric  condition  would   deteriorate.  They   saw  the
plaintiff  in the  witness box.  They had  an opportunity,  denied to  this
Court,  of forming an  opinion about  the likelihood of the  plaintiff ever
establishing   a  relationship  with   a  female.  They  could   reach  the
conclusion,  based on their  knowledge of  people, their assessment  of the
plaintiff,  and  the evidence  of Dr  Greenberg, that  the plaintiff  would
never  overcome  the  psychological  harm  which  his  injury  has  caused.

The jury  could reasonably conclude that the psychological condition of the
plaintiff  would  deteriorate to  the point  where there  was a  reasonable
prospect  that  he  would withdraw  from  society  and find  difficulty  in
maintaining  employment. They had evidence that throughout his  life he had
withdrawn from  sporting and social activities whenever they had given rise
to  the possibility that  his "deformity"  might be discovered.  They could
think  that in  a society,  where sexuality  is the subject  of one of  its
dominant  discourses,  the plaintiff's  perception of  himself as  sexually
deformed  and inadequate would ultimately  force him to retreat  from most,
if  not all, forms of  social intercourse. His life  already contained much
evidence  that  he  could not  and  would  not be  able  to  cope with  the
pressures  of  adulthood. Moreover,  the  jury was  entitled  to take  into
account,  in  assessing the  plaintiff's future,  the  long and  continuing
obsession  of Western society  with physical  beauty and the  perfection of
the  human  figure. This  obsession has  long  been a  source  of pain  and
distress  to those persons,  like the plaintiff,  who do not measure  up to
the  ideal.  Of  course,  the  jury was  bound  to  take into  account  the
possibility  that the plaintiff would enter into a  loving and affectionate
relationship  which would  persuade him  that he had  no real problem.  But
equally  the jury  had also  to consider whether  a sarcastic or  unfeeling
remark  could  precipitate a  psychological crisis.  No  one could  predict
exactly  what the future  held for the  plaintiff. But on the  evidence the
jury was entitled to take a very pessimistic view.

It is  not to the point that the penile stump  of the plaintiff is adequate
for  its normal functions. Modern  sexologists may have punctured  the myth
that  sexual adequacy  depends upon  the size  of the  penis. But the  myth
persists.  It  could  hardly be  otherwise.  Throughout  human history  the
phallus  has  been  seen as  a  symbol of  power.  Its identification  with
virility,  power and male supremacy  has been an enduring theme  in the art
and  literature  of many  societies. An  idea,  so deeply  rooted in  human
consciousness,  is not easily eradicated.  The jury could conclude  that it
has so  affected the plaintiff's perception of himself that he believes and
will  always  believe that  he is  abnormal and  sexually inadequate.  They
could   infer  that  the  plaintiff  is  so  oppressed   by  his  perceived
abnormality  and  inadequacy that  his  capacity to  function  as a  useful
member  of society was seriously  threatened. Perhaps this was  the extreme
view  of the evidence.  Nonetheless, it was  a view reasonably open  to the
jury.

Accordingly, the jury could see the case, not as one concerned simply with
the loss of part of a penis which functioned adequately, but as one where
the injury had substantially destroyed the plaintiff's capacity to enjoy
life and threatened his capacity to earn his living.

Counsel  for  the hospital  contended that  the jury  could not  reasonably
award  more than  $30,000 for  loss of  earning capacity  and no more  than
$170,000 in  total for general damages. However, once it is conceded, as it
quite  properly was, that the  jury could award a substantial  sum for loss
of earning capacity.
I  do  not see  how a  limit  of $30,000  could  be imposed  on the  jury's
assessment.
The  plaintiff was aged  19 at  the time of  the second trial. He  had over
forty  five  years  of  working  life  ahead of  him.  If  his  psychiatric
condition deteriorated  markedly by the time he was aged 40, as I think the
jury  could  reasonably find,  it could  award a  sum for  loss of  earning
capacity much in excess of $30,000.

The  first jury  assessed the  plaintiff's damage  at $500,000. The  second
jury assessed  it at $275,000. No doubt the second award is high. But in my
opinion  it was within  the range of damages  which a jury, mindful  of its
duty, could award.

Order The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
