      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American common
      law holds that any individual has the right "to make an
      informed choice, if competent to do so, to accept or forgo
      medical treatment."<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Doctors
      must inform patients of the nature of the proposed treatment,
      possible alternative treatment procedures, and the nature and
      degree of risk and benefits involved in accepting or
      rejecting treatment. Additionally, courts hold that a surgeon
      who performs an operation without consent, independent of its
      result, may be guilty of a battery, or if a surgeon obtains
      an insufficiently informed consent, he may be guilty of
      negligence.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to
      accept or refuse treatment has been recognized under the
      common law right of self-determination and informed
      consent.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Further the state
      cannot compel an individual to submit to invasion of bodily
      integrity for the benefit of another person's health:<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>The common law has consistently held to a rule
          which provides that one human being is under no legal
          compulsion to give aid or take action to save another
          human being or to rescue ... For our law to <i>compel</i>
          defendant to submit to an intrusion of his body would
          change every concept and principle upon which our society
          is founded. To do so would defeat the sanctity of the
          individual, and would impose a rule which would know no
          limits, and one could not imagine where the line would be
          drawn.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> (emphasis
          added.)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As our law openly recognizes the individual's right of
      autonomy over her body, the frequent and often ill-justified
      use of the substituted judgment standard in cases involving
      those who have never been competent is particularly
      disturbing. Courts have frequently used the doctrine of
      substituted judgment to permit procedures which would not be
      permitted or consented to by a competent individual. In doing
      so, courts have violated the constitutional rights of
      incompetent patients in denying them the right to informed
      consent guaranteed, except in an emergency, in all
      jurisdictions in the United States.<sup><a

      464 F.2d 772</a>, cert. denied 409 U.S. 1064 (1972). Doctor
      failed to disclose a risk of serious disability inherent in
      laminectomy operation. Patient became paralyzed and sued
      doctor for negligent failure to disclose. <i>Id</i>. at 779.
      "[D]ue care normally demands that the physician warn the
      patient of any risks to his well-being which contemplated
      therapy may involve. The context in which the duty of
      risk-disclosure arises is invariably the occasion for
      decision as to whether a particular treatment procedure is to
      be undertaken." <i>Id</i>. 464 F.2d at 781.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two
      exceptions to the rule of a doctor's duty to disclose. "The
      first comes into play when the patient is unconscious or
      other wise incapable of consenting and harm from a failure to
      treat is imminent. and outweighs any harm threatened by the
      proposed treatment." <i>Id</i>. at 788. The second occurs in
      situations where disclosure may cause a patient to become so
      ill or distraught that she cannot make a rational decision.
      <i>Id</i>. at 789. "The physician's privilege to withhold
      information for therapeutic reasons must be carefully
      circumscribed, however, for otherwise it might devour the
      disclosure rule itself." <i>Id</i>.</small></p>
