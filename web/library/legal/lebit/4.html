        <p><a id="A" name="A"></a><i>A. Compelled Organ and Tissue
        Donation</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctrine of
      substituted judgment has been misinterpreted and misapplied
      in several situations. Courts have misused this doctrine in
      cases of compelled organ and tissue donation by minors and
      incompetents, compulsory sterilization of minors and
      incompetents, and removal and denial of life-sustaining
      treatment to minors and incompetents.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case which
      established precedent for applying the substituted judgment
      doctrine to situations involving incompetents and organ
      donation was the Kentucky decision in of <i>Strunk v.
      Strunk</i>.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> This Kentucky
      court asked the question:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>Does a court of equity have the power to permit
          a kidney to be removed from an incompetent ward of the
          state upon petition of his committee, who is also his
          mother, for the purpose of being transplanted into the
          body of his brother, who is dying of a fatal kidney
          disease?</span><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Tommy Strunk was twenty-eight years old and dying of
      kidney disease.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> His brother
      Jerry was twenty-seven years old and was committed to the a
      state hospital and school for the incompetent.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> His mental age was approximately six
      years.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Tommy's entire family
      was tested for possible tissue compatibility for a
      transplant, but only Jerry's tissue was found to be
      acceptable.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Kentucky
      court permitted the transplant in his situation and held that
      in the</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>peculiar circumstances of this case it would not
          only be beneficial to Tommy but also beneficial to Jerry
          because Jerry was greatly dependent upon Tommy,
          emotionally as well as psychologically, and that his
          well-being would be jeopardized more severely by the loss
          of his brother than by removal of a kidney.</span><sup><a
          href="#n29">29</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The court in this case based its decision on two key
      factors. The first was the "benefit" that would be bestowed
      upon Jerry by giving his kidney,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> and he second was what the court
      perceived to be the "minimal" degree of risk associated with
      the procedure.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> The court
      applied the substituted judgment doctrine based on these
      factors and held that, "[t]he right to act for the
      incompetent in all cases has become recognized in this
      country as the doctrine of substituted judgment and is broad
      enough not only to cover property but also to cover all
      matters touching on the well-being of the ward."<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This risk/benefit
      analysis has been criticized for being a utilitarian
      manipulation of the substituted judgment doctrine. In
      situations similar to Strunk, the benefit incurred by the
      incompetent can be vaguely and loosely construed, and there
      are no criteria or standards for determining what constitutes
      a benefit or how much benefit must be shown in each
      particular case.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> Additionally
      the substituted judgment doctrine mandates that the court do
      what the incompetent would do if he were competent to make a
      decision. In Strunk, the court based the substituted judgment
      clearly on its view of a benefit flowing to the incompetent.
      "Yet the presence of a benefit does not justify nonconsensual
      intrusions on competent persons. Rather the determinative
      factors appears to be consent or choice - persons may choose
      or consent to actions which bring them little or negative
      benefit."<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> The benefits
      standard articulated in Strunk assumes three things. First,
      that an individual will always do what is "beneficial" to her
      and second, that a possible psychological "benefit" may be
      enough to allow a medical procedure to be performed under the
      doctrine of substituted judgment. Finally, it assumes that
      any "benefit" is enough to permit a court to allow a guardian
      to substitute her judgment for that of an incompetent who has
      never been competent under the law to make a decision. If the
      incompetent's life under the substituted judgment doctrine is
      to be protected and respected, and the standard is to be
      correctly applied, the precedent articulated in <i>Strunk</i>
      is improper.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wisconsin
      Supreme Court recognized some of these inherent problems in
      <i>In re Guardianship of Pescinski</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> This court held:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>[a]n incompetent particularly should have his
          own interests protected. Certainly no advantage should be
          taken of him. In the absence of real consent on his part,
          and in a situation where no benefit to him has been
          established, we fail to find any authority for the county
          court, or this court, to approve this
          operation.</span><sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Here, the court recognized the principle of substituted
      judgment the same way the <i>Strunk</i> court did. By
      limiting the scope of <i>Strunk</i>'s benefit rule the court
      was able to reject its application is these
      circumstances.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dissent in
      the decision recognized the one reason for the courts
      judgment may have been its concern with the eugenic arguments
      reminiscent of Nazi Germany.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup>
      Further, the dissent articulated another misinterpretation of
      the substituted judgment doctrine. It first makes a proper
      analysis of the doctrine stating: " the court in effect does
      for the incompetent whit is is sure he would do himself if he
      had the power to act."<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> Then,
      however, the dissent makes an improper analysis of the goal
      of the substituted judgment doctrine writes, "[t]his approach
      gives the incompetent the benefit of the doubt, endows him
      with the finest qualities of his humanity, assumes the
      goodness of his nature instead of assuming the
      opposite.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> The assumptions by
      the dissent in <i>Pescinski</i> make the doctrine of
      substituted judgment an objective one bestowing the best
      qualities upon all incompetent persons instead of recognizing
      substituted judgment as a subjective doctrine, unique to each
      individual and his own beliefs and ideals.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of
      Appeals of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit, faced a similar
      situation in <i>In re Richardson</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup> In this case, however, the possible
      donor was a minor, Roy, who was mentally retarded. The father
      in this case wished to compel the mother to consent to the
      operation. Since the possible donor was a child, the court
      rejected the substituted judgment doctrine articulated in
      Strunk, and stated that under Louisiana law the goal of the
      decision was to "promote the ultimate best interest of a
      minor."<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup> Counsel for the
      plaintiff in this case argued that the transplant could be in
      Roy's best interest because the donee could take care of Roy
      after the death of his parents. The <i>Richardson</i> Court
      held: "[s]uch an event is not only highly speculative, but in
      view of all the facts, highly unlikely. We find that surgical
      intrusion and loss of a kidney clearly would be against Roy's
      best interest."<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here a court
      refused to accept the substituted judgment doctrine as proper
      in cases involving a retarded minor, and instead chose to
      apply the best interests standard. Unlike the Strunk court,
      the Richardson court refused to allow a potential care
      relationship to constitute a "benefit" that would be in the
      incompetent's best interest. The Richardson court recognized
      that removal of a kidney could rarely be in an incompetent
      patient's best interest.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> This
      court correctly refused to apply the substituted judgment
      doctrine, and also decided that benefit is not a proper
      element to be considered in making a substituted
      judgment.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concurrence
      in his case refused even to apply a best interests standard
      in this particular situation. Judge Gulotta wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>I am of the opinion that before the court might
          exercise its awesome authority in such an instance and
          before it considers the best interest of the child,
          certain requirements must be met. I am of the opinion
          that it must be clearly established that the surgical
          intrusion is urgent, that there are no reasonable
          alternatives, and that the contingencies are
          minimal.</span><sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      Here, a judge refused to apply the doctrine of substituted
      judgment or a best interests standard and held the decision
      to a high level review. Judge Gulotta recognized the
      compelling need to protect mentally retarded minors from
      bodily intrusions that may be detrimental to their health. 

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Connecticut
      court faced with a unique situation in the case of <i>Hart v.
      Brown</i>,<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> chose to apply the
      substituted judgment doctrine articulated in <i>Strunk</i>.
      Here, parents of identical twins who were seven years and ten
      months old petitioned the court to allow a kidney
      transplantation from one twin to the other. This case was
      particularly unusual because it involved an isograft
      donation, which is a "perfect match" and does not carry the
      risk of rejection involved in other kidney
      transplantation.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> The <i>Hart
      v. Brown</i> court wrote that "the surgical risk is no
      greater than the risk of the anesthesia..." and that "[t]he
      only real risk would be the trauma to the one remaining
      kidney, but testimony indicated that such trauma is extremely
      rare in civilian life."<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup> The
      <i>Hart</i> court then applied the benefits analysis set
      forth in <i>Strunk</i> and stated that there would be immense
      benefit to the donor in that the donor would be better off in
      a family that was happy than in a family that was distressed
      and that it would be a great loss to the donor if the donee
      were to die from her illness.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the court
      applied the benefits analysis in this case, it also
      recognized the uniqueness of an isograft transplant. Second,
      the court recognized that the donor was a minor who did not
      suffer from impaired mental capabilities.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup> Based on these facts, the court held
      that the natural parents of the children would be able to
      substitute their consent for that of their minor children
      after a close investigation of their motives.<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here it appears
      likely that the court approved the application of the
      substituted judgment doctrine as the parents' motives were
      likely to be pure since neither child was suffering from
      mental impairment.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis in
      this case was a risk/benefit one which weighed in favor of
      allowing the donation based on unique circumstances. The
      court recognized that the twins were extremely close and that
      the family life of the surviving twin would be greatly
      damaged by the death of her sister. Overall, the court
      applied a benefits analysis as it related to the healthy twin
      and how the operation would affect the balance of her life
      and development. It can be argued, therefore that this should
      have been called a best interests analysis and that after
      weighing the alternatives surgery was, in fact, in the
      healthy child's best interests, even if it may not be what
      she would have decided if competent. It is interesting to
      note that the court acknowledged that '[t]he donor has been
      informed of the operation and insofar as she may be capable
      of understanding she desires to donate her kidney so that her
      sister may return to her."<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here a court
      applied a new version of the doctrine of substituted
      judgment. It allowed a parent's judgment to be substituted
      for a minor's child's in the case of a compelled organ
      donation. This child had not yet developed the capacity to
      consent; yet understood that she did not want her sister to
      die. This decision was based on what the court and the
      parents believed the child would do if she were mature enough
      to fully understand the nature of the procedure. In essence,
      this is not a substituted judgment, but a combination of
      substituted judgment and best interests. A court allowed
      parents to substitute their judgment for that of their child,
      who could not consent, based on what they believed was in the
      child's best interests, and what they believed the child
      would decide if competent. Since the child had never been
      legally competent, however, this is <i>not</i> technically a
      substituted judgment.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This case most
      closely parallels the situation in <i>Curran v. Bosze</i>
      introduced at the beginning of this article.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> the primary differences are that the
      potential donors in <i>Curran</i> were substantially younger
      than the potential donor in <i>Hart</i>, and the potential
      success of the procedure was substantially lower in
      <i>Curran</i> than in <i>Hart</i>. <i>Curran</i> rejected the
      substituted judgment doctrine stating that there could be no
      clear and convincing evidence of the twin's intent at such a
      young age. (three and one half years.)<sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup> The <i>Hart</i> court, however,
      accepted the doctrine as permissible. It should also be
      recognized that the family unit was intact in the <i>Hart</i>
      case and both parents consented, while the parents were never
      married in <i>Curran</i> and the custodial parent disapproved
      of the procedure.<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> While one
      of the cases accepted the substituted judgment doctrine in a
      situation involving a minor and the other rejected it, these
      cases can be reconciled based on facts alone.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possibly the
      best way to put the <i>Hart</i> decision in context is to
      recognize it as a unique application of the substituted
      judgment doctrine in a unique situation. What actually
      occurred is a "substituted consent" based on the child's
      limited understanding of the procedure she would have to go
      through to save her sister, combined with what the court
      believed the child would want, and what the court believed
      was in the child's best interests. Overall, this is not a
      traditional application nor a theoretically correct
      application of the substituted judgment doctrine. Instead of
      viewing this case as a precedent, therefore, it should be
      viewed as an unusual application of the substituted judgment
      doctrine to an isolated set of facts and circumstances. While
      the results may seem "fair" and beneficial to all, this case
      cannot stand for the proposition that parents can always
      substitute their judgment for the judgment minor children in
      the case of compelled organ or tissue donation. <i>Curran v.
      Bosce</i> recognizes this and rejects this standard in a
      similar situation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
      several problems with the application of the substituted
      judgment doctrine in cases of compelled organ donation.
      Ordinarily, "when the mental or social condition of the
      patient or subject precludes legally effective consent to a
      personal intrusion... respect for persons usually entails
      prohibiting the intrusive activity."<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> Because children and the mentally
      impaired have never developed the capacity to consent under
      the law, courts have frequently used a convoluted version of
      the substituted judgment doctrine involving a "benefits"
      analysis. The problem with this standard, as illustrated in
      Strunk, is that a "benefit" can be construed as any
      psychological benefit to the incompetent, no matter how
      slight. It is almost bizarre to recognize that in cases such
      as <i>Strunk</i>, a court has held that the possible
      "psychological benefit" to an <i>institutionalized</i>
      individual of not losing a relative justifies a surgical
      invasion of the incompetent's body and removal of his organ.
      Even more disturbing is that often the parents of an
      incompetent, who are attempting to save a life of their
      "normal" child, are the individuals entrusted with making the
      substituted judgment for their incompetent child. While
      courts also appoint a guardian ad litem to aid in these
      decisions, it in the judgment of the parent or legal guardian
      that courts hold in the highest regard.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In analyzing
      the "benefit" construed upon an incompetent, courts
      frequently disregard the risks involved in organ
      donation:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>If the risks were trivial, a question of
          principle would still exist, but the chances of abuse
          would be lowered. To make a substituted judgment
          concerning an organ trans- plant, it is essential to be
          clear about the effect of the transplant on the donor,
          since a competent person similarly situated is likely to
          consider the consequences to himself. To an incompetent,
          who may be less able to understand the transplant
          procedures or to adapt to the unfamiliar surroundings in
          a hospital, the risks of an organ transplant may be even
          greater.</span><sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      While several courts have analyzed organ transplant cases
      based on the "minimal risks" involved in organ
      donation,<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> few courts have
      recognized that these risks may be magnified for the mentally
      incompetent. 

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authors have
      argued that, "[u]se of an institutionalized incompetent might
      inspire his attendants to devote special care and attention
      to him out of a sense of obligation or otherwise. Or, as a
      condition or natural result of the organ donation, it might
      be decided to assure the incompetent the best of medical care
      ..."<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> These types or arguments
      are at best speculative and attempt to justify what can only
      be viewed as invasions of the bodily integrity of
      incompetents to benefit others considered more valuable by
      our society.</p>

        <p><a id="B" name="B"></a><i>B. Compulsory
        Sterilization</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the
      doctrine of substituted judgment has been tragically
      misapplied in cases of compelled organ donation, it has also
      been misused in cases involving compulsory sterilization of
      incompetents. The best example of this misuse is found in the
      1978 case of <i>Stump v. Sparkman</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup> In this case, a circuit court judge
      permitted the sterilization of a fifteen year old girl upon
      petition of her mother. The mother stated that her somewhat
      retarded daughter had been associating with older men and
      that it would be in her best interests to undergo tubal
      ligation "to prevent `unfortunate circumstances' ..." in the
      future.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> The judge permitted
      the procedure and the daughter was told that she was to have
      her appendix removed. Two years later, she was married and
      found out the true state of her procedure when she attempted
      to become pregnant.<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> Although
      the key issue the Supreme Court examined in this case was
      whether the judge acted within his jurisdiction and was
      therefore immune from liability,<sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup> it is important to note that a judge
      accepted a mother's "substituted judgment" regarding
      sterilization, which was clearly without her daughter's
      consent. Deception was even used to lure the daughter into
      the medical procedure. This case is a clear demonstration
      that the judgment of an incompetent and that the substituted
      judgment of a parent may not always be in a child's best
      interest when the child is mentally retarded.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Wentzel
      v. Montgomery County Hospital, Inc.</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup> the Court of Appeals of Maryland
      wavered between application of the substituted judgment
      doctrine and a best interests standard. In this case the
      mother and grandmother of a 13 year old mentally incompetent
      female petitioned the court to permit sterilization because
      of her inability to understand and handle her own bodily
      functions.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup> Ultimately the
      court applied a best interests standard in this situation as
      the incompetent was a minor. The court cited <i>Strunk</i> as
      precedent and also cited <i>In Re Mary Moe</i><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> which held that a trial court should
      apply the substituted judgment doctrine to cases when it must
      determine whether to authorize sterilization.<sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup> The <i>Wentzel</i> court, which
      ultimately permitted the sterilization, seems uncertain as to
      which standard it actually applied. The dissent in this case,
      however, makes it clear that substituted judgment is the
      proper standard in this situation:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>Thus, under the doctrine of substituted
          judgment, in determining whether to authorize
          sterilization, the trial court must not be concerned
          solely with objective criteria of what is in the best
          interests of the incompetent minor, but rather must place
          primary emphasis upon the decision that would be made by
          the incompetent minor if he or she were competent. Only
          by so doing can the incompetent minor's personal
          fundamental rights be fully protected and, therefore, the
          incompetent minor's best interests be fully
          preserved.</span><sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This dissenting judge also assumes that the substituted
      judgment doctrine and the best interests standard can be
      equated with each other and that best interests are the
      ultimate result of substituted judgment.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two courts
      however have recognized the abuse of the substituted judgment
      doctrine in the cases of compulsory sterilization. In <i>In
      re A.W.</i>,<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> the Supreme
      Court of Colorado, sitting En Banc, refused to allow the
      sterilization of a 12 year old incompetent girl based on her
      parents' substituted judgment. This court held that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>Simply allowing the parents or guardians of the
          mentally retarded person to substituted their decision
          and consent to sterilization for that of the incompetent
          person is not an adequate solution to the problem.
          Consent by parents to the sterilization of their mentally
          retarded offspring has a history of abuse which indicates
          that parents, at least, in this limited context, cannot
          be presumed to have an identity of interest with their
          children.</span><sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      This court recognized that the inconvenience and difficulties
      associated with caring for an incompetent child may cause
      parents to make decisions that infringe upon their
      offspring's procreational rights.<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> 

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conflict
      of interest is also recognized in the case of
      <i>Conservatorship of Valerie N</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup> The California Court of Appeals held
      that there is "[a]n increasing awareness of conflicts which
      may exist between incompetent persons and those who are
      charged with their care."<sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup>
      This California court went on to state:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>[B]ecause many unknown and variable
          considerations are thus involved in a decision whether or
          not to undergo or impose sterilization, it is perceptibly
          necessary that the procedure be limited to persons who
          are able to give informed consent. The limitation
          protects the fundamental right of an incompetent person
          to bear children.</span><sup><a
          href="#n75">75</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      While several courts have recognized the varying motivations
      of parents and guardians in situations involving compulsory
      sterili- zation, few courts have recognized this problem in
      cases of organ donation. This distinction can easily be
      traced to a benefits analysis. In cases of organ donation,
      the person to be benefitted may receive life or health.
      Without this surgery, the donee may die or be subjected to a
      painful and difficult lifestyle. It is also argued that the
      donor may benefit psychologically. In situations involving
      sterilization, however, it is the guardians who are
      benefitted both physically, as they do not have to deal with
      the problems of menstru- ation and conception, and
      psychologically, as they do not have to worry about
      promiscuity. The detriment to the incompetent female,
      however, may arguably be too great as she loses her
      fundamental right to bear children. In situations where the
      benefit involves the life or health of a competent
      individual, such as cases of organ donation, as opposed to a
      guardian's peace of mind, as in sterilization cases, courts
      are more willing to apply the doctrine of substituted
      judgment and infringe upon the rights of an incompetent
      person.

        Life-sustaining Treatment</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The medical
      situation best designed for application of the substituted
      judgment doctrine is the decision to refuse or discontinue
      life-sustaining treatment. This is only true however, in
      situations where a patient was once competent. Frequently,
      this situation involves a person who has become incompetent
      through disease or accident but who has already developed a
      system of ideals and beliefs which can be applied in making a
      substituted judgment. Paradoxically, this has been the
      situation in which courts are most reluctant to apply the
      substituted judgment doctrine. The only Supreme Court
      decision involving the substituted judgment doctrine in this
      situation is <a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/497/261.html"><i>Cruzan v.
      Missouri Department of Health</i></a>.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> In <i>Cruzan</i>, the Supreme Court
      held that due process did not require a state to accept the
      substituted judgment of close family members without
      substantial proof that their views reflect those of the
      patient.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> Even though Nancy
      Cruzan had made general statements about her desire to
      discontinue her life if she were in a vegetative
      state,<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup> the Supreme Court did
      not find this to be sufficient evidence of her intent. The
      tenor of the Supreme Court's opinion also recognized that
      Nancy Cruzan's parents were people with the best possible
      motives and concerns.<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup>
      Additionally the Court wrote that "there is no automatic
      assurance that the view of close family members will
      necessarily be the same as the patient's would have been had
      she been confronted with the prospect of her situation while
      competent."<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of
      an incompetent sixty-seven year old male with an I.Q. of ten,
      however the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachussetts came to
      a dramatically different decision. In <i>Superintendent of
      Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n81">81</a></sup> a Superintendent of a state
      institution petitioned the court to make a decision regarding
      administration of chemotherapy treatments for a man suffering
      from acute myeloblastic monocytic leukemia. Ultimately, the
      court let this decision turn on a general right of all
      persons to refuse medical treatment and extended this right
      to include those who are incompetent.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> This court applied the substituted
      judgment doctrine, and distinguished this case from other
      right to die cases in stating:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>To make a worthwhile comparison, one would have
          to ask whether a majority of people would choose
          chemotherapy if they were told that something outside of
          their previous experience was going to be done to them,
          that this something would cause them pain and discomfort,
          that they would be removed to strange surroundings and
          possibly restrained for extended periods of time, and
          that the advantages of this course of action were
          measured by concepts of time and mortality beyond their
          ability to comprehend.</span><sup><a
          href="#n83">83</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      While this court found that most people in a similar
      situation to Mr. Saikewicz elect to undergo
      chemotherapy,<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup> this court held
      that the decision to withhold treatment from Mr. Saikewicz
      "was based on a regard for his actual interests and
      preferences. ..."<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup> This
      decision was based primarily on Mr. Saikewicz's inability to
      understand the treatment he would have to undergo.<sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup> While this court may actually have
      been making a decision that was in Mr. Saikewicz's best
      interests, the court's reasoning is twisted is such a manner
      as to allow this decision to be a substituted judgment.
      Technically, this court based its decision on what Mr.
      Saikewicz would have decided if competent. Theoretically,
      however, Mr. Saikewicz can never have made such a decision
      and therefore cannot have the doctrine of substituted
      judgment applied. While this case may arguably have been
      correctly decided, it could not have been decided applying
      the doctrine of substituted judgment. 

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Saikewicz,
      who had never been able to express any sort of opinion
      regarding chemotherapy treatments, was permitted to have his
      guardian's judgment substituted for his in this situation.
      Ms. Cruzan, who had expressed some opinions regarding her
      situation, was not permitted to have her parents' judgment
      substituted for hers. While <i>Cruzan</i> was decided after
      <i>Saikewicz</i>, the key distinguishing factor is that Mr.
      Saikewicz had never been competent while Ms. Cruzan had been.
      Additionally Missouri required a standard of clear and
      convincing evidence while Massachussetts did not. In a case
      where substituted judgment could not in theory be applied, a
      court chose to apply the doctrine. In a case where
      substituted judgment could reasonably have been applied,
      however, the Supreme Court refused to do so.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the
      <i>Cruzan</i> decision, several courts permitted the use of
      substituted judgment for removal of life-sustaining medical
      treatment from persons in an irreversible vegetative
      state.<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup> <i>Cruzan</i>,
      however, is not viewed as controlling precedent in all
      situations involving removal of life-sustaining treatment.
      The Supreme Court did not mandate that courts apply the
      standard of clear and convincing evidence required in the
      state of Missouri.<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup> Rather,
      <i>Cruzan</i> permitted the states to apply such a
      standard.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally,
      <i>Cruzan</i> does not serve as a precedent in cases such as
      Saikewicz. The <i>Cruzan</i> decision applies to persons once
      competent, who through accident or illness remain in a
      persistent vegetative state. <i>Saikewicz</i>, however,
      stands for the proposition that the court may apply the
      doctrine of substituted judgment to situations where a person
      who has never been competent under the law must decide
      whether to accept or reject life prolonging treatment. While
      the <i>Saikewicz</i> court presents its decision under the
      rubric of "the right to refuse medical treatment," this
      application is particularly dangerous in cases involving the
      mentally deficient. As medical costs increase and medical
      technology improves, the doctrine of substituted judgment may
      be applied in a utilitarian manner to deprive incompetents of
      medical care they may be entitled to. Although it has been
      argued that, "the substituted judgment doctrine is explicitly
      non-utilitarian, and makes no claim that the rights of
      incompetents may be overridden to advance the interests of
      others, where the rights of competents may not be similarly
      overridden,"<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> this is exactly
      what has been done in cases such as <i>Strunk</i> and
      <i>Saikewicz</i>. When the life of an incompetent become
      devalued to aid another or refuse a human being medical
      treatment, the substituted judgment doctrine has reached its
      most ominous appli- cation. It creates generic reasonable
      idiots who may be prone to giving their organs or their lives
      away.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup></p>

      proper test to apply, this court, and the <i>Wentzel</i>
      court confused this doctrine with the best interests
      standard: The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
      concluded that the trial court--a court of general equity
      jurisdiction--possessed inherent equitable power to grant a
      petition for sterilization, shown it to be in the best
      interest for the mentally incompetent ward. In so holding,
      the court said "that the [trial] court is to determine
      whether to authorize sterili- zation when requested by the
      parents or guardian by finding the incompetent would so
      choose if competent. <i>Id.</i><br />

      affirmed the decision of the trial court in holding that
      conservators were not entitled to have conservatee
      sterilized. The Supreme Court of California affirmed, holding
      that the California statute prohibiting sterilization of
      those under conservatorship "[d]eprives developmentally
      disabled persons of privacy and liberty interests...."

      that its judgment was without prejudice to a renewed petition
      to establish that sterilization was necessary to the
      conservatee's habilitation. <i>Id.</i> at 762. In assuming
      that those who are incompetent has a right to procreative
      choice the court may have made a drastic mistake in
      reasoning. As observed in Chief Justice Bird's
      dissent:</small> 

      <blockquote>
        <small>Today's holding will permit the state, through the
        legal fiction of substituted consent, to deprive many women
        permanently of the right to conceive and bear children. The
        majority can run roughshod over this fundamental
        constitutional right in a misguided attempt to guarantee a
        right of procreative choice for one they assume has never
        been capable of choice and never will be. Yet precisely
        because choice and consent are meaningless concepts when
        applied to such a person, the majority's invocation of the
        theory of procreative choice and the fiction of substituted
        consent cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.</small>

        <small>No doubt is engendered by anything in this record

        caring persons. If the state were required by the United
        States Constitution to repose a right of "substituted
        judgment" with anyone, the Cruzans would surely qualify.
        But we do not think the Due Process Clause requires the
        State to repose judgment on these matters with anyone but
        the patient herself. Close family members may have a strong
        feeling--a feeling not at all ignoble or unworthy, but not
        entirely disinterested, either--that they do not wish to
        witness the continuation of the life of a loved one which
        they regard as hopeless, meaningless, and even

      <sup>86</sup> <i>Id.</i> The two factors considered by the
      probate judge to weigh in favor of administering chemotherapy
      were: (1) the fact that most people elect chemotherapy and
      (2) the chance of a longer life. Both are appropriate
      indicators of what Saikewicz himself would have wanted,
      provided that due allowance is taken for this individuals
      present and future incompetency. We have already discussed
      the perspective this brings to the fact that most people
      choose to undergo chemotherapy. With regard to the second
      factor, the chance of a longer life carries the same weight
      for Saikewicz as for any other person, the value of life
      under the law having no relation to intelligence or social
      position. <i>Id.</i> at 431. It is ironic, therefore, that
      this court chose to permit this procedure after recognizing
      that the life of an incompetent has the same value as the
      life of a competent individual.<br />
