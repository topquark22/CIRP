      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicine and
      technology have advanced to a point where procedures that
      were never before possible are now routine and common. With
      further advancement, procedures we have not even contemplated
      may become commonplace. Cases such as <i>Curran v. Bosze</i>
      recognize the difficulty in applying present legal standards
      to situations and procedures that have been developed and are
      being developed. The doctrine of substituted judgment,
      developed in the 19th Century, is clearly not applicable in
      many of these new situations where minors and incompetents
      are involved. The law needs a new standard which allows
      certain procedures to be performed when truly equitable and
      necessary, but which prevents the abuse of those who cannot
      truly protect themselves. The standards which presently exist
      are not sufficient and permit the utilitarian use of minors
      and incompetents to benefit those who are competent. If this
      abuse is to be prevented, courts must recognize the fiction
      of the substituted judgment standard as it now being applied
      and adopt a new standard which protects the rights of
      incompetents and treats them as persons with value and
      dignity under the law.</p>
