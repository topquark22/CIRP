      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic
      problem courts have with the application of the substituted
      judgment doctrine in cases involving minors and the mentally
      incompetent is that is is frequently confused with the best
      interests standard. The best interests standard allows
      decisions to be made which promote a patient's best
      interests. This standard is usually applied in terms of
      beneficence and looks to consequences which will benefit a
      minor or incompetent.<sup><a href="#n91">91</a></sup>
      Alternatively, "[s]ubstituted judgment is an effort to make
      the decision the person would have made if competent. As we
      have seen time and time again, subjects and patient do not
      always make the decisions that others feel are in their best
      interests."<sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even leading
      authorities on medical ethics, however, have blurred the
      distinction between the two standards. According to Paul
      Applebaum, Charles Lidz and Alan Meisel;</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <span>All surrogate decisions makers are, in a general
          way, under a duty to act in the best interest of
          incompetent patients. The difficulty with the best
          interest standard is not in the statement of it but in
          giving content to it. The substituted judgment approach
          is, in fact, one way of doing so. That is a surrogate on
          the basis of instructions - written or oral, express or
          implied - is seeking to implement the patient's best
          interests <i>as the patient would have defined them</i>.
          Thus, the substituted judgment approach is merely one way
          in which the best interests standard is given
          content.</span><sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>D. Don Welch criticizes this argument in his article
      "Walking in Their Shoes: Paying Respect to Incompetent
      Patients." He writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <span>This statement is exactly wrong. Substituted
          judgment is not a way of giving content to the best
          interests standard. Rather, best interests is one item
          that should be taken into account when making a
          substituted judgment. The inverted relationship in which
          these authors place the two concepts reflects their
          failure to acknowledge the priority that autonomy should
          have over beneficence in their development of a theory of
          informed consent.</span><sup><a href="#n94">94</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the
      <i>Strunk</i> court reveals a confusion between the best
      interests standard and the substituted judgment doctrine when
      it places an emphasis on benefit.<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup> Theoretically, benefit should not be
      the key issue in a substituted judgment, but this is a key
      issue in a best interests standard.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other judges
      have made the same mistake when evaluating the substituted
      judgment doctrine in relation to the best interests standard.
      In <i>Wentzel v. Montgomery General Hospital, Inc.</i>, Judge
      Smith wrote, "Each approach has its own difficulties but use
      of the doctrine of substituted judgment promotes best the
      interests of the individual, no matter how difficult the task
      involved may be."<sup><a href="#n96">96</a></sup> This is
      precisely what a substituted judgment is not designed to do.
      Rather substituted judgment allows a patient to make
      decisions that may be contrary to her best interests, based
      on her personal preferences.<sup><a
      href="#n97">97</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A benefits test
      is frequently applied when equating best interests with
      substituted judgment. It is argued that respect for
      incompetents is preserved when making decisions in this
      manner because:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <span>A competent person will ordinarily satisfy his
          wants and preferences. To the extent that the benefits
          rule advances the incompetent's previously expressed
          preferences, or procures him more of the primary goods if
          his preferences are unknown, there is a firm basis for
          ascribing to him choices which yield a net
          benefit.</span><sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Here again, a presumption of best interests is
      intermingled with the doctrine of substituted judgment though
      this is theoretically incorrect.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the
      reasons for this confusion are the differing situations to
      which courts have applied substituted judgment. In cases
      involving removal of life-sustaining treatment from those
      which were competent but are presently in a vegetative state,
      courts have easily looked to a subjective standard which is
      based on the patients actual, expressed wishes and wants. In
      cases involving organ transplantation, sterilization, or
      refusal of life-sustaining treatment to minors or those who
      have never been competent, courts are confused as to what
      standard to apply. This may be because minors and
      incompetents are traditionally accorded the best interests
      standard in cases involving issue of informed consent.<sup><a
      href="#n99">99</a></sup> In an effort to allow procedures to
      be performed which courts view as beneficial to society
      rather than to the incompetent individual, judges have become
      uncomfortable with the best interest standard which is
      paternalistic in nature and benefits the incompetent.
      Therefore, courts have looked for another doctrine to apply
      and have found substituted judgment. The problem in applying
      this standard to those who have never been competent,
      however, is that the substituted judgment doctrine is not
      based on benefit, yet benefit cannot be overlooked in cases
      involving incompetents. Therefore courts have incorrectly
      applied the substituted judgment doctrine to cases involving
      minors and incompetents by combining this doctrine with a
      best interests beneficence analysis. This is wrong in theory
      and in practice and allows procedures to be performed on
      those typically accorded more protection under the law, which
      may never have been permitted had they been capable of
      consent. The result is to give the incompetent less
      protection than the competent thereby rendering nugatory the
      true purpose of the doctrine.</p>
