      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1816, Lord
      Eldon created the doctrine of substituted judgment to permit
      an incompetent person, Hinde, to grant an allowance to his
      near relative from the surplus of his estate.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> It has been argued that the creation
      of this doctrine was, in itself, a legal fiction and that
      Lord Eldon established it to allow the preservation of the
      law of property while achieving the desire to grant money to
      the lunatic's niece.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironically,
      while Lord Eldon's doctrine of substituted judgment purports
      to "act as the lunatic would have acted if of sound
      mind."<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Lord Eldon seemed to
      have made no effort to discover what had once been in Mr.
      Hinde's mind. The <i>Whitbread</i> decision does not mention
      any evidence of Mr. Hinde's prior spending practices or his
      propensity for making gifts."<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      Instead Lord Eldon looked to an objective point of view and
      found a "generic, reasonable lunatic - a generic reasonable
      lunatic giving his money away."<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While already
      on shaky ground in the 19th century, the doctrine found its
      way into American law and eventually into the area of
      informed consent in medical cases. It is here that the
      "fiction" of substituted judgment has reached its most
      dangerous incarnation.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>[M]any equity courts assumed that the authority
          to remove vital tissue, to withhold or withdraw
          life-support systems, to sterilize the incompetent, and
          to force psychotropic drugs on mental patients over their
          vocal dissent. Arguably some of these courses of medical
          treatment directly harmed the incompetent and directly or
          indirectly benefitted others."</span><sup><a
          href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, the
      doctrine of substituted judgment looks to the individual to
      determine what she would do in a particular situation if she
      were competent. This doctrine works well in situations where
      a person, once competent, is rendered incompetent to consent
      to medical procedures through injury or disease. The once
      competent person has developed a system of morals and
      beliefs, and patterns of behavior which the court can examine
      when evaluating what she would do in a particular
      situation.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The Supreme Court
      most recently articulated and accepted this standard in
      <i>Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of
      Health</i>.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> The Court,
      however, went on to hold that in cases involving a petition
      to terminate artificial hydration and nutrition of a patient,
      the states did not have to accept the substituted judgment of
      a family member absent clear and convincing evidence of the
      patient's wishes.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      interesting to note, that in a case where the doctrine of
      substituted judgment can be applied appropriately, the
      Supreme Court permits the requirement of clear and convincing
      evidence to assure that the wishes articulated are that of
      the patient and not of the family, no matter how well
      motivated the family's decision may be. The <i>Cruzan</i>
      decision illustrates the Supreme Court's acceptance of a
      stringent interpretation of this standard even in a situation
      where there is some evidence of a patient's desires. In
      theory, the substituted judgment doctrine should only be
      applied in cases like <i>Cruzan</i> where a person, once
      competent, has made some statements as to her beliefs
      regarding a particular situation and has developed a life
      which can be used as frame of reference to determine her
      wishes.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>In re
      A.C.</i>, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
      recognized that</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span>Most people do not foresee what calamities may
          befall them, much less do they consider, or even think
          about, treatment alternatives in varying situations. The
          court in a substituted judgment case, therefore, should
          pay special attention to the known values and goals of
          the incapacitated person and should strive, if possible,
          to extrapolate from those values and goals what the
          patient's decision would be.</span><sup><a
          href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This definition
      should set the outer limits of the substituted judgment
      doctrine: Looking to a particular individual's known value
      system to determine her decision in a particular situation.
      Instead, courts have tragically misapplied the doctrine of
      substituted judgment to achieve what judges believe to be
      "beneficial" decisions in cases where consent cannot be
      obtained. It is here that the doctrine of substituted
      judgment and the standard of best interests becomes confused.
      Substituted judgment is a subjective standard, and therefore
      can only apply to persons who have been competent at one
      time. The best interests standard, however, is to be applied
      to the minor or incompetent who has never been competent and
      is, therefore, entitled to more protection under the
      law.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>
