    <div class="corpus">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent
      years, courts have used, or attempted to use, the doctrine of
      substituted judgment to compel certain medical procedures
      upon incompetents or minors of tender years. The substituted
      judgment standard, as first articulated in the case of <i>Ex
      Parte Whitbread in re Hinde, a Lunatic</i>, holds that "the
      court will act with reference to the lunatic, and for his
      benefit, as it is probable that the lunatic himself would
      have acted had he been of sound mind."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This case involved a petition for
      funds to be drawn from the surplus estate of a lunatic to
      support his near relatives.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years
      the courts have extended this doctrine to encompass medical
      procedures where a person, incapable of consent, can donate
      organs or tissues to a family member in need, or refuse
      medical treatment under the rubric of a "substituted
      judgment."<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Courts have also
      applied this standard to cases where a parent or guardian
      wishes to sterilize a retarded minor or adult.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1990, an
      Illinois man attempted to have this doctrine applied to a
      situation involving young children and a relatively new
      medical procedure. In the case of <i>Curran v.
      Bosze</i>,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> a father wished to
      compel his illegitimate three and one half year old twins to
      submit to a bone marrow harvesting procedure so the cells
      could be transplanted into his son who was dying of leukemia.
      The father argued that under the doctrine of substituted
      judgment, the children would agree to the procedure if they
      were old enough to make an informed rational decision. The
      Illinois Supreme Court rejected this premise, holding that
      the future intentions of three and one half year olds could
      not be ascertained by a court of law or anybody else, and
      therefore a substituted judgment standard was inappropriate.
      While the court did not permit this procedure in this
      instance, the case raises interesting questions about the
      application of the substituted judgment doctrine as it
      relates to increasing advances in medical technology.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases,
      courts have incorrectly applied the doctrine of "substituted
      judgment" to violate the bodily integrity of a minor (who is
      usually physically or mentally disabled), or an adult
      incompetent, to bring about a result which on its face seems
      beneficial to all involved. What courts have failed to do
      however, is protect the best interests of these incompetent
      persons and to recognize their right to be protected,
      especially when they cannot consent, from non-therapeutic
      body invasions. In this context, "best interests" are
      determined by weighing the risks, needs and benefits to the
      affected person.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The type of
      "non-therapeutic" procedures to which courts typically apply
      substituted judgment are those which are of no physical
      benefit to the incompetent person, but which may benefit
      another person or the guardians of the incompetent
      individual.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctrine of
      substituted judgment was originally applied in terms of
      property issues, while the best interests standard was
      typically applied to situations involving health interests of
      minors and incompetents. Over time, however, courts have come
      to confuse the best interest standard with the substituted
      judgment doctrine in certain situations and apply the
      substituted judgment doctrine in cases in which it is not
      appropriate. This misinterpretation and confusion often
      endangers the life and health of minors and incompetents, and
      places them in positions where courts and families may take
      advantage of their legal disability. This article will
      discuss the doctrine of substituted judgment in reference to
      these issues and examine (1) the theory of the substituted
      judgment doctrine; (2) the doctrine of informed consent; (3)
      the misapplication of the doctrine of substituted judgment to
      medical decisions involving minors and incompetents; (4) the
      confusion between the best interests standard and the
      doctrine of substituted judgment; and propose a possible new
      standard to be used in cases involving minors or incompetents
      facing compelled medical procedures.</p>
