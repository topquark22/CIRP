      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to
      alleviate the confusion surrounding the application of the
      substituted judgment doctrine to cases involving minors and
      incompetents, a new standard must be developed to apply to
      these particular circumstances. This new standard would be
      applied in cases involving compelled medical procedures to be
      performed on minors and incompetents which are not life
      saving or life prolonging. This standard will cover
      situations similar to <i>Curran, Strunk</i> and
      <i>Wentzel</i>, but will not apply to cases such as
      <i>Saikewicz</i>, where the medical procedure is, in fact,
      life saving or life prolonging and perhaps a basic best
      interests standard should be applied. Nor will this standard
      apply to cases such as <i>Cruzan</i> where a person who was
      once competent has expressed beliefs and wishes and a
      substituted judgment may be ideal. This standard will not be
      applicable to cases involving fetal organ and tissue donation
      or anencephalatic babies. These issues are best left to
      another discussion as they involve the rights of the unborn
      and complicated issue of brain development and survival which
      are not addressed in this discussion. Rather, this standard
      would be implemented to protect the young and the incompetent
      from abuse, and to keep parents and courts from placing less
      value on the life of an incompetent.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new
      standard begins with the proposition that substituted
      judgment can never be used in cases involving minors and the
      mentally deficient. In theory and by definition, substituted
      judgment can only be applied in situations where persons have
      developed a system of judgment in addition to beliefs and
      ideals. This can never be true in cases of very young or
      permanently incompetent persons.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second
      element of this proposed standard involves a presumption that
      no compelled medical procedure is in a minor's or
      incompetent's best interests.<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> Although several cases merely
      brush over this fact, all surgery has inherent risks, and
      these risks may be magnified where a person is too young or
      unable to understand the procedure. Second, pain may be more
      difficult to detect and handle in cases of the young or
      mentally deficient as they may not be able to express and
      identify how they hurt.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this
      standard will be based on a presumption that no compelled
      procedure is in best interests, one can only rebut this
      presumption by clear and convincing evidence. In essence,
      this makes the standard a "higher scrutiny best interests
      standard." The proof required will be much more than an
      amorphous psychological benefit which may inure upon the
      minor or incompetent who may undergo the medical procedure.
      While psychological benefit may be real, there are different
      levels of "psychological benefit" and specific facts must be
      considered in each case. This may allow for certain cases of
      sterilization where it can be proven by several sources that
      it is in the incompetent's best interests, or other possible
      procedures not contemplated by this article which may even
      pass muster of a higher scrutiny best interests test.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although family
      may seem like the ultimate decision maker in cases such as
      the ones mentioned in this article, cases like Strunk have
      shown that parents may not always be disinterested parties.
      Parents sometimes look out for their own interests or the
      interests of others when determining the fate of their
      incompetent child or adult. Therefore, there must be more
      sources than just the family to turn to in cases such as
      these. Although courts already appoint guardians ad litem,
      deference is usually paid to parents or guardians in cases
      involving substituted judgment. Since it is clear that
      substituted judgment must not be applied in these cases, it
      follows that parent's or guardian's decisions should not be
      given greater weight than the decision of the guardian ad
      litem. Additionally, medical doctors and psychologists should
      have a great deal of input into these decisions, as should
      medical ethicists. The combination of the family, the legal
      community, the medical community and the philosophical
      community with a higher scrutiny level should best protect
      the interests of minors or incompetents in these situations.
      The strong presumption approach is still necessary in
      combination with several decision makers as these decisions
      must still be made based on benefit to the individual and not
      to "society" as a whole. The presumption approach eliminates
      room for abuse in these situations.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decisions
      involving organ and tissue donation frequently must be made
      quickly. Nevertheless, courts should not disregard the
      safeguards built into this proposed standard but must
      exercise them expeditiously. Priority should be given to
      these types of cases, and our medical or legal systems should
      cooperate in procuring the proper experts. Sometimes this may
      fail, but this failure should be viewed in the same way as we
      view our criminal justice system. The margin of error should
      be on the side of the incompetent just as it is on the side
      of the criminal defendant. With these safeguards in place,
      incompetents will not be treated as tissue and organ banks
      used to benefit those considered more valuable to
      society.</p>

      <sup>100</sup> Walter M. Weber, <i>Substituted Judgment
      Doctrine: A Critical Analysis</i>, I<font size="1">SSUES
      IN</font> L<font size="1">AW AND</font> M<font
      size="1">EDICINE</font> V<font size="1">OL</font>. 1 N<font
      size="1">UMBER</font> 2 131 (1985). Weber makes a similar
      proposal which he labels the "presumptions approach" which
      basically states that the incompetent individual is presumed
      to desire life. Id. at 154 Weber argues:</small></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>The incompetent patient, maintained by certain
        therapies, is presumed to desire life. To the extent that
        physicians and caregivers nevertheless proceed to `unplug'
        incompetents, this standard will act only to prevent the
        official devaluation of the lives of incompetents to
        dispose of their wards ... Thus, the presumptions approach
        may reduce the efficient allocation of resources. While
        this public goal may suffer, the social goal of upholding
        life gains. The presumptions approach would manifest the
        state's special solicitude for its weaker members and
        effectively proclaim the great respect held for all human
        life.</small>
      </blockquote>

      <p><small>Id. at 155. The standard proposed in this article,
      however, protects not only the sanctity of life of the
      incompetent, but her right to bodily integrity and her right
      to procreational autonomy.</small></p>
