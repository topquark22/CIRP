        <p class="abs"><i>Genital surgery is one of the most
        controversial and contested practices, yet it is frequently
        described and referred to with little or no attention to
        cultural and social context. This article examines the
        practice, performed on both men and women, and the extent
        to which it clashes with issues of consent and capacity, as
        well as multicultural concepts of toleration for minority
        group practices. It then questions why female genital
        surgery, unlike male genital surgery, is legally prohibited
        in Australia. It argues that such legal gender bias stems
        from a liberal conception of "tolerance" and the limits of
        consent in Australia, placing female genital surgery in an
        "unacceptable" category and male genital surgery in an
        "acceptable" category.</i></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text">The issue of genital surgery has sparked
      heated debate in Australia,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and
      while this article does not condone it or deny its
      deleterious effects, it does attempt to situate it in a
      cultural context. It is a practice performed on both men and
      women to different extents and far a variety of reasons:
      religious, cultural, political, sexual, and health-related.
      It is an act that is controversial for both the law and the
      medical establishment to deal with since it clashes, at
      times, with issues of consent and capacity as well as
      challenging the extent of multicultural concepts of
      toleration for minority group practices.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Most controversially, female genital
      surgery is legally prohibited yet male surgery is not -
      despite heavy criticism of the latter.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> This article argues that such legal
      gender bias stems from a liberal conception of "tolerance"
      and the limits of consent in Australia. Thus, female genital
      surgery is not viewed as an "acceptable" minority practice
      but male genital surgery is. This article reaches this
      conclusion by first examining the practice of female genital
      surgery and then assessing its legal ramifications in
      Australia. This is followed by a similar survey of male
      genital surgery and a final section which assesses the
      divergent status accorded to each in Australian law and
      society.</p>

      <p><b>Female genital surgery</b></p>
      <i>Definitional debates</i> 

      <p class="text">Female genital surgery is heavily
      criticized<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> and most commonly
      referred to as "female genital mutilation" (FGM). For
      example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) formerly
      referred to the practice as "female circumcision" but has
      changed this to "female genital mutilation" at its 1990 Addis
      Abeba Conference. The altered terminology was said to carry
      "heavier moral weight".<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      "Circumcision" may indeed be an inaccurate term. However, the
      label "female genital mutilation", as well as the discourse
      surrounding it, is also unsatisfactory for a number of
      reasons.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">First, it designates women who have undergone
      any form of genital surgery as "mutilated" - a term that some
      women would not use in their own self-perception:</p>

      <p class="quote">"When I seem myself, that area is neat and
      smooth. This is how it should be, not exposed and
      ugly."<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="init">To be branded as a "mutilated woman" and a
      "victim of mutilation" can be perceived as both insulting and
      embarrassing. It denies spheres of autonomy and power and
      tends to situate women only as subordinates.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Conversely, many women remember the
      ritual as an empowering "coming of age" and excitedly
      anticipate the ritual for their own daughters.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Though this is not to deny the agony
      it frequently entails, such as described by the Egyptian
      women's activist and doctor, Nawal El Saadawi,<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> such pain is often deeply repressed
      or turned into a means of strength and pride. Thus,
      frequently "it is not viewed by those participating in it as
      an ethical issue or an immoral act".<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> As an important submission to the
      Family Law Council of Australia explained:</p>

      <p class="quote">"These practices, however distasteful or
      unjust to a Western audience, are based on traditions on
      which women have built and created their whole meaning of
      life and identity, both as individuals and part of their
      society. For some of these women, their female strength and
      identity may partly come from the pain and difficulty which
      female genital mutilation causes, making them 'strong' and
      'desirable' women."<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Robertson's reseach on the Kikuku peoples of
      Kenya found exactly this.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      Genital surgery, varying from minor cuts to clitoridectomy,
      was central to female initiation. This initiation into adult
      life led to the reception of knowledge and wisdom from
      respected elders and entailed special treatment of girls
      during the initiation period. Girls entered into a realm of
      power separate from men and forged intense solidarity both as
      a group and also between the initiated girl and the female
      elder who "held her during the ceremony. Girls were imbued
      with a sense of "triumph" and "empowerment" that stayed with
      them for life. The practice gradually faded out among this
      particular group due to collective female labour action that
      envolved into new forms of women's groups, leading to a
      decline in initation ceremonies and associated genital
      surgery. Amongst the Chamus of Kenya the initiation process,
      involving clitoridectomy, is still practised as an integral
      part of contemporary Chamus culture. Kawai found that "[t]he
      ordeal is a source of invaluable pride to the girl. Elderly
      women still take pride in their brave attitude many years
      before."<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Secondly, without denying the adverse effects
      of female genital surgery, it is important to recognize that
      the term "mutilation" stem from a neo-colonial narrative that
      views genital surgery, and the people involved with it, as
      "barbaric and uncivilized". The following statements are apt
      in this regard:</p>

      <p class="quote">"[Female circumcision is a totally heinous
      thing. It is impossible to find a single instance in which
      such a <i>barbaric</i> procedure could be justified in a
      <i>civilized</i> society such as <i>ours</i>."<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="quote">"The <i>primitive</i> attitude to female
      circumcision rests not only on tradition, but also on the
      male desire for the female to be pure for him&hellip; That is
      not only the most cruel, but also &hellip; the most
      <i>primitive</i>, and the most important aspect of the matter
      we should reject."<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>
      This approach is not grounded in the lived experiences of
      many women, and although often benevolent, it creates an
      artificial and hierarcha division between "us" (Western,
      civilized) and "them" (primitive, barbaric). Such divisions
      do nothing to alter cultural tensions and misunderstandings
      and stifle useful and constructive cross-cultural dialogue.
      As Gunning pointed out:<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="quote">"[T]he 'us helping them' approach has
      created an enormous amount of bitterness in non-Western
      feminists for whom the attitude is chillingly reminiscent of
      colonialism."<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Thirdly, the "FGM" label does not do justice
      to the many varieties of genital surgery, that range from
      minor ritual acts to severe infibulations. "FGM" is a broad
      "cover all" that attempts to narrowly define and
      sensationalise the practice. In order to explain its
      complexity, the next section explains the varieties of female
      genital surgery.</p>
      <i>The practice</i> 

      <p class="text">Female genital surgery is practised
      predominantly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
      It is frequently linked to religion, though it predated
      Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and is also practised among
      some animist groups. Islam is the only religion that
      stipulates any limited grounding for the practice. According
      to Abu-Sahlieh, this comes from several sources including a
      hadith relating to a conversation between the Prophet
      Mohammed and an exciser, Um Habibah, after she emigrated with
      him to Medina. Upon asking her if she still continued the
      art, she replied that she did unless he forbade it. The
      Prophet said to her:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Cut slightly and do not over-do it
      [<i>ash-immi wala tanhaki</i>] because it is more pleasant
      for the woman and better [<i>ahab</i>] for the
      husband."<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>
      However, in terms of Islamic jurisprudence, this source (and
      several others also invoked) are of questionable authority
      and weight.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Most Muslims
      choose not to practise genital surgery and many who do so, do
      so incorrectly in the belief that it is written in the
      Qur'an. As illiteracy is prevalent in many regions where
      genital surgery is performed, neither men nor women have
      access the the Qur'an themselves. Female genital surgery is
      therefore a predominantly cultural practise - existing in
      areas where religion spread and was grafted onto old
      traditional practices. It is practised for multifarious
      reasons: to ensure cleanliness and hygiene, to control female
      sexual urges and prostitution, it indicate initation into
      adulthood, to express religious faith, to ensure virginity
      upon marriage, and to guarantee chastity in a husband's
      absence.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text">Four main categories of genital surgery
      exist:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>ritualized genital surgery is the least severe and can
        amount to as little as a symbolic act of cleaning the
        clitoris; at other times the clitoris is scraped or
        nicked.</li>

        <li>The second and intermediate form is commonly termed
        <i>sunna</i> (tradition) and involves the removal of the
        clitoral hood and at times the glands of the clitoris.</li>

        <li>The third is excision and usually involves removing the
        whole clitoris.</li>

        <li>The fourth and most severe is infibulation or
        "Pharonic" genital surgery. This involves removing all of
        the external female genitalia and sewing the remaining
        edges together with a small passage for menstruation and
        urination. As a practice in Africa, it is predominantly
        performed by a midwife in unsanitary conditions and with
        implements varying from knives to sharp rocks and glass.
        However, in some circumstances, as in Somalia and Egypt,
        health professionals have been known to perform the
        procedure in clinics.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text">The impact of female genital surgery has been
      increasingly documented. A recent Australian study of
      complications relating to genital surgery highlighted
      dyspareunia, apareunia, dysmenorrhoea, urinary tract and
      vaginal infections and labour difficulties.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> Other studies point to the possibly
      extensive psychological damages caused by the practice,
      though this is less than adequately documented. At the same
      time, whilst it can eliminate sexual feeling and pleasure
      (and make intercourse agonizing or impossible), other studies
      have shown that this is not uniform: "an unpredictable
      response from women who cannot, at least according to Western
      medical discourse, enjoy the act."<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> A study by Lightfoot-Klein of
      infibulated women in the Sudan found:</p>

      <p class="quote">"[C]lose to 90% of women (by their own
      report) were orgasmic, ranging from always to occasionally
      and from intense to mild. Many were able to give vivid and
      convincing descriptions of their orgasms and to credibibly
      ascribe frequency of occurrence."<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="init">A 1985 Egyptian study found that 25 per cent
      of infibulated women could still attain orgasm through
      stimulation of the clitoral area, as opposed to 50 per cent
      of women who had not had genital surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> The extent of sexual damage is
      therefore extremely difficult to assess and is widely
      debated.</p>

      <p class="text">The age of genital surgery varies from
      newborn girls (as with nomads in Sudan) to seven-year-old
      girls (Egypt) or to those prior to menstruation. In Tanzania
      and Kenya, clitoridectomies are performed amongst some groups
      on a woman's wedding night. Other groups such as the Ibo in
      Nigeria, perform surgery prior to marriage. Another Nigerian
      community, the Aboh, do the same before the birth of a
      woman's first child.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">All these variations - in geographical
      locations, reasons for the procedure - exemplify the global
      complexity of female surgery. Accordingly, we need to bear
      this in mind when examining the situation in Australia, since
      essentialising and stereotyping the procedure is common
      amongst health professionals, law-makers and society.</p>

      <p><b>Female genital surgery in Australia</b></p>

      <p class="text">Australia has a growing population of
      immigrants from areas that practise female genital
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> However, there are
      no data on the extent of the practice in Australia; nor on
      the number of girls taken overseas for the performance of the
      act. Likewise, there is only limited research on the topic in
      the Australian context.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup>
      However, several legal issues and initiatives exist in
      relation to both international and domestic law and it is
      therefore necessary to examine each in turn.</p>
      <i>International obligations</i> 

      <p class="text">International human rights norms remain
      centred on individual rights. As such, it is a controversial
      regime that fails to consider the more community-based nature
      of non-Western cultures, especially those in Africa, the
      Middle East, and Asia.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> Female
      genital surgery, though not usually specifically mentioned,
      appears to breach the various covenants of international
      organisations: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
      (1948);<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> the Convention on the
      Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
      (1979);<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> and the Declaration
      on Violence Against Women (1993).<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The issue of female genital surgery has also
      been raised in the context of the United Nations Convention
      relating to the Status of Refugees and refugee applications
      in Australia. In 1997 the Refugee Review Tribunal recognised
      the threat of of imminent genital surgery that a mother and
      her 18-month-old daughter faced in they were forced to return
      to Nigeria. The tribunal explained:</p>

      <p class="quote">"[T]he female circumcision feared by the
      Application is not an operation that is tailored to her
      personally in the way that an operation for the excision of a
      melanoma or the removal of a rotten tooth is directory at an
      individual for the amelioration of a particular problem.
      There is nothing about female circumcision which will be
      beneficial or medically desirable for either the Applicant or
      her daughter: indeed the opposite is true."<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

      <p class="init">As a result, the tribunal held that both
      mother and daughter were refugees and had a well-founded fear
      of persecution, that is, "female genital mutilation".<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> It appears that such applications
      may increase as awareness of the grounds for refugee
      applications are more widely circulated among regions
      practicing female genital surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>
      <i>Legislative issues</i> 

      <p class="text">Some Australian States and Territories have
      enacted amendments to existing legislation prohibiting
      "female genital mutilation", while others believe the
      existing Criminal Codes amply cover the issue.<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> In new South Wales the Crimes
      (Female Genital Mutilation) Amendment Act 1994 (NSW) was
      achieved after a long discussion process and recommendations
      by the Australian Family Law Council.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> Section 45 stipulates:</p>

      <p class="quote">"(1) A person who:<br />
       (a) excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or
      any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of
      another person; or<br />
       (b) aids, abets, counsels or procures a person to perform
      any of these acts on another person, is liable to
      imprisonment for seven years."</p>

      <p class="text">Section 45(5) as with other comparable Acts
      relating to FGM, makes it clear that consent is not a defence
      to the charge. Distinguished from "female genital mutilation"
      are surgical procedures deemed necessary or the health of a
      person; performed during or after labour; and sexual
      reassignment. Other States, such as South Australia,<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> Victoria<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> and the Australian Capital
      Territory,<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> also allow the
      court to make an order preventing a person from removing a
      child from the State; seizing the child's passport and
      subjecting her to "periodic examination" to ensure surgery
      has not taken place. Victoria enacted similar terminology, no
      doubt to prevent what happened in February 1994 when an
      action took place between a father and the Department of
      Health and Community Services in the Children's Court of
      Victoria. The Department was seeking care and protection
      orders against the father due to physical abuse. The activist
      group, Women Lawyers Against Female Genital Mutilation, was
      granted friend of the court (amicus curiae) status in this
      matter and obtained evidence that the abuse included
      fibulation of both girls. However, because infibulation took
      place outside Australia, the court was unable to make an
      order specifically addressing this abuse.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The discussion processes that led to the
      implementation of the legislation in each State and Territory
      are marred by the fact that some vital opinions were omitted
      due to linguistic and institutional barriers. Many women
      originating from regions that perform genital surgery are not
      accustomed to discussing this issue in public or indeed in
      English, and some faced the additional trauma of arriving as
      refugees.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> One informant, when
      discussing the issue of making written submissions or
      discussing genital surgery for the sake of possibly enacting
      legislation, had this to say:</p>

      <p class="quote">"I would never discuss this issue in public,
      it is not right to talk about it like that. It is a personal
      matter, for our women."<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Some informants originated from states with
      repressive political institutions where it is unacceptable to
      discuss family and personal issues for fear of government
      reprisal. Female genital surgery has been banned by certain
      regimes, and therefore is interpreted as part of repressive
      imperialism. British colonial rule in the Sudan, for example,
      enacted ineffective prohibition of all forms of female
      genital surgery in 1946. The result was not only anticolonial
      rumblings under the leadership of Mahmoud Mohammed Taha but
      an increased urgency and reduced age for the infibulation of
      girls.<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> Some of these feelings
      persist in Australia; an attitude of "'we' will 'civilise'
      you because we know and live the truth".<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> Thus the Ecumenical Migration Centre
      argued that legislation was not appropriate for addressing
      the dilemma of female genital surgery in Australia, since it
      makes "affected women feel rejected and self-conscious - as
      if they had a disease".<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Despite these reservations, the legislation
      has been enacted but commentators emphasise that it "alone is
      insufficient. It should be accompanied by appropriate
      community-based action."<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> Such
      action is well underway in parts of Australia, but many
      activists are critical of the legislation:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Does it mean a white woman can have her
      labia trimmed for cosmetic reasons but a Somalian Australian
      woman cannot because that would be female genital
      mutilation?"<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></p>
      This leads to the conundrum of the legislation making the
      issue a racial one. It is often assumed, if a woman is of
      African descent or, indeed, Muslim, that she is
      circumcised:<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text">"[M]any [Western] women's studies students
      may know nothing more about African women and assumed that
      all or most African women are genitally mutilated."<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">In turn, as Mmaskepe Sejoe explained, health
      professionals often assume that circumcised women must be a
      mindless vessel to be used and abused".<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> It is for this reason that many
      circumcised women can find the racism they experience in
      relation to their condition worse than the problem itself.
      Some therefore avoid doctors and health practitioners for
      fear of ridicule and embarrassment.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Additionally, such legislation means that a
      mother, grandmother and community "exciser" (those normally
      involved in female genital surgery) would face imprisionment.
      A girl, already injured due to the procedure, would therefore
      face the public uproar surrounding such a case and lose here
      most vital (female ) support network. In short, the
      legislation suggests "that women who permit the operation are
      incompetent and abusive mothers who in some ways, do not love
      their children".<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>
      <i>Common law: Capacity and consent</i> 

      <p class="text">Even in the absence of legislation in, for
      example, Western Australia, Queenland, Tasmania and the
      Northern Territory, certain directives would need to be
      examined. Consent is the most central concept since "all
      medical treatment is preceded by the patient's choice to
      undergo it".<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> Without consent,
      even the "least touching" (such as medical treatment) amounts
      to the tort of battery. Consent may be implied<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> or express (verbally or through a
      consent form), but a person must have the requisite age and
      intelligence in order to consent to battery.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text"><i>Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area
      Health Service Authority</i><sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup>
      held that the rights of parents decline as a child grows
      older and more competent. More crucially, Secretary,
      Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and
      SMB<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> held that children, even
      if intellectually disabled have the right to provide real and
      informed consent to medical procedures. However, if the child
      is incompetent and the medical treatment is non-therapeutic,
      then approval must be sought from the Family Court of
      Australia or the Supreme Court.<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> Conversely, if the child cannot give
      consent, but the procedure is in the best interests of the
      child,<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> parental consent is
      sufficient to negate actions pertaining to assault and
      battery.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> However, the
      majority in Marion's Case identified clitoridectomy as an
      example of a medical treatment that is prohibited by law
      irrespective of parental consent.<sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">These basic tenets raise significant problems
      when we analyse their impact in relation to female genital
      surgery. If parents consent to genital surgery. And take the
      child to a registered medical practitioner, how does the law
      address this? First, the Australian Medical Association has
      explicitly stated that any medical practitioner found to have
      performed the procedure would be deregistered. Secondly, it
      would appear, that is, the surgery is not, on face value, in
      the best interests of the child and is of no therapeutic
      benefit; and it seems certain that the Family Court or
      Supreme Court would not grant an approval for the procedure.
      However, the cultural significance of genital surgery is that
      it is a rite of passage into adulthood and in most societies
      where it is practiced, women cannot marry if they are not
      circumcised. A girl who is not circumcised may be ostracized
      in her community in Australia and not accepted in her country
      of origin if she visits or returns to live, or indeed, marry.
      What, therefore is in the "best" interest of the child, and
      by what standards are we to judge what is "best"? Regardless,
      of these problematic moral and cultural questions, in
      Australia the "best interests of the child are most certainly
      judged in light of Western liberal traditions. Thus,
      individual bodily integrity overrides cultural considerations
      of what a girl's "best interest" may be. Thus, parents cannot
      consent to their daughter's genital surgery and nether could
      a doctor perform such a procedure. Despite the cultural
      tension this creates, the author agrees with this approach
      and feels that the legislation, despite its faults, is also
      right to protect minors from genital surgery.</p>

      <p class="text">However, a significant issue arise when
      differentiating between a minor and an adult. If a
      sound-minded adult woman (for example), prior to or, indeed,
      after marriage) voluntarily wants to be circumcised, perhaps
      in the less intrusive <i>sunna</i> form, where does she stand
      in respect to the law? Consent is fulfilled, so therefore, as
      Mackay discussed, "there must be some important difference
      between female circumcision and other forms of surgical
      operations"<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> to differentiate
      it from , for example, cosmetic surgery, sexual realignment
      or male circumcision. How is a woman's choice to have her
      clitoral hood removed (<i>sunna</i>) different from a woman's
      choice to have breast implant surgery or labia trimming?
      Consent to all three forms of surgery derives from social
      conceptions of how a woman's body should appear; and all are
      "unnecessary" surgery that causes significant pain and
      scarring. <i>Sunna</i> genital surgery, breast surgery and
      labia trimming have associated risk. Breast surgery (such as
      enlargement, reduction, nipple alteration) can reduce overall
      breast and nipple sensitivity and lead to lowered self image
      and sexual fulfilment. Similarly, labia trimming has been
      known to have associated complications and can leave women
      feeling physically unsatisfied with the outcome of the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> Therefore as
      Parekh argued:</p>

      <p class="quote">"[I]t is difficult to see in the name of
      what right we may tell an adult woman in full possession of
      her senses that here uncoerced demand for clitoridectomy is
      unacceptable."<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <p class="init">As Marion's Case highlights, the choices of a
      sound-minded adult should "be respected and accepted,
      irrespective of what other, including doctors, may think is
      in the best interest of a particular person."<sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">However, others would argue that a person
      cannot consent to such an act, and that although women may
      voluntarily wish to undergo the practice, they are unaware of
      the "deleterious complications" resulting from genital
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> Or they may be
      coerced by community or familial pressure. However, if a
      woman is acting voluntarily and is aware of the complications
      and risks involved, how do we differentiate genital surgery
      from, say cosmetic surgery, tattooing or body
      piercing?<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup> Indeed, it falls
      into issues surrounding the limits of consent, especially
      with regard to acts seen as "perverse". The decision of the
      House Lords in <i>R v Brown</i><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> indicated that consent can be a
      defence to certain potentially criminal acts such as surgery,
      male circumcision, tattooing, ear piercing and boxing. The
      case then considered consensual sado-masochistic activity in
      light of this and held by a three-to-two majority that
      participants could not consent to this form of harm. It
      appears, therefore, that the House of Lords found such
      behaviour "intolerable as a matter of public
      morality".<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> Female genital
      surgery in adult women would be likely to fall into this
      category - though it is yet to be challenged in the
      Australian courts. This is discriminatory and prejudicial and
      demonstrates that consent, as a concept, is determined not
      only by culture but, indeed, as we shall now discuss, by
      gender.</p>

      <p><b>Male genital surgery</b></p>

      <p class="text">Male genital surgery has been practised in
      Australia as both a religious ritual of the Jewish and Muslim
      communities and to promote male health. Muslim communities
      view circumcision as compulsory for males, closely linking it
      to both purity and cleanliness for prayer.<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup> Male Jewish infants are circumcised
      seven days after birth, though this is not universally
      practised and has been questioned by some Jewish
      scholars.<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Although it is not prohibited in Australia,
      the Australian Medical Association does not encourage the
      practice, and a great deal of medical opinion openly opposes
      it.<sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup> Complications can include
      damage to the shaft and urethra, amputation, urethral
      fistulas, infection, haemorrhage, misshapen appearances, loss
      of sexual stimulation,<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>
      problems with mother-child bonding, and extremely rarely,
      death. In light of such possible outcomes and the fact that
      there is no medical benefit, Brigman argued that male genital
      surgery should be included in the definition of child
      abuse.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> Despite this, an
      estimated 25 per cent of infant boys are circumcised in
      Australia at present,<sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup> and
      neo-natal circumcision is covered by Medicare.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> Unlike female genital mutilation,
      there is no prohibition on male genital surgery in minors or
      adults and some commentators continue actively to encourage
      it.<sup><a href="#n76">76</a></sup>.</p>
      <i>Issues of consent</i> 

      <p class="text">Again, as with the genital surgery of girls,
      consent is also at issue with infant males. In Marion's Case,
      the majority excluded female clitoridectomy from the ambit of
      parental consent for religious and hygienic reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup> Within this discourse, we need to
      understand that parental consent must be informed consent or
      a medical practitioner may be liable in negligence.<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup> Thus parents must be informed of the
      risks associated with male genital surgery; otherwise, as
      with <i>St Margeret's Hospital of Women (Sydney) v
      McKibbin</i>,<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup> an infant may
      be found to have been negligently circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">Again, as with female genital surgery, issues
      of well-being, such as emotional, moral and spiritual health,
      are considered to be within the scope of a child's
      welfare.<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup> As Haberfield
      explained: "a Jewish or Muslim son who is not circumcised may
      feel psychologically and spiritually alienated from his
      culture and his religion."<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup> It
      appears that, in the case of infant male circumcision, these
      more spiritual and cultural considerations trump issues of
      infant bodily integrity and inability to consent.</p>

      <p class="text">Since a child cannot be consulted and the
      process is painful and unnecessary at birth, such decisions
      should only be made by an adult male. As with adult female
      surgery, an adult male in full possession of his senses
      should be able to voluntarily elect to be circumcised. This
      may make sense if a man, as an adolescent or as he develops
      sexually, experiences some form of sexual dysfunction or
      discomfort due to his foreskin; or indeed, has a
      psychological desire to be circumcised. In such case,
      circumcision would be a medical remedy or option.</p>

      <p><b>Male and Female genital surgery: Why the
      differences?</b></p>

      <p class="text">The common distinction between the two
      practices is based on the degree of risk and harm
      involved.<sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup> However, the sunna
      type of female genital surgery is broadly equated with male
      genital surgery by a number of commentators.<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup> If this is so, how can this form of
      female genital surgery be prohibited for all women yet male
      genital surgery remain legally sanctioned for all men? As
      Richards argued:</p>

      <p class="quote">"[I]t is illogical that male circumcision
      has not been considered with [female genital mutilation]
      prohibition. Surgical cutting and disfiguring of a healthy
      genital organ is consistent with male and female circumcision
      &hellip; the differences appear to be based largely on
      socially constructed ideals, and not on facts, it is
      suggested there should be no distinction based purely on
      gender."<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup></p>

      <p class="init">Hayter, in the context of female genital
      surgery in the United Kingdom, asked the following:</p>

      <p class="quote">"[W]hat justification is required before
      minority groups should be legally compelled to discontinue
      practices which are fundamental to their culture[?]"<sup><a
      href="#n85">85</a></sup></p>

      <p class="init">In Australia the answer to the question
      appears to lie in the dominant societal conception of what
      minority practices are "acceptable" and "unacceptable". Male
      genital surgery was prevalent in Australia (and other Western
      liberal countries) for a great length of time as it is not
      viewed as "barbaric" and "savage" in the same way that female
      genital surgery is. It is perceived as far more easy to
      accommodate into Western liberal tradition. Female genital
      surgery has only a very minor role in the Western liberal
      tradition - clitoridectomies were at one stage performed on
      "hysterical" and "over-sexed women",<sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup> However, it was never routine and
      uniform in the way male genital surgery was. There is also a
      strong religious connection with male circumcision, and
      freedom of religion is a central constitutional tenet. This
      is significant in the conceptualisations of male and female
      genital surgery, as Povenmire argued: "[e]thnocentric
      distinctions between the 'barbaric' practice of FGM, and the
      'meaningful' practice of Jewish circumcision, facilitated
      this distinction."<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">There is also less desire to control the male
      body in the way the female body is monitored and regulated by
      the state. Thus, on one hand, female genital surgery is
      frequently seen as a method for the monitoring of
      "irresponsible" female sexuality.<sup><a
      href="#n88">88</a></sup> On the other hand, the debate,
      legislation and uproar over female genital surgery in
      Australia is also about controlling the female body. As one
      informant observed:</p>

      <p class="quote">"I feel confused by the attitude here, I was
      not circumcised at home due to the war [between Eritrea and
      Ethiopia], and when I came here I started hearing about how
      it [female genital surgery] is a terrible and savage
      practice. That women have no control over their bodies or
      sexuality. Now that I am older, I would like to be
      circumcised before I marry, but I can't because it is
      illegal. Does this mean I cannot chose either way? It is my
      body."<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

      <p class="text">This article does not condone female genital
      surgery; rather it interrogates the discourse that condemns
      it in Australia. As such, it seriously questions the way in
      which the current legislation prohibiting female genital
      surgery was constructed and its possible effectiveness in
      eliminating the practice. This is especially true in respect
      of adult women who are prohibited to consent to such surgery
      by the legislation. By contrast, an adult male can consent to
      male genital surgery for any reason he chooses. More
      importantly, parents can consent to genital surgery for their
      infant son, leaving serious questions unanswered. How can the
      rights of a child with relation to genital surgery remain
      gender-based? The only answer is that it persists for the
      same reason that the rights of an adult to consent to genital
      surgery remain gender-based: that is, certain minority
      practices are tolerated as acceptable within the rubric of
      dominant liberal values in Australia and others are not. The
      law simply reflects this dominant cultural blueprint to the
      detriment of alternative minority rights and opinions.
      However, a more prolonged impact on infants is that among
      communities practicing male and female genital surgery, the
      two are elided as acceptable and, in an unintended way, the
      current Australian legislation encourages this: "Female
      circumcision will never stop as long as male circumcision is
      going on. How do you convince an African father to leave his
      daughter uncircumcised as long as you let him do it to his
      son?"<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Changes are required to educate against both
      male and female infant genital surgery whilst also amending
      the existing legislation in order to permit adult consent to
      such procedures. This both protects children and allows
      freedom of minority practices when a person is old enough to
      voluntarily and freely decide for himself or herself. In the
      long term, it may even lead to the eradication of the
      practice altogether.</p>
