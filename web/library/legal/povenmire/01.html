      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no
      interest so vital and personal to the individual as that of
      controlling one's own body. This interest is a fundamental
      precept of the common law<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and
      an essential element of the right to privacy protected under
      the United States Constitution.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      The right to bodily integrity is also a "sacred"<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and "fundamental"<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> right which derives its compelling
      indepensibility from the instinctual desire for
      self-preservation common to all sentient beings.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The desire to protect oneself is
      papably present in an infant from the moment it emerges from
      the womb.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      routine infant circumcision of males in the United States
      consists of surgically amputating healthy male tissue.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> In the overwhelming majority of cases,
      this procedure is performed at the parents' discretion,
      without any compelling medical or religious purpose.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> This article argues that routine
      infant circumcision implicates important constitutional
      rights which should supercede parental discretion, and that
      parental authorization for this procedure is legally
      insufficient to constitute effective consent.</p>

      <p class="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
      female infants, the right to the integrity of the genital
      organs is protected against surgical "mutilation"<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> by federal law<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> and United Nations
      resolutions.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Under the law,
      the right of bodily integrity is deemed so fundamental that
      it displaces any consideration of the parents' cultural or
      religious beliefs.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      Unfortunately, no similar recognition has been extended to
      male infants in the United States. The failure of the law to
      provide equal protection to males can find no "exceedingly
      persuasive"<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> justification,
      and is therefore unconstitutional.</p>

      <p class="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part
      II of this article reviews the historical background of
      routine infant circumcision in the United States and surveys
      the positions of various medical associations and medical
      researchers concerning the practice of male circumcision.
      Part III reviews the legal prerequisites for obtaining an
      effective consent to surgery, including circumcision. Part IV
      analyzes the <i>parens patrie</i><sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> power of the state to intervene in
      parental decisions affecting minor children, while drawing
      parallels between circumcision and cases involving
      sterilization and amputation. Part V discusses the recently
      passed Criminalization of Female Genital Mutilation Act,
      emphasizes the inability of parents to consent to genital
      surgery on minor females under the Act, and exposes the Act's
      vulnerability to Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection
      Challenges under the United States Constitution. Part VI
      concludes that a change in society attitudes is necessary in
      order to extend to males the same protection from intrusive
      amputation of genital tissue currently provided to females
      under the Criminalization of Female Circumcision Act.</p>

      9. The term "female genital mutilation" has been the subject
      of considerable controversy. Some scholars argue for the use
      of the term "female genital surgery" in an effort to be more
      objectively descriptive and culturally neutral. <i>See</i>
      Hope Lewis, <i>Between Irua and "Female Genital Mutilation":
      Feminist Human Rights Discourse and the Cultural Divide</i>,
      8 H<font size="-2">ARV</font>. H<font size="-2">UM</font>.
      R<font size="-2">TS</font>. J. 1, 7 (1995) (nothing that
      there are objections to the word "mutilation" because it has
      a negative connotation and elicits a misunderstanding of its
      purpose). Most authors have dispensed with the term "female
      circumcision" on the premise that the surgical procedures
      gathered under the term are more abhorent than male
      "circumcision." <i>Id.</i> at 6.<br />
