      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of
      the judiciary to intervene in decisions affecting the minors
      is contained in the equitable authority of the court known as
      <i>parens patriae</i>.<sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup> In
      many cases involving the medical decision making and minors,
      the state asks the court to exercise its <i>parens
      patriae</i> power to compel action over parental
      objections.<sup><a href="#n144">144</a></sup> These
      objections often implicate constitutionally protected rights
      of the parent.<sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> The court's
      <i>parens patriae</i> power is weakest in such situations
      because the state is advocating intervention, and so
      typically the state has the burden to show by clear and
      convincing evidence that intervention is necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n146">146</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessity
      for the intervention must outweigh the interests of the
      parents in their exercise of parental discretion, as well as
      the interest of the minor in preserving bodily
      integrity.<sup><a href="#n147">147</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <p><i>A. The Power of the State to Prohibit Medical
        Intervention Over Parental<br />
        Discretion</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases of
      proposed sterilization of incompetents are the most common
      circumstance in which parental discretion to consent to
      medical treatment is challenged by the state.<sup><a
      href="#n148">148</a></sup> In a surprisingly large body of
      case law, courts have struggled to balance the interests of
      the minors, (including adult incompetents), parents, and the
      state, in proposed sterilization.<sup><a
      href="#n149">149</a></sup> The court's <i>parens patriae</i>
      power is relatively strong in such situations, because the
      court is safeguarding both the interests of the state in
      ensuring the health of minors, as well as the right of minors
      in preserving bodily integrity.<sup><a
      href="#n150">150</a></sup> Also the proponents of
      sterilization typically have the burden of establishing that
      the proposed intervention is either necessary, or at least in
      the minor's best interest.<sup><a
      href="#n151">151</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The similarity
      between the sterilization of incompetents and infant
      circumcision goes beyond the mere fact that both involve
      surgery on the genitals.<sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup>
      Incompetents of whatever age are treated by the law as
      minors, and the court's parens patriae power applies equally
      to both.<sup><a href="#n153">153</a></sup> Both sterilization
      and circumcision violate the personal integrity of the
      minor.<sup><a href="#n154">154</a></sup> While sterilization
      implicates powerful personal privacy interests in procreative
      choice which circumcision does not,<sup><a
      href="#n155">155</a></sup> circumcision does involve the
      radical alteration of a males's most sensitive and private
      body part which is surely a protected privacy
      interest.<sup><a href="#n156">156</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extent to
      which parental discretion is subordinated to the interests of
      the minor and the state is immediately apparent in the
      sterilization cases. In many of the cases, parents are not
      deemed to have the ability to consent to sterilization on
      behalf of incompetents without specific statutory
      authority.<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup> Other courts
      claim the equitable power to confer upon parents the ability
      to consent to sterilization in the absence of express
      statutory authority. Other courts claim the equitable power
      to confer among parents the ability to consent to
      sterilization in the absence of express statutory authority.
      The parents must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence
      that the procedure is medically necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n158">158</a></sup> In some cases, the courts merely
      require a showing that the procedure is in the minor's best
      interest.<sup><a href="#n159">159</a></sup> A number of
      courts have pointed to procedural safeguards in state laws
      that protect minors from inappropriately authorized
      sterilization.<sup><a href="#n160">160</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <p><i>B. Determining the Best Interest of the Minor</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a court to
      utilize its equity power to authorize sterilization of an
      incompetent, it must invoke the doctrine of substituted
      judgment.<sup><a href="#n161">161</a></sup> Many medical
      contexts have adopted this doctrine<sup><a
      href="#n162">162</a></sup> which requires the court to
      determine what the incompetent person would have decided if
      he or she were capable of making an informed decision on the
      matter.<sup><a href="#n163">163</a></sup> The substituted
      judgment doctrine reflects the fundamental right of
      individuals to exercise control over their own bodies.<sup><a
      href="#n164">164</a></sup> Because people are presumed to act
      in their own best interest, the best interest test has become
      a convenient shorthand for substituted judgment.<sup><a
      href="#n165">165</a></sup> The distinction is sometimes
      important, however, when the medical "best interest"
      conflicts with emotional or other "best interest," and the
      court is left to decide what the minor might have
      done.<sup><a href="#n166">166</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substituted
      judgment is also a helpful tool to remind a court that the
      "best interests" at stake are those of the minor rather than
      the State or the parents. In some cases, the incompetents
      parents will be best able to determine what he would have
      wanted, drawing upon knowledge gained from close association
      over time.<sup><a href="#n167">167</a></sup> The court should
      be alert to situations, however where the parents are likely
      to substitute their wishes for those of the incompetent.
      Circumcision typically occurs within days of birth, and
      hence, there is little likelihood that the parents will be
      better able than the court to determine what the minor "would
      have chosen."<sup><a href="#n168">168</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we now
      know that the infant experiences excruciating pain at the
      time of the circumcision, has obviously no idea what is
      happening or why, and must be restrained from struggling to
      escape, it is fair to conclude that the infant undergoing
      circumcision does not want the procedure performed.<sup><a
      href="#n169">169</a></sup> Leaving the child uncircumcised,
      in most cases, involves no health risk to the infant, avoids
      the potential complications from the procedure,<sup><a
      href="#n170">170</a></sup> avoids the possibility of making
      an irreversible error of substituted judgment, and does not
      foreclose the possibility that the infant might consent to
      the procedure upon reaching maturity.<sup><a
      href="#n171">171</a></sup> On the other hand, attempting to
      determine what the infant would have chosen had he been
      mature is practically an attempt at clairvoyance. For these
      reasons, the most prudent course under these circumstances
      would be to postpone authorization for the procedure until
      the individual is able to choose for himself. Parents wishing
      to invoke the substituted judgment doctrine, should be
      required to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence
      that the procedure is one the infant "would have
      chosen."<sup><a href="#n172">172</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best
      interest standard, often employed by courts in conjunction
      with or in approximation of the substituted judgment doctrine
      is usually assessed on the basis of medical or emotional
      "benefit."<sup><a href="#n173">173</a></sup></p>

      <p><i>1. Medical Benefits</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A finding that
      a proposed procedure is medically necessary to avoid a
      serious risk of death for a minor will almost always result
      in the procedure going forward despite parental
      objections.<sup><a href="#n174">174</a></sup> There is an
      important state interest in protecting the health of minors,
      as well as a judicial presumption that the minor would choose
      to go on living.<sup><a href="#n175">175</a></sup> In those
      cases the Court will not overrule parental objections to
      necessary treatment if a balancing of the risks indicate that
      a minor's best interests might not be served by going forward
      with the operation.<sup><a href="#n176">176</a></sup> In the
      case of amputation, the courts have generally required a life
      and death situation before allowing parents to authorize the
      procedure on behalf of minor children.<sup><a
      href="#n177">177</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amputation
      of the male foreskin in the United States is unique in
      medical practice for not requiring any medical justification,
      and for the widely accepted view that the amputation may be
      authorized at the sole discretion of a parent.<sup><a
      href="#n178">178</a></sup> This attitude is completely at
      odds with legal and medical practice regarding other forms of
      amputation and must be challenged.<sup><a
      href="#n179">179</a></sup> It is time to consider a judicial
      presumption that a minor would choose not to have a normal
      healthy piece of his body removed. It is also time to limit
      the ability of parents to authorize circumcision to the
      highly exceptional case where the procedure is medically
      necessary. This is especially appropriate in view of the fact
      that the option of removing the foreskin is not foreclosed to
      the minor upon reaching legal maturity.<sup><a
      href="#n180">180</a></sup></p>

      <p><i>2. Emotional Benefits</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation
      of the substituted judgment doctrine is most clearly evident
      in those cases that consider the sensory, emotional or
      psychological impact of a proposed procedure upon the minor.
      In one case, a procedure deemed necessary was not authorized
      by the court due to the anticipated pain of the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n181">181</a></sup> In a number of
      cases involving altruistic donation of organs or blood,
      usually to save the life of close family members, the courts
      have reasoned that the emotional benefits to the minor
      justified the procedure.<sup><a href="#n182">182</a></sup>
      The express preferences of the minor may be given
      consideration by a court, not as an effective choice
      regarding the treatment, but as an indicator of the
      psychological and emotional benefit to the child.<sup><a
      href="#n183">183</a></sup> In the case of circumcision,
      emotional considerations clearly weigh in favor of avoiding
      the procedure. The procedure is traumatic and painful, and
      may disrupt nursing and bonding with the mother.<sup><a
      href="#n184">184</a></sup></p>

      sterilization cases sometimes involve guardians in lieu of
      parents' the responsibilities of guardians toward their wards
      are treated almost identically by the courts as birth parents

      sacredness of the parent/child relationship does not extend
      to the guardian/ward relationship. There is no discernable

      benefit which have been applied in various court cases.
      <i>Id</i>. at 3-5. Lebit proposes a best interest test for
      minors and congenitally impaired mental incompetents combined
      with a judicial presumption favoring the preservation of
      bodily integrity and a clear and convincing standard of
      review. <i>Id</i>. at 11. Lebit's construction of the
      substituted judgment doctrine disqualifies it for use upon
      those for whom the doctrine was first formulated and for
      those for whom it has historically been applied, namely
      mental incompetents. <i>Id</i>. For purposes of this article,
      the ambiguities between the substituted judgment doctrine and
      the best interest standard may be left in place.
