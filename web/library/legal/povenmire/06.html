      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently,
      parents may consent to circumcision because the procedure is
      viewed as relatively trivial, with either a marginal benefit
      to the child, or at least with a negligible adverse impact.
      The medical and legal communities have heretofore viewed
      circumcision as falling well within the purview of parental
      discretion. Circumcision has not been viewed by the public as
      the amputation of an organ implicating constitutionally
      protected privacy rights of the child, even though a child's
      privacy right is widely recognized in the case of
      sterilization and under federal law for female children.
      However a fundamental shift in public perception and
      attitudes regarding circumcision is required.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the
      substituted judgment standard of judicial review employed in
      other cases of proposed amputation on minors, including
      sterilization, would probably eliminate the routine practice
      of infant circumcision. It is highly unlikely that anyone
      would be able to convince a court by clear and convincing
      evidence that the procedure is medically necessary, is in the
      minor's best interest, or is one in which the patient would
      choose if competent to make a choice. The perspective of the
      minor required under the substituted judgment rule would
      constrain the court from granting too much consideration to
      parental discretion.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arguments
      presented in this article for subordinating parental
      discretion in medical decisions affecting their children to
      the right of the infant to bodily integrity would not prevent
      parents from granting authority for medical treatment that is
      either necessary or demonstrably in the minor's best
      interest. Where medical consensus and parental consent are
      aligned on a course of treatment, the application of the
      substituted judgment rule is likely to yield concurring
      results. Legislative solutions could be found to deal with
      routine medical situations such as the extraction of a tooth
      for orthodontic purposes.<sup><a href="#n246">246</a></sup>
      In certain types of irretrievable decisions, such as
      circumcision and other discretionary amputations, judicial
      review may be warranted in every case.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively,
      the federal government and the states could enact legislation
      to prohibit routine male circumcision while leaving parental
      discretion in other areas intact. For example, child abuse
      laws in many states do not prohibit spanking, corporal
      punishment or discipline, but do prohibit permanent physical
      injury to children.<sup><a href="#n247">247</a></sup> A
      better approach, however is to amend the Anti-FGM act to
      include protection against circumcision. The authority of
      Congress to enact such a law under the commerce clause is not
      in serious doubt, and is predicated on the exact same
      arguments propounded in innumerable legal commentaries
      dealing with FGM.<sup><a href="#n248">248</a></sup></p>

      legislative solutions are already widespread. In Maine, for
      example, parents may consent to the piercing of a child's ear
      but not to a tattoo. <i>See</i> M<font size="-2">E</font>.
