      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right of
      the infant to bodily integrity, the state's interest in
      protecting the infant from unnecessary genital surgery, and
      the ineffectiveness of parental consent to such surgery are
      the fundamental concepts supported by this article. These
      concepts, far from being radical, have already been
      incorporated into federal law with respect to females.<sup><a
      href="#n185">185</a></sup> In particular, parents in the
      United States may not consent to the circumcision, excision,
      or infibulation of their infant daughters unless the
      operation is medically necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n186">186</a></sup> What remains to be done, and what
      must be done to preserve intellectual and constitutional
      integrity, is to recognize the same rights for infant
      males.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike male
      circumcision, the practice of female genital mutilation
      ("FGM") is deemed barbaric by western cultures. The United
      Nations, with the support of the United States and European
      nations, passed a resolution condemning the practice in
      1980.<sup><a href="#n187">187</a></sup> In 1996, Congress
      passed the Criminalization of Female Genital Mutililation Act
      [hereinafter "The Anti-FGM act"],<sup><a
      href="#n188">188</a></sup> which made it a crime for a doctor
      to circumcise, excise, or infibulate, &ldquo;the whole or
      part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of
      another person who has not attained the age of 18
      years.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n189">189</a></sup> In its
      findings, Congress determined that FGM &ldquo;infringes upon
      the guarantees of rights secured by Federal and State Law,
      both statutory and constitutional,&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n190">190</a></sup> and determined that
      &ldquo;Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of
      article I, the necessary and proper clause, section 5 of the
      Fourteen Amendment, as well as under the treaty clause, to
      the constitution to enact such legislation.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n191">191</a></sup> Significantly, the findings also
      include the dubious assertion that FGM &ldquo;can be
      prohibited without abridging the exercise of any rights
      guaranteed by under the First Amendment to the
      Constitution&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n192">192</a></sup> Most significantly, in applying
      the law, &ldquo;no account shall be taken of the effect on
      the person on whom the operation is to be performed of any
      belief on the part of that person, or any other person, that
      the operation is required as a matter of custom or
      ritual.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n193">193</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This act thus
      vitiates the authority of anyone, including the parents or
      the patient, to consent to the genital mutilation of
      non-adult females. The &ldquo;guarantees of rights&rdquo; are
      deemed so fundamental that the exercise of cultural or
      religious convictions requiring female genital
      mutilation<sup><a href="#n194">194</a></sup> are simply
      excluded from consideration under the act. The act is fatally
      flawed, however, because it provides protection to females
      and not males. The supposed distinctions between FGM and male
      circumcision, offered as justification for this unequal
      treatment, are not exceedingly, persuasive, and therefore
      contravene constitutional guarantees of equal
      protection.<sup><a href="#n195">195</a></sup></p>

        <p><a name="s5a" id="s5a"></a><i>A. Comparing Female
        Genital Mutilation and Male Circumcision</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgical
      alteration of female genitalia is practiced primarily in
      North Africa, where an estimated 110 million women are
      affected by the practice.<sup><a href="#n196">196</a></sup>
      Many Muslims believe that the tenets of their faith require
      surgery, although this is contested by Islamic
      scholars.<sup><a href="#n197">197</a></sup> The surgery takes
      different forms, ranging from the removal of the clitoral
      prepuce to the removal of the entire clitoris and portions of
      the vaginal opening.<sup><a href="#n198">198</a></sup> The
      surgery often occurs under unsanitary conditions, without
      anesthetic, and is extremely painful.<sup><a
      href="#n199">199</a></sup> In the United States, the practice
      is rare or non-existent.<sup><a
      href="#n200">200</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparison,
      male circumcision is often practiced in Africa.<sup><a
      href="#n201">201</a></sup> Nelson Mandela, for example, was
      circumcised as a young man in a tribal rite of passage, which
      involved the removal of the foreskin with the point of a
      spear.<sup><a href="#n202">202</a></sup> The operation, often
      conducted under unsanitary conditions and without anesthetic,
      is extremely painful.<sup><a href="#n203">203</a></sup>
      Scientists have identified the use of the same instruments
      for a series of circumcisions as creating a significant risk
      for the spread of AIDS.<sup><a href="#n204">204</a></sup>
      Indeed, the excruciating pain of the operation is one of the
      essential elements of the ritual. This passage into manhood
      results in dozens of boys dying each year in South Africa
      alone, and hundreds more being maimed for life.<sup><a
      href="#n205">205</a></sup> Figures on the number of men
      circumcised in Africa do not appear to be available, however,
      perhaps due to a lack of interest or a lack of cooperation
      from South African officials.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cultures
      practice more severe forms of circumcision. The Australian
      and New Guinea aborigines slit the underside of the penis
      lengthwise from the tip of the penis to the base, conferring
      on the penis an unusual flattened aspect.<sup><a
      href="#n206">206</a></sup> The Hottentot tribe of Africa
      practices partial castration, removing one testicle.<sup><a
      href="#n207">207</a></sup> The Ysidi tribe in Yemen strip the
      skin from the navel to the anus.<sup><a
      href="#n208">208</a></sup> The Masai and Kikiuyu tribes of
      Africa practice partial circumcision, allowing the lower part
      of the foreskin to be remain attached in a &ldquo;bib&rdquo;
      of atrophied flesh.<sup><a href="#n209">209</a></sup>
      Numerous cultures practice the gashing or perforation of the
      penis without removal of the prepuce.<sup><a
      href="#n210">210</a></sup> The former Yugoslavia recently
      reported the use of circumcision as a form of torture.<sup><a
      href="#n211">211</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereever
      genital surgery is practiced, whether in Africa or in the
      United States, the proponents of the surgery offer similar
      justifications. These justifications include religious
      tenets, bodily hygiene, reduction of sexual urges, cosmetic
      reasons, and long-standing cultural practice.<sup><a
      href="#n212">212</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sponsors of
      the Anti-FGM Act repeatedly distinguish FGM from male
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n213">213</a></sup> In order to
      avoid politically costly resistance by Jewish groups seeking
      to preserve the practice of circumcision for infant Jewish
      males, proponents of the Anti-FGM Act placed emphasis upon
      the supposed distinctions.<sup><a href="#n214">214</a></sup>
      Ethnocentric distinctions between the barbaric practice of
      FGM, and the &ldquo;meaningful practice&rdquo; of Jewish
      circumcision, facilitated this distinction.<sup><a
      href="#n215">215</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed many
      people in the United States, particularly those of religious
      faiths, believe that the practice of circumcision is
      constitutionally protected from regulation because of its
      association with religious practices.<sup><a
      href="#n216">216</a></sup> In <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/000/95-2074.html">City of
      Boerne v. Flores</a></i>, the Supreme Court held, however,
      that &ldquo;neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied
      to religious practices.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n217">217</a></sup> It is no longer necessary to
      demonstrate a compelling government interest in order to
      uphold the constitutionality of such laws,<sup><a
      href="#n218">218</a></sup> although such an interest is
      present in the case of circumcision. Jewish and Muslim
      circumcisions constitute only a small fraction of the total
      practice of circumcision in the United States, and is a
      practice that is now being questioned in by Jews in
      America<sup><a href="#n219">219</a></sup> and in
      Israel.<sup><a href="#n220">220</a></sup> The inclusion of
      male infants in the Anti-FGM Act would render it neutral and
      generally applicable,<sup><a href="#n221">221</a></sup> would
      further a compelling state interest in the protection of the
      health and constitutional rights of minors, and would not
      single out Jews or Muslims for unequal treatment under the
      law.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anti-FGM
      literature, including legal commentary, echoes the assertion
      of a supposed distinction between circumcision and
      FGM.<sup><a href="#n222">222</a></sup> This position is often
      linked to a feminist or a blatantly misandrist
      sentiment.<sup><a href="#n223">223</a></sup> The distinction
      is typically asserted on the basis of the common embryonic
      origin of the clitoris and the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n224">224</a></sup> The removal of the clitoris,
      according to this argument, is equivalent to the removal of
      the penis.<sup><a href="#n225">225</a></sup> This assertion
      ignores the obvious differences in the development of these
      organs, and the resulting difference is size, function, and
      morphology.<sup><a href="#n226">226</a></sup> The purpose of
      the comparison is to make circumcision appear insignificant,
      and therefore, unworthy of serious consideration. By doing
      so, however, these writers and congressional representatives
      have abetted the perpetuation of circumcision in the United
      States, and have done a great harm to millions of United
      States men.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing of
      lasting value is to be gained in an argument over which is
      worse, circumcision or FGM. Even conceding that certain forms
      of FGM are more horrific than circumcision as practiced in
      the United State, this does not diminish the rights of males
      relative to females. Surely no one would suggest that the
      mildest forms of FGM should be legalized because they are not
      as horrific as circumcision. They are both violation of an
      individual's rights.</p>

        <p><a name="s5b" id="s5b"></a><i>B. An Equal Protection
        Challenge</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fourteenth
      Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees
      &ldquo;equal protection of the laws.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n227">227</a></sup> Historically, gender based
      classifications in the law worked to the disadvantage of
      women,<sup><a href="#n228">228</a></sup> and required only
      the merest &ldquo;basis in reason&rdquo; to pass
      constitutional muster.<sup><a href="#n229">229</a></sup>
      Beginning in 1971, however, such laws have been successfully
      challenged for failure to afford equal protection.<sup><a
      href="#n230">230</a></sup> There is now a strong presumption
      that gender classifications, whether favoring men or women or
      invalid.<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup> The justification
      for such gender classifications must be &ldquo;exceedingly
      persuasive,&rdquo; and the burden of demonstrating such a
      justification rests solely upon the State.<sup><a
      href="#n232">232</a></sup> The gender classification must
      serve &ldquo;important governmental objectives,&rdquo; and
      must be &ldquo;substantially related to the achievement of
      those objectives.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n233">233</a></sup>
      The justification &ldquo;must not rely upon overbroad
      generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or
      preferences of males and females.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n234">234</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Faustian
      bargain struck by the framers of the Anti-FGM Act is now
      coming due as people come to understand the hypocrisy of
      current attitudes toward circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n235">235</a></sup> The gender based classification
      under the Anti-FGM Act of the right to bodily integrity and
      protection from unnecessary genital surgery can find no
      &ldquo;exceedingly persuasive&rdquo; justification. No
      important governmental objective can be furthered by denying
      infant males the same claim to these fundamental rights as
      infant females. Overbroad distinctions between &ldquo;genital
      mutilation&rdquo; and &ldquo;circumcision&rdquo; cannot
      obscure the unconstitutional and discriminatory effect of the
      Anti-FGM Act.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A challenge to
      the constitutionality of the Anti-FGM Act is practically
      certain the first time an attempt is made to enforce it. A
      challenge to the Anti-FGM Act in this posture presents
      obvious difficulties for those working to abolish routine
      infant circumcision in the United States, because nobody
      wishes to facilitate the practice of unnecessary genital
      surgery on females. Nevertheless, patients' rights advocates
      could justifiable support such a challenge because a ruling
      approving the constitutionality of the act would deal a
      serious blow to the rights of infant males, who are
      overwhelmingly the victims of genital surgery in the United
      States.<sup><a href="#n236">236</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The District
      Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit recently turned back
      an attempt to challenge a prohibition of FGM on equal
      protection grounds.<sup><a href="#n237">237</a></sup> In that
      case, three plaintiffs challenged a North Dakota law<sup><a
      href="#n238">238</a></sup> modeled on the federal Anti-FGM
      Act as unconstitutional for lack of equal protection for
      males and females.<sup><a href="#n239">239</a></sup> The
      court affirmed the lower court's ruling that two of the
      plaintiffs lacked standing because &ldquo;they have no
      personal stake in the outcome of this case, one way or the
      other.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n240">240</a></sup> The court
      also denied standing to the third plaintiff, a mother whose
      son had been circumcised at the father's request, but without
      her consent, on the theory that whatever injury the son had
      sustained was in the past, and no remedy could be ordered by
      the court to change it.<sup><a href="#n241">241</a></sup> The
      court noted that no claim had been made for damages, which it
      opined in any case would be barred by the Eleventh
      Amendment.<sup><a href="#n242">242</a></sup> Although an
      appeal to the Supreme Court is promised,<sup><a
      href="#n243">243</a></sup> the standing issues affirmed by
      the Eighth Circuit will be difficult to overcome even under
      the expanded standing doctrine enunciated by the Supreme
      Court in recent cases.<sup><a href="#n244">244</a></sup> A
      plaintiff search program is now underway by patients' rights
      groups in an effort to bring forward a test of the Anti-FGM
      Act unfettered by the standing issues plaguing the North
      Dakota case.<sup><a href="#n245">245</a></sup></p>

      46-47. Many writers assert an equivalence between
      clitoridectomy and &ldquo;castration&rdquo;. Castration
      involves the removal of the testicles and is therefore more
      analogous to the removal of the ovaries in women.

      absurdity of such a facile argument is obvious when one
      considerers that it is approximately equivalent to saying
      that the removal of a man's nipples is the same as the
      removal of a woman's breasts, since both developed from the
      same embryionic structures.<br />
