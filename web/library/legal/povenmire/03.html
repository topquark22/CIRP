      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common law
      of battery has for centuries recognized the right of a person
      to be free from unwanted touching.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> The common law has long recognized
      surgery as a technical battery that can only be excused when
      there is expressed consent from the patient.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup> Because of the fundamental interests
      at stake, the consent must be "informed" in accordance with
      accepted standards for disclosure of information by the
      physician and actual understanding by the patient.<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup> Some courts base the necessity for
      informed consent in the fiduciary nature of the relationship
      between the physician and the patient, or upon "fundamental
      fairness."<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An operation
      performed without informed consent is an unauthorized
      operation and may subject the physician to liability.<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> In assessing liability, courts have
      considered whether or not the patient would have withheld
      consent if a doctor had provided adequate information.<sup><a
      href="#n81">81</a></sup> Courts will also consider the
      existence of emergency conditions.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup> Courts have held that the
      requirement for informed consent is applicable even to minor
      surgical operations with extremely slight risks, such as the
      removal of a wart.<sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judicial
      standard for determining whether a patient has given informed
      consent varies by jurisdiction.<sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup> Courts measure informed consent
      either by the disclosure that would have been given by a
      reasonable physician,<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup>
      typically measured by the customary practices of physicians
      in the locality,<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup> or by a
      standard based upon disclosure of information which the
      patient would deem relevant in reaching a decision.<sup><a
      href="#n87">87</a></sup> The latter "patient-based rule
      reflects the trend towards healthy skepticism of medical
      authority,<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup> and the increasing
      recognition of patients' right to control their own
      treatment.<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> Consent under the
      patient based rule is valid only if the risks of surgery have
      been communicated in fact.<sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been
      surprisingly few cases involving the question of informed
      consent to circumcision.<sup><a href="#n91">91</a></sup> The
      paucity of cases may reflect the awkward legal position that
      parents face when bringing an action on behalf of the child
      in a situation where any harm to them is indirect.<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup> It may also reflect the widespread
      but erroneous belief that circumcision is without adverse
      consequences for the child, or its relationship to its
      parents.<sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup> The startling result
      has been that courts have denied parents standing to sue for
      unauthorized circumcision, despite the fact that their
      consent, or the lack thereof, formed the basis for the
      complaint.<sup><a href="#n94">94</a></sup> As awareness of
      the adverse consequences of circumcision becomes more
      widespread, courts are likely to find standing for the
      parents in case of unauthorized circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event,
      providing a legal remedy for the unusual case of unauthorized
      circumcision does not address the larger issue of whether or
      not the parents are, or should be, legally authorized to
      consent on their child's behalf. Unfortunately, most parents
      in the United States either give their consent or acquiesce
      in the occasional unauthorized procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup> In order to protect the infant's
      fundamental right to bodily integrity, a reassessment is
      required of the power of minors and parents to consent to
      surgery, and of the State's role in protecting the right's of
      unborn children.<sup><a href="#n96">96</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <p><i>A. Ability of Minors to Consent to Surgery</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
      jurisdictions severely constrain the ability of minors to
      consent to medical treatment on the premise that minors lack
      the considered judgment to act in their own best
      interest.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup> Some courts
      recognized the power of minors to consent when the granting
      or withholding of such consent constitutes the exercise of a
      fundamental right.<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup> The most
      settled area in which such power is recognized concerns
      decisions over procreative choice.<sup><a
      href="#n99">99</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/428/52.html">Planned
      Parenthood v. Danforth</a></i>,<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> which overturned restrictions on a
      minor's right to consent to abortion, the Supreme Court held
      that constitutional rights do not ``magically'' appear at the
      time a child reaches maturity.<sup><a
      href="#n101">101</a></sup> The Court emphatically stated that
      ``[m]inors as well as adults are protected by the
      Constitution and possess constitutional rights.''<sup><a
      href="#n102">102</a></sup> The Court quickly conceded that
      the state has ``somewhat broader authority to regulate the
      behavior of children than of adults,''<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup> but ultimately concluded that the
      state interest in the ``safeguarding of the family unit and
      of parental authority ...is no more weighty than the right of
      privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become
      pregnant,''<sup><a href="#n104">104</a></sup> provides a
      convenient limit to the scope of the Court's ruling. In
      <i>Danforth</i>, the Court had little difficulty overriding
      any concern for the parent's interest in parental discretion,
      as distinct from the interest of the minor or the
      state.<sup><a href="#n105">105</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In each case in
      which the right to consent to medical treatment has been
      extended to minors, the court has favorably assessed, either
      explicitly or implicitly, the minor's ability to make a
      considered decision regarding the treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n106">106</a></sup> The presence of sufficient
      maturity and judgment to make such a decision is necessary in
      a minor because of the fundamental nature of the rights at
      stake and the cognitive prerequisites for granting effective
      consent.<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup> Thus, there is a
      biological limit, determined by psychological and
      intellectual development factors, to the ability of minors to
      grant effective consent.<sup><a href="#n108">108</a></sup> In
      other words, at a certain age, the minor is too young to say
      ``yes.''</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless,
      it does not necessarily follow that the minor is too young to
      say ``no.'' Invasive medical treatment, for example, is a
      battery and a violation of constitutional rights unless the
      patient has granted effective consent. The absence of consent
      is all that is required in the case of competent adults,
      under normal circumstances, to preserve an individual's
      bodily integrity.<sup><a href="#n109">109</a></sup> For
      adults, no affirmative withholding of consent is necessary.
      Important exceptions to this analysis of effective consent
      occur in the case of medical treatment required to safeguard
      the community, such as an inoculation against communicable
      disease,<sup><a href="#n110">110</a></sup> or when the
      judicial presumption of consent is warranted.<sup><a
      href="#n111">111</a></sup> For minors, the absence of consent
      should operate in a similar manner with the distinction that
      a presumption of effective consent is warranted once it is
      demonstrated that the medical treatment is necessary to
      preserve the infant's life. Another distinction exists when
      clear and convincing evidence indicates that the minor would
      have given consent if shown competent to do so.<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup> Under most circumstances, the
      courts could approximate this standard by determining by
      clear and convincing evidence that the proposed procedure is
      in the minor's best interest.<sup><a
      href="#n113">113</a></sup> In the case of male circumcision
      in the United States, the need for such a demonstration is
      rarely articulated, and is all too readily relinquished to
      the perceived parental interest in exercising parental
      discretion.<sup><a href="#n114">114</a></sup></p>
      <a id="parents" name="parents" /> 

      <center>
        <p><i>B. Ability of Parents to Consent on Behalf of Their
        Children</i></p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme
      Court has struggled to define a zone of privacy within the
      family unit that is beyond the purview of state
      interference.<sup><a href="#n115">115</a></sup> Courts have
      long recognized parental discretion in decisions affecting
      their children as a ``fundamental'' interest of the parents,
      and thus distinct from the interests of the state.<sup><a
      href="#n116">116</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support of a
      constitutional basis for parental discretion is provided in
      several cases including: <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/406/205.html">Wisconsin v.
      Yoder</a>;</i><sup><a href="#n117">117</a></sup> <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/262/390.html">Meyer v.
      Nebraska</a>;</i><sup><a href="#n118">118</a></sup> and <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/268/510.html">Pierce v.
      Society of Sisters</a></i>.<sup><a href="#n119">119</a></sup>
      In each of these cases, the Court protected parental
      discretion from state interference, after a careful weighing
      of the state interest and the First Amendment right asserted
      by the parents.<sup><a href="#n120">120</a></sup> Instead of
      recognizing a broad constitutional right of parental
      discretion, these cases stand for a limited scope of parental
      discretion in the matters of education and religion.<sup><a
      href="#n121">121</a></sup> Other Supreme Court cases have
      hinted at a "fundamental right to raise a family," although
      the Court has not clearly defined the contours of this
      right.<sup><a href="#n122">122</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme
      Court has sharply curtailed parental discretion, even in the
      exercise of First Amendment rights, when the exercise of such
      rights may adversely affect the health of a minor.<sup><a
      href="#n123">123</a></sup> <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/321/158.html">Prince v.
      Massachusetts</a></i><sup><a href="#n124">124</a></sup>
      involved the prosecution of the guardian of a minor child
      under child labor laws.<sup><a href="#n125">125</a></sup> The
      Court held that ``[p]arents may be free to become martyrs
      themselves. But it does not follow that they are free to, in
      identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children
      before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion
      when they can make that choice for themselves.''<sup><a
      href="#n126">126</a></sup> Subsequent cases tested and
      sustained the <i>Prince</i> reasoning.<sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the context
      of the recognized fundamental interest in procreative choice
      and contraception, the Supreme Court has again declined to
      recognize constitutional protection of parental discretion in
      medical decisions affecting their children.<sup><a
      href="#n128">128</a></sup> In cases dealing with these
      issues, the Court barely paused to acknowledge the
      independent interests of parents.<sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup> Indeed, these decisions that a
      dawning recognition of a minor's constitutional right to
      privacy in procreative choice, a right which is inextricably
      intertwined with the right to bodily integrity.<sup><a
      href="#n130">130</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i><a
      href="http://laws.findlaw.com/US/442/584.html">Parham v.
      J.R.</a></i>,<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> the Supreme
      Court upheld a Georgia statute permitting parents to commit
      their children to state mental institutions for medical
      evaluation and treatment.<sup><a href="#n132">132</a></sup>
      The parental discretion at issue, however, was carefully
      delimited by the procedural safeguards contained within the
      statute.<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup> This statute placed
      decision making in the hands of a neutral fact-finder.<sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup> While the Court recognized ``broad
      parental authority over minor children,''<sup><a
      href="#n135">135</a></sup> it emphasized that, ``a state is
      not without constitutional control over parental discretion
      in dealing with children when their physical and mental
      health is jeopardized.''<sup><a href="#n136">136</a></sup>
      Significantly, the Court did not identify a constitutionally
      protected interest in parental discretion.<sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the
      ambiguous constitutional status of parental discretion in
      medical decision making for minors, courts should be wary of
      relinquishing such decisions to parents without serious
      consideration of the other interests involved. Increasingly,
      the other interests include the separate constitutional
      interests of the minor to bodily integrity. However, the
      decisions of lower courts on the issue of parental discretion
      in medical decision making vary widely, with all
      jurisdictions recognizing the ability of parents to consent
      to medical treatment of their children in cases where the
      treatment is deemed medically necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n138">138</a></sup> In fact, a minority of courts have
      limited the scope of parental discretion in cases where the
      courts have not deemed medical treatment necessary.<sup><a
      href="#n139">139</a></sup> Most courts, however, defer to
      parental discretion within a broad spectrum of situations
      ranging from those which are medically necessary, to those
      which do not threaten the health of the child.<sup><a
      href="#n140">140</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of
      male circumcision in the United States, parents are presumed
      to have the power to consent to the circumcision of their
      infant sons despite the mounting evidence of the procedure's
      deleterious effects.<sup><a href="#n141">141</a></sup> This
      practice is no longer tenable given the emerging recognition
      of constitutional rights for minors, the ambiguous and highly
      qualified status of parental interests in medical decision
      making on behalf of children, and the important state
      interest in ensuring the protection of children's health.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courts
      typically place a high burden on the state to show that
      medical treatment is necessary before they will compel
      treatment over parental objections.<sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup> This article argues that the
      burden should be reversed where the state intervenes to
      ensure the health of children against questionable medical
      procedures authorized by the parents on the child's
      behalf.</p>

        to this [contraception through sterilization] procedure....
        Therefore, whether approached as in infringement of the
        right of privacy under the First Amendment or the privacy
        right that is found within the liberty protected by the
        Fourteenth Amendment, and whether analyzed under due
