      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision,
      as practiced in the United States, involves the surgical
      removal of the penile prepuce, or foreskin.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> The United States is the only
      western country to practice routine infant circumcision for
      non-religious reasons.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> For
      Jewish infants, the procedure is typically performed in a
      non-hospital setting by a specially trained lay person, or
      <i>mohel</i> (a religious leader who performs Jewish
      circumcisions),<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> on the eighth
      day following birth, without anesthetic, except for the
      ritualized use of wine.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> For
      non-Jewish infants, the procedure is typically performed in a
      hospital within days of birth, also without the use of
      anesthetic.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Approximately
      eighty percent of the males living in the United States in
      1970 were circumcised.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> Given
      a total male population in the United States of approximately
      130 million, it appears that approximately 104 million males
      have been affected by the practice in this country
      alone.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> The rate of infant
      circumcisions reported for the years 1991 through 1993 was
      approximately sixty percent, showing a decline in the
      acceptance of this technique.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
      For Jews, circumcision is an ancient, highly ceremonial
      practice, signifying a covenant with God.<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> The practice is widely believed
      among Jews to be a prerequisite for acceptance into the
      Jewish religion; so is therefore almost universal amongst
      Jewish men.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> Muslims also
      practice routine circumcision, although Islamic scholars are
      divided on whether the practice is mandated by the Muslim
      religion.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> The vast majority
      of circumcisions in the United States, however, are upon
      non-Jewish and non-Muslim men.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For non-Jewish
      men, the practice of circumcision traces its origins to a
      complex set of causes beginning with the antimasturbation
      hysteria prevalent during the latter half of the nineteenth
      century.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> The practice of
      infant circumcision was popularized as part of the
      institutionalization of medical childbirth that began during
      the early years of this century.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> Although the antimasturbation
      rationale persisted until recently, other justifications for
      circumcision were also popularized.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> Such justifications for circumcision
      include: supposed hygienic benefits,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> resistance to venereal
      disease,<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> resistance to
      cancer,<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> suitability for armed
      service,<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> and alleged
      improvement of sexual performance.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> Many people also believe that a
      circumcised penis is a cosmetic improvement<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> and that a child will feel
      conspicuous with an uncircumcised penis.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> As the prevalence of circumcision
      declines, however, popular conceptions of what a penis looks
      like will undoubtedly change.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup>
      It is entirely possible that the next generation will accept
      the natural whole penis as normal.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> Even though each of the supposed
      justifications for circumcision have now been seriously
      challenged or discredited,<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> a
      belief in the benefits of circumcision remains
      prevalent.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies
      conducted at U.S. Army hospitals beginning in1985, show an
      increased incidence of urinary tract infection in
      uncircumcised males an are cited as evidence of the benefits
      of circumcision.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> These
      studies, however have been severely criticized for analytical
      and methodological flaws.<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup> In
      particular the studies were retrospective, and based on
      potentially unreliable medical records.<sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup> They also failed to account for the
      presence of urinary birth defects,<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> hospital hygiene practices,<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> and survey bias.<sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup> Indeed, recent studies indicate a
      correlation between circumcision and urinary tract
      infection.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> The authoritative
      weight of recent studies favors routine penile hygiene,
      rather than circumcision, to prevent urinary tract infections
      in infants.<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision of
      adult males is a more involved procedure than routine infant
      circumcision, and this difference is sometimes offered as
      justification for the circumcision of infants.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup> Such reasoning fallaciously
      presupposes the decision to amputate the foreskin in
      adulthood.<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup> Circumcision of
      adult men is rarely necessary for medical reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Routine infant
      circumcision was once practiced in Canada,<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup> England,<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> and Australia,<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup> but now is uncommon in those
      countries. The <a href="/library/statements/bma/">British
      Medical Association</a>,<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> the
      <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">Canadian
      Paediatric Society</a>,<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> and
      the <a href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australasian
      Association of Paediatric Surgeons</a><sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup> have all unequivocably disapproved
      of circumcision as a routine practice, citing a lack of
      proven medical benefits and the invasiveness of the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> Although the <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian College of
      Paediatrics</a><sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> and the
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup> have adopted more ambivalent
      positions, they are nonetheless unsupportive of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American
      Pediatric Society (``APS'') is alone among the medical
      societies of the developed western world, in providing tepid
      support of routine circumcision as a medical practice.<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup> The current APS position, adopted in
      1989 in response to preliminary study results, states
      ``[n]ewborn circumcision has potential benefits and
      advantages as well as disadvantages and risks.''<sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup> The weight of circumcision research
      done since 1989, however, has shown that APS reliance upon
      preliminary date was misplaced. <font color="navy">[CIRP
      Note: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is herein
      referred to as the American Pediatric Society
      (APS).]</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APS is
      currently reviewing its position on circumcision, and a
      statement is anticipated in the latter part of 1998.<sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup> Undoubtedly, there are powerful
      political and economic pressures impinging upon APS in its
      decision making process.<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup>
      Despite these pressures, it is now time for APS to cast away
      the unnecessary ambiguity which its 1989 position has
      engendered, by adopting the medically conservative position
      that circumcision is unwarranted. Even if one recognized that
      the evidence against circumcision is incomplete, APS should
      err, if at all, on the side of patients' rights.<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> <font color="navy">[CIRP Note: The
      AAP subsequently published a <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a> in March
      1999.]</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people
      believe that circumcision has little or no adverse
      consequences. This popular misconception has been disproved
      by a number of recent studies confirming the presence of
      serious adverse effects from circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> The procedure is now known to be
      traumatic<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> and painful,<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup> may interfere with proper bonding
      and nursing with the mother,<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup>
      and results in long-term heightened pain response.<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> Circumcision reduces the sensitivity
      of the penis by amputating approximately eighty percent of he
      penile skin covering when erect, including highly specialized
      structures evolutionarily adapted to further the various
      functions of the penis.<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup> The
      amputation of the foreskin uncovers the tip of the penis, or
      glans, which then becomes dry tough, and relatively
      insensitive.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup> The beneficial
      functions of the foreskin in providing a natural lubricant,
      protecting the glans, and facilitating vaginal penetration
      are also lost.<sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup> Lastly, the
      operation has a surgical complication rate of one in
      five-hundred, ranging from constriction of the penis, to
      death from infection.<sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup></p>

      transmitted diseases less common among circumcised Jews
      during the mid-to-late 1800s. <i>Id</i>. at 80. These studies
      did not consider religious and cultural practices which
      insulated Jews from contagion. <i>Id</i>. Current
      observations indicate that circumcision has the opposite
      effect. See Fleiss, <i>supra</i> note 27 at 19 (stating that
      ``the U.S. has both the highest rates of sexually active
      circumcised males in the western world and the highest rate
      of sexually transmitted diseases... ''). Medical studies have
      found either no correlation between circumcision and
      transmission rates or a slight increase in transmission among
      circumcised men. <i>See generally</i> <a

      reviewing the APS's positions regarding circumcision). In
      1989, however, the APS altered its position, in response to
      preliminary data suggesting possible benefits of circumcision
      in reducing urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted
      disease, and cancer of the penis and cervix. A<font

      <i>supra</i> note 61, at 390. The APS gratuitously added that
      the ``the benefits and risks should be explained to the
      parents and informed consent obtained.'' <i>Id</i>. This
      comment argues that informed consent cannot be obtained from
      the parents under the 1989 APS position, absent unusual
      medical circumstances, because there is insufficient showing
      that the procedure is medically necessary and in the child's
      best interest. The legal community need not take direction
      from the medical community in determining the legal
      prerequisites of informed consent.<br />

      65. Circumcision is not an insignificant source of income for
      hospital and pediatricians. The cost of circumcision is
      approximately $100-150. Sharon Bass, <i>supra</i> note 33, at
      10. It is estimated that an enthusiastic pediatrician may
      earn $10,000 a year from the procedure. R<font
      size="-2">OMBERG</font>, supra note 15, at 111. The foreskin
      has also found use as a source of tissue in the manufacture
      of synthetic skin. Paul Recer, <i>New Methods May Aid Those
      With Chronic Wounds</i>, S<font size="-2">EATTLE</font>
      T<font size="-2">IMES</font>, Oct. 21, 1997, at A13. Five
      billion dollars a year is spent treating wounds for which
      synthetic skin has potential application. Id. Jewish and
      Islamic groups may also seek to sway the APS in order to
      safeguard the legality of circumcision as a religious
      practice. <i>Id</i>.<br />
