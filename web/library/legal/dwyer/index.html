        </center>

        <p class="abs">The story of children who die because their
        parents, in observation of their own religious principles,
        withhold conventional medical treatment from them is a
        familiar one. In this Article, James G. Dwyer shows that
        the phenomenon of parents denying secular benefits to
        children goes far beyond those few highly publicized cases,
        extending into the realm of education as well as medical
        care. Moreover, Dr. Dwyer shows that the federal and state
        governments endorse this practice by statutorily exempting
        `religious objector' parents from otherwise generally
        applicable compulsory child care and education laws. He
        argues that courts addressing such exemptions, in
        emphasizing the parents' free exercise rights, have failed
        to observe that they infringe upon the children's equal
        protection rights. These children, solely because of their
        parents beliefs, do not receive the same legal protections
        from harm (for instance, inferior health care and an
        inferior education) that other groups of children receive.
        After describing in detail the types of discrimination that
        religious exemptions to child welfare laws inflict upon
        these children, Dr. Dwyer considers how each element of an
        equal protection analysis would apply to these exemptions.
        He concludes ultimately that very few, if any, of the
        exemptions should survive an equal protection challenge. -
        a conclusion with radical practical implications,
        particularly with regard to the educational system in this
        country. Finally, the author discusses the practical
        impediments to bringing equal protection claims, especially
        the fact that neither the parents nor the children
        themselves are likely to raise and support them, and
        proposes methods by which courts might nevertheless hear
        these claims.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>IV. Conclusion</b></p>

      <p class="text">Mainstream American Society has for several
      decades been in the throes of a struggle to effectuate its
      ideal of quality before the law. This ideal is far from being
      realized, but such significant steps have been taken that
      today the most debated question is whether historically
      under-privileged groups are now over-privileged, at least in
      regard to higher education opportunities and employment. This
      struggle and its successes, however, have not included all
      disadvantaged groups. The state has denied some groups of
      children equal protection of the laws to an increasing,
      rather than decreasing, degree, and few persons have noticed,
      because these children cannot speak for themselves and their
      parents do not seek equal treatment for them. We in the legal
      profession should pause from our discussions of affirmative
      action hiring of law professors and corporate managers to ask
      whether these children deserve our immediate attention and
      our efforts to secure equal treatment for all.</p>

      <p class="text">This Article has endeavored to explain why
      religious exemptions to child welfare and education laws
      violate the Equal Protection Clause and constitute an
      injustice to children of religious objectors. The legal
      conclusions strongly support elimination of these exemptions.
      The discrimination is clear and clearly intentional on the
      part of legislatures. The purpose of the exemptions is
      obvious and obviously illegitimate, as a naked preference for
      the interests of parents over the interests of children. The
      real obstacle to reversing this history of discrimination
      against children of religious objectors lies in finding a
      judge who can conceive of a child as a person distinct from
      her parents, with independent interests and no real
      commitment to any religion, and who understands that the
      religious preferences of parents should be relevant to the
      legal treatment of children only insofar as frustrating those
      preferences might unavoidably adversely affect children's
      well-being.</p>

      <p class="text">The world is which all children enjoy the
      equal protection of the laws would be a significantly
      different world from the present one. One difference that
      some might mourn in this "ideal" world would have little
      place for certain types of religious commitment and religious
      community - specifically, those based on unreflective,
      unchosen, inherited religious faith. Proponents of strong
      parental rights or of toleration of minority religious
      practices often raise this concern, although these persons
      themselves are typically not among the persons who have that
      kind of faith or who belong to that type of community. Their
      motivation seems principally the satisfaction they derive
      from living in a diverse social environment and in a tolerant
      society.</p>

      <p class="text">We must recognize that such satisfaction
      hardly counts as any justification, let alone an important
      one, for denying medical care and equal opportunity to some
      children. Liberals and conservatives alike should begin to
      think less about what kind of world they want to live in when
      they discuss children's upbringing and more about what kind
      of world is best for a child born today whose parents have
      religious views opposed to the types of benefits that
      collectively have decided children need. That child alone has
      fundamental interests in her health and education, and that
      child is therefore whom the law should put first.</p>
