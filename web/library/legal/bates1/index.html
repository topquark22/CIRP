      <h3>Circumcision of healthy children</h3>

      <p class="text">The issue of circumcision of healthy male
      children has been raised in graphic form in Australia in an
      article by Boyle and others.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      They conclude<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> that
      non-therapeutic circumcision of unconsenting minors is
      unethical, useless and traumatic, and that it causes lasting
      harm physically, sexually, and often, psychologically.
      Consequently, they suggest that it is "overdue for
      recognition by the legal community as sexual
      mutilation". The description of the procedure<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> adopted by those writers is, if taken
      alone, certainly horrific enough. In the authors'
      words:</p>

      <p class="quote">"During circumcision, the baby's
      sensitive foreskin is crushed audibly, and the raw flesh is
      cut with scissors. In all neonatal circumcisions, forceps or
      other probes are inserted into the delicate foreskin,
      scraping, tearing apart and destroying the normal erogenous
      tissues of the child's sex organ. This causes
      considerable pain and leaves the raw glans open to
      infections, with any resultant scar tissue on the glans
      further compromising sexual sensitivity. Tearing the normal
      protective adhesions between the glans and foreskin resembles
      ripping a fingernail from its quick. If a clamping device is
      used, the foreskin is crushed over a bell-shaped device to
      enable amputation."</p>

      <p class="text">Despite this more than graphic description,
      there has been relatively little in the way of case law
      pertaining to this procedure. The matter was referred to in
      obiter dicta in the notorious decision of the House of Lords
      in <i>R v Brown</i>,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> where Lord
      Templeman had said:<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="quote">"Surgery involves intentional violence
      resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm but
      surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities carried on
      with consent by or on behalf of the injured person have been
      accepted as lawful notwithstanding that they involve actual
      bodily harm or may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual
      circumcision, tattooing, ear-piercing and violent sports
      including boxing are lawful activities."</p>

      <p class="text">This is with respect, a most curious
      statement: in the case of the latter instances, it is
      usually<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> the participant who
      consents to the activity, whereas in the case of ritual
      circumcision, the object of the procedure will not be in a
      position to protest. This is particularly so in the case of a
      Jewish male child who is ritually circumcised on the eight
      day of his life.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <h3>The McKibbin decision</h3>

      <p class="text">There can, of course, be not doubt that the
      issue has arisen in respect of negligent surgical procedures.
      This, in <i>St Margaret's Hospital for Women (Sydney) v
      McKibbin</i>,<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> the 21-year-old
      plaintiff had had a negligently performed circumcision
      performed on him when he was six days old. This reduced the
      size of his penis by nearly one-third. He was able to
      urinate, but it sprayed his legs if he was standing: erection
      and seminal discharge was possible and he was able to father
      children. Sexual intercourse was also possible, although it
      would present greater difficulties than it would for other
      men. However, the cosmetic deformity could not be improved by
      surgery and it had resulted in a number of social and
      psychiatric problems for the plaintiff, who avoided women,
      was sexually frustrated and often depressed. He never formed
      a relationship with a woman and had never had sexual
      intercourse. Psychiatric evidence suggested that the
      psychological harm to the plaintiff was permanent and could,
      at a later stage, seriously interfere with his capacity to
      work.</p>

      <p class="text">At the trial of his action for damages, the
      jury returned a verdict for $500,000, a sum regarded as
      excessive by the New South Wales Court of Appeal, which
      ordered a new trial. The second jury subsequently returned a
      verdict for $275,000. The defendant hospital appealed again
      on the ground that the sum was manifestly excessive. By a
      majority, the New South Wales Court of Appeal dismissed the
      appeal.</p>

      <p class="text">McHugh JA, with whom Priestly, JA agreed, was
      of the view<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> that the jury could
      reasonably conclude that the psychological condition of the
      plaintiff might deteriorate to the point where there was a
      reasonable prospect that he would withdraw from society and
      find difficulty in maintaining employment. The judge was
      further of the view that it was not to the point that the
      plaintiff's residual organ was adequate for its normal
      functions. He stated:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Modern sexologists have punctured the
      myth that sexual adequacy depends upon the size of the penis.
      But the myth persists. It could hardly be otherwise.
      Throughout human history the phallus has been seen as a
      symbol of power."<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Although the jury's view of the
      evidence might, he considered,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> have been extreme, it was reasonably
      open to them. In his dissent, it is not without interest that
      Mahoney JA did rely<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> on the
      writings of such modern sexologists in order to seek to find
      that the award was excessive.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text"><i>McKibbin</i> is, of course, a
      straightforward decision on quantum of damages, the
      negligence having been admitted. However, the facts of the
      case do seem to bear out at least some of the comments made
      by Boyle and his colleagues regarding some of the actual and
      excessive risks of the process.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> However for the purposes of this
      commentary, that is not the major issue: the procedure in
      McKibbin must have been authorized and it is the issue of by
      whom and when it should, or might, be so authorized that was
      the issue in <i>Re J</i>.</p>

      <h3>The Re J decision</h3>

      <p class="text">In <i>Re J (Specific Issue Orders:
      Child's Religious Upbringing and
      Circumcision)</i><sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> the father
      had applied for a specific issue order<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> that his five-year-old son be
      circumcised. The father was a Muslim, though not especially
      observant. The mother was a non-practising Christian who was
      bringing up the child in an essentially secular household.
      The trial judge had accepted that the mother regarded
      circumcision as an important part of the child's
      identity as a Muslim, but rejected the application on the
      basis that the procedure would be not be in the child's
      best interests because the mother was opposed to the
      procedure and because only a small minority of the
      child's peers would be circumcised. The father appealed
      unsuccessfully to the English Court of Appeal.</p>

      <p class="text">First, Thorpe LJ described<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> the trial judges's judgment,
      which he had summarized<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> in
      some detail, as "impregnable" and noted that
      counsel for the appellant therefore faced an "uphill
      struggle". Nevertheless, the arguments which she had
      presented are of interest for the purposes of this article.
      The first referred to the issue of religion. It was argued
      that the trial judge had confused the child's religion
      with the child's religious upbringing in the sense,
      that during the first two years of his life, his parents
      were, to some degree at least, practicing Muslims and the
      parents' separation could not terminate his religion,
      particularly in the absence of any active step by his mother
      to do so. Thorpe LJ considered<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> that, theoretically at any rate,
      that argument was correct, even though it weighed very light
      in the scale that the judge was required to balance as to
      whether the procedure was in the child's best
      interests. As the judge pointed out, there were differences
      in the ways in which children become part of religious
      communities. On the other hand, some regard their religion as
      being derived from their parental heritage; on the other
      hand, some recognize their religion as a result of some
      ceremonial induction or initiation. Nevertheless, in respect
      of newborn children, Thorpe LJ was of the opinion that such
      child did</p>

      <p class="quote">"not share the perception of his
      parents or of the religious community to which the parents
      belong. A child's perception of his or her religion
      generally depends on involvement in worship and teaching
      within the family. From this develops the emotional,
      intellectual, psychological and spiritual sense of belonging
      to a religious faith."<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">It followed in Thorpe LJ's view, that,
      for practical purposes, courts had correctly emphasised the
      child's religious upbringing rather than the
      child's religion, on which there had been no reported
      case law.</p>

      <p class="text">On that issue, Schiemann LJ considered<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> that it "bristles with
      conceptual and philosophical issues". However, his
      Lordship did not attempt to deal with them, although he
      commented<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> that it was
      apparent that adherents of the Islamic faith would regard the
      boy as being part of that faith, as did his father. At the
      same time, there was no reason to suppose that the child do
      so regard himself or, indeed, consider himself as belonging
      to any particular faith. Butler-Sloss P did not
      express<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> any opinion on the
      matter.</p>

      <p class="text">The matter of religion has, necessarily, to
      be placed in context, especially in view of the opinions
      expressed by Boyle and his co-authors. The relationship
      between religious belief and practice has been a source of
      dispute for a considerable time, although it has been more
      directly addressed in the United States than in England or
      Australia. Thus, in <i>Cleveland v United States</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> in the United States Supreme Court,
      Douglass J stated:</p>

      <p class="quote">"It is also urged that the requisite
      criminal intent was lacking since petitioners were motivated
      by religious belief. That defense claims too much. If upheld,
      it would place beyond the law any act done under claim of
      religious sanction."<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">More recently, in the well-known United
      States Supreme Court decision in <i>Employment Division v
      Smith</i>,<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> Scalia J
      noted<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> that exercise of
      religion</p>

      <p class="quote">"often involves not only belief and
      profession, but the performance of (and abstention from)
      physical acts: as in being with others for a worship service,
      participating in a sacramental use of bread and wine,
      proselytizing, abstaining from certain foods or certain modes
      of transportation".</p>

      <p class="text">Although Scalia J's analysis seemed to
      be concerned largely with Christian observances, he could
      have properly included ritual circumcision in connection with
      other religions. Scalia J continued by saying that a State
      within the United States would be prohibiting the free
      exercise of religion if it were to ban such acts or
      abstentions only when they were engaged in for religious
      reasons, or because of the religious belief that they
      display. He went on<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> to say
      that the United States Supreme Court had never held that
      individuals' religious beliefs excuse them from
      adherence to otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the
      State is free to regulate. The question is quite plain, even
      though the answer is not: if Boyle and his co-authors are
      correct in their contention that male circumcision does (or
      should constitute a criminal assault, then the fact that it
      is carried out in the exercise of religion does not make it
      any less of an assault. As will be remembered, Lord Templeman
      in <i>R v Brown</i><sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>
      specifically exempted ritual circumcision, though he did not
      justify the exemption and, contextually, the exemption is
      less than valid.</p>

      <p class="text">It had also been submitted on behalf of the
      father in <i>Re J</i> that any considerations against
      circumcision were "either transient or, if not
      transient, speculative". Thorpe LJ took the view<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> that the submission disregarded the
      realities of child development. In the judge's own
      words:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Fear, pain, despair or a sense of
      betrayal may all be transient in the temporal sense, but
      still inflict emotional and psychological trauma that will
      burden a child for life."<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The view shared by Boyle and his co-authors
      who have asserted<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> that the
      procedure causes behavioural and neurological change,
      diminished self esteem and body image, sexual deficits and,
      often, lifelong related stress.</p>

      <p class="text">However, Thorpe LJ continued<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> by saying that each case must turn
      on its own particular facts and he did not wish to be taken
      as laying down general guidance:</p>

      <p class="quote">"The only certainty is that social
      attitudes to male circumcision will remain extremely fluid.
      The only generalization I would feel confident to express is
      that, in those communities where it is the practice to carry
      out the circumcision of a male child within days of birth,
      there is much less likelihood of a forensic
      dispute."</p>

      <p class="text">Indeed, Thorpe LJ concluded by saying that
      the only point of principle that the case decided was that
      the relevant legislation<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> did
      not enable one parent to arrange circumcision without the
      consent of the other. The trial judge had accepted the
      argument that the operation was of considerable consequence
      and was irreversible. Hence Thorpe LJ was of the view that it
      must be regarded as falling into the category which , when
      there was disagreement between holders of parental
      responsibility, required submission to the court for
      determination. That point was taken up by Butler-Sloss P who
      commented:<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>

      <p class="quote">"The decision to circumcise a child on
      a ground other than medical necessity is a very important
      one; the operation is irreversible, and should only be
      carried out where the parents together approve of it, or in
      the absence of parental agreement, where a court decides that
      the operation is in the best interest of the
      child."</p>

      <p class="text">In the end, Thorpe LJ is surely correct when
      he stated that <i>Re J</i> really did not
      <i>decide</i><sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> a great deal,
      but it has raised a number of issues which, when taken in
      context, suggest the possibility of further conflict. Both
      Thorpe LJ and Butler-Sloss P emphasized the irreversible
      nature of the procedure and seemed cautious about permitting
      it, certainly in the case of a child of the age in question,
      Thorpe LJ did comment specifically<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> that many of the issues could have
      not have developed but for the practice of the father's
      community to delay the procedure until the child was about
      seven years old. One can only speculate about how an
      identically constituted court would have resolved a dispute,
      say, between a Jewish mother, who wished the procedure to be
      carried out, and a non-Jewish father who did not. In
      addition, the case does nothing to allay the concerns about
      the procedure itself which have been raised by Boyle and his
      colleagues regarding the legality of the procedure,<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> although it must be of some
      satisfaction to them that the operation was not
      authorized.</p>

      <p class="text">One final point arises out of <i>Re J</i> and
      out of the article by Boyle and his co-authors: they point
      out<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> that female genital
      mutilation, referred to as female circumcision, is illegal in
      two Australian jurisdictions<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>
      and elsewhere. The nature of that practice has been clearly
      documented<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> and attracts
      general, and proper, revulsion; however, given present
      practice, what court or, more especially, legislature would
      be prepared to clarify the law in the manner urged by these
      writers?</p>

      <h3>The Re A decision</h3>

      <p class="text">In <i>Re J</i>, Butler-Sloss P
      referred<sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup> to sterilization
      which, in relation to young women with intellectual
      disabilities, has caused considerable problems in Australia
      in recent years.<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> However, the
      issue of sterilization in relation to males has only arisen
      in one instance - in the recent case of <i>Re A (Male
      Sterilisation)</i>,<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> which was
      decided by an identically constituted Court of Appeal to that
      in <i>Re J</i>. The relevant facts in <i>Re A</i> were that
      the person who was the subject of the application was a
      28-year-old male who had Down's Syndrome and was on the
      borderline between significant and severe intellectual
      impairment. He lives with his mother who was 63 years old. A
      major cause for her concern was that, as her health declined,
      she would be unable adequately to supervise her son and that
      he might make a woman pregnant. The mother, hence, sought a
      declaration<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> that
      sterilization was in the son's best interests, but any
      such declaration was opposed by the Official Solicitor. The
      trial judge found that the son was sexually aware and
      active,<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> but also had a high
      degree of care and supervision which substantially reduced
      any possibility of his indulging in a sexual relationship.
      Accordingly, although the mother's application was
      supported by expert medical evidence, the trial judge refused
      to grant the declaration on the grounds that the advantages
      to the son of his undergoing a vasectomy were not clear; that
      the risks of his entering into a casual sexual relationship
      were very low; and lastly, that the effect on him which might
      result from such a relationship would be minimal. The mother
      unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>

      <p class="text">The first issue raised by Butler-Sloss P
      related the nature of the object's best interests after
      having noted<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> an earlier
      comment in <i>Re MB (Medical Treatment)</i><sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> to the effect that best interests
      were not limited to best medical interests, she stated that
      in her view, the expression encompassed "medical,
      emotional and all other welfare issues". In the case of
      sterilization operations, Butler-Sloss P also emphasized that
      it was the courts, rather than medical practitioners, who
      were required to make the decision as to whether it was in
      the patient's best interests that the operation be
      performed. At the same time, she adopted the view of Lord
      Jaucey in <i>Re F</i><sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> that
      [I]n the case of a long-term incompetent, convenience to
      those charged with his care should never be a justification
      for the decision to treat".</p>

      <p class="text">From a comparative standpoint, that view has
      not generally been accepted: in Australia, Warnick J of the
      Family Court of Australia in <i>Re Katie</i><sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup> specifically noted the benefits to
      the child's mother were a hysterectomy to be carried
      out. Although he emphasised that the welfare of the child to
      be regarded as the paramount consideration, it was necessary
      to look at her total circumstances. She had been raised as
      part of the family and it was intended that she continue to
      be so. In view of that, the abilities of the family,
      especially here mother, should be maximised so as to cope
      with the child's needs: "Thus the interests of
      Katie are inextricably linked with the ability of her parents
      to cope with the burdens of Katie's care."<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup> It should also be said, in that
      comparative context, that in only one case, <i>Re
      Sarah</i>,<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> was the operation
      not authorised, and, in that case, the young woman did not
      live with her family. In the English context, as Butler-Sloss
      P noted,<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> there have been case
      of women with intellectual disabilities where the procedure
      has been authorised<sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup> and
      others where it has not.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup>
      Butler-Sloss P commented<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup>
      that, in each case, the decision of the court was made in the
      best interests of the person concerned.</p>

      <p class="text">However, the learned President continued, an
      application on behalf of a man for sterilization was not the
      equivalent of an application with respect of woman and was
      not a matter of equality between the sexes, but a balancing
      exercise on a case-by-case basis:</p>

      <p class="quote">"There are obvious biological
      difficulties and sexual intercourse for a woman carries a
      risk of pregnancy which patently it does not for a man.
      Indeed there is no direct consequence for a man of sexual
      intercourse other than the possibility of sexually
      transmitted diseases."<sup><a
      href="#n57">57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">However she went on to say that, in the case
      of a man who has an intellectual disability, neither the
      birth of a child nor disapproval of his conduct was likely to
      affect him to a significant degree except in exceptional
      circumstances. The exceptional circumstances to which
      Butler-Sloss referred included the subject's freedom of
      movement which, in turn, might lead to his quality of life
      being diminished. She also suggested, but did not specify,
      that there might be other disadvantages to the subject which
      might require a court to authorize the operation. Likewise,
      Butler-Sloss P expressed the view that it might be necessary
      to evaluate the nature and the degree of risk attached to the
      approval or disapproval of the operation. Again
      unfortunately, perhaps, these risks were not specified: the
      operation itself is relatively straightforward<sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup> and there appear to be little risk
      of side-effects.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> Neither
      would be likely to be of any significance to a male person
      with an intellectual disability. Butler-Sloss P also
      commented that it might be necessary for a court to evaluate
      the nature and degree of risk which might be attached to
      approval or refusal of the operation.</p>

      <p class="text">In the instant case, Butler-Sloss
      considered<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> that it was
      necessary to focus on the best interests of the son: it was
      clear from his mother's evidence that he would continue
      to be the object of close supervision. If the operation were
      not to be approved, it would inevitably affect the mother,
      but that would not affect the level of supervision. She also
      expressed the view that, "[I]f sterilization did take
      place, it would not save [him] from the possibility of
      exploitation nor help him cope with the emotional
      implications of any closer relationship he may
      form".<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> It was also
      clear, she continued, that, from the evidence of carers in
      the day center which he attended, the level of supervision
      which was exercised did not depend upon his fertility.
      However, it is important to point out that Butler-Sloss P
      emphasized<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> that, when the son
      was admitted to local authority care, the possibility that he
      might enter a sexual relationship with a woman<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup> might affect the degree of freedom
      he might otherwise enjoy and <i>if his quality of life were
      to be diminished</i><sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup> that
      would be a reason to seek, at that time, a declaration that
      sterilization would be in the son's best interests.</p>

      <p class="text">Thorpe LJ agreed with the President, though
      he admitted<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> that on first
      reading, he had not been sure of his conclusion. As a general
      point, Thorpe LJ accepted<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup>
      expert evidence to the effect that the young man's
      fertility was a genuine disadvantage:</p>

      <p class="quote">"In our society vasectomy has become
      the preferred method of contraception for many males who wish
      to separate their sexual and procreative functions. The
      obligation of society is to minimize the consequences of
      disability by vouchsafing the disabled wherever possible the
      rights and freedoms vouchsafed to the majority who have been
      spared disability."</p>

      <p class="text">Thorpe LJ then turned his attention<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> to the way in which courts should
      proceed when dealing with such cases and considered that, in
      the absence of any statutory checklist or direction, the
      trial judge should "draw up a balance
      sheet".<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> The first entry
      would consist of a factor or factors of actual benefit: in
      the present instance, the entry would refer to the benefits
      of "foolproof" contraception. On the other hand;
      a disadvantage would be the apprehension, risk and discomfort
      inherent in the operation.</p>

      <p class="quote">"Then the judge should enter on each
      sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making
      some estimate of the extent of the possibility that gain or
      loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge
      should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum
      of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the
      certain and possible losses."<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">It followed, Thorpe LJ stated, that it was
      only if the account was in "relatively significant
      credit" that a trial judge would conclude that the
      application was likely to advance the best interest of the
      relevant person.<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">However, as had Butler-Sloss P,<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> Thorpe LJ emphasized that the
      failure of the appeal did not preclude a fresh application in
      the future were there to be fresh evidence available.<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> Schiemann LJ agreed with both
      Butler-Sloss and Thorpe LJ.</p>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>

      <p class="text">What then do these cases tell us? At one
      level, it seems as though courts are less ready to order
      surgical procedures on male children. The alacrity with which
      procedures have been carried out in Australia on young women
      with intellectual disabilities has, in this writer's
      view, been somewhat alarming.<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup>
      In that context, the cautionary notes sounded in both cases
      seem to be desirable, but again, it is hard to ignore the
      fact that the objects of the procedures were male.</p>

      <p class="text">In both cases, too, there were significant
      factual matters which militated against the drawing of global
      conclusions, both of which related to considerations of time.
      In <i>Re J</i>, Thorpe LJ had referred<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> to the practise of the Muslim
      community of delaying the procedure; in <i>Re A</i>, it is
      clear that the application had not been brought at the
      appropriate time. <i>Re J</i> does not attempt to deal with
      the concerns raised by Boyle and his colleagues<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> and <i>Re A</i> does not really get to
      grips with the issue of sterilization of people with
      disabilities at large. At the same time, the issues which
      these two cases raise are important, even if they do not
      resolve them. For that reason, they are of interest and put
      courts and commentators on notice for the future.</p>
