      <p class="text">COURT OF APPEAL, CIVIL DIVISION<br />
       DAME ELIZABETH BUTLER-SLOSS P, SCHLIEMANN AND THORPE,
      LJ<br />
       24, 25 NOVEMBER 1999</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Section 8 orders - Specific issue orders -
      Child living with non-practising Christian mother - Muslim
      father seeking order that son be circumcised - Whether judge
      correct to order circumcision not in child's best
      interests.</i></p>

      <p class="text">The English mother, who was a non-practising
      Christian, met the father, a non-practising Muslim of Turkish
      origin, whilst on holiday in Turkey in 1992. They married in
      Turkey later that year and subsequently returned to England.
      Their son, J, was born in March 1994 but the parents
      separated when he was two and a half years old. Thereafter J
      was brought up by the mother in an essentially secular
      household and his only contact with Islam was through his
      father, who, like the mother, did not have any Muslim
      friends, or mix is Muslim circles. However, when J was five
      years old the father applied for specific issue order under
      <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s8.html"
       target="_blank">Section 8</a> of the Children Act 1989 that
      J be circumcised. The father said that whilst pregnant the
      mother had agreed that any male child would be circumcised.
      The mother opposed the father's application, which was also
      opposed by the Official Solicitor acting as J's guardian ad
      litem. The judge held, inter alia, that although J was born a
      Muslim his upbringing was going to be essentially secular;
      that circumcision was an effectively irreversible surgical
      intervention which had no medical basis in J's case; that the
      mother who shared parental responsibility for J with the
      father but cared for him on a day-to-day basis, opposed
      circumcision; and that on the facts it was not in J's best
      interest to be circumcised. The father appealed with leave to
      the Court of Appeal contending, inter alia, that the judge
      confused the child's religion with the child's religious
      upbringing.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Held</b> - (1) <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s2.html"
       target="_blank">Section 2(7)</a><sup>1</sup> of the Children
      Act 1989 did not enable a parent to arrange male circumcision
      on a child without the consent of the other parent sharing
      parental responsibility. Furthermore, since the operation of
      circumcision was of considerable consequence and irreversible
      any disagreement between the holders of parental
      responsibility should be referred to the court for
      determination. Each case would depend on its particular
      facts.<br />
       (2) A child's perception of his or her religion generally
      depended on involvement in worship and teaching within his
      family from which developed the emotional, intellectual,
      psychological and spiritual sense of belonging to a religious
      faith. So for all practical purposes, the courts had been
      right to focus upon religious upbringing. There was no need,
      in the context of the present case to do more than be aware
      of the facts and then decide what weight to give them. The
      judge had not given inappropriate weight to any of the facts
      he had to consider and the appeal would be dismissed.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Appeal</b><br />
       The father appealed from the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/">decision</a>
      of Wall J (|1999| 2 FCR 345) whereby he refused the father's
      application for a specific issue order under s 8 of the
      Children Act 1989 that his five-year-old son be circumcised.
      The facts are set forth out in the judgement of Thorpe
      LJ.</p>

      <p><i>Lindsey Kushner QC</i> and <i>Richard Humphrey</i>
      (instructed by <i>Metcalfe Wright &amp; Piatr</i>) for the
      father.<br />
       <i>David Harris QC</i> and <i>Helen Matsk</i> (instructed by
      <i>Berry &amp; Berry, Cocker, Smith &amp; Co</i>) for the
      mother.<br />
       <i>Michael Nichols</i> (instructed by the <i>Official
      Solicitor</i>) as guardian ad litem.</p>

      <p>1. <b>DAME ELIZABETH BUTLER-SLOSS P.</b> I will ask Thorpe
      LJ to give the first judgment.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>2. THORPE LJ.</b> On 23 April 1999 Wall J
      gave a reserved judgment refusing a father's
      application for a specific issue order that his five-year-old
      so be circumcised (see | 1999 | 2 FCR 345). No earlier
      application raising this issue is known and accordingly, he
      gave permission to appeal to enable the father to bring his
      case to this court.</p>

      <p class="text">The judge's factual summary could not
      be bettered. What follows is all extracted from his judgment
      (at 347, 348, 349). I quote.</p>

      <p class="quote">"The father is 27. He is Turkish by
      birth and upbringing, and retains this Turkish nationality,
      although he is permanently resident in the United Kingdom and
      also has a British passport. He is a Muslim, although, as he
      freely accepts, he does not actively observe many of the
      tenets of his faith. The mother is 29. She is English, and
      apart from a short period around the time of her marriage to
      the father, when she lived with him in Turkey, she has lived
      throughout her life in England. She is notionally a Christian
      and a member of the Church of England but, like the father,
      she is non-practising. The parents met whilst the mother was
      on holiday in Turkey in the summer of 1992. Later that year
      she returned to Turkey, and she and the father were married
      in Turkey on 18 November 1992. It was a first marriage for
      both of them. . .The father says &hellip; that whilst the
      mother was pregnant with J she gave her agreement that any
      male child would be circumcised. I accept that evidence.
      Following the parents' return to England from Turkey in
      February 1993 the marriage, despite the birth of J in March
      1994, did not endure, and they separated on 29 September
      1996, when J was aged two and a half. J is five and attending
      a local state primary school. He is being brought up in an
      essentially secular household. The only contact he has with
      Islam is through his father. The mother has no Muslim friends
      and no connections with any member of the Muslim community.
      The father, likewise, does not appear to have Muslim friends
      or mix in Muslim circles."</p>

      <p class="text">4. Against that factual background, the judge
      then posed the question, what is J's religion? He
      answered it thus, adopting a a submission made by the
      guardian ad litem, the Official Solicitor (at 349). I
      quote:</p>

      <p class="quote">&hellip; In English law, therefore,[J] would
      seem to be being brought up as a "non-practising Christian"
      in accordance with the convictions of his mother with whom he
      lives and as a "non-practising Muslim" when he stays with his
      father. He therefore has a mixed heritage and an essentially
      secular lifestyle. He does not have a settled religious
      faith.'&hellip;</p>

      <p class="text">5. The judge turned to decide, first, a
      substantial issue as to whether the mother should be required
      to bring J us as a Muslim: an issue which is no longer live
      in this court since both parties accept the judge's
      pragmatic resolution under which the father is free during
      periods of contact to deal with this aspect in his own
      way.</p>

      <p class="text">6. The judge's approach to the dispute
      over circumcision was characteristically thorough. He
      considered the lawfulness of ritual male circumcision,
      concluding that it was lawful for two parties jointly
      exercising parental responsibility to arrange the ritual
      circumcision of their male child.</p>

      <p class="text">7. The judge then recorded medical attitudes
      to ritual circumcision., having heard evidence from a
      consultant paediatrician and having read the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/gmc/"
      target="_blank">GMC</a> and <a
      href="/library/statements/bma/" target="_blank">BMA</a>
      guidelines supplied by the Official Solicitor. He concluded
      that current mainstream medical opinion requires both
      parent's consent and particularly, maternal consent
      when the father lacks parental responsibility. Additionally,
      he recorded in the consultant's report that
      circumcision was not medically indicated for J since he did
      not suffer from any of the three medical conditions that can
      make circumcision either necessary or advisable. He also
      accepted the consultant's advice that-</p>

      <p class="text">The procedure is not pain free and there are
      potential risks both physical and psychological which may be
      small but which are nonetheless definite&hellip;. (See [1999]
      2 FCR 345 at 361.)</p>

      <p class="text">8. The judge's summary of the
      submission of the parties is full and in many ways favourable
      to the father. I need quote only one sentence (at 362):</p>

      <p class="quote">`By comparison with what I have to say
      was the mother's pallid and unconvincing statement of her
      religious beliefs, the father's passionate plea for J to be
      given his proper identity as a Muslim and for him to be
      thereby enabled to identify fully with his father was
      impressive.'</p>

      <p class="text">9. In an important section, the judge
      considered the likely effects of J of being circumcised.
      There, he made these significant findings (at 365):</p>

      <p class="quote">In Turkish society, a Muslim male child's
      peers will all be circumcised: in the circles in which J will
      grow up, he is likely to be in a small minority, and he will
      not have the reassurance that all his contemporaries have
      been through - or will go through - the same experience. The
      incident I have described also makes it clear to me that the
      mother, as J's primary carer, would find it extremely
      difficult to present the question of circumcision to J in a
      positive light, and unlike ritual circumcision occurring in
      the context of a Muslim family, where the event would be one
      of celebration and fulfilment, J's circumcision would be
      likely to be surrounded by tension and stress, even though
      the mother was able to agree with the father's counsel in
      cross-examination that she would, of course, care for J after
      the operation, and would have no difficulty changing
      dressings. In my judgment, the strained relationship between
      the parents, and the fact that as a circumcised child J would
      be unlike most of his peers, increases the risk that J will
      suffer adverse psychological effects from being
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">10. Against that background Wall J stated his
      conclusions, marshalling them by reference to the statutory
      checklist in 1(3) of the Children Act 1989. However, he
      preceded that exercise with this concise passage (at
      365):</p>

      <p class="text">The major benefit is that he will thereby be
      firmly identified with his father, and confirmed in the eyes
      of Islam as a Muslim. However, his circumcision would not be
      part of a family celebration, and he would not thereafter be
      brought up in a Muslim family environment.</p>

      <p class="quote">`The disadvantages are that despite
      the father's passionate defence of the procedure, J may be
      traumatised by it; he will, moreover, be living in the
      household of his mother, who disagrees with the procedure,
      and will find great difficulty in presenting it to J in a
      positive light.'</p>

      <p class="text">11. Finally, in refusing the application the
      judge stressed that his conclusion was finely balanced and
      depended on the facts as he had found them. He summarized the
      factors which had influenced his conclusion in the following
      four numbered paragraphs (at 367-368):</p>

      <p class="quote">(1) Although born a Muslim, it is clear to
      me that J is going to have an essentially secular upbringing
      in England. He is not going to mix in Muslim circles, and his
      main contact with Muslims and the Muslim ethos will be his
      contact with his father. J is therefore not going to grow up
      in an environment in which circumcision is a part of family
      life; or in which circumcision will be in conformity with the
      religion practised by his primary carer; or in which his
      peers have all been circumcised and for him not to be so
      would render him either unusual or an outsider. To the
      contrary, circumcision in the circles in which J is likely to
      move will be the exception rather than the rule.</p>

      <p class="quote">(2) Circumcision is an effectively
      irreversible surgical intervention which has no medical basis
      in J's case. It is likely to be painful and carries with it
      small but definable physical and psychological risks. For it
      to be ordered there would accordingly have to be clear
      benefits to J which would demonstrate that circumcision was
      in his interests notwithstanding the risks. The principal
      benefits put forward are J's identification as a Muslim and
      the strengthening of his bond with his father. The strength
      of each is substantially weakened, in my judgment, by the
      facts of J's life-style and his likely upbringing. As I have
      already made clear, he is not going to be brought up as a
      Muslim child, and the strength of his bond with his father -
      viewed from his perspective rather than the father's - is
      unlikely to be weakened if he is not circumcised unless the
      father chooses to allow the absence of circumcision to weaken
      it.</p>

      <p class="quote">(3) J is in the middle of a hostile battle
      between his parents over contact. He is to that extent a
      vulnerable child. The operation and the period leading up to
      it are likely to be highly stressful for the mother, who
      would find it difficult to explain to J why it was being
      undertaken and would have grave difficulty presenting it to J
      in a positive light. Furthermore, J is of an age and
      understanding to feel pain and discomfort without at the same
      time being fully able to understand why the operation was
      being carried out.</p>

      <p class="quote">(4) J's mother, who not only shares parental
      responsibility for him with his father but cares for him on a
      day-to-day basis and is currently the most important person
      in his life, is opposed to his circumcision, and there is a
      rational basis for her opposition. It is a strong thing to
      impose a medically unnecessary surgical intervention on a
      residential parent who is opposed to it. In my judgment, this
      should only be done if the evidence shows that J's welfare
      requires him to be circumcised. For the reasons I have given,
      I do not think that the evidence overall shows that it is in
      J's interests to be circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">12. By way of postscript, the judge dealt
      with art 9 of the <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
       target="_blank">Convention for the Protection of Human
      Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> (the European Convention
      on Human Rights) (Rome, 4 Novmber 1950, TS-7 (1953); Cmd
      8969) and with Art 24.3 of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/" target="_blank">United
      Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> (New York,
      20 November 1989: TS 44 (1992); Cm 1576). The judge correctly
      held that the father's right to manifest his religion
      had to be balanced against the welfare of the child and the
      rights of the mother. That holding has not been challenged in
      the course of this appeal.</p>

      <p class="text">13. I have summarized the judgment in this
      important case at length and have cited extensive passages
      since I accept the submission of Mr. Harris, QC that it is
      impregnable.</p>

      <p class="text">14. In presenting the father's appeal,
      Miss Kushner QC faced an uphill struggle with some fortitude.
      Her principal complaint was that the judge confused the
      child's religion with the child's religious
      upbringing. As the child of a Muslim father, J arrived in
      this world a Muslim. His family, during the first two years
      of his life, were practicing Muslims to a slight degree and
      the separation of his parents could not terminate his
      religion, particularly in the absence of any active step by
      his mother so to do.</p>

      <p class="text">15. That contention seems to me, at best, to
      be theoretically correct. For what it is worth, it weighs
      very light in the scale that the judge had to balance to
      determine whether the relief sought would advance J's
      welfare. Some faiths recognize their religion as a birthright
      derived from either the child's mother or the
      child's father. Some recognize religion by some
      ceremony of induction or initiation, but the newborn does not
      share the perception of his parents or of the religious
      community to which the parents belong. A child's
      perception of his or her religion generally depends on
      involvement in worship and teaching within the family. From
      this develops the emotional, intellectual, psychological and
      spiritual sense of belonging to a religious faith. So far,
      for all practical purposes, the courts have been right to
      focus upon religious upbringing and it is not surprise to me
      that there is no reported case focusing on a child's
      religion, as Miss Kushner defines it.</p>

      <p class="text">16. Miss Kushner also submitted to that in a
      number of respects the judge had underestimated the weight of
      points that told for her client or over estimated the weight
      of points that told for the mother. It is unnecessary to
      particularize. These were all fact dependent issues and none
      was a point of principle. It is impossible to demonstrate
      that Wall J erred on any issue of fact or in weighing the
      discretionary balance.</p>

      <p class="text">17. Miss Kushner further submitted that any
      considerations against circumcision were either transient or,
      if not transient, speculative. That submission seems to
      disregard the realities of child development. Fear, pain,
      despair or a sense of betrayal may all be transient in the
      temporal sense but still inflict emotional and psychological
      trauma that will burden the child for life.</p>

      <p class="text">18. Miss Kushner finally accused the judge of
      setting a general standard that hes denied her client success
      in this application and which would make future applications
      unlikely to succeed. She rests this submission on a single
      paragraph where the judge said (at 368):</p>

      <p class="quote">`I repeat that my decision in this
      case turns on its particular facts. I do not think it can be
      said that the court would not, in any circumstances, order a
      child to be circumcised. The example which was put in
      argument was that of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father
      with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been
      circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the
      parents then have another son who is born after they have
      separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his
      brothers; the father, for no good reason, refuses his
      agreement. In circumstances such as these, it seems to me
      that the court would be likely to grant the mother a specific
      issue order.'</p>

      <p class="text">19. It is immediately obvious to me that the
      paragraph does not begin to justify the charge. It merely
      emphasizes that each case must turn on its particular facts.
      I would not wish to be taken as laying down any more general
      guidance than the judge. The only certainty is that the
      social attitudes to male circumcision will remain extremely
      fluid. The only generalization I would feel confident to
      express, is that, in those communities where it is the
      practice to carry out circumcision in a male child within
      days of birth, there is much less likelihood of forensic
      dispute. Many of the issues in the present appeal could not
      have developed but for the practise of the father's
      community to defer circumcision to the age of about
      seven.</p>

      <p class="text">20. The only point of principle that this
      appeal decides is to indorse the judge's conclusion
      that <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s2.html"
       target="_blank">s 2(7)</a> of the 1989 Act does not enable a
      parent to arrange circumcision without the consent of the
      other parent. Section 2(7) provides:</p>

      <p class="quote">`Where more than one person has
      parental responsibility for a child, each of them may act
      alone and without the other (or others) in meeting that
      responsibility; but nothing in this Part shall be taken to
      effect the operation of any enactment which requires the
      consent of more than one person affecting the
      child.'</p>

      <p class="text">21. Mr Nicholls, for the Official Solicitor,
      submitted and the judge accepted that the operation of
      circumcision is of considerable consequence and irreversible.
      It must, therefore, join the exceptional categories where
      disagreement between holders of parental responsibility must
      be submitted to the court for determination. He has renewed
      that submission in this court. No one has opposed it and I
      would uphold it.</p>

      <p class="text">22. For these reasons, I would dismiss this
      appeal.</p>

      <p class="text">23. <b>SHIEMANN L.J.</b> I agree with the
      judgment that has just been delivered.</p>

      <p class="text">24. The question before the judge, faced with
      conflicting parental views, was whether to authorize the
      infliction of pain, the permanent loss of foreskin, and the
      exposure to the small risk of serious physical and
      psychological damage.</p>

      <p class="text">25. The object of this procedure was a child
      too young to give consent. Miss Kushner criticized the judge
      for mixing up the answers to what she maintained were two
      separate questions: What is the child's religion and,
      with what religious practices has the child been brought
      up?</p>

      <p class="text">26. She submitted that the child was a Muslim
      and the judge failed to give enough weight to what she
      described as `this fact'. The formulation of the
      first question bristles with conceptual and philosophical
      difficulties. However, it seems to me there was no need, in
      the context of the present case, to do more than be aware of
      the facts of which the judge was aware and then decide what
      weight to give them. The fact that the child is recognized as
      a Muslim under Muslim religious law was not and is not in
      issue. Nor is the fact that he was not brought up in a fully
      observant Muslim household.</p>

      <p class="text">27. It is clear that adherents of Islam would
      regard him as a fellow Muslim and that his father so regards
      him. There is no reason to suppose that the child himself at
      present perceives of himself as a Muslim or as belonging to
      any faith grouping. Nor is there any reason to suppose that,
      apart from the father, those by whom he is surrounded regard
      him as a Muslim or as the member of any other faith.</p>

      <p class="text">28. All of these facts were clear to the
      judge. He rightly regarded them as relevant to the questions
      he had to decide. I see no reason for holding that he gave
      inappropriate weight to any of them.</p>

      <p class="text">29. I agree with that the appeal should be
      dismissed.</p>

      <p class="text">30. <b>DAME ELIZABETH BUTLER-SLOSS P.</b> I
      agree with the judgment of Thorpe LJ and that this appeal
      should be dismissed. I add a comment on one aspect only. The
      Official Solicitor recommended to Wall J that where parents
      sharing responsibility were in disagreement over the
      circumcision of a male child, that issue should be referred
      to the court for determination. The judge accepted that
      submission and I entirely agree with him and the observations
      made by Thorpe LJ in his judgment.</p>

      <p class="text">31. There is in my view, a small group of
      important decision made on behalf of a child which in the
      absence of agreement of those with parental responsibility
      ought not to be carried out or arranged without the specific
      approval of the court. Sterilisation is one example. The
      change of a child's surname is another. Some of the
      examples, including the change of a child's surname,
      are based upon statute (see <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s13.html"
       target="_blank">s 13(1)</a> of the 1989 act).</p>

      <p class="text">32. The issue of circumcision has not, to my
      knowledge, previously been considered by this court but in my
      view it comes within that group. The decision to circumcise a
      child on grounds other than medical necessity is a very
      important one: the operation is irreversible, and should only
      be carried out where the parents together approve of it or,
      in the absence of parental agreement, where a court decides
      that the operation is in the best interests of the child.
      This requirement for a determination by the court should also
      apply to a local authority with parental responsibility under
      a care order.</p>

      <p class="text">33. The appeal is dismissed.</p>
