            </blockquote>

            <p>The English mother, who was a non-practising
            Christian, met the father, a non-practising Muslim of
            Turkish origin, whilst on holiday in Turkey in 1992.
            They married in Turkey later that year and, whilst the
            mother was prepared to convert to Islam and went
            through a religious marriage ceremony, she did not in
            fact do so. Following their return to England in
            February 1993 and despite the birth of their son, J, in
            March 1994, their marriage did not endure and they
            separated when J was two and a half years old. The
            mother left the matrimonial home with J, who remained
            with her; a position which was not challenged by the
            father. Thereafter the father made applications, inter
            alia, for two specific issue orders under s 8 of the
            Children Act 1989 (i) that J be brought up in the
            Muslim religion and (ii) that in order to fulfil his
            paternal duty to J within Islam, J be circumcised
            thereby confirming J's personal and religious identity
            and thus his upbringing. The district judge made a
            prohibitive steps order preventing the father from
            removing J from the jurisdiction pending final
            determination of his applications. Both applications
            were opposed by the mother, and by the Official
            Solicitor acting as J's guardian ad litem.</p>

            <p><b>Held</b> &#150; The applications would be
            dismissed for the following reasons&#151;</p>

            <p>(1) The court, in approaching the question of a
            child's religious upbringing, would apply the
            paramountcy of welfare test under s 1 of the 1989 Act
            to the particular facts of the individual case. A
            relevant factor was each parent's religious beliefs and
            practices. Applying those principles to the present
            case, whilst under Islamic law J was a Muslim, it was
            clear he would not be brought up in a Muslim
            environment; his father did not actively practice his
            religion or mix in Muslim circles. Circumcision apart,
            since all the father requested was the right to
            instruct J about Islam at the fairly simple and
            rudimentary level at which he understood it himself,
            those aspects of J's upbringing could be properly
            addressed by the father during contact. Furthermore, it
            was not practical to make an order that a child whose
            home was with his non-practising Christian mother
            should be brought up a Muslim.</p>

            <p>(2) Where two parents, jointly exercising parental
            responsibility for a male child caused him to be
            ritually circumcised in accordance with the tenets of
            their religion, that exercise of parental
            responsibility was lawful. However, where there was
            disagreement between those who had parental
            responsibility for the child, including a local
            authority exercising parental responsibility under a
            care order, circumcision was not to be carried out
            without the leave of the court, which would determine
            the question by applying s 1 of the 1989 Act to the
            facts of the individual case. Although it was clearly
            relevant that mainstream medical opinion required both
            paternal and in particular maternal consent when the
            father did not have parental responsibility, it was not
            determinative of the issue. The court plainly had the
            jurisdiction, in an appropriate case, to override a
            maternal veto, and if it did so, it would obviously be
            proper for the doctor to carry out the procedure.
            However the maternal veto was clearly a very powerful
            consideration in the welfare equation, particularly
            where, as in the present case, the parents were
            estranged, the mother did not share the same cultural
            and religious stance as the father, and she was the
            parent with residential care of the child. On the facts
            of the present case, there would be a prohibited steps
            order preventing the father from arranging or
            permitting J to be circumcised without the leave of the
            High Court.</p>

            <p>6 May 1999. The following judgment was handed
            down.</p>

            <p><b>WALL J.</b></p>

            <p>INTRODUCTION</p>

            <p>In these proceedings, the father of a male child
            (J), born on 23 March 1994 and thus five years old,
            seeks two specific issue orders under s 8 of the
            Children Act 1989. The first is that J be brought up in
            the Muslim religion. The second is that he be
            circumcised. Both applications are opposed by the
            child's mother, and by the Official Solicitor, who is
            J's guardian ad litem in relation to these aspects of
            the case. There is also an outstanding issue between
            the parents about aspects of the father's future
            contact with J, which I propose to address in a
            separate judgment.</p>

            <p>This judgment is being handed down in open court
            because, although the case ultimately turns on its own
            facts, it raises important issues on which there
            appears to be no authority. I am, however, more than
            usually anxious to ensure that the child in question
            should not be identified. I therefore propose to refer
            to him throughout this judgment by an initial, J: I
            also propose to refer to his parents only as &#145;the
            mother' and &#145;the father' respectively. Clearly,
            nothing must be published which in any way identifies J
            or his parents or the location in which they reside, or
            the school which J attends.</p>

            <p>Throughout this judgment I propose to use the phrase
            &#145;ritual circumcision' to mean circumcision carried
            out for religious or social purposes in order to
            distinguish it from surgical interventions designed to
            treat particular medical conditions.</p>

            <p>It should, however, be made clear at the outset that
            although the father in this case seeks J's circumcision
            both in order to fulfil his paternal duty to J within
            Islam, and to confirm J's status as a Muslim, he is
            content that the operation should be carried out in
            hospital under general anaesthetic by a qualified
            medical practitioner.</p>

            <p>For the purposes of these two applications, I heard
            oral evidence from both parents, and from Dr S, a
            consultant paediatrician instructed by the Official
            Solicitor. I had written evidence from an expert in
            Islamic law (Dr Doreen Hinchcliffe, a member of the
            English Bar) and from Dr Suhaib Hasan, the Secretary to
            the Islamic Shariah Council in London. I was also
            provided with a number of medical papers to which I
            will refer in due course.</p>

            <p>THE BACKGROUND TO THE APPLICATIONS</p>

            <p>The father is 27. He is Turkish by birth and
            upbringing, and retains his Turkish nationality,
            although he is permanently resident in the United
            Kingdom and also has a British passport. He is a
            Muslim, although, as he freely accepts, he does not
            actively observe many of the tenets of his faith.</p>

            <p>The mother is 29. She is English, and apart from a
            short period around the time of her marriage to the
            father, when she lived with him in Turkey, she has
            lived throughout her life in England. She is notionally
            a Christian and a member of the Church of England but,
            like the father, she is non-practising.</p>

            <p>The parents met whilst the mother was on holiday in
            Turkey in the summer of 1992. Later that year she
            returned to Turkey, and she and the father were married
            in Turkey on 18 November 1992. It was a first marriage
            for both of them.</p>

            <p>The parents underwent both civil and religious
            ceremonies of marriage. The mother's case is that
            whilst she was, at the time, prepared to convert to
            Islam, she did not in fact do so. She says that she was
            given some words to pronounce in Turkish at the
            religious ceremony; that these words were written out
            phonetically so that she could pronounce them; but that
            as she does not speak Turkish she had no understanding
            of what they meant, and nobody explained their
            significance to her. Whether this is right or wrong
            (the mother was a very unsatisfactory witness who, in
            an earlier hearing, gave what she now acknowledges was
            perjured evidence in relation to important aspects of
            the father's application for contact with J) it is
            plain to me that the mother is not a Muslim. She has
            neither knowledge of Islam nor any interest in
            acquiring it. It is clear to me that unless
            specifically directed to do so by the court, she would
            take no steps to acquaint J with Islam, or the Turkish
            side of his inheritance.</p>

            <p>The father says that not only did the mother tell
            him before the marriage that she would convert to Islam
            (although, in the event, he agrees that she did not do
            so); he also says that whilst the mother was pregnant
            with J she gave her agreement that any male child would
            be circumcised. I accept that evidence.</p>

            <p>Following the parents' return to England from Turkey
            in February 1993 the marriage, despite the birth of J
            in March 1994, did not endure, and they separated on 29
            September 1996, when J was aged two and a half. The
            reasons for the breakdown of the marriage are
            immaterial to this judgment. The mother left the
            matrimonial home, taking J with her. He has, since that
            date, made his home throughout with his mother, and the
            father has at no stage sought to challenge that
            position: to the contrary, he has made it clear on many
            occasions that in his view J's proper place of
            residence is with his mother.</p>

            <p>The mother petitioned for divorce on 3 October 1996
            and on the same day applied to the county court ex
            parte for an order that the father be restrained from
            removing J from her care and from the jurisdiction of
            the court. On the return date of the application, 14
            October 1996, a circuit judge, by consent, made a
            residence order in the mother's favour in relation to J
            with an order for reasonable contact with J by the
            father.</p>

            <p>There was a schedule of agreed contact which was set
            out in the order of the court. The father also gave
            undertakings not to remove J (1) from the mother's care
            save for purposes connected with contact and (2) from
            the jurisdiction of the court. Those undertakings were
            expressed to last until 14 January 1997.</p>

            <p>Unwisely, the father refused thereafter to renew the
            undertakings, and on 4 February 1997 a district judge
            made a prohibited steps order preventing the father
            from removing J from the jurisdiction pending final
            determination of his applications (inter alia) for
            specific issue orders that J be brought up in the
            Muslim religion and that he be circumcised, which he
            had issued on 10 January 1997.</p>

            <p>As will be apparent, the father's applications have
            taken an unconscionable time to come to a hearing. The
            reason for this is that at various stages, directions
            given by the court have simply not been obeyed. The
            result, undoubtedly, has been an overall heightening of
            tension between the parties.</p>

            <p>J's contact with his father has been problematic,
            and the issue has been before the court on a number of
            occasions. The mother's attitude to it latterly has
            been, at best, ambivalent and at worst obstructive. In
            order to frustrate the father's contact she even, at
            one point, went to the extent of lying on oath about
            both J's residence and where he was at school. She has
            furthermore persuaded herself that it is the father's
            intention permanently to remove J from the jurisdiction
            and from her care, and either to place him with his
            paternal grandparents in Turkey or to go and live with
            him in Turkey.</p>

            <p>For reasons which I have already given in a judgment
            delivered in chambers on 25 November 1998 I am
            satisfied (1) that contact between the father and J is
            in J's best interests;(2) that J both greatly enjoys
            and benefits from contact with his father; and (3) that
            the father has no intention of removing J either from
            his mother's care or (apart from holidays) from the
            jurisdiction of the court. I am also clear that it is
            in J's interests, in due course, to visit Turkey in
            order to meet members of his extended family on the
            father's side.</p>

            <p>The question of the father taking J to Turkey on
            holiday is, however, linked with the question of his
            circumcision. If I decide that J should not be
            circumcised, the question arises as to whether or not
            the father's family and/or a Turkish court would accept
            that decision and feel themselves bound by it. The
            father assured me in evidence that he would respect the
            English court's decision, however much he might
            disagree with it, and would not seek to have J
            circumcised in Turkey. The father also recognised that
            if J returned from Turkey circumcised that would
            constitute a clear contempt of the English court.</p>

            <p>The question of a holiday for J in Turkey with his
            father raises a number of other issues; and for a
            variety of reasons (including the inter-action between
            the questions of circumcision and leave to the father
            to remove J from the jurisdiction to Turkey for a
            holiday), I took the view that it would be sensible to
            deal first with the issues of religious upbringing and
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>These are accordingly addressed in this judgment.
            The question of the holiday in Turkey will then be
            dealt with once this judgment has been handed down.</p>

            <p>WHAT IS J'S RELIGION? DOES J HAVE A RELIGION AT THE
            MOMENT?</p>

            <p>I am satisfied that in Islamic law, J is a Muslim.
            The evidence of Dr Hasan is that, in Islam, children of
            parents either of whom is Muslim are considered
            Muslims: J has a Muslim father, therefore he is a
            Muslim in the eyes of Islam.</p>

            <p>That opinion is supported by Dr Hinchcliffe, who
            reports as follows:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;A Muslim woman may never validly marry a
              non-Muslim man. The law, however, allows a Muslim
              male to contract a marriage with a non-Muslim woman,
              provided she belongs to one of the revealed
              religions, ie Judaism or Christianity. Any child of
              such a marriage is a Muslim. It is a principle of
              Islamic law that the child of a Muslim father is
              always considered to be a Muslim.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It is, therefore, clear to me that in Islamic law, J
            is to be regarded as a Muslim.</p>

            <p>Is the position the same in English law? J's mother,
            who has a residence order and is J's primary carer, is
            nominally a Christian. J is five, and attending a local
            state primary school. He is being brought up in an
            essentially secular household. The only contact he has
            with Islam is through his father. The mother has no
            Muslim friends and no connections with any members of
            the Muslim community. The father, likewise, does not
            appear to have Muslim friends or mix in Muslim circles.
            The evidence does not disclose that there are any other
            Muslim children at J's school.</p>

            <p>In his clear and careful submissions on this point,
            counsel for the Official Solicitor, J's guardian ad
            litem, having accepted that in the eyes of Islam, J is
            a Muslim, argues as follows:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;The position in English law is not so clear
              cut. The Official Solicitor's submission is that the
              religious persuasion a child is being brought up in
              must be a matter of fact, to be determined from all
              the relevant circumstances. Thus, a child of Muslim
              parents who is too young to make a decision about his
              religious convictions will be regarded as being
              brought up in the Muslim faith. In [J]'s case, the
              evidence is that he has had very little exposure to
              Islam. He lives with his mother who was baptised as,
              and thinks of herself as, a Christian, although she
              does not attend church services. From the evidence,
              the practice or philosophy of Christianity appears to
              play a very small part in her life. She does not see
              [J] as a Muslim child. [J]'s father is Muslim as far
              as Islamic law is concerned, and would probably be so
              regarded in English law. Equally, however, he has not
              attended a Mosque whilst in England and last attended
              one in Turkey some three years ago. The father's
              expectations of observance seem to be that of a
              non-practising Muslim. In English law, therefore,[J]
              would seem to be being brought up as a
              "non-practising Christian" in accordance with the
              convictions of his mother with whom he lives and as a
              "non-practising Muslim" when he stays with his
              father. He therefore has a mixed heritage and an
              essentially secular lifestyle. He does not have a
              settled religious faith.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I respectfully agree with that analysis by the
            Official Solicitor.</p>

            <p>CIRCUMCISION IN ISLAM</p>

            <p>According to Dr Hinchcliffe, circumcision is not
            mentioned in the text of the Koran, but in the Sunna
            (the practice of the Prophet Mohammed), which is the
            second recognised source of law, it is strongly
            recommended, and sayings from the Prophet himself are
            cited in support of the practice. Thus although
            circumcision does not occupy a prominent place in the
            traditional texts of Islamic law, Muslims regard it as
            a necessity to fulfil their faith. That is certainly
            the father's position.</p>

            <p>In Islamic law, responsibility for ensuring that a
            male child is circumcised lies with his father, and
            Islam does not consider that it is a decision for the
            child to make for himself. The decision when to
            circumcise is also made by the father, and the evidence
            is that Muslim practice varies from locality to
            locality. According to Dr Hinchcliffe, some jurists
            assert that the father must ensure that the child is
            circumcised before puberty, whilst others state more
            precisely that the child should be circumcised on the
            seventh day after birth. The father himself was
            circumcised in Turkey when he was six or seven.</p>

            <p>Dr Hasan describes circumcision of a boy
            as&#151;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;an obligatory duty which should preferably
              be done at a tender age which helps the wound to heal
              quickly. It is a father's duty to carry it out as
              soon as possible. [If] he doesn't do it while the
              child is still a minor, he would be failing in this
              duty.'</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>HOW SHOULD THE TWO ISSUES OF RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING
            AND CIRCUMCISION BE APPROACHED?</p>

            <p>The father's two applications are separate, but
            clearly closely inter-linked. Each is for an order
            under s 8 of the Children Act 1989, and is governed by
            the paramountcy of welfare principle in s 1. The
            &#145;welfare checklist' under s 1(3) applies to
            each.</p>

            <p>The father sees circumcision as an essential part of
            J's personal and religious identity and thus of his
            upbringing. The Official Solicitor agrees that ritual
            circumcision is a question of &#145;upbringing' for the
            purposes of s 1 of the Act: however, he argues that the
            decision whether or not to order J to be circumcised is
            effectively dependent on (alternatively should be
            heavily influenced by) the broader question of whether
            or not he is to be brought up as a Muslim.</p>

            <p>In para 34 of his report he puts the matter
            thus:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;I do not consider it likely, on the present
              evidence, that [J] will mix in a Muslim environment
              and have increasing contact with the Muslim
              community. It is this which might make it possible to
              view circumcision as promoting his welfare. Without
              that likelihood, there is nothing to weigh against
              the evidence as to the medical risks.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Whilst, for reasons which will emerge, I do not
            accept that proposition in the stark form in which it
            is advanced, I do agree that the question of [J]'s
            circumcision must be seen in the broad context of his
            overall upbringing, and accordingly it seems to me
            sensible to look at the question of religious
            upbringing first.</p>

            <p>SHOULD THE COURT MAKE A SPECIFIC ISSUE ORDER
            REQUIRING J TO BE BROUGHT UP AS A MUSLIM?</p>

            <p>Up until 1925, the law was that, unless there were
            special circumstances, children had to be brought up in
            the religion of their father, although the stresses
            that imposed were recognised as early as 1871 by Mr
            Wickens, the Vice-Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
            in <i>Hawksworth v Hawksworth</i> (1871) 6 LR Ch App
            539,[1861&#150;73] All ER Rep 314. In that case, as the
            headnote reads ((1871) 6 LR Ch App 539):</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;A Roman Catholic died leaving a widow who
              was a Protestant, and an infant daughter, then six
              months old. He left no directions as to his child's
              religious education. The child was brought up by her
              mother as a Protestant until she was eight years and
              a half old. A suit having been instituted for the
              administration of the father's estate, the Court made
              an order that the child should be brought up in the
              Roman Catholic faith. The Court did not think it
              advisable to have an interview with the child.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Mr Wickens V-C, having shortly stated the facts,
            continued (at 540):</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;I must, I conceive, hold that the child is
              to be brought up in the father's faith&#151;that is
              as a Roman Catholic&#151;unless there are special
              circumstances to exclude the general rule . . . Were
              I at liberty to follow my own opinion, I should have
              no hesitation in acceding to Mr. <i>Jackson's</i>
              argument. For to direct that this ward shall be
              brought up in the Roman Catholic faith will be to
              create a barrier between a widowed mother and her
              only child; to annul the mother's influence over her
              daughter on the most important of all subjects, with
              the almost inevitable effect of weakening it on all
              others; to introduce a disturbing element into a
              union which ought to be as close, as warm, and as
              absolute as any known to man; and lastly, to inflict
              severe pain on both mother and child. But it is clear
              that no argument which would recognise any right in
              the widowed mother to bring up her child in a
              religion different from the father's can be allowed
              to weigh with me at all.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The rule that children had to be brought up in the
            religion of their father was abolished by s 1 of the
            Guardianship of Minors Act 1925, and although many
            parents (including J's mother) would not, today, regard
            religion as &#145;the most important of all subjects',
            the thrust behind Mr Wickens V-C's observations in
            <i>Hawksworth v Hawksworth</i> seems to me to have
            stood the test of time and to provide a valid rationale
            for not insisting that a child be brought up in a
            religion which is not that of the residential
            parent.</p>

            <p>The mother on this point puts forward the same
            argument as the Official Solicitor. Whilst accepting
            that in the eyes of Islam J is to be regarded for all
            time as being a Muslim, she argues that in English law
            the position in Islamic law is but one factor to be
            taken into account in determining the religious
            upbringing (if any) required in J's welfare interests,
            and that the weight (if any) to be attached to the
            position of Islam must necessarily depend on the actual
            and potential importance of Islam in the child's life.
            Her counsel's skeleton argument continues:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;In principle, however, it is normally wholly
              inappropriate for the court to require a child to be
              brought up in a particular religion, contrary to the
              wishes, beliefs, and way of life of the residential
              parent. To impose upon a child a religious upbringing
              which is not shared by, and perhaps resented by, the
              residential parent is to expose the child to a
              significant risk of confusion, conflict of loyalty,
              and a damaging perception that he is in important
              respects incompatible with the psychological and
              emotional environment in which he lives. His
              consequential distress and resentment may impose
              strains upon his relationship with his carer and/or
              with the non-residential parent who has forced him
              into what he perceives to be an unacceptable
              position.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Whilst, in my judgment, this passage somewhat
            over-states the case, its underlying thrust seems to be
            sound when applied to the facts of this particular
            case.</p>

            <p>In this context it is, I think, highly relevant to
            look at what, in practice, the father seeks so far as
            J's religious upbringing is concerned. The relief
            sought by the father on this aspect of the case, as set
            out in the skeleton argument prepared by his counsel,
            is as follows:(1) that J be circumcised as required by
            the Muslim religion;(2) the right to teach J about
            Islam and God to familiarise him with Muslim
            practices;(3) to celebrate Id Mubarak with him;(4) for
            J not to eat pork. At the same time, the father is
            expressly content:(5) that J should enjoy Christian
            Festivals such as Christmas and Easter;(6) that he
            should learn about Jesus and the prophets; and (7) that
            he should be allowed to eat meat which is not Halal
            meat (except pork).</p>

            <p>THE LAW</p>

            <p>It is common ground that the court must apply the
            paramountcy of welfare test under s 1 of the Children
            Act 1989 to the question of a child's religious
            upbringing, and that the welfare checklist under s 1(3)
            applies. It is also clear to me that each case will
            depend on its particular facts.</p>

            <p>The process of deciding whether or not to make a
            specific issue order involves a consideration of s 1(5)
            of the Act. I must not make an order unless I consider
            that doing so would be better for J than making no
            order at all.</p>

            <p>The Children Act 1989 does not impose any obligation
            on parents in respect of religious upbringing or
            instruction. Section 3, which defines parental
            responsibility, describes it as&#151;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;all the rights, duties, powers,
              responsibilities and authority which by law a parent
              of a child has in relation to the child and his
              property.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Parental responsibility thus clearly includes the
            right to bring up children in a particular religious
            faith, or in none.</p>

            <p>The court's powers in private law proceedings to
            control the exercise of parental responsibility by one
            or both parents are contained in s 8 of the 1989 Act. A
            &#145;specific issue order' under that section is
            defined as&#151;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;an order giving directions for the purpose
              of determining a specific question which has arisen,
              or which may arise, in connection with any aspect of
              parental responsibility for a child.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>A prohibited steps order, under the same section, is
            defined as&#151;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;an order that no step which could be taken
              by a parent in meeting his parental responsibility
              for a child, and which is of a kind specified in the
              order, shall be taken by any person without the
              consent of the court.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Section 11(7) also empowers the court to give
            directions in relation to any s 8 order &#145;about how
            it is to be carried into effect', and to impose
            conditions which must be complied with by any person
            with whom the child is living.</p>

            <p>Parts I and II of the 1989 Act are otherwise silent
            on the specific question of religious upbringing,
            although the question of religion is clearly embraced
            within &#145;the welfare checklist' in s 1(3) of the
            Act under the heading &#145;educational needs' in s
            1(3)(b); under &#145;background' in s 1(3)(d); in an
            appropriate case, it could also come within &#145;the
            likely effect on (the child) of any change in his
            circumstances' in s 1(3)(c). Furthermore, it may be
            relevant to the capacity of each of the child's parents
            in meeting his needs: s 1(3)(f).</p>

            <p>It is noticeable that whilst no restrictions are
            placed on parents by Pt II of the Children Act in
            relation to the religious upbringing of their children,
            local authorities, under s 33(6)(a) are prohibited from
            causing children in their care to be brought up in any
            religious persuasion other than that in which such
            children would have been brought up if care orders had
            not been made. In addition, the particulars to be taken
            into account by a local authority in considering
            suitability of persons and household, when making any
            &#145;placement decision' about a child in its care
            include &#145;religious persuasion and degree of
            observance, racial origin and cultural and linguistic
            background': see Sch 1, para 1(h) to the Placement of
            Children with Parents, etc Regulations 1991, SI
            1991/893. These provisions, in my judgment, underline
            the freedom which parents have over the question of
            their children's religious education and
            upbringing.</p>

            <p>The attitude of the courts to the question of a
            child's religious upbringing is clear. The religious
            beliefs and practices of the parents are relevant
            factors to be taken into account when applying the
            paramountcy of welfare test. The approach is aptly
            summarised by Purchas LJ in <i>Re R</i> (<i>a
            minor</i>)(<i>religious sect</i>) [1993] 2 FCR 525 at
            534:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;It is no part of the court's function to
              comment upon the tenets, doctrines or rules of any
              particular section of society provided that these are
              legally and socially acceptable . . The impact of the
              tenets, doctrines and rules of a society upon a
              child's future welfare must be one of the relevant
              circumstances to be taken into account by the court
              when applying the provisions of s. 1 of the Children
              Act 1989. The provisions of that section do not alter
              in their impact from one case to another and they are
              to be applied to the tests set out in accordance with
              the generally accepted standards of society, bearing
              in mind that the paramount objective of the exercise
              is promoting the child's welfare, not only in the
              immediate, but also in the medium and long-term
              future during his or her minority. This is well
              established.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Applying these principles it would, of course, on
            appropriate facts, be open to the court to decide that
            a child should be brought up in a particular religion,
            even though that religion was not one practised by the
            parent with whom the child resides, although such a
            course would be unusual. In each case, the welfare test
            under s 1 of the Act must be applied to the particular
            facts of the individual case.</p>

            <p>THE APPLICATION OF THE WELFARE TEST TO THE FACTS OF
            THIS PARTICULAR CASE</p>

            <p>The reality of this case is that J is not going to
            be brought up in a Muslim environment. He is not going
            to mix in Muslim circles. He is unlikely to have many
            Muslim friends. He will be living in a non-practising
            Christian household. When with his father he will not
            be expected to attend the Mosque. His father does not
            actively practice his religion, or mix in Muslim
            circles.</p>

            <p>Circumcision apart, all that the father requests in
            this case is the right to instruct J about Islam at the
            fairly simple and rudimentary level at which he
            presently understands it himself. He does not request
            outside instruction for J or that his son should attend
            the Mosque. It therefore seems to me that these aspects
            of J's upbringing can properly be addressed by the
            father during contact.</p>

            <p>In these circumstances, and given the level of the
            relief which the father seeks, I do not think it
            necessary to set out the terms of s 1(3) of the Act and
            to go through all its provisions in turn, although I
            have, of course, had regard to them. I do not think it
            would be better for J to make an order on this aspect
            of the case. I also agree with the Official Solicitor
            that, on the facts of this case, it is not practical to
            make an order that a child whose home is with a mother
            who is a non-practising Christian should be brought up
            as a Muslim. In my judgment, therefore, the &#145;no
            order' principle in s 1(5) applies to this aspect of
            the case.</p>

            <p>As to eating pork, this is an issue which, in my
            judgment, should be a matter for compromise and
            agreement between the parties. The mother, I think,
            would be wise to respect the father's views about it.
            However, it does not seem to me to be in J's welfare
            interests for me to make a specific order in relation
            to it.</p>

            <p>In so far as authority is relevant to the particular
            facts of the instant case, the decision nearest in
            point seems to me to be <i>Haleem v Haleem</i> (1975) 5
            Fam Law 184, in which the Court of Appeal reversed a
            judge who had split the two sons (aged six and one) of
            a practising Muslim father and an agnostic mother on
            the basis that the father would be able to provide the
            elder boy in particular with a religious education.
            Making an order that both children reside with the
            mother, the Court of Appeal took the view that whilst
            the father set great store by both children being
            brought up in the Muslim faith and culture, the court
            had to consider other factors when applying the welfare
            test, not least the fact that the children were going
            to live in England and attend English schools, and
            needed to be brought up together. The Court of Appeal
            also took the view that the children would have the
            opportunity to pick up Arabic and to absorb their
            father's outlook during periods of contact.</p>

            <p>This latter consideration seems to me to apply
            particularly to the instant case. The father's
            perspective, of course, is that circumcision is an
            essential element of a male Muslim's identity. However,
            so far as the remaining items identified by the father
            as required for J's religious upbringing are concerned,
            it does not seem to me that an order is either
            necessary or appropriate.</p>

            <p>There will, accordingly, be no order on the father's
            application that J be brought up in the Muslim
            religion.</p>

            <p>CIRCUMCISION: IS RITUAL MALE CIRCUMCISION
            LAWFUL?</p>

            <p>The only judicial reference which counsel were able
            to find in relation to male circumcision is a dictum of
            Lord Templeman in <i>R v Brown</i> (<i>Anthony</i>)
            [1994] 1 AC 212 at 231,[1993] 2 All ER 75 at
            78&#150;79, which is clearly obiter. The case concerned
            a number of sado-masochistic men who were convicted of
            assaults upon each other, notwithstanding that each had
            consented to the assaults in question. Lord Templeman
            said:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;In some circumstances violence is not
              punishable under the criminal law. When no actual
              bodily harm is caused, the consent of the person
              affected precludes him from complaining. There can be
              no conviction for the summary offence of common
              assault if the victim has consented to the assault.
              Even when violence is intentionally inflicted and
              results in actual bodily harm, wounding or serious
              bodily harm the accused is entitled to be acquitted
              if the injury was a foreseeable incident of a lawful
              activity in which the person injured was
              participating. Surgery involves intentional violence
              resulting in actual or sometimes serious bodily harm
              but surgery is a lawful activity. Other activities
              carried on with consent by or on behalf of the
              injured person have been accepted as lawful
              notwithstanding that they involve actual bodily harm
              or may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual
              circumcision, tattooing, ear-piercing and violent
              sports including boxing are lawful activities.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>J is plainly not in a position to give an informed
            consent to his circumcision, and that consent must,
            accordingly, be given either by those with parental
            responsibility for him, or by the court. In the instant
            case, each parent has parental responsibility, but they
            do not agree. It follows that the decision must be
            taken by the court.</p>

            <p>Lord Templeman's view that ritual male circumcision
            carried out pursuant to consent given by a child's
            parents is lawful is supported by the Law Commission,
            in its consultation paper number 139
            entitled<i>Criminal Law. Consent in the Criminal Law. A
            consultation paper</i> (1995). At para 9.2 there
            appears the following statement:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;Male circumcision is lawful under English
              common law. Male circumcision is insisted on by
              Islamic and Jewish law. It is generally accepted that
              the removal of the foreskin of the penis has little,
              if any, effect on a man's ability to enjoy sexual
              intercourse, and this act is not, therefore, regarded
              as a mutilation. The traditional reason for male
              circumcision appears to have been a hygienic one.
              Several respondents supported the continuing legality
              of ritual circumcision in general terms, and ACPO
              [the Association of Chief Probation Officers] said
              that it would be desirable to make the position
              entirely clear by formulating rules as to the nature
              of the consent given by the victim and the limits and
              the circumstances in which consent is legally
              effective. Since ritual circumcision is customarily
              carried out by someone who is not a qualified doctor,
              the practice of male circumcision would not be
              protected by a purely medical exemption.' (See The
              Law Commission Consultation Papers vol 23, p
              119&#150;120.)</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The lawfulness of male circumcision is accepted by
            the British Medical Association, although it
            acknowledges in its <a
            href="/library/statements/bma/"><i>Guidance for
            Doctors</i></a> on the subject that &#145;male
            circumcision has never been the subject of a case in
            English law, but this assumption of lawfulness has
            never been challenged'.</p>

            <p>Female circumcision is prohibited by the Prohibition
            of Female Circumcision Act 1985. Section 1(1) of this
            Act makes it a criminal offence, punishable by fine or
            imprisonment&#151;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;(a) to excise, infibulate or otherwise
              mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora or
              labia minora or clitoris of another person; or (b) to
              aid, abet, counsel or procure the performance by
              another person of any of those acts on that other
              person's own body.'</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>There is a saving in s 2(1) for the performance of
            surgery by a registered medical practitioner which is
            necessary for the patient's physical or mental health,
            and for surgery performed during labour or after birth.
            However, by s 2(2):</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;In determining for the purposes of this
              section whether an operation is necessary for the
              mental health of a person, no account shall be taken
              of the effect on that person of any belief on the
              part of that or any other person that the operation
              is required as a matter of custom or ritual.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Infibulation is the fastening of the sexual organs
            with a fibula, or clamp. The distinction drawn in the
            medical literature to which I was referred between male
            and female circumcision is that whilst both involve the
            alteration or removal of tissue where there is no
            disease present, the latter is undoubtedly a mutilation
            which is designed to control female sexuality and
            which, when performed without anaesthetic, with crude
            cutting instruments and with few or no precautions
            against infection is life-threatening, as well as
            resulting in a total loss of stimulation. The medical
            profession is thus agreed on its detrimental effects on
            physical, sexual and mental health.</p>

            <p>There is also, however, a body of medical opinion
            which regards both male and female circumcision as
            invasive procedures involving unnecessary mutilation of
            the genitals, and which calls for male circumcision to
            be criminalised, except in the rare cases where it is
            medically called for.</p>

            <p>The Law Commission also draws a distinction between
            male circumcision and other assaults on the bodies of
            children by their parents. Thus in<i>R v Adesanya</i>,
            reported only as a news item in the Times for 16 and 17
            July 1994, a Nigerian member of the Yoruba people,
            resident in Tottenham, North London, was convicted at
            the Central Criminal Court of assault occasioning
            actual bodily harm for having made incisions with a
            razor in the cheeks of her two sons, aged 14 and 9
            respectively, in accordance with the ritualistic
            customs of her tribe.</p>

            <p>The report indicates that both children were willing
            parties. However, the trial judge, Judge King-Hamilton
            QC ruled that the existence of tribal custom was no
            defence, although the defendant received an
            unconditional discharge.</p>

            <p>The Law Commission cites four reasons to justify
            this approach. They are:(1) the reason given by the
            judge namely the potential for serious injury &#150; in
            that the slightest movement of the child's head might
            have led to injury to his eye;(2) the reason that
            impelled Parliament to enact the Tattooing of Minors
            Act 1969, namely that a minor who consents to such an
            act at the time may come to regret it in later adult
            life;(3) increasing inobservance of the ritual in
            Nigeria itself made its tolerance as a special case in
            England less defensible; and (4) the argument that the
            essence of the criminal law is that it imposes a
            minimum standard of behaviour upon all who live in
            England and Wales. Thus if there are to be any special
            exemptions for foreigners these must be decided upon by
            the legislature and not by the courts.</p>

            <p>A case can be made for describing ritual male
            circumcision without any medical need for it as an
            assault on the bodily integrity of the child; indeed,
            that is the case which is made in much of the medical
            literature to which I was referred. However, although
            the origins of ritual circumcision are unknown, the
            fact remains that there have, historically, been a
            number of medical justifications put forward for male
            circumcision, and there are certain specific, albeit
            rare, medical conditions for which it is currently
            deemed necessary. Whilst the medical benefits of ritual
            male circumcision are now controversial, the fact
            remains that not only is it insisted upon by Muslims
            and Jews, but that male circumcision itself has, over
            the years, become an accepted practice amongst a
            significant number of parents in England.</p>

            <p>In my judgment, therefore, where two parents,
            jointly exercising parental responsibility for a male
            child cause him to be ritually circumcised in
            accordance with the tenets of their religion, that
            exercise of parental responsibility is lawful.</p>

            <p>MEDICAL ATTITUDES TO RITUAL CIRCUMCISION</p>

            <p>Through the good offices of Dr S, I was provided
            with a number of articles from medical journals.
            Through the good offices of the Official Solicitor, I
            was also given the <a
            href="/library/statements/gmc/"><i>Guidance for doctors
            who are asked to circumcise male children</i></a>
            published by the General Medical Council (GMC) and the
            guidance on the same subject published by the British
            Medical Association (BMA). The Chairman of the Medical
            Ethics Committee of the BMA also kindly made available
            an up-to-date draft of a discussion paper on male
            infant circumcision. The latter was made available on
            the basis that, since it was a draft, it did not
            represent formal BMA policy.</p>

            <p>The GMC <i>Guidance for Doctors</i> who are asked to
            circumcise male children summarises the debate about
            circumcision in these terms:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;Circumcision raises difficult questions
              about the rights and freedoms of individuals. Many
              people maintain that individuals have a right to
              practice their religion unhindered. Others feel that
              it is unequivocally wrong to undertake a surgical
              procedure, with its attendant risks, on an infant who
              is unable to consent. These are not solely medical
              matters and we do not think they can be resolved by
              the medical profession alone. They are matters for
              society as a whole to decide.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In my judgment, following <i>Re R</i> (<i>a
            minor</i>)(<i>residence: religion</i>)[1993] 2 FCR 525
            it is no part of the court's function to take a stance
            anywhere along this spectrum of opinion. English law,
            as I understand it to be, is as follows:(1) that as an
            exercise of joint parental responsibility, male ritual
            circumcision is lawful; however (2) where there is a
            disagreement between those who have parental
            responsibility for the child as to whether or not he
            should be circumcised, the issue is one within the
            court's jurisdiction under s 8 of the 1989 Act; and (3)
            the court must decide the question by the application
            of s 1 of the 1989 Act to the facts of the individual
            case.</p>

            <p>The BMA's <a
            href="/library/statements/bma/"><i>Guidance for
            Doctors</i></a> on the ritual circumcision of male
            infants take a similar stance. The BMA does not have a
            policy on the ethics of male circumcision for religious
            or cultural purposes. It is, however, noteworthy that
            the BMA strongly recommends that either the written
            consent of <i>both</i> parents or of the person with
            parental responsibility be obtained for circumcision;
            parents must be aware of the nature and implications of
            the procedure, and the risks involved. The guidance
            also contains this paragraph:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;Doctors should be aware of potential
              difficulties if both parents do not follow the same
              cultural tradition. A case raised with the BMA
              concerned a GP who had circumcised, without any
              enquiry, a baby unknown to him but whose parents
              were, in fact, unmarried and estranged. The child's
              father had taken the baby without the mother's
              permission, fully aware that the procedure would be
              completely contrary to her wishes and that he had no
              legal right to consent. The mother made a formal
              complaint about the doctor concerned.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The BMA's <i>Guidance</i> is summarised thus:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;*Circumcision is not unlawful but care must
              be taken to obtain appropriate consent from the
              parent(s) and inform them of the implications, as
              with any other surgical procedure.</p>

              <p>*Circumcision for medical purposes should be
              carried out in accordance with accepted good clinical
              practice.</p>

              <p>*Doctors must consider the situation of each case
              with which they are presented and act according to
              their clinical judgment.</p>

              <p>*It is recommended that written parental consent
              be obtained.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>A similar stance is taken by the GMC in its guidance
            for doctors.</p>

            <p>Since the father of a child who is not married to
            the child's mother only has parental responsibility by
            agreement or by order of a court, I take the BMA and
            the GMC <i>Guidance</i> to mean, in practice, that it
            is undesirable to circumcise a male infant without the
            consent of his mother.</p>

            <p>In my judgment, it is plainly relevant to my
            decision that mainstream medical opinion (as
            represented by the BMA and GMC guidelines), requires
            both paternal and maternal consent and in particular
            requires maternal consent when the father of the child
            does not have parental responsibility. That fact
            cannot, however, be determinative of the issue. If
            parents disagree about the circumcision of their son,
            and the issue has to be decided by the court, the court
            plainly has the jurisdiction, in an appropriate case,
            to override a maternal veto, and if it does so, it
            would plainly be proper for a doctor to carry out the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>However, a maternal veto is plainly a very powerful
            consideration in the welfare equation, particularly
            where, as here, the parents are estranged, the mother
            does not share the same cultural and religious stance
            as the father, and she is the parent with residential
            care of the child.</p>

            <p>THE EVIDENCE OF DR S</p>

            <p>Dr S's evidence confirmed that ritual circumcision
            remains a contentious issue from the medical
            perspective. There were, however, he said, three
            medical conditions for which circumcision was
            indicated. They are:</p>

            <p>(1) True pathological phimosis. This is a condition
            in which the tightness of the prepuce (foreskin)
            prevents retraction of the foreskin over the glans. In
            this condition the tip of the penis becomes white and
            scarred. It is a rare condition, and the peak incidence
            is between the ages of 9 and 11.</p>

            <p>(2) Balanoposthitis. This is a generalised
            inflammation of the penis and the foreskin,
            characterised by soreness, irritation and discharge. It
            is caused by an infection under the foreskin. If it is
            recurrent, surgery may be considered.</p>

            <p>(3) Paraphimosis. This is a condition in which the
            edge of the foreskin is retracted behind the glans and
            becomes too tight to be pulled forward. It results in
            swelling of the tip of the penis. Reduction can be
            carried out by manipulation, but on occasions the
            restricting ring may need a small incision.
            Circumcision would be considered later if there was a
            recurrence.</p>

            <p>There is no evidence to suggest that J suffers from
            any of these conditions, and accordingly no suggestion
            that circumcision is medically indicated for him. Dr S
            told me, however, that if J were to be circumcised this
            could be carried out as a day case. J would be likely
            to be unconscious for about 20 to 30 minutes. It would
            be a painful procedure, and pain relief would be
            provided by an anaesthetic block of the sensory nerve,
            with oral analgesia and application of topical local
            anaesthetic gel continuing for some 48 hours after
            surgery. Dr S said that J's mother or other carer would
            need to bathe the penis regularly, following detailed
            instructions from the surgical team.</p>

            <p>So far as the risks of surgery are concerned, Dr S
            referred me to a paper by Williams and Kapila, two
            English paediatric surgeons, published in the British
            Journal of Surgery in 1993 entitled <a
            href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/"><i>Complications
            of Circumcision</i></a>. He also referred me to the
            literature on the possible psychological effects of
            circumcision, including the <a
            href="/library/psych/freud/">psychoanalytic view</a>,
            expressed by Anna Freud, that for a child between the
            ages of four and five&#151;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;any surgical interference with the child's
              body may serve as a focal point for the activation,
              reactivation, grouping and rationalisation of the
              ideas of being attacked, overwhelmed and/or
              castrated.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Against this, as Dr S acknowledged, were the
            propositions that circumcision may encourage
            identification with the child's father, and that in
            societies where circumcision was linked to religion or
            tradition, an uncircumcised male may be an outcast.</p>

            <p>Much of the medical literature to which Dr S
            referred is passionately argued, and it is clear that
            Dr S was correct when he described ritual circumcision
            as &#145;a very contentious, emotive and passionate
            issue worldwide'.</p>

            <p>I do not think that it is either necessary or
            appropriate for me to attempt to review the medical
            literature identified by Dr S in detail, even if I was
            qualified to do so. I think it sufficient, for the
            purposes of this judgment, if I summarise the
            propositions which I think can properly be drawn from
            it. (1) The medical benefits arising from circumcision
            (apart from the three conditions identified by Dr S for
            which surgery is indicated) are highly contentious. As
            the BMA Medical Ethics Committee draft text puts
            it:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;The medical literature on the health
              implications of circumcision is contradictory, and
              often subject to claims of bias in research, perhaps
              due to the emotive nature of the subject.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>(2) There is a powerful body of medical opinion
            which puts strongly in issue any suggestion that male
            circumcision prevents or reduces the risk of urinary
            tract infection, penile cancer, or sexually transmitted
            disease. Equally contentious is the suggestion that it
            reduces the incidence of cervical cancer in women.
            Doctors opposed to circumcision acknowledge that,
            properly performed, newborn circumcision prevents
            phimosis, paraphimosis and balanoposthitis; it argues,
            however, that these conditions are rare and either
            often treatable by less invasive techniques or resolve
            themselves.</p>

            <p>(3) The procedure for a child of J's age carries
            small but identifiable physical and psychological
            risks. It is an invasive procedure, which therefore
            carries with it risks shared by all surgical
            interventions: pain, bleeding, infection, surgical
            mishap and complications of anaesthesia.</p>

            <p>(4) There is <a
            href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/">evidence</a>
            that tissue loss during circumcision removes or
            destroys the function of tissue which plays an
            important part in the overall sensory mechanism of the
            penis, and that there is a consequential loss of sexual
            sensory pleasure during sexual intercourse.</p>

            <p>(5) The lack of consensus as to the medical harms
            and benefits of circumcision, and the social and
            religious factors influencing parents to have their
            sons circumcised, make this an issue for society, not
            the health professionals.</p>

            <p>Dr S's view, as a paediatrician, was that
            circumcision should only be carried out if medically
            indicated. He recognised, however, that there may be
            religious and cultural reasons for circumcision, but
            pointed out that both the BMA and the GMC, in their
            advice to medical practitioners who are undertaking
            circumcision are very specific on the question of
            consent being obtained from both parents, and in
            particular in obtaining <i>written</i> consent from the
            parent who has parental responsibility. Dr S concluded
            his report with this paragraph:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;Hence with regard to [J] there appear to be
              no medical indications for circumcision in this case,
              and due note should be made of his vulnerable age.
              The procedure is not pain free and there are
              potential risks both physical and psychological which
              may be small but which are nonetheless definite, and
              furthermore it must be emphasised that once carried
              out the prepuce cannot be restored.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>On this latter point, I should add, in parenthesis,
            that amongst the documents shown to me was material
            from an organisation called <i>Norm UK</i>, the aims of
            which are to provide education about (1) the need to
            avoid circumcision and (inter alia)(2) about foreskin
            restoration. Within this material was an article on
            foreskin restoration which indicates that it is
            possible, although restoration cannot give back the
            erotogenic nerves amputated at circumcision. Equally,
            there was nothing in the medical evidence I read and
            heard which indicated that J could not be circumcised
            as an adult, although the possibility of finding a
            surgeon who would perform the operation in the absence
            of a medical need for it was not canvassed in evidence
            before me.</p>

            <p>THE FATHER'S CASE</p>

            <p>In the witness box, the father spoke with passion
            and obvious sincerity about the benefits to J of being
            circumcised. To the father it is a fundamental and
            essential part not merely of his religion but of his
            identity and J's identity.</p>

            <p>The father simply could not understand the
            objections to circumcision. It was a means of
            demonstrating and reinforcing J's relationship with
            him: they had to be the same. J would be proud to be
            like his father. Uncircumcised, J would be different,
            and there would be a barrier between them.</p>

            <p>The father told me that he had been circumcised in
            Turkey when he was six or seven. It had been done in
            hospital under a local anaesthetic. Most boys had to
            wear a form of skirt for a time afterwards: the father
            had not. He had been able to put on his jeans and walk
            out of the hospital. It had not been painful. It had
            also been a matter of celebration. There was a family
            party, and he was given presents. If presented to J
            sympathetically, there would be no difficulty. He
            should be told that the operation was being performed
            &#145;to make you like your daddy'. There would be no
            pain; alternatively, the pain would only last for a
            couple of days. It was &#145;no big deal'.</p>

            <p>The father did not accept the risks, either physical
            or psychological, outlined in the medical evidence by
            Dr S and I have to say that, despite his obvious
            sincerity, there was an element of exaggeration in the
            father's account of his own circumcision (no doubt as a
            result of the passage of time), and in my judgment he
            minimises its painful aspects and underestimates the
            likely effect of the procedure on J.</p>

            <p>The father acknowledged that he was not a practising
            Muslim. However, he insisted that he adhered to the
            essential tenets of his faith. He believed in Allah,
            and that Mohammed was the prophet of Allah. He did not
            eat pork. He was a Muslim, and being circumcised was
            fundamental to being a Muslim.</p>

            <p>By comparison with what I have to say was the
            mother's pallid and unconvincing statement of her
            religious beliefs, the father's passionate plea for J
            to be given his proper identity as a Muslim and for him
            to be thereby enabled to identify fully with his father
            was impressive. In my judgment, and with all due
            respect to the skilful presentation of his case by his
            legal team, the father was his own best advocate on
            this issue.</p>

            <p>As developed by counsel, however, the case for the
            father broke down into the following propositions.</p>

            <p>(1) J is a Muslim according to the law of Islam. It
            is necessary for J to be circumcised under that law and
            it is the father's responsibility to ensure that he is
            circumcised before he reached the age of puberty.</p>

            <p>(2) Circumcision is not inimical to Christian
            beliefs, whereas lack of circumcision is inimical to
            Muslim beliefs.</p>

            <p>(3) The mother had known she was marrying a Muslim
            with a strong sense of identity and that whatever the
            degree of religious observance practised in the family,
            if the parties had a boy he would be circumcised.</p>

            <p>(4) A distinction must be drawn between the religion
            of a child and the religion in which he is being
            brought up. The English authorities appear to
            concentrate purely on this issue of which religion
            should govern a child's upbringing: there appear to be
            no authorities which decide what the religion of a
            child actually is.</p>

            <p>(5) J is a Muslim by birth and as a Muslim has a
            right to be circumcised in accordance with his
            religion: see art 9 of the Convention for the
            Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
            (European Convention on Human Rights)(Rome, 4 November
            1950; TS 71 (1953); Cmnd 8669), shortly to become part
            of English domestic law. The welfare checklist under s
            1(3) of the 1989 Act should thus incorporate and assume
            the right of the child to practice his own religion
            &#150; in this case by ensuring that he is
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>(6) Ensuring that J is circumcised is a primary
            responsibility of the father in the practice of his
            religion and his right to do so is protected under the
            European Convention: this is highly relevant to the
            capacity of the father to meet J's needs under Children
            Act 1989, s 1(3)(f).</p>

            <p>(7) There is a distinction between religious
            identity and the extent of religious practice. The
            father does not suggest that he is a particularly
            religious Muslim and the description &#145;secular
            Muslim' may be accurate. However, it is plain from the
            father's evidence that his Muslim identity is by no
            means dependent on the degree to which he puts his
            religion into practice. The fact that he is circumcised
            is fundamental to that identity, and his son's
            circumcision is fundamental to his.</p>

            <p>THE MOTHER'S CASE AND THE CASE FOR J</p>

            <p>For J, counsel for the Official Solicitor argues, in
            short, that J should not be circumcised because:(1)
            there is no evidence that he is now being brought up in
            the Muslim religion;(2) he is not likely to be brought
            up in the Muslim religion;(3) he is not likely to have
            such a degree of involvement with Muslims as would
            justify circumcising him for social reasons; and (4)
            for the reasons set out at (1) to (3) the small but
            definite medical and psychological risks involved in
            surgical circumcision outweigh the benefits attaching
            to the procedure.</p>

            <p>The mother's argument on the issue of circumcision
            adopts that of the Official Solicitor and makes the
            following points:(1) it is clear from the report of Dr
            S that:(a) there is no medical indication for
            circumcision in J's case;(b) the procedure is attended
            by definite, albeit small physical risks and more
            significant psychological risks;(c) there is no
            consensus in the medical profession that the actual or
            potential benefits of circumcision exceed those risks;
            the consensus is rather to the contrary;(d) on the
            facts of the case there is an increased risk that J
            will suffer an adverse psychological reaction; and (2)
            the mother, who has day-to-day responsibility for J, is
            adamantly opposed to circumcision.</p>

            <p>THE LIKELY EFFECTS ON J OF BEING CIRCUMCISED</p>

            <p>It is, I think, relevant that the question of J's
            circumcision arises at a time of considerable tension
            between the parties, and when the mother (albeit, as I
            have found, without justification) appears genuinely
            anxious about the father's contact and, in particular,
            about the possibility that he may remove J permanently
            from the jurisdiction. These tensions have undoubtedly
            had a knock-on effect on J.</p>

            <p>One particular incident gives a stark example of the
            difficult position in which J is placed. In a statement
            made on 18 November 1998 the mother sought to justify
            her unilateral termination of contact by expressing
            concern at what the father had apparently been saying
            to J on contact visits. She said, in particular:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;He told me that his father talked to him
              about having his "willy" cut and asked if he was
              still going to be able to go to the toilet. I had to
              explain to him that it would not stop him from
              weeing. This seemed to become more of an obsession to
              [J] as time went on and I could only presume that
              [the father] was constantly talking to him about
              this, which I did not think was very fair. It upset
              [J]... [J] was very concerned at the effect of having
              the operation would have on him and I had to try to
              calm him down. To do so, I have obviously had to play
              down the effect of any operation upon him and I did
              not like not being able to be entirely honest with
              him.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The father's statement in answer reads as
            follows:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;In relation to me speaking with [J] in
              respect of circumcision, I admit that I did this. [J]
              and I had taken a shower together and [J] always asks
              questions as he is very inquisitive. He asked me such
              things as what is that on my face, referring to the
              stubble of my beard and when he was younger I used to
              tell him that I bought it from the shop but now that
              he is older I can't tell him what is not true. He
              also asked me why I have got hair on my chest and why
              has he not and I explained to him that when he gets
              older he will have hair on his chest as well. After
              taking a shower,[J] noticed that my penis was
              different to his and he asked me why was mine this
              size and why was his small. I explained that was
              because I was older and then he asked why was mine
              different to his and then I explained to him that I
              had some of it taken away and he asked me whether he
              would have some of his taken away and whether it
              would make him like me and make him nicer. He asked
              me whether [R], who is [L], my girlfriend's son was
              going to have some of his removed and I said "yes"
              and he then said if [R] was going to have it done and
              daddy had it done then he would have it done. I had
              not intended to have a conversation with [J] in
              relation to circumcision but it came up because of
              [J] asking me questions. [J] is a little boy who
              always thinks his father is perfect and likes to be
              like his daddy, like every kid. When I saw [J] for
              the next contact visit, he was saying that the
              circumcision would hurt him and mummy had told him
              this. [J] had a chat with me and I explained that I
              thought his mother was only joking.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>On 26 November 1998, during the father's renewed
            application for contact to J, I heard oral evidence
            from both parties on this particular issue, and had no
            hesitation in accepting the father's evidence about
            what had occurred. At the same time, despite the father
            asserting that he could not tell J a lie, it was untrue
            that R (who is not the father's son) was going to be
            circumcised, and the father and L have now broken up.
            This is, in my judgment, a relevant consideration. In
            Turkish society, a Muslim male child's peers will all
            be circumcised: in the circles in which J will grow up,
            he is likely to be in a small minority, and he will not
            have the reassurance that all his contemporaries have
            been through &#150; or will go through &#150; the same
            experience.</p>

            <p>The incident I have described also makes it clear to
            me that the mother, as J's primary carer, would find it
            extremely difficult to present the question of
            circumcision to J in a positive light, and unlike
            ritual circumcision occurring in the context of a
            Muslim family, where the event would be one of
            celebration and fulfilment, J's circumcision would be
            likely to be surrounded by tension and stress, even
            though the mother was able to agree with the father's
            counsel in cross-examination that she would, of course,
            care for J after the operation, and would have no
            difficulty changing dressings.</p>

            <p>In my judgment, the strained relationship between
            the parents, and the fact that as a circumcised child J
            would be unlike most of his peers, increases the risk
            that J will suffer adverse psychological effects from
            being circumcised.</p>

            <p>CONCLUSION ON THE CIRCUMCISION ISSUE</p>

            <p>How then, do I balance the various considerations to
            which I have referred? J's welfare is, of course,
            paramount. Is it in his interests to be
            circumcised?</p>

            <p>The major benefit is that he will thereby be firmly
            identified with his father, and confirmed in the eyes
            of Islam as a Muslim. However, his circumcision would
            not be part of a family celebration, and he would not
            thereafter be brought up in a Muslim family
            environment.</p>

            <p>The disadvantages are that despite the father's
            passionate defence of the procedure, J may be
            traumatised by it; he will, moreover, be living in the
            household of his mother, who disagrees with the
            procedure, and will find great difficulty in presenting
            it to J in a positive light.</p>

            <p>The application for J to be circumcised is one to
            which s 1(3) of the Children Act applies. I propose to
            consider each of the relevant heads of that subsection
            in turn.</p>

            <p><i>(a) The ascertainable wishes and feelings of the
            child concerned (considered in the light of his age and
            understanding)</i></p>

            <p>I have already related the parents' evidence about
            their respective conversations with J. In the event, I
            do not think J's wishes and feelings are ascertainable,
            or that he is of an age to have a proper understanding
            of what is involved. It would be inevitable, I think,
            for a child of J's age to be apprehensive about any
            form of surgery, but his attitude to it would largely
            depend upon how it was presented to him. I am satisfied
            that the mother, who is the residential parent, would
            find it very difficult to present the operation in a
            positive light, and there must accordingly be a
            possibility that the operation &#150; from J's
            perspective would damage, rather than enhance the
            father's relationship with J. All in all, however,
            given J's age and level of understanding, I do not
            think I can place any weight on J's wishes and
            feelings.</p>

            <p><i>(b) His physical, emotional and educational
            needs</i></p>

            <p>J's physical needs are at present catered for by his
            mother, and to a much lesser extent by his father
            during contact visits. Circumcision is not required to
            meet any of his physical needs. His emotional needs are
            to maintain his relationship with both his parents. His
            relationship with his mother is secure: his
            relationship with his father is warm and caring. It
            needs to be strengthened and preserved.</p>

            <p>The father perceives that his relationship with J
            may be damaged if J is not circumcised. Whilst I have
            no doubt that the father genuinely feels this to be the
            case, I cannot believe that in practice he would allow
            a refusal by the court to allow J to be circumcised to
            affect his day-to-day relationship with J.</p>

            <p>J plainly has a need to be educated in the ways of
            the Turkish side of his inheritance, but, for the
            reasons I have already given that can be done by the
            father without any order of the court.</p>

            <p><i>(c) The likely effect on J of any change in his
            circumstances</i></p>

            <p>J's parents are at present unable to communicate
            with each other in a civilised way. Whilst I am of the
            view that responsibility for this unhappy state of
            affairs lies more with the mother than the father,
            there must be a real risk that circumcision, which
            would undoubtedly be a change in J's circumstances,
            will be seen by the mother and, through her, by J as an
            affront, and that the father will be perceived as
            having put J through unnecessary pain and
            suffering.</p>

            <p>Thus, contrary to the father's perception,
            circumcision may in fact weaken rather than strengthen
            his relationship with J.</p>

            <p><i>(d) His age, sex, background and any
            characteristics of his which the court considers
            relevant</i></p>

            <p>J is five: he is thus at an age at which Muslim boys
            are often circumcised. His male sex is, of course,
            critically important. His background is a mixed
            Turkish/English parentage. He is a Muslim in the eyes
            of Islam, although he is being brought up in England by
            a notionally Christian mother in an effectively secular
            environment. His connections with Turkey and with the
            Turkish side of his inheritance will inevitably be
            limited. At the moment, he appears to be a normal,
            happy, boisterous five-year-old.</p>

            <p><i>(e) Any harm which he has suffered or is at risk
            of suffering</i></p>

            <p>J has already suffered harm through the separation
            of his parents, and continues to do so through their
            mutual hostility and inability to communicate.
            Circumcision carries with it the small but definite
            risks of both physical and psychological harm to which
            I have referred. Furthermore J, as a circumcised child,
            would undoubtedly be different from the majority of his
            peer group. The consequential possibility that he may
            be picked on or teased by his peers cannot be excluded
            as a risk.</p>

            <p><i>(f) How capable each of his parents, and any
            other person in relation to whom the court considers
            the question to be relevant, is of meeting his
            needs</i></p>

            <p>His mother is caring competently for J as his
            residential parent. In my judgment, however, she lacks
            both the willingness and any real capacity to teach him
            about his Turkish background. She is also strongly
            opposed to his circumcision. His father, in my
            judgment, is capable of providing him with sufficient
            information about the Turkish side of his inheritance,
            and would be able, if I order J to be circumcised, to
            present the operation to J in a positive and sensitive
            way, even though I think that, because of his strong
            feelings and the passage of time, the father minimises
            the pain and discomfort likely to be suffered by J if
            the operation is performed.</p>

            <p><i>(g) The range of powers available to the court
            under the Act in the proceedings in question</i></p>

            <p>I have the power to make either a specific issue
            order or a prohibited steps under s 8 of the Act, and
            to attach conditions to either under s 11(7).</p>

            <p>I have not found the differing factors in this case
            easy to balance. I have, however, come to the
            conclusion that I should not make a specific issue
            order requiring J to be circumcised: indeed, on the
            particular facts of this case, notably its foreign
            element and the fact that the father's family or a
            Turkish court might disapprove of my decision, I have
            come to the conclusion that it is in J's interests to
            make an order prohibiting the father from arranging for
            or permitting J to be circumcised either in England and
            Wales or elsewhere.</p>

            <p>I make it clear that this is a conclusion which I
            have reached on the individual facts of this case. The
            factors which influence me are, in particular, the
            following.</p>

            <p>(1) Although born a Muslim, it is clear to me that J
            is going to have an essentially secular upbringing in
            England. He is not going to mix in Muslim circles, and
            his main contact with Muslims and the Muslim ethos will
            be his contact with his father. J is therefore not
            going to grow up in an environment in which
            circumcision is a part of family life; or in which
            circumcision will be in conformity with the religion
            practised by his primary carer; or in which his peers
            have all been circumcised and for him not to be so
            would render him either unusual or an outsider. To the
            contrary, circumcision in the circles in which J is
            likely to move will be the exception rather than the
            rule.</p>

            <p>(2) Circumcision is an effectively irreversible
            surgical intervention which has no medical basis in J's
            case. It is likely to be painful and carries with it
            small but definable physical and psychological risks.
            For it to be ordered there would accordingly have to be
            clear benefits to J which would demonstrate that
            circumcision was in his interests notwithstanding the
            risks. The principal benefits put forward are J's
            identification as a Muslim and the strengthening of his
            bond with his father. The strength of each is
            substantially weakened, in my judgment, by the facts of
            J's life-style and his likely upbringing. As I have
            already made clear, he is not going to be brought up as
            a Muslim child, and the strength of his bond with his
            father &#150; viewed from his perspective rather than
            the father's &#150; is unlikely to be weakened if he is
            not circumcised unless the father chooses to allow the
            absence of circumcision to weaken it.</p>

            <p>(3) J is in the middle of a hostile battle between
            his parents over contact. He is to that extent a
            vulnerable child. The operation and the period leading
            up to it are likely to be highly stressful for the
            mother, who would find it difficult to explain to J why
            it was being undertaken and would have grave difficulty
            presenting it to J in a positive light. Furthermore, J
            is of an age and understanding to feel pain and
            discomfort without at the same time being fully able to
            understand why the operation was being carried out.</p>

            <p>(4) J's mother, who not only shares parental
            responsibility for him with his father but cares for
            him on a day-to-day basis and is currently the most
            important person in his life, is opposed to his
            circumcision, and there is a rational basis for her
            opposition. It is a strong thing to impose a medically
            unnecessary surgical intervention on a residential
            parent who is opposed to it. In my judgment, this
            should only be done if the evidence shows that J's
            welfare requires him to be circumcised. For the reasons
            I have given, I do not think that the evidence overall
            shows that it is in J's interests to be
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>I repeat that my decision in this case turns on its
            particular facts. I do not think it can be said that
            the court would not, in any circumstances, order a
            child to be circumcised. The example which was put in
            argument was that of a Jewish mother and an agnostic
            father with a number of sons, all of whom, by
            agreement, had been circumcised as infants in
            accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have
            another son who is born after they have separated; the
            mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers;
            the father, for no good reason, refuses his agreement.
            In circumstances such as these, it seems to me that the
            court would be likely to grant the mother a specific
            issue order.</p>

            <p>The Human Rights Act 1998 is not yet, of course, in
            force in the United Kingdom. Despite this, is seems to
            me a useful backdrop against which to examine the
            application of the welfare principle in s 1 of the
            Children Act to an application to circumcise a male
            child.</p>

            <p>Section 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that
            certain articles (which include art 9) are to have
            effect, and s 3(1) provides that primary legislation
            must be read and given effect in a way which is
            compatible with Convention rights. Under s 6, it is
            unlawful for a public authority (which includes a
            court) to act in a way which is incompatible with a
            Convention right.</p>

            <p>Under art 9, the father says that his right to
            manifest his religion in practice includes the right to
            arrange for the circumcision of his son in accordance
            with the tenets of his religion. That seems to me
            plainly correct. It follows that any limitations on
            that freedom imposed by a court must be (1) as are
            prescribed by law; and (2) as are necessary in a
            democratic society for the protection of the rights and
            freedoms of others &#150; in this case, the rights and
            freedoms of both the mother and J himself.</p>

            <p>The relevant law in this context must be:(a) ss 2
            and 3 of the 1989 Act, which give both the mother and
            the father parental responsibility and the right to act
            alone and without the other in meeting that
            responsibility (see s 2(7) of the Act);(b) s 8 of the
            Act, which empowers the court to authorise or restrict
            an exercise of parental responsibility by either
            parent; and (c) the welfare principle contained in s 1
            of the Act.</p>

            <p>Where, as here, two parents have identical rights
            under art 9 of the Convention (and also, for that
            matter, under art 8) I see no difficulty in imposing
            limitations on the right of one parent to manifest his
            religion if the exercise of that right (a) infringes or
            conflicts with the rights and freedoms of the other
            parent or the child and (b) is found by the court not
            to be in the best interests of the child.</p>

            <p>I therefore see nothing inconsistent with the proper
            operation of arts 8 and 9 of the Convention in a
            decision of the court which, on the particular facts of
            this case and in the exercise of a judicial discretion,
            refuses to make a specific issue order permitting J's
            circumcision, alternatively prohibits the father from
            causing J to be circumcised.</p>

            <p>Equally, given the balance which the court has to
            strike between the competing rights of the mother, the
            father, and the child, it does not seem to me that an
            order prohibiting circumcision in the circumstances of
            this case could properly be described as discriminatory
            under art 14.</p>

            <p>CIRCUMCISION AS A DISPUTED EXERCISE OF PARENTAL
            RESPONSIBILITY</p>

            <p>The Official Solicitor, on behalf of J urged me to
            say that, notwithstanding the provisions of s 2(7) of
            the 1989 Act, where more than one person shares
            parental responsibility, no one holder of parental
            responsibility should be able to have an incompetent
            child circumcised against the wishes of any of the
            others. Thus where there is a disagreement between
            holders of parental responsibility about the
            circumcision of a male child, circumcision should not
            be carried out without the leave of the court.</p>

            <p>Counsel for the mother urged me to be cautious about
            laying down such a broad principle which they submitted
            was unnecessary to the decision in the case and which
            could have potentially important social and physical
            consequences.</p>

            <p>Section 2(7) of the Children Act reads:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&#145;Where more than one person has parental
              responsibility for a child, each of them may act
              alone and without the other (or others) in meeting
              that responsibility; but nothing in this Part shall
              be taken to affect the operation of any enactment
              which requires the consent of more than one person in
              a matter affecting the child.'</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The BMA <i>Guidance for Doctors</i>, which I have
            set out earlier, is, in my judgment, relevant on this
            point. I have in mind in particular the fact that the
            BMA strongly recommends that the written consent of
            <i>both</i> parents is obtained. It also emphasises the
            need for doctors to be aware of potential difficulties
            if both parents do not follow the same cultural
            tradition.</p>

            <p>In my judgment, the argument put forward by the
            Official Solicitor on this point is sound. Circumcision
            is an irrevocable step in a child's life. Section 13(1)
            of the 1989 Act provides that where a residence order
            is in force, no person may cause a child to be known by
            a new surname or remove that child from the
            jurisdiction without the leave of the court. There is
            no equivalent statutory prohibition against
            circumcision without the agreement of all those with
            parental responsibility.</p>

            <p>Changes of surname, which require applications to
            the court in cases of disagreement are reversible:
            circumcision is not. In my judgment, therefore, where
            there is a dispute between parents or other persons
            having parental responsibility for a child over the
            child's circumcision, that dispute should be referred
            to the court for resolution, if need be as a matter of
            urgency. I also agree with the Official Solicitor that
            this proposition should also apply to any local
            authority which has parental responsibility for a child
            under a care order: see the 1989 Act, s 33(6).</p>

            <p>For all these reasons, there will be no order on the
            father's application for J to be brought up as a Muslim
            and there will be a prohibited steps order preventing
            the father from arranging or permitting J to be
            circumcised without the leave of the High Court. I
            propose to invite counsel to agree the precise terms of
            the order.</p>

            <p><i>Order accordingly. Leave to appeal
            granted.</i></p>
