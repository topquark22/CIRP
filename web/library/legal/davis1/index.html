    <h2>MALE AND FEMALE GENITAL ALTERATION:<br />
     A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE LAW?</h2>

    <p class="a"><i>Dena S. Davis</i><sup>&dagger;</sup></p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="a">I. I<span class="sc2">NTRODUCTION</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>IN MARCH OF 1999</b>, the American
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a policy statement on
      the circumcision of newborn males, stating that the practice
      does not have health benefits strong enough to warrant
      recommendation as a routine procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This withdrawal of medical support for
      routine circumcision requires us to face some uncomfortable
      facts, and raises intriguing constitutional questions.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is now illegal in the United States to
      perform genital alteration on female minors, no matter how
      minimal the surgery or how safe and sanitary the procedure.
      Newborn male genital alteration, however, is an accepted
      procedure in the U.S. Although there is some controversy over
      this practice, for most people it is a familiar part of life
      in America. The law takes no cognizance of the male
      procedure, with no records kept of circumcisions performed
      outside of hospitals, and with no oversight or licensing of
      ritual practitioners.</p>

      <p class="text2">Why does the law turn a blind eye to one
      procedure and criminalize the other? Two possible answers
      present themselves. The first answer claims that male genital
      alteration is medically beneficial, whereas female genital
      alteration is purely "cultural." As I will show later in this
      article, this is a weak argument. There are no health
      benefits to the female procedures, certainly, but the health
      benefits for males are contested and tenuous.</p>

      <p class="text2">The second answer points to the relatively
      minor and low risk character of newborn male circumcision,
      contrasted to the pain, suffering, morbidity, and death
      associated with female genital alteration. With regard to the
      most common practices of female alteration, this is a good
      answer. The practice as carried out in most countries well
      deserves the name "female genital mutilation." It is
      emphatically not my goal here to defend that practice nor to
      weaken the international movement to eradicate it. However,
      the federal and state laws criminalizing genital alteration
      on female minors are so broad that they cover even procedures
      significantly less substantial than newborn male
      circumcision. One consequence of these laws' wide sweep is
      that they block the efforts of compassionate and creative
      physicians who want to attempt to offer a compromise to
      immigrant parents from countries where female genital
      alteration is the norm. By offering a tiny, safe procedure,
      these physicians hope to dissuade parents from sending their
      girls back to Africa for the procedure or from employing a
      local traditional practitioner.</p>

      <p class="text2">When one begins to question the normative
      status of male newborn alteration in the West, and when one
      thinks of female alteration as including even an hygienically
      administered "nick," one sees that these two practices,
      dramatically separated in the public imagination, actually
      have significant areas of overlap. In this article I will
      show that the two practices lack a legally defensible
      distinction, given the current wording of state and federal
      statutes. Thus, a complete laissez-faire attitude toward one
      practice coupled with total criminalization of the other,
      runs afoul of the "free exercise" clause of the First
      Amendment. There are also troubling implications for the
      constitutional requirement of equal protection, because the
      laws appear to protect little girls, but not little boys,
      from religious and culturally motivated surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Part II, I give a brief description of
      the medical facts and geographical sweep of female genital
      alteration, a topic that has been covered in great detail by
      many other articles in the legal literature and elsewhere.
      Part II also discusses the legal and educational initiatives
      against female genital alteration in developing countries, in
      the West, and specifically in the United States. Part II
      concludes with a description of the experience of Seattle
      physicians who attempted to provide a compromise acceptable
      to their Somali immigrant consumers by offering a small
      "genital nick" in place of traditional genital
      alteration.</p>

      <p class="text2">Part III looks at the medical facts and
      statistical instances of male genital alteration, with an
      analysis of medical arguments for and against the practice.
      Part IV explores the meanings of male and female genital
      alteration, including religious, cultural, social and
      economic motivations. Part V discusses the "free exercise"
      issues, concluding that it is not constitutionally acceptable
      to criminalize all female genital alteration while retaining
      a laissez-faire legal attitude to male genital alteration.
      Finally, Part VI offers recommendations for changes in the
      law that would offer increasing protection to all children
      and treat different religious traditions with equal
      respect.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>A note on language.</i> Male newborn
      genital alteration is almost always referred to as
      "circumcision," a vaguely medical term and one that signals
      society's acceptance of this procedure. As one commentator
      noted:</p>

      <blockquote>
        What is familiar becomes a cultural value. Circumcision is
        familiar. The words we use and the words we avoid when
        talking about a cultural value like circumcision serve to
        reinforce the practice . . . . For example, the term
        "uncircumcised" suggests that to be circumcised is the
        norm, the standard. This is an assumption made by a culture
        that practices circumcision. However . . . nonreligious
        circumcision is not "normal" in any culture outside of the
        United States. From a global perspective, to be
        "uncircumcised" is to be normal, the way males are born,
        and the way most of the world's males remain.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">As the American debate about circumcision
      develops, the words "intact" and "natural" are being used in
      place of "uncircumcised" to reflect this global view.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">When writers have used "circumcision" to
      refer to the female procedure there is often an outcry;
      opponents of the female procedure and defenders of the male
      procedure alike object to casting them in the same light. I
      agree that calling both procedures "circumcision" tends to
      trivialize the horrors of the female procedures as they are
      commonly practiced. On the other hand, "female genital
      mutilation," the term preferred by many of its opponents and
      officially adopted by the World Health Organization,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> has its own problems. "(M)utilation
      implies removal or destruction without medical
      necessity,"<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> which logically
      ought to cover routine male circumcision as well. Further,
      the term completely ignores the meanings of female genital
      alteration in the cultures in which it is practiced, in which
      not to be circumcised is to look weird and disgusting.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Finally, the term polarizes people
      rather than inviting discussion. To quote two
      anthropologists:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The extreme language used by Western authors to describe
        female circumcision is perceived by Arab and African people
        as a continued devaluation of themselves and their entire
        cultures. To put the matter quite bluntly, if we care about
        the genitals of the women in those cultures, we need also
        to care about their feelings.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, I reject the term
      "traditional female genital surgeries" because it suggests a
      procedure that, even if medically indefensible, is at least
      carried out in a medical context. In most cases, nothing
      could be further from the facts. Most of these genital
      "surgeries" are done by traditional practitioners or by
      female members of the girl's family; the most common tools
      are cut glass, a sharp rock, fingernails, a razor blade or
      unsterile medical instruments.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      (I have some sympathy, however, with the argument that
      calling it "female genital surgery" is worthwhile because it
      invites comparisons with other forms of cosmetic surgery on
      women which are not generally greeted with horror and mass
      condemnation.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> This point is
      especially appropriate in countries such as Britain and
      Canada, where female genital surgery is illegal even when
      performed on adult women.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>)</p>

      <p class="text2">Because my goal in this article is to
      convince readers that there is legally significant overlap
      between the male and female procedures, I will resort to the
      cumbersome but assertively neutral term, "genital alteration"
      for all practices that surgically change the appearance or
      function of the male or female genitalia without medical
      reason. Within certain contexts, however, I will also use the
      more common terms.</p>

      <p class="a">II. F<span class="sc2">EMALE</span> G<span
      class="sc2">ENITAL</span> A<span class="sc2">LTERATION</span>
      (FGA)</p>

      <p class="a">A. Description and Epidemiology</p>

      <p class="text2">The scope and consequences of female genital
      alteration (FGA) have been well rehearsed in the legal and
      medical literature. The practice affects between 80 to 110
      million women now living worldwide, especially, but not
      exclusively, in Muslim cultures.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Annually, FGA is performed on about
      4 to 5 million female infants and girls, most commonly on
      children between the ages of 4 and 10.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Doctors categorize FGA into four
      general types:</p>

      <p class="text2">Type I, often called "clitoridectomy,"
      involves excision of the skin around the clitoris. It may
      also involve excision of all or part of the clitoris.</p>

      <p class="text2">Type II, called "excision," involves the
      removal of the entire clitoris and part or all of the labia
      minora. Bleeding from this procedure may be staunched with
      stitches of catgut or thorns; mud poultices may be applied
      directly to the wound.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Type III, known as "infibulation," the
      girl not only loses her clitoris and labia minora, but the
      outer labia are first cut and then stitched together, to
      create a permanent closure with only a small opening for
      urine and menstrual flow. Women who have been subjected to
      this procedure must then be cut open before intercourse, and
      require episiotomies to avoid tearing of the vulva during
      childbirth. (This is also sometimes referred to as "pharaonic
      circumcision.")</p>

      <p class="text2">Category IV is a catch-all covering other
      kinds of procedures of various degrees of severity, including
      piercing of the clitoris or labia, cauterization of the
      clitoris, and so on.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As would be expected, given the medically
      primitive conditions in which FGA commonly takes places, the
      physical consequences can be horrendous. Bleeding to death is
      the most tragic result of the procedure; no statistics exist
      as to how often this takes place. Other immediate
      complications include shock, hemorrhage, infection, damage to
      the urethra or anus, scarring, and tetanus. The use of
      unsterilized instruments also provides a pathway for
      infection from bloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are long-term health risks as well.
      New opportunities for infection occur when the scar tissue on
      infibulated women is opened when they marry or give birth.
      Tightly infibulated women can only urinate drop by drop, so
      that it can take between ten and fifteen minutes to void the
      bladder. Long-term complications of even the less extensive
      procedures include chronic vaginal, bladder, and uterine
      infections (often leading to sterility). When infibulated
      women give birth, failure to cut the scar open in time can
      lead to fetal damage and death.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> The very high rates of infant and
      maternal death in Sudan and Somalia are likely due in part to
      the fact that FGA in those countries is almost
      universal.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Psychological and emotional damage is less
      well studied. Obvious sequelae include lack of sexual
      satisfaction, fear of pain during intercourse, and inability
      to reach orgasm. Of course, what Westerners would deem a
      negative side effect proponents of the practice might
      consider a goal, as one rationale given for FGA is to dull
      women's sexual drive and keep them "pure and
      obedient."<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Some women "report
      a feeling of permanent loss and of being seriously
      wounded."<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> (Interestingly,
      adult men who bemoan the circumcisions that befell them in
      childhood often report the same feelings.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup>) Because the procedure is often done
      on small girls, who are grabbed without warning by female
      family members, lifelong feelings of distrust and betrayal
      are also common. Girls who receive the Type I procedure in
      hygienic conditions with the use of anesthesia do not report
      severe psychological reactions at the time, but may still
      experience problems in sexual functioning at a later
      date.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Because psychological distress is harder to
      characterize than physical symptoms, writers describe the
      emotional consequences of the procedure in widely varying
      ways, in part due to their own perspectives on how best to
      approach the problem. One Egyptian woman is quoted as
      saying:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I was 7 years old when I was circumcised. The women in my
        village spoke of this operation as if their whole life had
        stopped then and there. Their descriptions and the
        subsequent feeling of inescapable doom triggered such a
        panic in me that . . . I began to vomit. What happened that
        day is excruciatingly burning in my flesh, and I often wake
        up in the middle of the night screaming for my
        mother.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, when anthropologists Lane
      and Rubinstein interviewed 50 women in rural and urban Egypt,
      they found only two who were angry at having been
      circumcised, and the overwhelming majority planned to have
      the procedure performed on their daughters as well. One
      African woman, herself circumcised, defended the procedure
      and wrote that "(t)he circumcision ritual is an enjoyable
      one, in which the girl is the centre of attention and
      receives presents and moral instruction from her
      elders."<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">B. Legal and Educational Initiatives Against
      FGA:<br />
      </p>

      <p class="a">Outside the West</p>

      <p class="text2">The last decades have seen a number of legal
      initiatives against FGA, both internationally and in those
      countries in which the practice most commonly occurs. The
      <i>United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
      of Discrimination Against Women</i> addresses discriminatory
      traditional practices. Article 24.3 of the <i>Convention on
      the Rights of the Child</i> requires states to act to end
      traditional practices harmful to the health of children.
      <i>The African Charter on Human and People's Rights</i> and
      the <i>African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the
      Child</i> protect children from harmful traditional
      practices. The <i>Programme of Action of the International
      Conference on Population and Development</i>, held in Cairo
      in 1994, committed governments to take "urgent" steps to stop
      the practice, as did the <i>Platform for Action of the World
      Conference on Women</i>.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A number of African countries, including
      Senegal, Ghana, the Central African Republic, Djibouti, Togo,
      and Burkina Faso, have recently passed laws outlawing female
      circumcision. Other countries, such as Uganda, discourage
      it.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> In Guinea, performing
      female circumcision carries the death penalty.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> Some of these laws were passed in
      response to the growing threat of HIV and the evidence that
      women subjected to genital alteration were at increased
      risk.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Passing laws is one thing; enforcing
      compliance is another. At a 1995 meeting of African health
      ministers, the group ruled out a ban, saying that "it would
      be absurd to introduce laws which would not be
      implemented."<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> In Senegal,
      Moun-taga Tall, spiritual leader of northern Senegal's
      Tou-cou-leur people, vowed to die rather than supporting the
      ban; just before the 1999 law was passed, one village
      reportedly circumcised 120 girls en masse, to express their
      defiance. Senegalese critics charge that the law was passed
      only to cater to American sensitivities and to woo American
      grant money. The Senegalese law was passed one month before
      the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights was
      released, a report that is used as a guide to allocating
      aid.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> In Sierra Leone, where
      the sequelae of surgical alteration include one of the
      highest rates of miscarriage and pregnancy-related deaths in
      the world, public controversy about the practice sparked a
      huge march of women on the capital city, to defend the
      custom. "I am only doing this to protect our culture," said
      Mrs. Haja Sasso, leader of the National Council of Muslim
      Women. "I don't want to see this ceremony eradicated, because
      it binds us, we the women, together. We respect each other in
      this way, and we feel free together because of it."<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some anthropologists and activists, both
      Western and from developing countries, are appalled by the
      arrogant, colonialist manner in which Westerners often frame
      their opposition to the practice. Ellen Gruenbaum says that,
      "international efforts to 'eradicate' female circumcision (as
      if it were a disease), though often couched in seemingly
      progressive feminist rhetoric, sound condescending to many
      African women. The response has often been a cultural
      backlash, characterized by a defense of traditions by African
      women against what is perceived as Western cultural
      imperialism."<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> Nahid Toubia, a
      widely quoted activist against the practice, nonetheless
      observes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The West has acted as though they have suddenly discovered
        a dangerous epidemic which they then sensationalized in
        international women's forums creating a backlash of
        over-sensitivity in the concerned communities. They have
        portrayed it as irrefutable evidence of the barbarism and
        vulgarity of underdeveloped countries... It became a
        conclusive validation to the view of the primitiveness of
        Arabs, Muslims and Africans all in one blow.<sup><a
        href="#n30">30</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">By the same token, women from developing
      countries often bitterly contrast Western obsession with FGA
      with Western indifference to other factors in women's
      suffering. Gruenbaum points out:</p>

      <blockquote>
        In Sudan . . . at least a quarter of a million people died
        of starvation due to drought and war in 1988-89 . . . .
        Although the United States and other countries offered some
        assistance, it was too little and too late, relating to the
        "donor fatigue" phenomenon. Thousands of little Sudanese
        girls died&mdash;whether circumcised or not&mdash;along
        with their brothers and elders.<sup><a
        href="#n31">31</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Parasathi Teare writes that "campaigners
      against female circumcision should put all their efforts into
      challenging the circumstances that create and perpetuate the
      harsh everyday lives of people in those developing countries
      that practice female circumcision."<sup><a

      <p class="text2">Among those who want to see FGA eradicated,
      there are different viewpoints on how to achieve that goal.
      Not everyone agrees that outlawing the practice is the best
      strategy. Critics argue that, lacking grassroots support and
      educational infrastructure, laws motivated by outside
      interests will not be effective. In Ghana, Guinea, and
      Burkina Faso, the laws have never been applied. Governments
      fear that draconian efforts to stop the practice will incite
      a repetition of the rebellions of the colonial period, when
      female alteration was seen as an emblem of nationalist pride.
      Groups in favor of female alteration helped build support for
      the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. When British law banned
      traditional cutters from performing the procedure, groups of
      girls would defiantly conduct "Ngaitana," or "I cut
      myself."<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There is some evidence that bans enacted
      from above, rather than growing out of grassroots movements
      for change, can actually work to entrench the practice. In
      Senegal, a group called Tostan had had some success in
      educating hundreds of villages about the health risks
      associated with the practice. Thirty-one villages had
      announced that they would stop female circumcision and others
      were poised to follow suit. But when the law was passed,
      Tostan was forced to suspend its work. "Villagers say the ban
      has turned friends and relations into criminals, and fiercely
      resist the idea that they are being forced into giving up the
      practice." One reporter says that the issue has " exposed a
      split" between aid workers in the field, who oppose the law,
      and people in distant Western capitals, who back it.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Many activists argue that the best approach
      is to avoid cultural judgment and concentrate on the risks to
      women's health,<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> in part
      because the cultural meanings vary widely across countries
      while the health risks are universal. The World Health
      Organization takes the tack that "(female genital mutilation
      (FGM)) is an issue that cuts across both health and human
      rights and a major lesson learned from past community actions
      is that efforts to stop the practice need to go beyond the
      medical model of disease eradication."<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> "Medicalization" of the practice,
      i.e., avoiding the worst harms by having it done only by
      qualified medical personnel, is likewise controversial. In
      the short run, it appears to guard against some of the most
      serious side effects. On the other hand, medicalization lends
      a cloak of acceptability to the procedure. Lane and
      Rubinstein found that in Egypt, among the middle class,
      modernization had not lessened support for female
      circumcision. Factors such as increased education and
      employment outside the home for women, with the resultant
      impossibility of total chaperonage, had increased parents'
      interest in having the procedure performed, but performed by
      physicians, with local anesthesia and less risk of
      infection.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> The World Health
      Organization says that "(l)aws and professional codes of
      ethics should prohibit the medicalization of all the
      different forms of FGM."<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">C. Alternatives to FGA</p>

      <p class="text2">Because the cultural meaning of the female
      ritual surgery is complex and multi-layered, there is hope
      that the procedure can be eradicated gradually by finding
      less harmful ways to fulfill the same functions. For example,
      many commentators, from both within and without societies
      that practice female ritual surgeries, note that the practice
      serves to bond women together and to cement their identities
      as members of the group.<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> In
      cultures where the ritual is practiced on older girls, it is
      seen as the doorway into adulthood.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> Thus, some indigenous work against
      the practice has shown progress by substituting other
      rituals, or at least by lessening the severity of the
      procedure. As an example of the latter, Gruenbaum describes
      what she observed in villages in the Sudan in the 1970s and
      '80s. In northern Sudan, FGA was virtually universal in the
      '80s. The most severe form, the "Pharaonic," involving total
      excision of the clitoris, prepuce, labia minora, labia
      majora, and infibulation, was practiced by the majority, the
      Kenana ethnic group. Some others practiced an "intermediate"
      form, and a small minority, the Zabarma, practiced the
      "Sunna" form, involving clitoridectomy or partial
      clitoridectomy only.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> By 1989,
      Gruenbaum observed a significant shift from the more severe
      to less destructive form of the procedure, due to individuals
      and organizations within Sudan who had spoken out against the
      pharaonic practice. In Wad Medani, an old city on the west
      bank of the Blue Nile, the capital of Gezira Province,
      Gruenbaum interviewed a nurse-midwife, Sister Battool:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Sister Battool is a renowned nurse-midwife who supports the
        public health education efforts to inform people about the
        dangers of the pharaonic form and trains other health
        workers. Sister Battool reported having considerable
        success in influencing her clients to opt for minimal
        tissue removal, success that she attributed to changing
        social attitudes. . . . For those parents who insisted on
        infibulation, she tried to preserve the clitoris and
        erectile tissue inside, so as to minimize bleeding and
        preserve sexual sensitivity.<sup><a
        href="#n42">42</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Another healthworker, a female physician,
      has become convinced through study of Islamic texts that no
      type of FGA was religiously required. However, she observed
      that the policy of the Sudanese Ministry of Health, which was
      against any form of the procedure, had met with such
      widespread popular opposition that she saw no hope for its
      adoption. Her strategy was to become an advocate for the
      least destructive form of the surgery which removed only the
      clitoral prepuce. "That procedure, she felt, might satisfy
      people's desire to circumcise, yet would leave the clitoris
      better exposed to sexual stimulation and improve women's
      sexual response."<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Sierra Leone, where thousands of women
      celebrated the end of warfare and their imminent release from
      refugee camps by circumcising themselves in the communal
      ritual known as Bondo, anti-circumcision activist and
      gynecologist Olayinka Kosso-Thomas advocates finding ways to
      retain the constructive parts of Bondo and women's secret
      societies, while eradicating the ritual surgery around which
      they now revolve.<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> In a small
      pilot study in Sierra Leone, support for FGA among both men
      and women was associated with illiteracy, while literate
      persons "failed to see the rationale of the practice," even
      though they themselves, in the case of the women, had been
      subjected to the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Kenya, the rate of FGA has dropped
      substantially. In 1991, a survey of adolescents found that
      78% of them had undergone the procedure, compared to 100% of
      women over the age of 50. A novel alternative rite, involving
      13 rural communities as of 1998, is worth describing at
      length. This rite is called <i>Ntanira Na Mugambo</i>,
      "circumcision through words." Because the key to success is
      to involve the girl's family and community, the rite is
      flexible enough to change from one community to another;
      female adolescents, family members, and others in the
      community participate in designing the ceremony. There is
      also a "family life" educational component in the schools,
      and a program targeting young males, explaining to them the
      health risks women face as a result of the procedure and
      enlisting them in a process that ends with making a vow not
      to require that their future wives be circumcised. The rite
      itself typically involves a week of seclusion for the
      adolescent girls, where they are taught about sexual and
      reproductive health, bodily anatomy, respect for adults, how
      to withstand peer pressure, and so on. The week ends with a
      public celebration in which the girls are the center of
      attention, receive gifts, and are given certificates.
      "Because the rite does not exert a blunt prohibition on
      female genital mutilation being practised in Kenya, but
      offers an attractive alternative, it is possible that it may
      become the most successful strategy towards more widespread
      elimination throughout the world."<sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Israel, where Bedouin tribes already
      practice an extremely mild type of FGA, it has been suggested
      that the World Health Organization "train medical-religious
      functionaries to perform a sterile minor incision and then
      declare (that the) girl (has been) circumcised."<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Indonesia, genital cuttings used to occur
      but are no longer performed. What persists, for some people,
      is a ritual form of the practice, consisting of cleaning the
      clitoris with herbal juice, a symbolic scratch of the girls'
      labia majora, or a "light puncture of the clitoris."<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Accounts exist of women who only pretend to
      circumcise girls. An African mother says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Everyone tries to persuade me that it must be done to my
        daughter, saying that no one will marry her, but I tell
        them I don't care. Let her get old enough to decide what
        she wants for herself. In a year or so I will have a party
        for her and pretend that I am going to circumcise her. I
        will buy her new clothes, paint her hands with henna, and
        call in the midwife, exactly as I would if I were to have
        her circumcised. Then I will pay the midwife to do nothing,
        and tell everyone that it has been done ....<sup><a
        href="#n49">49</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">In Guinea, the chief practitioner of FGA was
      Aja Toun-kara Diallo Fatimata, who was reviled by Western
      human rights activists. However, she recently confessed that
      she had never actually cut anyone. "'I'd just pinch their
      clitorises to make them scream,' she said, 'and tightly
      bandage them up so that they walked as though they were in
      pain."'<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">D. Western Legal and Educational Initiatives
      Against FGA<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">With increased migration from countries
      where the practice is common to countries in the West where
      it was previously unknown,<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup>
      healthcare workers found themselves giving prenatal or
      obstetrical care to women whose genitals appeared unlike
      anything they had ever seen. It is probably in this context
      that public health officials in European countries first
      became aware of the extent of the problem. Meanwhile,
      international activism aimed at eradicating the custom in
      Africa and elsewhere focused attention on the issue around
      the globe. Western countries have reacted to the issue with a
      variety of legal responses, which I sketch only briefly
      here.</p>

      <p class="text2">For one example, the city of Cardiff in
      South Wales is home to substantial numbers of persons from
      Somalia and Yemen, two countries where forms of FGA are
      common.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> In other parts of
      Britain, immigrants who practice the custom may also come
      from Eritrea or Ethiopia.<sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup> The
      practice (on adult women as well as on minors) was made
      illegal in Britain in 1985 under The Prohibition of Female
      Circumcision Act; conviction can carry a sentence of up to
      five years in prison.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> When
      the object of the surgery is a minor, the 1989 Children Act
      also applies; relevant professionals have a statutory duty to
      protect children from harm. Great tension and conflict are
      experienced when a practice that parents consider to be a
      responsible act of caring for their daughter's future, is
      considered by school and health professionals to be a form of
      child abuse. Further, there is the real possibility that
      parents can simply send their girls home to have the
      procedure performed there or use clandestine refugee
      practitioners in the United Kingdom.<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Canada, the Criminal Code was amended in
      1997 to address the issue of FGA. As in Britain, the Code
      appears to apply to adults as well as minors. The Code also
      applies to parents who take their children out of the country
      to have the procedure performed in places where it is legal.
      However, as of 1998, there were no recorded instances of
      arrests.<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup> New Zealand's code,
      amended in 1995 to address this issue, is essentially the
      same as in Britain; again, so far there have been no
      arrests.</p>

      <p class="text2">In France, the Penal Code does not
      specifically address FGA. However, provisions relating to
      acts of violence against minors have been enforced against
      practitioners of ritual genital surgery, and also against the
      girls' parents. Although France has probably prosecuted more
      adults than any other Western country, few who are convicted
      actually go to prison.<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> France
      first took official cognizance of the problem in 1978, when
      an infant died from a ritual surgery. The practitioner
      received a one-year suspended sentence; the parents were not
      tried.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> Since 1978, there have
      been at least 25 prosecutions of parents and providers. The
      parents are almost always given suspended sentences. One
      provider went to prison for five years; in a recent case, a
      provider, Hawa Greou, was sentenced to eight years in prison
      for performing surgery on 48 girls.<sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup> The case against Greou, who is
      originally from Mali, was initiated by one of her victims, a
      Parisian law student from a Malian family, who accused Greou
      of cutting her and her sisters when they were children. The
      parents of the 48 girls were tried as accomplices.<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup> One commentator points out that
      immigrant families in France still feel acute social pressure
      to have their girls cut, "as many families hold on to the
      idea that one day they will return to the 'home country,' if
      only to marry off their daughters there. They also hold on to
      an image of the 'home country' as it was when they left it,
      so they are often unaware that excision is being challenged
      as much if not more there than it is in France."<sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">An irony not lost on French feminists is
      that it is almost exclusively women who are tried and
      convicted for this crime, despite universal agreement that
      FGA is "an expression of male domination...with the primary
      purpose of controlling women's sexuality for the benefit of
      men."<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> Some feminists have
      argued against using the legal system to fight the practice,
      as only women are caught in its nets&mdash;often women with
      no support networks, no independent source of income, little
      fluency in French, and so on.<sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup>
      Others have tried to get magistrates to charge the fathers in
      the case as well. "However, as the husbands continue to plead
      their innocence, pointing out that they were at work or even
      overseas at the time, the wives continue to support their
      husbands' stories, and both husbands and wives maintain that
      excision is 'women's business'... the law cannot&mdash;or
      will not&mdash;recognize the husbands as accessories to the
      fact."<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> Bronwyn Winter
      comments that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        (I)t is the women who not only are the vehicles of their
        own oppression but also who end up paying for it doubly in
        the name, paradoxically, of their own "liberation."
        Moreover, the women being tried are not those who have
        grown up in France with knowledge of French language,
        customs, and law but those who have been brought to France
        (often as a second or third wife, in which case they
        basically have no social or legal status) and who often are
        very young, do not speak the language, and have been
        educated into believing that excision is necessary for
        their daughters' future psychological, physical, and social
        development.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="a">E. The United States Legal Situation</p>

      <p class="a">1. Federal</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1997, Congresswoman Pat Schroeder finally
      succeeded in having opposition to FGA on minors encoded in
      the criminal law.<sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup> With a
      couple of minor exemptions to address situations of medical
      necessity (e.g., de-infibulation of women in childbirth), the
      law states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text2">(a) ...whoever knowingly circumcises,
        excises, or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia
        majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person who
        has not attained the age of 18 years shall be fined under
        this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or
        both.</p>

        <p class="text2">(c) (N)o account shall be taken of the
        effect on the person on whom the operation is to be
        performed of any belief on the part of that person, or any
        other person, that the operation is required as a matter of
        custom or ritual. The 1995 version of the Act had directed
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services to compile data
        on females, both adults and minors, living in the United
        States who have been subjected to the surgery, and to carry
        out outreach and educational initiatives to those
        communities within the U.S. who traditionally practice the
        custom, but that provision did not survive.<sup><a
        href="#n68">68</a></sup> However, the 1997 version is
        partnered with a law requiring the Immigration and
        Naturalization Service to hand out materials on the ill
        effects and legal consequences of female genital mutilation
        to immigrants from countries where it is commonly
        practiced.<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Unlike some of the state laws, the federal
      law does not speak to the legality of causing a child to be
      surgically altered; practitioners, but not parents, are at
      legal risk.</p>

      <p class="a">2. States</p>

      <p class="text2">Fifteen states have criminalized female
      genital mutilation.<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> Illinois,
      Minnesota, Rhode Island and Tennessee prohibit the practice
      on adult women as well as minors<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> (giving rise to provocative
      questions about why other forms of cosmetic surgery, such as
      breast enlargement, are not within the purview of the
      law<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>). Six states explicitly
      hold parents or legal guardians of minors criminally liable
      if they consent to or initiate the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup> It is not clear what constitutes
      "allowing" or "permitting" the procedure to take place. One
      commentator wonders if a woman who would like to oppose FGA,
      but feels powerless to protest against her husband's wishes,
      would be liable under this language.<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although most state laws track the language
      of the federal statute, some, such as North Dakota, give a
      more explicitly sweeping description of what constitutes the
      criminal act: "(A)ny person who knowingly separates or
      surgically alters normal, healthy, functioning genital tissue
      of a female minor is guilty of a class C felony."<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> All the state laws echo the federal
      clause making clear that religious or cultural beliefs are
      not to be taken under consideration when applying the
      law.</p>

      <p class="a">3. The Seattle Experience</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1996, physicians at Harborview Medical
      Center in Seattle decided to try a novel approach to save
      young girls from the horrors of traditional genital
      alteration. Harborview is situated in a neighborhood with a
      large and varied immigrant population, including a
      substantial number of Somali people.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> The Center had a strong tradition of
      trying to be seen as sensitive to the cultural situation of
      the clients it served, and to be perceived as trustworthy and
      helpful by the people in its catchment area.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup> Doctors and nurses in obstetrical
      practice had been startled by pregnant Somali women who, when
      asked if they wanted their baby circumcised if it was a boy,
      responded, "Yes, and also if it's a girl."<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup> In addition, Somali mothers were
      asking physicians to perform minimalist procedures on their
      adolescent daughters' genitals. The women explained that, if
      they could not have some form of the procedure done safely in
      the U.S., they would take their girls back to Somalia, where
      in all likelihood they would be subjected to the most severe
      pharaonic procedure,<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup> or have
      the procedure done in the U.S. by an imported traditional
      practitioner.<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup> Parents gave an
      array of reasons for wanting to have the procedure done,
      including religion, preservation of culture, making sure
      their daughters are marriageable, and protection against what
      they perceive as the immoral, eroticized American culture
      that surrounds them.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The idea of a symbolic cut, a tiny
      bloodletting under hygienic procedures with no foreseeable
      sequelae, came initially from the Somali women themselves.
      This might seem surprising, especially in light of the fact
      that many immigrants appear quite na&iuml;ve about the
      Western opposition to "female circumcision," even expressing
      disappointment that Medicaid will not cover the
      procedure.<sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup> However, the
      women's request can be attributed to the use of the "minimal"
      procedure as a strategy in the anti-circumcision movement in
      Somalia itself, and to the varying levels of sophistication
      and support for some form of FGA among Somalis living in the
      United States.<sup><a href="#n83">83</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The hospital was intrigued by a possible
      compromise that offered a way out of a terrible dilemma;
      refusing to do the procedure simply condemned the girls to an
      uncontrolled, unsupervised, life-threatening array of
      possibilities in their homeland. According to the compromise,
      girls old enough to provide consent<sup><a
      href="#n94">84</a></sup> would undergo a tiny nick on the
      prepuce which would be performed with appropriate analgesia
      and under sterile conditions.<sup><a href="#n85">85</a></sup>
      The operation would be less extensive than the commonly
      practiced male circumcision, and more analogous to
      earpiercing. The community-bonding, cultural aspects of the
      practice would be preserved, as the girls' mothers would be
      able to invite the community to the hospital, organize
      appropriate rituals, throw a party to honor the girls, and so
      on.<sup><a href="#n86">86</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The hospital formed a committee to discuss
      the idea, which met over a lengthy period of time. While they
      were deliberating, they held three public meetings with
      Somali mothers, involving about 13 women each time. The women
      were committed enough to the compromise that they waited for
      the hospital to make a decision, not turning to other avenues
      of genital alteration until the hospital backed out.<sup><a
      href="#n87">87</a></sup> One activist within the Somalian
      Seattle community said that about 40 women came forward to
      express their interest in having the modified procedure for
      their daughters.<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Not surprisingly, once reporters got hold of
      the story the response was dramatic. Despite reiterations by
      the hospital that it was not contemplating "circumcision,"
      but merely a tiny bloodletting substantially less severe than
      routine newborn male circumcision, many reporters continued
      to misstate the facts or to write headlines which
      contradicted facts in the body of the articles.<sup><a
      href="#n89">89</a></sup> There was a great deal of public
      outcry. Activists against female genital mutilation, both
      Westerners and African women now living in the West,
      expressed intense disapproval. Even among those who appeared
      to understand the medically minimalist nature of the
      procedure being contemplated, there was condemnation based on
      the belief that any compromise would validate the misogynist,
      patriarchal culture that gives rise to the custom, or would
      give immigrants the idea that this was an acceptable
      practice. "How dare it even cross their mind," said Meserak
      Ramsey, an Ethiopian immigrant whose San Josebased group,
      Forward USA, seeks to eliminate the ritual completely. "What
      the Somalis, what the immigrants like me need is an
      education, not sensitivity to culture."<sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup> Opponents did not have good answers
      to the problem Harborview faced, that is, the near certainty
      that these girls would face a far worse fate elsewhere.</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to the onslaught in the press,
      individual members of Harborview received hate-mail and death
      threats. Finally, the Center put out a press release saying
      that its "role in considering the need for a culturally
      sensitive, safe alternative to the practices of female
      circumcision or female genital mutilation has now been
      concluded."<sup><a href="#n91">91</a></sup> Physicians at the
      Center are convinced that many of the girls whose mothers had
      asked for the minimalist procedure were instead subjected to
      some form of ritual practice either in Africa or by one of
      three California "midwives" imported by the community.<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup> As Doriane Lambelet Coleman notes,
      "In their Pyrrhic victory . . . Harborview's opponents
      probably denied some Somali girls in Seattle the possibility
      of living a life free of the physical and emotional
      devastation caused by the traditional circumcision practiced
      in their community; in the name of ideological purity, they
      probably sacrificed some of the very girls they claim are the
      beneficiaries of their efforts."<sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In light of the news releases quoted above,
      Coleman's "probably" should be changed to "certainly." One
      Somali activist expressed concern that Somalis preparing to
      leave Africa for America will hear of Harborview's decision
      and take it as a catalyst to have their daughters cut in
      Somalia before emigrating.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">For the purposes of this article, what is
      most interesting about this story are the legal ramifications
      of Harborview's proposed experiment. At the time of the
      public brouhaha, the federal law authored by Congresswoman
      Schroeder had been passed but had not yet taken effect.
      Schroeder herself wrote to Harborview, saying that she
      believed the proposal would violate the new law.<sup><a
      href="#n95">95</a></sup> "The clear intent of the
      legislation," she wrote, "was to criminalize any medically
      unnecessary procedure involving female genitalia."<sup><a
      href="#n96">96</a></sup> Certainly, under some forms of state
      criminal statutes, such as North Dakota's, any practice, no
      matter how minimal, would constitute a felony under the
      "surgically alters" wording of the law.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dr. Leslie Miller of Harborview responded to
      the final decision by saying: "We will cut the whole foreskin
      off a penis, but we won't even consider a cut, a sunna,
      cutting the prepuce, a little bloodletting (on a girl). . .
      ."<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As we shall see below, newborn male
      circumcision faces no such legal constraints. The Seattle
      experience makes clear that, at least in the eyes of the
      Federal law's primary author, even a tiny cut with proper
      medical precautions done on a minor female's genitalia is
      illegal. Male circumcision, however, which is a more
      substantial procedure than the one contemplated in Seattle,
      is legal even when done by traditional, nonmedical
      practitioners in the home. As Coleman comments, the
      comparison between male circumcision and female genital
      mutilation, while "usually disingenuous," in this case was
      "ultimately legitimate."<sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup>
      Thus, the difference in legal constraints needs to be
      justified, or else it raises questions of religious
      discrimination and equal protection.</p>

      <p class="a">A. Medical and Statistical Facts</p>

      <p class="text2">In this article, I shall confine myself to
      looking at the vast majority of male surgical alterations:
      routine newborn circumcisions. In routine circumcision,
      whether or not it is done as part of a religious ritual, the
      practitioner completely removes the foreskin, exposing the
      tip of the penis.<sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup>
      "Circumcision is the amputation of the prepuce from the rest
      of the penis, resulting in permanent alteration of the
      anatomy, histology and function of the penis."<sup><a
      href="#n100">100</a></sup> When done as a medical procedure,
      it is usually accomplished in the first few days of life, if
      the infant is "stable and healthy."<sup><a
      href="#n101">101</a></sup> As part of the traditional Jewish
      berit milah it is always done on the eighth day of life,
      unless there are medical indications to the contrary.<sup><a
      href="#n102">102</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Frequency of male genital alteration (MGA)
      in the United States is surprisingly difficult to ascertain.
      Hospital discharge records provide only partial information,
      as they do not include ritual circumcision or circumcisions
      performed in doctors' offices after mother and baby have left
      the hospital (as hospital stays become shorter, this latter
      practice presumably is more common).<sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup> This leads to the
      counter-intuitive result that significantly fewer infants are
      altered in New York City than virtually anywhere else in the
      country.<sup><a href="#n104">104</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Another way to get at this data is to
      interview adult men about their circumcised state. It turns
      out, surprisingly, that about one third of men do not know
      whether or not they have been circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n105">105</a></sup> However, given these difficulties,
      it is generally agreed that the circumcision rate among
      American males is somewhere between 70 and 80 percent. This
      is in contrast to other Western countries, which have much
      lower rates. In Canada, the rate had been comparable to the
      U.S., but fell to less than 20 percent in the 1990s,
      following a re-evaluation of the efficacy of circumcision by
      the Canadian medical community. Canada's story is repeated in
      Australia and Great Britain, which have comparably low rates
      today.<sup><a href="#n106">106</a></sup> In some Western
      countries, such as Finland, the practice is virtually
      nonexistent.<sup><a href="#n107">107</a></sup> "The United
      States stands alone as the only country in which the
      overwhelming majority of newborn males are circumcised,
      purportedly for health reasons."<sup><a
      href="#n108">108</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Within the U.S., MGA rates vary sharply with
      the socioeconomic status of the parents; the single most
      critical variable is the mother's level of education. In one
      study, 62 percent of respondents whose mothers did not finish
      high school had been circumcised, compared to 84 to 87
      percent of those whose mothers had graduated from high
      school.<sup><a href="#n109">109</a></sup> Rates also vary
      widely with geography, approaching 95 percent in some areas
      of the Midwest, but falling to the 50 percent mark on the
      West Coast.<sup><a href="#n110">110</a></sup> Although Jews
      are, not surprisingly, more likely than other groups to have
      high rates of male circumcision, the rates are so high
      overall in the U.S. that religion does not play an important
      statistical role.</p>

      <p class="text2">The United States stands apart from the rest
      of the Western world for its high rates of neonatal
      circumcision. . . . With respect to prevalence, we
      demonstrated that circumcision rates are greatest among
      whites and better-educated respondents and that Americans of
      various religions do not display significantly different
      rates. The latter fact illustrates the unique cultural status
      maintained by circumcision in the United States. While
      circumcision has been employed as a religious marker in other
      Western societies, it has clearly lost such an association in
      America.<sup><a href="#n111">111</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The March 1999 statement of the Task Force
      on Circumcision of the AAP adopted "an evidence-based
      approach" to the question of newborn MGA, and found that,
      while scientific evidence shows "potential medical benefits"
      of the procedure, "these data are not sufficient to recommend
      routine neonatal circumcision."<sup><a
      href="#n112">112</a></sup> Acknowledging that many parents
      make the decision about circumcision for reasons apart from
      the medical evidence, the Task Force said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        In the pluralistic society of the United States in which
        parents are afforded wide authority for determining what
        constitutes appropriate child-rearing and child welfare, it
        is legitimate for the parents to take into account
        cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, in addition to
        medical factors, when making this choice.<sup><a
        href="#n113">113</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">In 1992, in a hospital in New Mexico, a
      group of nurses who had been struggling with this issue since
      1986 declared themselves "conscientious objectors to
      circumcision" and sent a formal letter to the administration
      of the hospital in which they worked, declaring their refusal
      to assist in the procedure. The group included 24
      maternal-child nurses (nearly fifty percent of the staff).
      Their resistance eventually produced a Memo of Understanding
      for Circumcision Procedure, to recognize the conscientious
      objector rights of nurses employed by the hospital.<sup><a
      href="#n114">114</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the rest of the Western world, medical
      support for routine newborn male circumcision is rapidly
      eroding. In Australia, the Australian College of Paediatrics'
      Position Statement on Routine Circumcision of Normal Male
      Infants and Boys opposes the practice, but acknowledges that
      some parents will opt for circumcision for "social, religious
      and family factors," in which case it is the duty of the
      physician to recommend that this be performed "at an age and
      under circumstances which reduce hazards to a
      minimum."<sup><a href="#n115">115</a></sup> Australia's
      national health plan no longer covers the operation, and some
      Australian physicians refuse to operate even when parents are
      willing to pay for it privately.<sup><a
      href="#n116">116</a></sup> The British Medical Association
      stated in 1996 that "(i)t is rarely necessary to circumcise
      an infant for medical reasons" and "(t)he BMA opposes
      unnecessarily invasive procedures."<sup><a
      href="#n117">117</a></sup> Nonetheless, the BMA does not
      support an outright prohibition against newborn circumcision,
      saying that "(d)octors must be allowed to make clinical
      (judgments) in individual cases."<sup><a
      href="#n118">118</a></sup> On the subject of ritual
      circumcision performed by physicians, the group says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The BMA does not have a policy on the ethics of male
        circumcision for religious or cultural purposes but issues
        this guidance in response to doctors for all relevant
        factors to be taken into account. The practice of
        circumcision has previously been considered to be morally
        neutral, that is, no harm was caused to the child and
        therefore with appropriate consent from both parents or a
        person lawfully exercising parental responsibility, it
        could be carried out. The neutrality of the procedure,
        however is now being increasingly challenged although it is
        argued that it is in the best interest of the child to be
        circumcised, to be accepted into a religion or community.
        Arguably the procedure can confer social benefits in some
        such circumstances.<sup><a href="#n119">119</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">In 1996, the Canadian Paediatric Society
      issued a statement from its Fetus and Newborn Committee,
      recommending that "circumcision of newborns should not be
      routinely performed," an iteration of a position it took in
      1982.<sup><a href="#n120">120</a></sup> In 1995, at the
      annual meeting of the Registered Nurses' Association of
      British Columbia, delegates passed a resolution condemning
      routine circumcision.<sup><a href="#n121">121</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">These policy statements by the relevant
      medical communities have clearly had an effect. Rates of
      newborn male circumcision in those countries, which in the
      1970s were similar to those in the U.S., have fallen to below
      twenty percent.<sup><a href="#n122">122</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As the medical rationale for male
      circumcision is eroded, one sees increasing resistance to
      performing the procedure even when parents request it. An
      article in the Canadian Medical Journal Association noted
      that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The performance of unnecessary surgery on minors who have
        no say in the matter does not sit well with many people who
        consider circumcision a denial of basic human
        rights&mdash;specifically an infant's right to the respect
        and autonomy fundamental to Canadian law.... Removal of a
        normally functioning healthy body part without medical
        indication has also been viewed as a violation of the
        Hippocratic oath, falling under the United Nations'
        definition of genital mutilation.... In BC (British
        Columbia), the Infants Act stipulates that a child should
        be accorded the same protection under law as adults: if an
        adult male cannot be forced to undergo circumcision in
        adulthood, it follows that he shouldn't be forced to have
        it in infancy simply because he is too small to
        resist.<sup><a href="#n123">123</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="a">B. Medical Arguments For and Against Newborn
      MGA</p>

      <p class="a">1. Arguments in Favor of Newborn MGA</p>

      <p class="text2">In the United States, arguments about the
      medical basis for routine MGA have waxed and waned. In the
      1970's, the AAP officially said there was "no medical
      indication" for the procedure, in 1989 it talked of
      "potential medical benefits;" the recent report speaks of
      some benefits, but none sufficient to support the routine use
      of the procedure.<sup><a href="#n124">124</a></sup> To some
      extent, this indecision is a result of different data, and to
      some extent it is likely the result of a tension between
      "evidence-based medicine" and the strongly held intuitions,
      based on perceived experience, of pediatricians powerful
      enough to influence policy. David L. Gollaher provides a
      summation of sorts when he says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        A few clinical researchers have tried to draw together the
        different strands of investigation and to estimate an
        overall effect. One group built a model incorporating most
        published evidence of risks associated with being
        circumcised or uncircumcised. Using quality-adjusted years
        of survival as their measure, based on a life expectancy of
        85 years, they figured that the average man circumcised at
        birth could expect to live 84.999 years, whereas his
        uncircumcised counterpart would live 84.71 years. A
        subsequent study that included more recent findings about
        UTI (urinary tract infections) determined that, all things
        considered, being uncircumcised would shorten an average
        man's life by a total of fourteen hours. Statistically, the
        known pros and cons of circumcision cancel each other
        out.<sup><a href="#n125">125</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">One argument in favor of routine newborn MGA
      is that it protects against urinary tract infections. A
      review of the many studies on this subject shows that,
      despite a number of problems in summarizing and comparing the
      studies, there does seem to be a protective effect. In
      children younger than one year of age, the increased risk of
      a urinary tract infection among uncircumcised males may be as
      much as 4-to 10-fold. However, the disease is usually mild,
      and even at a 10-fold increase, the real numbers of children
      experiencing problems would be one in one hundred.<sup><a
      href="#n126">126</a></sup> The Canadian Paediatric Society
      concluded that "the incidence of complications of
      circumcision, according to some reports, approaches or
      exceeds the incidence of UTI (urinary tract infection) among
      uncircumcised male infants."<sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup> Wallerstein, a critic of routine
      circumcision, points out that, "the penis is the only organ
      subjected to routine prophylactic surgery."<sup><a
      href="#n128">128</a></sup> Dean Edell, a Jewish physician and
      father of five sons, commented on the Phil Donohue television
      show that "(a) certain small percentage of men with foreskins
      will get disease of the foreskin, but you can't just remove
      everybody's. You can't pull everybody's teeth to avoid
      cavities, remove breast tissue from little girls so they
      won't get breast cancer."<sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Another common argument is that genitally
      altered males are at lower risk of penile cancer. The risk is
      low in any case: the annual age-adjusted incidence in the
      U.S. is about 1 per 100,000. The rate of penile cancer in
      countries where very few men are circumcised is lower
      (compared to the U.S.) in Denmark, but higher in Brazil and
      India.<sup><a href="#n130">130</a></sup> Circumcision is
      extremely rare in Finland, where penile cancer rates are
      "extraordinarily low."<sup><a href="#n131">131</a></sup> It
      is thus difficult to ascertain whether the relevant variable
      is the circumcision, or some other factor relating, perhaps,
      to developed versus developing countries. The American Cancer
      Society, in 1996, stated that routine circumcision should not
      be promoted as a means of preventing penile cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n132">132</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One confusing issue involves proper care and
      hygiene of the intact penis. Proponents of circumcision are
      likely to argue that it is difficult and painful to fully
      retract the foreskin early in life, in order to clean it
      properly.<sup><a href="#n133">133</a></sup> However,
      physicians who have studied the issue now believe that the
      normal foreskin does not retract fully in early childhood,
      sometimes up until adolescence, and that there is no need to
      force it; "gentle washing" while bathing is enough.<sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision has long been a factor in the
      epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases. A 1999
      analysis reported that the relative risk of heterosexual HIV
      infection (the primary transmission vector in Asia and
      Africa) is two to eight times higher for uncircumcised
      males.<sup><a href="#n135">135</a></sup> One could argue that
      it is silly to use surgery for a public health risk that also
      be controlled by using condoms. However, in places where men
      have not been persuaded to the routine use of condoms, there
      may be good arguments for circumcision. More work needs to be
      done before the effects of circumcision can be detached from
      the effects of the culture and lifestyle of groups of people
      who circumcise. David L. Gollaher says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Circumcision is not random. It remains an expression of
        powerful cultural and religious ideas. Knowing this, we are
        apt to wonder whether the circumcised practice different
        hygiene, engage in different sexual behaviors, or even eat
        different foods than the uncircumcised.<sup><a
        href="#n136">136</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">With respect to other sexually transmitted
      diseases, the Canadian Paediatric Society reports a mixed bag
      of results<sup><a href="#n137">137</a></sup> with no clear
      answer. The same report said that no causal relationship had
      been established between a man's circumcised state and the
      likelihood that his female sexual partner(s) will develop
      cervical cancer.<sup><a href="#n138">138</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">2. Arguments Against Routine Newborn MGA</p>

      <p class="text2">The simplest and most forceful argument
      against MGA is that, absent some compelling reason, one ought
      to leave the natural body intact. Thus, the goals of Nurses
      for the Rights of the Child, formed in 1995, include: "To act
      as human-rights advocates for babies and children by
      informing and educating the public that the forced amputation
      of a healthy part of the genitals of an unconsenting infant
      or child&mdash;whether in the name of medicine, religion, or
      social custom&mdash;is a human-rights violation."<sup><a
      href="#n139">139</a></sup> Or to quote a memorable line from
      web-columnist Bruce LaBruce, "Why throw away a beautifully
      crafted, luxuriously textured protective carrying case
      designed specifically for one of your most precious
      mementos?"<sup><a href="#n140">140</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">"The simple argument against routine
      neonatal circumcision is that the procedure is unnecessary
      surgery with little benefit, performed on a patient incapable
      of giving consent."<sup><a href="#n141">141</a></sup> If
      circumcision is best described as elective cosmetic surgery,
      then it should not be performed on persons without their
      consent. In this case, consent by parents for surgery on
      minors is not ethically sufficient, because there is no
      therapeutic benefit to be gained. This argument is
      reminiscent of arguments against genital alteration on female
      children.</p>

      <p class="text2">A third argument, which necessarily relates
      to the first two, is that no surgery, however minor, is
      completely without risk. Risks that might be reasonable when
      balanced against the benefits expected from therapeutic
      surgeries are not acceptable when the surgery is cosmetic in
      nature (especially when the subject is not a consenting
      adult). The AAP Task Force on Circumcision reports that the
      "true incidence of complications after newborn circumcision
      is unknown," but cites two large studies as suggesting that
      most complications are quite minor and that the frequency is
      between 0.2% and 0.6% of all newborn procedures.<sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup> In September 1999, the Food and
      Drug Administration warned doctors to watch out for worn-out
      or misassembled surgical clamps, which had caused 105
      reported cases of injuries over a three year period (among an
      estimated 1.2 million circumcisions performed each year).
      Injuries ranged from bleeding to urethral damage, and
      included four cases in which the tip of the penis was
      amputated.<sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup> On the other
      hand, if a person has not been circumcised as an infant and
      problems develop which require the operation later in life,
      the risks are higher.<sup><a href="#n144">144</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Because most traditional <i>mohels</i> are
      not medical doctors, there are no reliable reporting
      mechanisms for documenting adverse outcomes from
      circumcisions performed in the home; therefore, "the
      incidence of complications after berit mila is difficult to
      determine."<sup><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> There is a
      common belief, both within and without the Jewish community,
      that mohels are better at circumcision because that is their
      only job and they do more of them. Henry C. Romberg, a
      physician and a traditional mohel, asserts that "the
      traditional mohel performs a circumcision far more
      skillfully, far less traumatically, far more safely, and
      certainly far more aesthetically (though this last quality is
      in the eye of the beholder) than the average medical house
      officer who is assigned to circumcise newborn babies."<sup><a
      href="#n146">146</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Another argument against circumcision is
      that psychological damage is done by subjecting a newborn to
      a painful and violent procedure. As early as 1976, Dr.
      Benjamin Spock said that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I am in favor of leaving the penis alone. Pediatric opinion
        is swinging away from routine circumcision as unnecessary
        and at least mildly dangerous. I also believe that there is
        a potential danger of emotional harm resulting from the
        operation.<sup><a href="#n147">147</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Or as another author put it, in more
      forceful language:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Leave it to humans to invent a method for making an infant
        male's first experience of genital sensation a traumatic,
        castrating one. Let's piss off men early on and make sex
        and violence interchangeable in their minds, shall
        we?<sup><a href="#n148">148</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Just as Western commentators assume that, of
      course, girls subjected to FGA must be emotionally damaged by
      the process, there is also a tendency to assume that, of
      course, MGA is benign or trivial, and men who complain of it
      as adults are slightly weird, or whiners. In neither case is
      there empirical evidence for the percentage of adults who
      claim to have been damaged as children. In both cases, the
      acceptance of the procedure by the wider culture makes it
      difficult for people to speak up about their own experience.
      People who argue against male alteration collect accounts of
      men who, looking back, feel damaged by the operation. Ronald
      Goldman claims that "(t)hose who have feelings about their
      circumcision are generally afraid to express them because
      they are afraid that their feelings may be dismissed or
      ridiculed."<sup><a href="#n149">149</a></sup> Of the many
      comments Goldman has collected, I will quote just one:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The shock and surprise of my life came when I was in junior
        high school, and I was in the showers after gym....I
        wondered what was wrong with those penises that looked
        different than mine....I soon realized I had part of me
        removed. I felt incomplete and very frustrated when I
        realized that I could never be like I was when I was
        born&mdash;intact. That frustration is with me to this day.
        Throughout life I have regretted my circumcision. Daily I
        wish I were whole.<sup><a href="#n150">150</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The most difficult argument to judge,
      perhaps, is the role of the foreskin in sexual pleasure, and
      the extent to which circumcision heightens or lowers
      sensation for men and their partners. Circumcised men who
      militate against the procedure commonly claim that their
      sexual pleasure has been lessened (both as individuals and as
      part of a couple). One man who was circumcised as an adult
      and was thus able to compare, said, "It was like night and
      day. I lost most sensation. I would give anything to get the
      feeling back. I would give my house."<sup><a
      href="#n151">151</a></sup> Another said:</p>

      <p class="text2">The sexual differences (sic) between a
      circumcised and uncircumcised penis is . . . like wearing a
      condom or wearing a glove. . . . Sight without color would be
      a good analogy. . . . Only being able to see in
      black-andwhite, for example, rather than seeing in full color
      would be like experiencing an orgasm with a foreskin and
      without. There are feelings you'll just never have without a
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n152">152</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Proponents of MGA usually describe the
      foreskin as merely a flap of useless, extra skin.<sup><a
      href="#n153">153</a></sup> Some researchers disagree. Three
      Canadian scientists, for example, point out that, based on
      autopsies they performed on 22 adult foreskins, the outer
      foreskin's concentration of nerves is "impressive," and the
      sensitivity to stimuli is similar to that of the rest of the
      penis. The foreskin, they concluded, has many different kinds
      of nerves, and " should be considered a structural and
      functional unit made up of more (or) less specialized
      parts...the glans and penile shaft gain excellent if
      surrogate sensitivity from the prepuce (foreskin)."<sup><a
      href="#n154">154</a></sup> Male circumcision "removes between
      a (third and a half) of the penile skin, as well as nearly
      all of the penile fine-touch neuroreceptors."<sup><a
      href="#n155">155</a></sup> "After circumcision, the surface
      of the glans thickens like a callus ... (with) nerve endings
      that can only sense deep pressure and pain."<sup><a
      href="#n156">156</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Critics of MGA claim that the woman's
      pleasure suffers as well,<sup><a href="#n157">157</a></sup>
      as she misses out on the "sliding" function of the foreskin
      and loses the lubricating properties of "the natural
      penis."<sup><a href="#n158">158</a></sup> For obvious
      reasons, evidence for this claim is hard to come by.<sup><a
      href="#n159">159</a></sup> A study done in Iowa in the late
      1980s reported that women had aesthetic preferences for
      circumcised penises. However, as only 16.5% of the 145 women
      surveyed had had sexual experiences with both altered and
      unaltered men, it appears that the women were more likely
      reporting a preference for what was familiar. (Strikingly,
      over half the women in that study said that they preferred
      circumcised penises because they looked "more
      natural.")<sup><a href="#n160">160</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A 1999 study that surveyed 139 women who had
      had sexual experiences with both circumcised and
      "anatomically complete" partners reported a strong preference
      for unaltered men.<sup><a href="#n161">161</a></sup> They
      stated that they were far more likely to experience vaginal
      orgasm with an unaltered partner, and much less likely to
      experience discomfort or to need artificial lubricants.
      Interestingly, they also reported more instances of premature
      ejaculation among altered partners (contrary to the common
      myth that decreased sensitivity in the glans enables
      circumcised men to "last longer"). "During prolonged
      intercourse with their circumcised partners, women were less
      likely to 'really get into it' and more likely to 'want to
      get it over with. ... On the other hand, with their unaltered
      partners, the reverse was true; they were less likely to
      'want to get it over with' and considerably more likely to
      "really get into it."'<sup><a href="#n162">162</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The authors had a number of hypotheses for
      this result. "When the anatomically complete penis thrusts in
      the vagina, it does not slide, but rather glides on its own
      'bedding' of movable skin, in much the same way that a
      turtle's neck glides in and out of the folder layers of skin
      surrounding it." This gliding motion allows stimulation with
      "minimal friction or loss of secretions." Further, they posit
      that because of the fine-touch receptors in the glans of
      uncircumcised men and the way in which the foreskin bunches
      up behind the corona, unaltered men are more likely to adopt
      a style of sexual intercourse ("short, gentle thrusts" and
      more contact with the clitoris and mons pubis) that women in
      the study found more satisfying.<sup><a
      href="#n163">163</a></sup> The authors also speculate that
      the well-known statistic that unaltered men are less likely
      to engage in a wide variety of sexual activities (e.g.,
      fellatio, anal sex) may be attributed to their greater
      satisfaction in vaginal intercourse.<sup><a
      href="#n164">164</a></sup> However, as we know that there are
      correlations between male circumcision, culture, and
      socioeconomic status, this is a hard claim to pin down.</p>

      <p class="a">3. The Problem of Pain</p>

      <p class="text2">Until recently, there was considerable
      disagreement over whether newborns felt pain at all, and
      specifically if they felt the pain of genital alteration.
      Medically and scientifically, it is now generally recognized
      that newborns do feel pain.<sup><a href="#n165">165</a></sup>
      The related belief that newborns, even if they did experience
      pain, have no memory of it and therefore no lasting effect,
      has also been repudiated.<sup><a href="#n166">166</a></sup>
      Despite the scientific consensus on these points, some
      defenders of circumcision disagree. In a 1996 letter to the
      editor of the <i>New York Times</i>, Rabbi Eugene Cohen,
      president of the Brit Milah (ritual circumcision) Board of
      New York, stated "newborns 'cannot feel pain."'<sup><a
      href="#n167">167</a></sup> <i>Mohel</i> (ritual circumciser)
      Romi Cohn, who has performed thousands of operations, called
      the procedure "absolutely painless."<sup><a
      href="#n168">168</a></sup> An article in the <i>Brit Milah
      Newsletter</i> calls the pain "mild," and recommends that the
      traditional cloth dipped in wine and placed in the infant's
      mouth, is sufficient pain control.<sup><a
      href="#n169">169</a></sup> Romberg, a physician and
      <i>mohel</i>, wrote in 1982 that "(i)t has been my experience
      that the procedure is generally painless up to at least four
      or five months of age."<sup><a href="#n170">170</a></sup>
      Romberg concedes that babies are often "cranky" the first
      night after circumcision, but attributes this to the
      irritation of the bandage rather than to pain.<sup><a
      href="#n171">171</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Just as the debate over FGA is made lurid by
      firsthand descriptions of young girls being tortured and
      mutilated, so the debate over MGA has its own horror stories.
      Marilyn Milos, who first witnessed a male circumcision when a
      nursing student, provides one example:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">We students filed into the newborn nursery
        to find a baby strapped spread-eagle to a plastic board on
        a counter top across the room. He was struggling against
        his restraints&mdash;tugging, whimpering, and then crying
        helplessly.... I stroked his little head and spoke softly
        to him. He began to relax and was momentarily quiet. The
        silence was soon broken by a piercing scream&mdash;the
        baby's reaction to having his foreskin pinched and crushed
        as the doctor attached the clamp to his penis.</p>

        <p class="text1">The shriek intensified when the doctor
        inserted an instrument between the foreskin and the glans
        (head of the penis), tearing the two structures apart. The
        baby started shaking his head back and forth&mdash;the only
        part of his body free to move&mdash;as the doctor used
        another clamp to crush the foreskin lengthwise, which he
        then cut. This made the opening of the foreskin large
        enough to insert a circumcision instrument, the device used
        to protect the glans from being severed during the surgery.
        The baby began to gasp and choke, breathless from his
        shrill continuous screams...During the next stage of the
        surgery, the doctor crushed the foreskin against the
        circumcision instrument and then, finally, amputated it.
        The baby was limp, exhausted, spent.<sup><a
        href="#n172">172</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Scientifically, there is ample evidence that
      newborns do experience circumcision as painful, and that the
      impact of that pain lingers even after the procedure is
      completed.<sup><a href="#n173">173</a></sup> "During
      circumcision boys are agitated, cry intensely, and have
      changes in facial expression. Their heart rates and blood
      pressure increase, and their oxygenation decreases. Their
      serum cortisol, &szlig;endorphin, and catecholamine
      concentrations rise. Clearly, circumcision is
      painful."<sup><a href="#n174">174</a></sup> Studies have
      shown that infants who experience the pain of circumcision
      exhibit disturbances in feeding and sleeping.<sup><a
      href="#n175">175</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1997, Taddio, Katz, Ilersich, and Koren
      noted that analgesia is still "rarely" given for routine
      circumcisions, because of "a common belief that the effects
      of circumcision pain are short-lived and clinically
      insignificant ...."<sup><a href="#n176">176</a></sup> To test
      that belief, the researchers compared three sets of infants
      with respect to their pain response to routine vaccinations
      at four and six months. Infants who had been altered as
      newborns showed a stronger pain response four or six months
      later than did infants who had not been circumcised. Further,
      within the altered group, infants who had had the benefit of
      a topical analgesic cream during their circumcision, reacted
      less strongly to the vaccination than did infants who had
      been circumcised without analgesia.<sup><a
      href="#n177">177</a></sup> Scientists are investigating the
      possibility that early experience with pain may actually
      change the way in which neural pathways for pain
      develop.<sup><a href="#n178">178</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In response to the growing acknowledgement
      that infant pain is real, it is increasingly recommended that
      babies who undergo MGA be given the benefit of some form of
      analgesia. "The ethical responsibility of clinicians is to
      provide full treatment of pain in children unless otherwise
      justified by defined therapeutic benefits."<sup><a
      href="#n179">179</a></sup> The AAP statement strongly
      counsels the use of analgesia. But what kind of analgesia is
      safe and effective? According to the AAP, neither sucrose on
      a pacifier nor acetaminophen is adequate for the operative
      pain and "cannot be recommended as the sole method of
      analgesia."<sup><a href="#n180">180</a></sup> Presumably,
      this would apply also to the few drops of wine on a cloth
      that is the mainstay of the traditional mohel.</p>

      <p class="text2">The AAP report distinguishes three types of
      analgesia. The first is EMLA cream (eutectic (easily melted)
      mixture of local anesthetics), applied to the penis 60 to 90
      minutes before the procedure. The second is dorsal penile
      nerve block, administered by needle at two spots at the base
      of the penis. The third is subcutaneous ring block, also by
      injection. This latter was found to be the most efficacious
      in preventing pain. The AAP group called this a "simple and
      highly effective technique."<sup><a
      href="#n181">181</a></sup> The EMLA cream, while the easiest
      to administer, is unfortunately the least effective.<sup><a
      href="#n182">182</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Even among <i>mohels</i> who are also
      physicians and who are interested in working toward
      amelioration of the baby's pain, there is only partial
      acceptance of these analgesic methods. In the 1990 book
      <i>Berit Mila in the Reform Context</i>, which "will
      undoubtedly become the classic text for (the Reform) movement
      regarding matters of circumcision," Dr. Thomas Goldenburg, in
      his chapter on medical issues, wrote that a local anesthetic
      is "unnecessary."<sup><a href="#n183">183</a></sup> Dr.
      Dorothy Greenbaum wrote in 1995 that she used a mixture of
      swaddling and a sucrose soaked pacifier for pain relief, but
      was beginning a project to experiment with EMLA.<sup><a
      href="#n184">184</a></sup> A model brochure for parents
      written by Rick Streiffer, a Reform<sup><a
      href="#n185">185</a></sup> <i>mohel</i> and physician,
      published in the same issue of the Berit Mila Newsletter as
      Greenbaum's article, explains to parents that "(n)ewborn
      circumcision is usually done without anesthesia." Streiffer
      believes that the pain of circumcision lasts only a couple of
      minutes, and that injecting local anesthesia actually
      increases overall stress.<sup><a href="#n186">186</a></sup>
      Another physician/<i>mohel</i>, Stuart M. Berlin, wrote in
      1989 that the pain of circumcision is "tolerable." His
      remarks, contained in an article written in response to a
      Jewish woman expressing great concern about the pain of
      circumcision, are worth quoting at length:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Yes there is pain associated with being circumcised. Now,
        what does that mean?<br />
         There is a misconception that pain is a bad thing to be
        avoided at all cost. Pain is part of life as a human being.
        We could not survive without pain ... We could not grow and
        learn as individuals without pain. You cannot give your
        child a life without pain. The consequence of doing that
        would be disastrous.<br />
         The question to be asked is not is there any pain, but is
        the pain tolerable? Regarding infant circumcision without
        anesthesia the answer is certainly yes. Pain must be placed
        with (sic) a context. All babies undergoing circumcision
        have undergone a much more prolonged and painful experience
        than circumcision. That experience is not elective, we
        don't choose to be born, but we are. . . . .<br />
         Compared to being born, a circumcision is a brief
        procedure, less than two minutes by the Mogen technique,
        with mild pain, easily tolerated, and quickly subsides. . .
        . .<br />
         I have been very impressed with the use of wine as an
        anesthetic at a bris. For wine to be effective, enough must
        be given and it must be given enough time to work. When I
        perform a bris, I explain the history, meaning and
        significance of the ceremony for about 15 minutes. All
        during this time the baby is taking the wine by sucking on
        a washcloth dipped in wine. The babies still cries (sic)
        when they are restrained on the circumcision board, and the
        circumcision itself is less traumatic than being
        restrained.<sup><a href="#n187">187</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Some writers have suggested that the parents
      of circumcised infants either deny the pain or are in
      "collusion."<sup><a href="#n188">188</a></sup> Ronald
      Goldman, a critic of circumcision, reports on attending a
      Jewish ritual circumcision where the baby cried very hard for
      a long time, but a guest at the ceremony later recalled that
      the baby had not cried at all.<sup><a
      href="#n189">189</a></sup> Michael Herzbrun reports asking
      fathers whether or not they would choose a procedure for
      their newborn sons that included some kind of anesthetic. He
      says that a number of fathers found the suggestion "fatuous,"
      and responded that "'(y)ou're making too much about this,
      rabbi; that's the way it's always been done; no one I know
      remembers the pain, isn't that right?!"'<sup><a
      href="#n190">190</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In sum, we know that newborns feel pain,
      that an initial painful experience may make them more
      sensitive to pain months or perhaps even years later in life,
      and that analgesics of various levels of efficacy exist.
      However, it appears that, despite articles in the medical
      literature exploding the myth that newborns do not feel pain
      or that genital alteration is not painful enough to warrant
      analgesics, the majority of male newborn alterations are done
      without effective pain control measures.<sup><a
      href="#n191">191</a></sup> This lack of pain control does not
      seem to be associated primarily with ritual practitioners nor
      with physicians, but occurs across the board. In 1999, Carole
      Lannon, the pediatrician who headed the AAP Task Force on
      Circumcision, said that fewer than half the children operated
      on in the hospital setting had received anesthesia; she and
      David Gollaher agreed that there is no anesthesia in the
      "typical" traditional berit milah.<sup><a
      href="#n192">192</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">4. Oversight</p>

      <p class="text2">As with virtually all medical operations,
      there is no legal oversight of MGA performed by licensed
      physicians, either in the hospital, the outpatient clinic, or
      in the home as part of a religious ritual. There is also no
      legal oversight, nor even reporting, of traditional
      practitioners who do not have medical training. Apparently,
      MGA is considered so minor, or such a familiar part of the
      American landscape, that mohels are not considered to be
      practicing medicine without a license. In the late 19th
      century, bills in states such as Ohio and New York would have
      banned ritual circumcision altogether, or required the
      presence of a licensed physician; these bills were probably
      motivated as much by anti-Semitism and desire to protect
      physicians' income as they were by concern for the baby boys;
      in any case, they failed to garner sufficient support.<sup><a
      href="#n193">193</a></sup> Today, according to one
      <i>mohel</i>: "The last thing which the observant Jewish
      community desires is governmental licensing since this often
      degenerates into a not so subtle ruse through which to
      eliminate traditional norms of <i>bris milah</i> and convert
      it into an aseptic, cosmetic, standardized surgical procedure
      totally devoid of religious meaning and value."<sup><a
      href="#n194">194</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There is also no requirement that
      <i>mohels</i> be certified even within their own religious
      communities.<sup><a href="#n195">195</a></sup> Some
      certification programs do exist but in many cases
      <i>mohels</i> are still trained in apprenticeship to other
      <i>mohels</i>, and parents are urged to seek out the most
      skilled ones by consulting other parents.<sup><a
      href="#n196">196</a></sup> The Berit Mila Board of Reform
      Judaism creates courses to teach physicians how to become
      <i>mohels</i>, in essence adding the religious piece onto
      existing medical expertise, but also training them in the
      technical specifics of newborn MGA.<sup><a

      <p class="text2">The religious/cultural/societal meanings of
      male and female genital alteration are often brought into
      arguments over the legality and propriety of criminalizing
      these practices. It is common to hear opponents of FGA claim
      that it is not religious in any "correct" understanding of
      Islam, or that its only cultural function is to degrade women
      and eradicate their sexuality. Conversely, MGA, when not
      being defended as good medical practice, is also often
      afforded great respect as a ritual required by the Jewish
      religion and one with no negative societal or misogynistic
      elements. A moment's thought would make it obvious to any
      student of culture that such simplistic claims cannot be
      correct. Practices that, for both girls and boys, predate
      recorded history<sup><a href="#n198">198</a></sup> and span
      many cultures and religions, cannot plausibly present such a
      simple story.</p>

      <p class="a">A. The Meanings of FGA</p>

      <p class="text2">Female genital mutilation is a human rights
      tragedy that represents an extreme example of how societies
      around the world attempt to suppress women's sexuality,
      maintain their subjugation, and control their reproductive
      function. In addition to being illegal, the procedure
      involves child abuse, torture, and violence against
      women.<sup><a href="#n199">199</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision in both males and females in
      Africa is a mark of cultural identity; it designates one's
      membership in one's tribe and participation in its life and
      assumptions.<sup><a href="#n200">200</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">1. Religion or Culture?</p>

      <p class="text2">It would be a mistake to assume an identity
      between Islam and FGA. Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most
      traditional Islamic nations, have no incidence of the
      practice,<sup><a href="#n201">201</a></sup> while non-Islamic
      minorities living in predominantly Muslim cultures sometimes
      embrace it.<sup><a href="#n202">202</a></sup> Nonetheless,
      the majority of people who practice some form of this custom
      identify with Islam, either as a religion or a culture, and a
      great deal of ink has been spilled on the question of whether
      the Koran and other authoritative Islamic texts require,
      encourage, or condemn the practice.</p>

      <p class="text2">No mention of FGA is found in the Koran, the
      sacred Muslim text.<sup><a href="#n203">203</a></sup>
      However, the inquiry cannot end with the Koran. Just as, in
      Judaism and Christianity, binding religious obligations can
      arise from oral teachings and extrabiblical sources (e.g.,
      rabbinic teachings, papal encyclicals), Islam looks to other
      sources to interpret and supplement Koranic teachings.
      Therefore, to say, "(I)t's not in the Koran, therefore it's
      not part of the religion," as some Western opponents of FGA
      have written,<sup><a href="#n204">204</a></sup> is as
      nonsensical as telling a Roman Catholic that because there is
      no prohibition against abortion in the Bible she cannot claim
      to be opposed to abortion on religious grounds.<sup><a
      href="#n205">205</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The Arabic term for Islamic law,
      <i>sharia</i>, literally means path or way to a water hole in
      the desert. For the desert dwellers living in the time of the
      Prophet Muhammad "water and direction were essential to
      life."<sup><a href="#n206">206</a></sup> In addition to the
      Koran, there are three supplemental sources of Islamic law.
      The most important is <i>hadith</i> ("narration") which are
      accounts of the sayings and doings of the Prophet which
      embody normative prescriptions, or sunnah. Not all
      <i>hadith</i> are considered canonic by all Islamic
      denominations and legal schools; furthermore, some hadith are
      considered more "strong" than others. The degree to which a
      particular <i>hadith</i> is accepted can depend on its
      coherence with the teachings of the Koran and also with the
      degree of reliability of its sources and "chain of
      transmission."<sup><a href="#n207">207</a></sup> The next
      source of law, <i>itihad</i>, is analogical
      reasoning&mdash;familiar to law students and Jewish scholars
      alike&mdash;in which the jurist faced with a novel issue
      attempts to categorize it with respect to existing case law
      and texts.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, there is <i>ijma</i>, or consensus.
      Consensus as the concept of the "informal agreement of the
      community" has an "overriding authority," and yet "there is
      no consensus on the definition of consensus."<sup><a
      href="#n208">208</a></sup> Consensus could include literally
      the whole community, or could apply only to the community of
      ulama (interpreters), or only ulama of a certain age.<sup><a
      href="#n209">209</a></sup> Reformers and traditionalists also
      disagree on whether an earlier consensus can be repealed by a
      later one.<sup><a href="#n210">210</a></sup> Feminists might
      well ask how well women's perspectives and voices are
      reflected in this process (although there are female
      ulama).</p>

      <p class="text2">Because FGA is not mentioned in the Koran,
      claims to its religious authenticity rest on <i>hadith</i>.
      This article cannot cover the wide and complex range of
      discussion among Muslim scholars on this issue, but will seek
      to sketch out a centrist, relatively uncontroversial view.
      According to many Muslim scholars, while male "circumcision"
      is religiously obligatory, female "circumcision" is
      classified as "sunnah," meaning that it is optional and
      virtuous.<sup><a href="#n211">211</a></sup> Ibn Qudamah, a
      medieval commentator on the work of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (founder
      of the strictest school of Islamic jurisprudence) writes: "As
      for circumcision, it is obligatory on men and admirable
      (makrumah) for women, but it is not obligatory for them. This
      is the position of the majority of people of
      knowledge."<sup><a href="#n212">212</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There is also grounding for the position
      that the procedure should be relatively minimal. One
      <i>hadith</i> (but one considered "weak" in its chain of
      transmission and authenticity) has the Prophet talking with a
      ritual circumciser and telling her "(d)o not overdo it,
      because that (clitoris) is lucky for the woman and dear to
      the husband."<sup><a href="#n213">213</a></sup> Making use of
      the analogicroute to legal knowledge, Muslim scholar Eric
      Winkel argues that removal of the clitoris and/or
      infibulation (as opposed to some lesser form of clitoral
      circumcision) is in the same category as castration of the
      penis, or amputation of any part, which is explicitly
      forbidden by Islam. The Koranic phrase: "Let there be no
      alteration in Allah's creation," has traditionally been
      applied to outlaw tattoos and other forms of
      disfiguration.<sup><a href="#n214">214</a></sup> Winkel also
      argues that a critical reading of the texts makes it clear
      that sexual enjoyment within marriage is to be encouraged and
      therefore that female genital alterations which have as their
      goal the eradication of female pleasure are
      "illegitimate."<sup><a href="#n215">215</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Anthropologists Lane and Rubinstein show how
      religious ideas permeate everyday thinking about the practice
      of genital alteration:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">In Islam as practiced in everyday life,
        the association of religious ideas with female circumcision
        is evident in the colloquial terms used to describe the
        custom. The use of the term <i>sunna</i> (meaning to follow
        the tradition of the Prophet), implies that the custom is
        religiously ordained. Similarly, although the classical
        Arabic term for female circumcision is <i>khifad</i>
        (literally "reduction"), in colloquial Arabic it is
        popularly called <i>tahara</i>, referring to a ritual state
        of purity that is required for Islamic prayer. In the
        bipolar opposition implied by the term <i>tahara</i>,
        genitals in their natural state...are ritually impure. In
        fact, in Egypt to ask if a woman is circumcised one asks
        "<i>Intii mutahara?</i>" "Are you purified?"<sup><a
        href="#n216">216</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The tortured history of the recent conflict
      over FGA in Egypt is a good case study of the mix of
      religious, cultural, political, and economic agendas that
      attend this issue. In Egypt, where the proportion of
      genitally altered women is among the highest in the
      world,<sup><a href="#n217">217</a></sup> there was a growing
      sentiment against the practice beginning in the 1930s and
      peaking in the late 1950s with a 1959 decree by the Ministry
      of Health prohibiting female alteration in public
      hospitals.<sup><a href="#n218">218</a></sup> (From the fact
      that Egypt has a prevalence rate of around 97%, one can infer
      that this prohibition merely insured that girls were
      subjected to this practice outside public hospitals.) During
      that period, FGA rose and fell on the agendas of various
      health and women's organizations, and was "initially of
      little importance to the Islamist movement."<sup><a
      href="#n219">219</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This decree remained in place until 1994.
      That was the year when, at the International Conference on
      Population and Development in Cairo, women from all over the
      world took activist positions on the connections between
      women's health, family planning, and human rights. During the
      Conference, a CNN film was shown that depicted the
      circumcision of a little girl, in its most horrific form. The
      film galvanized international opposition to the practice,
      often in terms that even Muslim opponents of FGA found
      insulting and racist. "In the few-minutes-long segment a
      small part of Egyptian culture was displayed that seriously
      angered and 'shamed' Egypt before the international
      community."<sup><a href="#n220">220</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Immediately after the film was aired,
      Egypt's Population Minister and members of parliament spoke
      publicly about the need to pass legislation criminalizing
      FGA. However, this was met with swift opposition from the
      Grand Shaikh of Al Azhar, one of the country's prominent
      Islamic leaders, who issued a <i>fatwa</i> (religious
      opinion) that "female circumcision is 'an Islamic duty to
      which all Muslim women should adhere."'<sup><a
      href="#n221">221</a></sup> "(C)ivic, religious, and state
      entities and groups began to use the issue as a way to define
      their position on the Egyptian political and ideological
      map."<sup><a href="#n222">222</a></sup> The Minister of
      Health and the Minister of Population each made a promise to
      the international community to strengthen the 1959 decree and
      to work harder to eradicate the practice. On its side, Al
      Azhar and traditionalist organizations launched a public
      campaign claiming that circumcision kept women free and
      independent and promoted female equality by preserving their
      virtue. Further, the campaign depicted female circumcision as
      an integral component of Egyptian national identity.<sup><a
      href="#n223">223</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Faced with growing political/religious
      furor, the Health Minister announced that he would defer any
      action until after the upcoming parliamentary elections. He
      then formed an advisory committee, whose advice he proceeded
      to reject. The committee had advised against legalizing FGA,
      and the Grand Mufti (the official government interpreter of
      Islamic law) had declared that the practice is not strongly
      endorsed by Islam and that its legality should be decided by
      physicians; nonetheless the Minister issued a directive
      making FGA "a legitimate medical treatment."<sup><a
      href="#n224">224</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1996, a new Health Minister again banned
      the practice, this time both in and out of hospitals. He was
      supported by a new head of Al Azhar, Sheik Mohammed Tantawi,
      who found the <i>hadith</i> concerning FGA "too vague to
      constitute a ruling."<sup><a href="#n225">225</a></sup> The
      efficacy of the ban remains to be seen. In rural areas, where
      the prevalence of FGA is virtually total, it is unthinkable
      to most villagers that the practice not continue. Doctors
      themselves, typically extremely conservative, inattentive to
      women's concerns, and with economic incentives to continue
      the practice, have challenged the ban, citing reasons of
      religion, health, and law.<sup><a href="#n226">226</a></sup>
      "Dr. Gamal Gaith, who works at the Minya el Qamh Public
      Hospital, said the decree finally prompted him to turn
      families away. 'I used to do it,' he said, 'even though I
      knew it was harmful for the women, because of the
      money."'<sup><a href="#n227">227</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Thus, we see how difficult it is to separate
      religious concerns from those which are primarily
      nationalist, cultural, economic, or medical. Nevertheless,
      across nations and cultures that practice some form of female
      genital cutting, the perception that it is a religious
      obligation, or at the very least a religious virtue, is
      ubiquitous. Lane and Rubinstein state that the belief that
      female circumcision is required by religion is "common."
      "Although it is not a practice of the majority of Muslims in
      the world, among those who do practice it female circumcision
      is nonetheless often considered to be legitimated by
      religion."<sup><a href="#n228">228</a></sup> The fatwas
      issued on the subject in Egypt are also evidence of the
      religious element in the persistence of FGA. Even writers who
      facilely dismiss the religious factor as "error," nonetheless
      acknowledge the widespread belief that FGA is required or
      expected of Muslims.<sup><a href="#n229">229</a></sup>
      Coleman, citing an interview conducted with one of the
      Harborview physicians, explained:</p>

      <blockquote>
        (O)ne Somali woman who is a Sunni Muslim "insist(ed) that
        each of her three young daughters must be cut." She claimed
        that "It's important for (their) health; it's important for
        religion. We have to keep the religion." Another woman
        noted that "(e)verything we do comes from
        religion&mdash;how we eat, how we dress, how we talk to
        people." The hospital is reported to have been
        "convinced... that as strongly as a Jewish mother believes
        her son must be circumcised to be a member of the faith, so
        do some Somali Muslim refugees in Seattle believe that
        their daughters' genitals must be cut to comply with their
        religion and demands of their culture."<sup><a
        href="#n230">230</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">A disingenuous refusal to see the connection
      between FGA and Islamic religion can serve the interests of
      Muslims who want to defend their religion and culture from
      Western criticism. Rana Kabbani, in a book intended to defend
      Islam's image after attacks on it following the fatwa against
      writer Salmon Rushdie, wrote, "I am always pained by Western
      misconceptions about the lives of Muslim women.... I was
      visited by a novelist who had come to talk to me about a
      Muslim character she wanted to put into her next book. 'How
      can a feminist like you defend Islam,' she inquired, 'when it
      advocates female circumcision?' As chance would have it, that
      same day I read a piece by the historian Marina Warner in
      which she described Islam as a religion that practices
      clitoridectomy. Could these two writers not have taken the
      trouble to discover that this was an African practice which
      had nothing whatsoever to do with Islam?" To which American
      journalist Geraldine Brooks responds, "Could... Kabbani not
      have taken the trouble to reflect that one in five Muslim
      girls lives in a community where some form of clitoridectomy
      is sanctioned and religiously justified by local Islamic
      leaders? Or to note the chapters on 'Women and Circumcision'
      appearing in many new editions of Islamic texts, especially
      in Egypt?"<sup><a href="#n231">231</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The refusal of many writers and activists to
      accept the religious elements of FGA is motivated by a number
      of factors. Western society places a high premium on (at
      least lip-service to) respect for other religions. As we
      shall see in Part V, religiously motivated practices enjoy
      special protection under the free exercise clause of the
      First Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, although it
      anticipates my Constitutional argument somewhat, it is
      appropriate to end this section with a reminder that a
      person's religious beliefs need not be "correct" nor
      universally held within her denomination, to enjoy
      constitutional protection. In <i>Thomas v. Review Board of
      Indiana</i>,<sup><a href="#n232">232</a></sup> a man refused
      to work in a factory that produced gun turrets because it was
      against his religious beliefs. The state Review Board denied
      his unemployment compensation benefits, stating that he had
      quit "voluntarily" and refusing to take his religious beliefs
      into account. The Indiana Supreme Court, in upholding the
      denial of unemployment compensation, argued that Thomas's
      religious convictions with respect to weapons-related work
      were "unclear," in part because he agreed that he would work
      in a part of the factory that produced raw materials, even if
      they eventually became weapons. The Indiana court also relied
      on the fact that other workers in the same factory who shared
      Thomas's Jehovah's Witness convictions, nonetheless had no
      religiously based objection to manufacturing gun turrets; the
      court took that as further evidence that Thomas's views were
      not truly religious. The U.S. Supreme Court however, refused
      to allow Thomas's lack of clarity, nor the idiosyncratic
      nature of his beliefs, to count against him. Nor would it
      countenance the Court becoming a theological body with the
      power to decide which person's religious beliefs are
      "correct."</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">[T]he guarantee of free exercise is not
        limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members
        of a religious sect. Particularly in this sensitive area,
        it is not within the judicial function and judicial
        competence to inquire whether the petitioner or his fellow
        worker more correctly perceived the commands of their
        common faith. Courts are not arbiters of scriptural
        interpretation.<sup><a href="#n233">233</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Thus we see that, whether or not a
      particular person or culture is "correct" in believing that
      FGA is part of Islam, is not constitutionally relevant.</p>

      <p class="a">2. The "Purpose" of FGA</p>

      <p class="text2">When I speak about this topic publicly, a
      common response is that the "purpose" of FGA is to subjugate
      females and to deny them their sexuality. This response can
      be used to contrast female with MGA, which is thought to have
      only benign cultural/ religious meanings. It can also be used
      to argue that the subjugation of women is not a goal to which
      U.S. law should be respectful or sympathetic; therefore,
      banning all FGA, even the "nick" proposed by the Seattle
      physicians, is acceptable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Constitutionally, of course, parents are
      given a great deal of leeway in how they bring up their
      children, including instances of gender discrimination and
      subjugation of girls. Parents can send only their boys to
      college, pull girls out of school at the minimum legal age,
      teach girls that their place is in the home, and acculturate
      boys to expect to be waited on hand and foot. Only if these
      patriarchal practices are otherwise harmful or illegal, can
      parents be legally forced to abjure them.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nonetheless, it is useful to see how
      multi-layered the motives and meanings of FGA really are.
      Leaving aside the religious significance of FGA, we are left
      with three broad categorizations (which are not, of course,
      in the least mutually exclusive): control and subjugation of
      females; eradication of female sexual pleasure; communal
      identity and cohesiveness.</p>

      <p class="text2">FGA is often justified as a way of keeping
      girls virginal and well-behaved, in societies which believe
      that women are "naturally" wild and wayward. It is probable
      that this belief is connected with the identification of the
      clitoris as a type of penis, so that a woman who possesses an
      unaltered clitoris will be as sexually aggressive as men are
      expected to be. (Among some peoples, it is believed that a
      clitoris that is not surgically altered will grow to be as
      large as a penis, or even down to the woman's knees.<sup><a
      href="#n234">234</a></sup>) As an Egyptian farmer told a
      <i>New York Times</i> reporter in 1996, after the Egyptian
      Health Minister banned the procedure, "Am I supposed to stand
      around while my daughter chases men? ... 'So what if some
      infidel doctor says it is unhealthy? Does that make it true?
      I would have circumcised my daughter even if they passed a
      death sentence against it."'<sup><a
      href="#n235">235</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">To people who hold these beliefs, the fact
      that Western nations do not practice FGA is actually an
      argument in its favor. "Banning it would make women wild like
      those in America."<sup><a href="#n236">236</a></sup>
      "American women jump from man to man because their sexual
      organs are driving them to have sex."<sup><a
      href="#n237">237</a></sup> A Somali woman in Seattle
      explained that genital alteration would protect her daughters
      from "the American disease: 'Girls 13, 14, 15 get pregnant,
      go wild, get welfare."'<sup><a href="#n238">238</a></sup> In
      Egypt, among educated middle-class women who are seeking to
      have their girls genitally altered in hospital settings, the
      increased independence of women in modern society and their
      increasing exposure to sexual stimulation have become other
      reasons to have them circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n239">239</a></sup> (Loretta Kopelman points out an
      important conflict here. Most proponents of FGA argue that
      women do not feel sexual pleasure in any case, and thus are
      not being deprived by the procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n240">240</a></sup>)</p>

      <p class="text2">FGA keeps women's sexuality in check in a
      number of ways. By removing large parts of her genitals, it
      arguably makes any sexual stimulation, from masturbation to
      intercourse, less enjoyable to her.<sup><a
      href="#n241">241</a></sup> One Egyptian doctor said that, by
      removing her "external parts," a girl will no longer be
      sexually stimulated by "tight nylon underclothes."<sup><a
      href="#n242">242</a></sup> Infibulation makes intercourse
      extremely painful, and often impossible without preliminary
      cutting. It also makes it impossible for women who are
      supposed to be virgins to hide evidence of sexual
      intercourse.<sup><a href="#n243">243</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The dual result of lessening a woman's
      sexual pleasure while heightening that of her partner, makes
      it clear that women's health, needs and desires are not
      important. Anthropologist Ellen Gruenbaum, who studied FGA
      among the Sudanese, where the most severe form is common,
      comments:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Critics and practitioners alike think that
        pharaonic circumcision serves the interests of men.
        Although tight infibulation can obstruct first intercourse
        (and requires repeated efforts over time or even a small
        incision to widen the opening), the opening remains fairly
        tight and is retightened after each childbirth. Both men
        and women in my research communities told me that men
        derive far greater sexual pleasure from intercourse with a
        woman whose vaginal opening has been surgically narrowed in
        this way. This view is widely held as a reason for the
        continuation of the practice, even among middle-class urban
        women, including those who actively oppose the
        practice.<sup><a href="#n244">244</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">A different take on preserving men's
      interests is the theory that, because men's virility lessens
      with age, if women's sexuality were not reduced by FGA older
      men would find themselves unable to satisfy their wives. This
      disparity would drive men to the use of drugs in order to
      enhance their sexual performance.<sup><a
      href="#n245">245</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Men's interests are also served by
      protecting "family honor," and lessening the chance of
      "shotgun weddings" and illegitimate births. One way in which
      families are strengthened economically and socially is by
      judicious use of daughters to make strategic marriages and to
      produce large numbers of legitimate offspring.<sup><a
      href="#n246">246</a></sup> Girls whose virginity can be
      proven bring higher dowries. "Virginity is a money-making
      asset. That is why some nations are so keen on
      infibulation."<sup><a href="#n247">247</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In cultures which believe that genitally
      altered women are "certifiable" virgins, more satisfying
      sexual partners for their husbands, more beautiful according
      to the prevailing norms of their culture, and also more
      passive and obedient, it is not surprising to find that lack
      of alteration makes girls much less marriageable. Thus, even
      mothers who decry the practice say that they are ensuring
      their daughters' economic and social survival by making sure
      that they are desirable mates. President Kenyatta of Kenya,
      in his 1938 book, <i>Facing Mount Kenya</i>, insisted that no
      man of his tribe would consider marrying a uncircumcised
      woman.<sup><a href="#n258">248</a></sup> Making sure their
      daughters could find mates within their immigrant community
      was an important reason for the request of the Somali
      immigrant women who came to Harborview hospital.<sup><a
      href="#n249">249</a></sup> Dr. Mushira al-Shafie, Egypt's
      Deputy Health Minister, said that women feel that "their
      reputations are at stake and therefore (they) do not object
      to (FGA)."<sup><a href="#n250">250</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Having an unaltered wife can even be a
      political liability for an African politician. In Sierra
      Leone, FGA was a large though unspoken issue in the 1997
      elections (the first the country has ever known). Many women
      expressed suspicion of one of the leading candidates because
      his wife, an American, was presumably uncut. When the winner
      chose an uncut woman as Minister of Gender and Children's
      Affairs, the choice was held up for months in Parliament
      because "she would not be familiar with our adored
      customs."<sup><a href="#n251">251</a></sup> Parasathi Teare
      says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">The vast majority of circumcised women are
        poor rural dwellers. The harshness of the practice of
        female circumcision echoes the harshness of their
        existence. The day begins before dawn, food is prepared for
        the family and the remainder of the day is spent supplying
        basics for survival, gathering wood and water. Lives are
        dictated by things people have no control over, such as the
        weather, good or bad harvests, and disease.</p>

        <p class="text1">A woman must fit into this society or die.
        If she is not circumcised, she will not marry. If she does
        not marry, she will not have children. Without children,
        she will have fewer hands to help out with the daily tasks
        or to look after her when she grows old. . . . We may not
        like it, but in these societies a good marriage is
        understood as the pinnacle of a woman's achievement. You
        could say that the children are circumcised because their
        parents love them and want them to be happy in their adult
        lives.<sup><a href="#n252">252</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Group identity and communal cohesiveness are
      other motivations for FGA. Gruenbaum shows how, among
      different ethnic groups in the Sudan, different types of
      female alteration serve as group demarcations (and also as
      ideological markers of superior morality and hygiene that
      support the dominance of some groups over others).<sup><a
      href="#n253">253</a></sup> As we saw in the recent history of
      the struggle over FGA in Egypt, the practice can easily
      become identified with nationalism, ethnic pride, and
      resistance to the dominance of Western (colonial) culture. As
      new national boundaries threaten to disrupt historical tribal
      dominance in particular geographic areas, a process
      accelerated by urbanization, FGA can be seen as an important
      custom that helps to maintain distinct village and tribal
      identities.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <i>irua</i> ceremony in which FGA is
      performed among the Kikuyu, for example, fulfills a number of
      functions, including acceptance of adult obligations by the
      initiates, enforcing behavioral norms of the social group,
      and unification of the tribe and enhanced tribal
      identity.<sup><a href="#n254">254</a></sup> War and
      dislocation can stimulate people to protect and display their
      cultural identity by intensified practice of FGA. In 1997,
      women in displaced persons camps in Sierra Leone celebrated
      the end of war and their imminent return to their homes by
      holding a series of FGA rituals:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">To celebrate this change of fortune, many
        felt, it was only proper that there should be a major
        ceremony marking what they hope will be a resumption of
        their normal lives. So, since Christmas, as many as 600
        women from the camp have hiked off in groups of a dozen or
        more at a time to a clearing in the bush nearby.</p>

        <p class="text1">There, the group members, ranging in age
        from 4-year-old girls to adult women, have stayed for a
        week or two at a time, dancing, feasting and sharing
        lessons about womenhood as part of an ancestral communal
        ritual known as Bondo, which culminates in having their
        external genitals cut off....</p>

        <p class="text1">One champion of the practice estimates
        that in the space of less than a month 4,000 or more
        displaced women may have had their genitals cut by women
        known as Soweis, all in preparation for the return to their
        rural homes. Sierra Leoneans say such numbers would make
        the displaced women's festivities the largest event of its
        kind ever seen in the country....</p>

        <p class="text1">"I decided to go to the bush and have this
        done now because I am a mature woman now," said Bateh
        Kindoh, a shy 16-year-old who sat with two other recent
        initiates to speak with a visitor. "We will go back to our
        villages soon, and I wanted to become part of the Bondo
        society first. This is a happy time for us."<sup><a
        href="#n255">255</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Anne Gibeau writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Although FGM is widely perceived to be a
        vehicle for the subjugation of women, the ceremony that
        accompanies the practice may serve as an important rite of
        passage for women, making it highly desirable to them. In
        the cultures in which FGM is performed, it may be a
        strictly ritualized, woman-centered experience that occurs
        at special times and places, such as around the time of
        harvest. The participants may be sequestered and given
        special foods and clothes. A communal meal for women might
        be served, during which an oral history of domestic life,
        the expected role of the adult woman, and information about
        women's secret societies are shared. These communal aspects
        of FGM ... and the ceremonies associated with it give women
        access to rituals and customs that they prize.<sup><a

      <p class="a">B. The Meanings of MGA</p>

      <p class="a">1. Religious Aspects</p>

      <p class="text2">In contrast to FGA, it is unnecessary to
      marshall proof that MGA, at least among Jews, is a religious
      practice. Therefore, I will begin this section with a
      description of the place of MGA within Judaism. After that, I
      will seek to problematize this depiction by showing how, for
      many Jews, the practice could better be described as
      cultural, especially if we applied to MGA the same standards
      currently applied to FGA.<sup><a
      href="#n257">257</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">As mentioned above, the origins of MGA
      predate any religion now in existence. It is certain that the
      ancient Egyptians practiced it, and the circumcision of two
      young nobles is depicted on a stele dating from 2400
      B.C.E.<sup><a href="#n258">258</a></sup> There are many
      theories about how, when and why the practice made its way
      from Egyptian culture to the Israelites. One theory is that
      the Israelites learned it when they were slaves in Europe. In
      <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>, Sigmund Freud asserts that Moses
      introduced the custom of circumcision to the Jews. Norman
      Mirsky comments, "Why did he do this? Because the Egyptian
      males were circumcised and the Egyptians regarded
      <i>themselves</i> as a chosen people! Moses wanted the Jews
      to have the same self-esteem, to have the same sense of
      divine destiny as their former masters, to lose their slave
      mentality..."<sup><a href="#n259">259</a></sup> Whatever the
      reasons, the Israelites became the first people to genitally
      alter infants.<sup><a href="#n260">260</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">According to the Hebrew Bible, Abraham was
      the first Israelite to be circumcised; he performed the
      operation on himself, in response to God's command, at age
      99. He then circumcised his son Ishmael and all the males of
      his household. The Biblical injunction reads: "Every male
      among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall be circumcised
      in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token of a
      covenant betwixt Me and you. And he that is eight days old
      shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout the
      generations." (Genesis 17:11-12) When Isaac, Abraham's second
      son, was born the following year, he was circumcised on the
      eighth day. Eilberg-Schwartz points out that the circumcision
      of Abraham and his descendents solved a double problem: that
      of creating and maintaining the genealogy of Abraham. As the
      progenitor of "a new lineage," Abraham had to be marked off
      in some special way, and he also had to be connected to all
      his descendents. Circumcision answered both needs.<sup><a
      href="#n261">261</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Like all important religious rituals this
      one has many layers, even in its Biblical depictions. For
      Ishmael (Abraham's son by his servant Hagar) genital
      alteration has to do with fertility, but not with the
      covenant between God and his chosen people. When Isaac
      (Abraham's son by his wife Sarah) is circumcised, fertility
      becomes a means to fulfilling the covenant and God's promise
      to give Abraham an infinitude of descendents; the covenantal
      theme is dominant, as it is for Jews today.<sup><a
      href="#n262">262</a></sup> Joel Roth explains:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Parents bringing their son into the
        covenant inevitably feel the weight of history on their
        shoulders. They know that circumcision has been the sign of
        the covenant&mdash;a mark of Jewish
        uniqueness&mdash;throughout our history. Tyrants from many
        times and places have attempted to stamp out Jewish
        observance of his ritual. The Talmud speaks of the
        suffering Jews endured to observe the <i>mitzvah</i>
        (obligation) of circumcision . . . the continued observance
        of . . . circumcision was one of the four things that
        guaranteed our redemption from slavery in Egypt.<sup><a
        href="#n263">263</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Jewish writers emphasize that the religious
      obligation is not fulfilled simply by performing the genital
      surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">If the event is merely an operation, the
      religious dimension of the ceremony is lost. The blessings,
      the correct procedure, the appropriate mindset and the
      legally mandated day of performance change a purely physical
      operation into a religious ceremony. The mere removal of the
      foreskin is not the link between the generations, but the
      ceremony of <i>brit milah</i> is.<sup><a
      href="#n264">264</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In fact, a Jewish male is not considered
      properly circumcised if the operation was originally
      performed in a secular manner; a ritual drawing of a drop of
      blood will have to be performed later for the circumcision to
      be considered covenantal.<sup><a
      href="#n265">265</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A ritual MGA, or berit milah (sometimes
      called a bris), has two components: the cutting and the
      naming of the baby. The cutting is performed by a mohel, who
      is not necessarily a rabbi and who may or may not be a
      physician.<sup><a href="#n266">266</a></sup> Even among
      traditional Jews, there are variations in how the ceremony is
      performed. What follows is a description of the core ritual,
      to which most Jews having a ritual circumcision would
      adhere.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <i>berit milah</i> is a social occasion;
      friends and relatives of the family are invited and food is
      prepared. On the eighth day of the baby's life,<sup><a
      href="#n267">267</a></sup> the <i>mohel</i> comes to the
      home. The ceremony begins with the lighting of a candle by a
      friend or family member. One or two people (usually not the
      mother, who traditionally remains in another room) then bring
      the baby to the "throne of Elijah," a special chair set aside
      for the <i>sandek</i>, a male (often the baby's grandfather)
      who will hold the baby during the cutting. Elijah, the Angel
      of the Covenant, is thought to attend every bris to ensure
      the child's well-being and to serve as God's witness that the
      Jewish people are faithfully fulfilling this
      obligation.<sup><a href="#n268">268</a></sup> Another
      explanation is that, as Jews believe that the Messiah is not
      yet come, Elijah, whose job it is to announce the Messiah's
      coming, attends every <i>bris</i> to make sure that he
      doesn't miss the event.<sup><a href="#n269">269</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The baby is restrained, and often given a
      cloth soaked in wine on which to suck.<sup><a
      href="#n270">270</a></sup> <i>Mohels</i> differ in their
      preferred technique, but a common way is to use a "mogen
      clamp," a sort of shield with a slit through which the
      foreskin is pulled. The shield protects the penis and scrotum
      while the foreskin is excised. The penis (which was bathed
      with an antiseptic solution before the procedure) is now
      bandaged; the baby is re-diapered and swaddled, and
      immediately allowed to nurse. Following the ritual cutting,
      the baby is given his Jewish name. Then the <i>mohel</i> or
      rabbi, if one is present, recites a blessing for the speedy
      recovery of the baby and the continuing recovery from
      childbirth of his mother. This is followed by a festive meal.
      Following the ceremony, the foreskin may be buried in the
      earth. In one custom, it is buried beneath a tree whose
      branches are later harvested to make the canopy for the
      child's wedding.<sup><a href="#n271">271</a></sup> According
      to one mohel, the penis is "essentially healed" after a
      week.<sup><a href="#n272">272</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One rather controversial element of the
      traditional <i>bris</i> is the performance of <i>mezizah</i>
      ("suction") immediately after the cutting. Originally the
      mohel performed this orally, by sucking at the wound,
      alternately sucking out blood and turning to take mouthfuls
      of wine which he then spat on the wound. This was meant to be
      hygienic and antiseptic.<sup><a href="#n273">273</a></sup> A
      <i>mohel</i> who omitted this step was considered to be
      endangering the life of the child and was barred from
      practice.<sup><a href="#n274">274</a></sup> However, by the
      end of the 19th century the custom had died out in many
      communities, as it was feared that some babies had contracted
      disease from a <i>mohel</i> who had syphilis or
      tuberculosis.<sup><a href="#n275">275</a></sup> Some
      communities dispensed with <i>mezizah</i> altogether, while
      others mandated that it be performed through a glass
      tube.<sup><a href="#n276">276</a></sup> In our current age of
      AIDS, with the risk of HIV transmission both to and from baby
      and mohel, <i>mezizah</i> has again been a subject for
      dispute. Orthodox Rabbi Moshe Tendler, a biologist and
      ethicist at New York's Yeshiva University, says that a mohel
      who practices (unmediated) mezizah now is "foolhardy." His
      colleague Rabbi David Bleich disagrees, saying the procedure
      is safe if the mohel first rinses his mouth with rum, wears
      gloves during the ritual cutting, and demands that mothers
      produce evidence of a negative HIV test before he agrees to
      perform the procedure.<sup><a href="#n277">277</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">2. The Meanings of MGA</p>

      <p class="text2">As we saw above, for most American parents
      the decision to alter their baby boys has nothing to do with
      religion. But even for American Jews the practice has many
      meanings, only some of them religious.</p>

      <p class="text2">A common argument against FGA is that its
      purpose is to deprive women of their right to sexual
      enjoyment. It turns out that an anti-erotic agenda has also
      played a role in MGA. In the secular arena, genital
      alteration has often been recommended as a "cure" or
      preventive measure against masturbation. In 19th century
      America, the crusade against masturbation was very like our
      current "war against drugs."<sup><a
      href="#n278">278</a></sup> One stimulus was the discomfort
      that an increasingly puritan population felt at any evidence
      of young children's sexuality. For another, based on the
      observation that inmates of asylums tended to masturbate,
      physicians jumped to the conclusion that the practice caused
      lunacy (not to mention tuberculosis, epilepsy, and other
      diseases that had physicians stumped). A popular baby book of
      1896 advised mothers to have their sons genitally altered to
      prevent "the vile habit" of masturbation. Interestingly,
      leading Jewish physicians, perhaps discerning an opportunity
      to present their distinct religious practice as being in the
      forefront of the fight for healthy American virtues, claimed
      that masturbation and bedwetting were relatively rare among
      Jews, and attributed this good fortune to the practice of
      circumcision. M.J. Moses, head of the New York State Medical
      Society and President of the Association of American
      Physicians, wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">I refer to masturbation as one of the
        effects of a long prepuce; not that this vice is entirely
        absent in those who have undergone circumcision, though I
        never saw an instance in a Jewish child of very tender
        years, except as the result of association with children
        whose covered glans have naturally impelled them to the
        habit.<sup><a href="#n279">279</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Some physicians advocated that genital
      alteration be deliberately accomplished in a painful manner.
      John Harvey Kellogg, the physician best known for "his
      obsession with dietary fiber and bowel disorders," advised
      performing circumcision on small boys without anesthetic, "as
      the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect
      upon the mind, especially if connected with the idea of
      punishment."<sup><a href="#n280">280</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Judaism as well, there has historically
      been an anti-erotic element in explanations for MGA. Judaism
      is usually thought of as an anti-ascetic religion that
      encourages robust enjoyment, within limits, of food, marital
      sex and other this-worldly pleasures. Like many stereotypes,
      this is largely correct but is also too simple.
      Eilberg-Schwartz writes that post-biblical rabbinic
      attitudes<sup><a href="#n281">281</a></sup> toward sexuality
      are best described as "ambivalent," and "more radically
      negative than has generally been supposed." Even within
      marriage, sex is seen as a problem rather than an unalloyed
      good. Eilberg-Schwartz enlists the work of Steven Fraade to
      argue that there is a "persistent ascetic strain" in rabbinic
      Judaism, and that temporary sexual abstinence was "a
      significant element in the tradition."<sup><a
      href="#n282">282</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The first century Jewish philosopher Philo
      explained circumcision by claiming that it "represents the
      excision of the pleasure of sex, which bewitches the
      mind."<sup><a href="#n283">283</a></sup> Moses Maimonides,
      the revered twelfth century physician, rabbi and scholar,
      wrote that the point of circumcision was "to weaken the organ
      of generation as far as possible, and thus cause man to be
      moderate . . . . Circumcision weakens the power of sexual
      excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural
      enjoyment."<sup><a href="#n284">284</a></sup> As we saw
      above, women were often supposed to prefer uncircumcised men
      and to importune them for sex. In contrast, circumcised men
      and their partners were believed to enjoy sex less and spend
      less time engaged in it. This had the benefit of freeing the
      men's minds and energies for the study of Torah. As Isaac ben
      Yediah, a French follower of Maimonides, explained, the
      husband "will not empty his brain because of his wife (and)
      his heart will be strong to seek out God."<sup><a
      href="#n285">285</a></sup> Maimonides also emphasized that
      experiencing the pain of circumcision was important to put
      sex into its proper place, to diminish "the violent ...lust
      that goes beyond what is needed."<sup><a
      href="#n286">286</a></sup> The conservative Jewish magazine
      <i>Commentary</i>, in a 2000 article entitled "The New
      Enemies of Circumcision," reflects some of this anti-erotic
      flavor when it comments</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">(Rabbinic) theology . . . in general sees
        human beings as born with a powerful appetite for evil, one
        that must be restrained, retrained, and redirected by a
        challenging and unending process of subordination to God's
        covenantal will. It is therefore, by definition,
        diametrically opposed to the Romantic affirmation of
        natural man and his raw instincts, and to that liberal
        psychology in which personal choice is sacrosanct,
        "experience" is the goal, and the traditional virtues of
        sacrifice, disciplines, and obedience are slighted or
        rejected.<sup><a href="#n287">287</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Another factor in MGA, both in ancient times
      and today, is the promotion of group cohesion and Jewish
      survival. The same article in <i>Commentary</i> notes that
      even for the many Jews who no longer follow other religious
      practices, some form of ritual circumcision endures.<sup><a
      href="#n288">288</a></sup> (In fact, the <i>Commentary</i>
      author may be less than accurate here; what endures among
      many American Jews is simply the surgical operation, not the
      ceremonial <i>bris</i>.<sup><a href="#n289">289</a></sup>)
      Goldman thinks that a high percentage of Jews genitally alter
      their sons not for religious reasons, but in response to
      societal, familial and community pressures.<sup><a
      href="#n290">290</a></sup> Although these may not be the most
      ideal reasons, they still bespeak the way in which the ritual
      remains an important element of the communal "glue" that
      holds Jewish culture together, especially in tolerant
      America, where assimilation is feared more than
      anti-Semitism. Pollack speaks of the way in which
      circumcision, originally an issue of tribal survival, became
      "laminated to our Jewish identities," so that now, to argue
      against it is seen as anti-Semitic and an assault on Jewish
      identity. Pollack continues, "challenging circumcision can be
      an attack on Jewish identity only if Jewish women don't
      count, for Jewish women have survived and kept their
      identities intact for millennia without any need of altering
      their bodies."<sup><a href="#n291">291</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some Jewish leaders see the birth of a
      Jewish male as an opportunity to persuade the Jewish couple
      to intensify their ties to the Jewish community. At present,
      only one-third of American Jewish households are affiliated
      with a synagogue, a trend that is considered "alarming." One
      Reform Jewish commentator begins with the statement that the
      decision to have a <i>berit milah</i> is "a decision with
      regard to Jewish identity," and then lays out a number of
      strategies in which the ceremony can be the hook that brings
      the young couple into the community.<sup><a
      href="#n292">292</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">For many unaffiliated or secular Jews, the
      decision to genitally alter their newborn sons (whether
      through berit milah or th</p>

      <p class="text2">rough the surgical operation alone) is done
      with so little thought about the religious aspects of the
      practice that it would seem rather a stretch to label their
      motivations as substantially religious. A common story is one
      told by this woman, who later converted to Judaism and became
      a <i>mohel</i>:</p>

      <p class="text2">I have two daughters so I never had to
      confront the issue of Berit Mila. But I do recall asking my
      husband, Phil, when I was pregnant, if he would want the
      child to be circumcised if it were a boy. His reply was an
      emphatic "of course!" Had I had a boy, and he had requested a
      Berit Mila ceremony, I am sure I would have replied with an
      equally emphatic "of course!" If one of you had then asked me
      if we were going to raise the child as a Jew, I would not
      really have known how to answer. Phil and I both had a lot of
      disenchantment with organized religion, but I don't believe
      we ever really had a discussion about the religious
      upbringing of our children.<sup><a
      href="#n293">293</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A common reason given by Jews and non-Jews
      alike as to why they want their sons altered is so that they
      will look like their fathers.<sup><a
      href="#n294">294</a></sup> In fact, among all but the most
      traditional Jews, it is fair to say that their reasons for
      performing MGA are made up of religious elements, medical
      beliefs, familial and communal motivations, all mixed in with
      the prevailing acceptance of newborn MGA in the American
      culture. As long as the surrounding culture and the medical
      establishment accepted routine MGA without controversy, there
      was little reason for Jewish parents to question their
      decision to have their newborn sons altered. (At most, they
      might feel some conflict over using a physician in a secular
      operation, a traditional mohel in a traditional ceremony, or
      a physician-mohel.) Now, however, controversy within the
      Jewish community is on the rise.</p>

      <p class="text2">An earlier debate about ritual circumcision
      occurred in 19th century Europe, among liberal Jews. In
      Frankfurt, in 1843, a society of Jewish laymen issued a
      manifesto that attacked the authority of the Talmud and a
      number of traditional practices, including <i>berit
      milah</i>. Although the rabbis angrily responded, some of
      them were actually less than enthusiastic about the practice
      themselves. The great Reform Jewish scholar Abraham Geiger
      said, "(i)t remains a barbarous bloody act . . . Its only
      supports are habit and fear."<sup><a
      href="#n295">295</a></sup> Rabbi Samuel Holdheim called it
      "the expression of an outlived idea."<sup><a
      href="#n296">296</a></sup> The topic was the subject of
      intense debate for some years, but eventually the rabbis
      reaffirmed the importance of the practice and the reformers
      gave up.<sup><a href="#n297">297</a></sup> A similar
      controversy arose in the United States in 1885, at a
      rabbinical conference to set forth principles of Reform
      Judaism, with a similar result.<sup><a
      href="#n298">298</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">3. Current Controversies Over Ritual MGA</p>

      <p class="text2">Controversy within the Jewish community
      today appears to fall into two categories: the perceived
      sexism of the practice and the pain and possible harm to the
      child. Secular, Reform, and Conservative Jews, who practice
      different levels of religious observance, may question why
      they adhere to this practice when they have dropped so many
      others.</p>

      <p class="text2">a) Harm and Pain to the Child</p>

      <p class="text2">Because most newborn genital alteration is
      done without adequate pain control, parents (many of whom
      have probably been guests at previous ritual circumcisions)
      react against the idea of voluntarily subjecting their child
      to a painful experience in his first days of life. One Jewish
      mother, married to a Jewish man, both members of a
      Conservative synagogue, explained why she declined to have
      her son circumcised: "My friends who are critical are the
      same ones who eat ham-and-cheese sandwiches. Our decision
      came out of Jewish ethics, out of the concern for someone's
      well-being, namely our son."<sup><a
      href="#n299">299</a></sup> Another mother writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Consider...what happens before a
        circumcision can even be performed: the infant penis is
        usually rubbed with an antiseptic. Trustingly his little
        body responds to his first overtly sexual experience. Next,
        the most sensitive part of his fully receptive body is cut,
        crushed and ripped or scraped away from the head of his
        penis.<sup><a href="#n300">300</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Lisa Braver Moss, who contends that an
      "honest reappraisal" of <i>berit milah</i> will help modern
      Judaism to "flourish," writes about the lack of systematic
      data on death or complications from traditional MGAs
      performed by <i>mohels</i>, and argues that, even if death
      and complications are as rare as <i>mohels</i> contend,
      Jewish values require that even the most rare possibility be
      taken with tremendous seriousness. In Jewish law, the rule is
      that danger to life takes precedence over all other
      considerations and therefore that hazardous medical
      procedures are strictly forbidden.<sup><a
      href="#n301">301</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Other writers are especially disturbed by
      the vulnerability of the newborn infant. Maimonides explained
      that one reason why ritual circumcision is performed on
      newborns is that parents have not yet fully bonded to them,
      and can therefore subject them to a procedure they would be
      unable to perpetrate on older children.<sup><a
      href="#n302">302</a></sup> Herbert Goldstein comments that
      this goes against the important Jewish commandment to "love
      the stranger." The reason for that precept is to guard
      against the common situation where a people who have been
      oppressed turn the tables on others once they have acquired
      the power to do so. Goldstein asks, "(i)f we might be unable
      to subject an older child to Brit Milah, is it Jewishly
      ethical to subject our infants to it?"<sup><a
      href="#n303">303</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">b) Sexism</p>

      <p class="text2">Miriam Pollack contends that "(c)ircumcision
      is at the heart of gender imbalance in Judaism."<sup><a
      href="#n304">304</a></sup> There are a number of ways in
      which the traditional Jewish practice of MGA is seen as
      sexist. The most obvious argument is that <i>berit mila</i>
      is a "sign" of the covenant with God, "a critical mark of
      identity,"<sup><a href="#n305">305</a></sup> a rite of
      passage, which is available only to boys. Among many Jews
      there is even the misconception that <i>berit mila</i> is the
      gateway through which Jews enter the covenant, so that
      somehow females are seen as "less Jewish" than males.<sup><a
      href="#n306">306</a></sup> The lack of similar ceremonies for
      girls or women "suggests that women only have access to the
      covenant through men; they are not covenantal Jews in their
      own right."<sup><a href="#n307">307</a></sup>
      Eilberg-Schwartz notes that because only men can "commemorate
      the promise of God to Abraham," circumcision "concretizes a
      latent association in the Hebrew language between masculinity
      and commemoration." Eilberg-Schwartz pursues the connection
      between the symbolism of circumcision and the symbolism of
      blood. He sees circumcision as a post-partum ritual which
      highlights the separation of a male child from his mother.
      The mother's blood&mdash;female and impure&mdash;is
      contrasted with the newborn's male blood, "clean, unifying
      and symbolic of God's covenant." "Although circumcision is
      not a rite of passage into manhood, it is a rite that marks
      the passage from the impurity of being born of women to the
      purity of life in a community of men."<sup><a
      href="#n308">308</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Traditional Jewish circumcision, as
      described above, is an important occasion which brings
      together the baby's extended family and members of the
      community in a joyous celebration of a boy's birth. Although
      there has been much activity lately in creating parallel
      ceremonies for the birth of a girl (<i>berit banot</i>), they
      are rarely given equal importance. Family who will travel
      long distances for a boy's <i>berit mila</i> but are less
      likely to invest resources in a ceremony for a newborn
      girl.<sup><a href="#n309">309</a></sup> The inevitable result
      is that the birth of a boy is "a much bigger deal," and girls
      may seem less valuable, their births more mundane.<sup><a
      href="#n310">310</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Pollack offers a fascinating discussion
      about the sexism inherent in <i>berit mila</i>, focusing on
      the way in which the new mother is toppled from her rightful
      role as protector and nurturer of the baby, and her
      biological instincts and "motherwisdom" ignored.<sup><a
      href="#n311">311</a></sup> Pollack's most powerful passages
      concern the role of the <i>akedah</i>, the "sacrifice of
      Isaac," which occurs in Genesis 22-23. Abraham is called by
      God to sacrifice Isaac, his "only" son, as a "burnt
      offering." Abraham takes the boy to the mountain God
      designates, along with wood, fire, and a knife. He builds an
      altar and lays the boy on it, bound and tied, on top of the
      wood. Just as Abraham picks up the knife to kill his son,
      God's voice is heard directing Abraham to "stay his hand."
      This has been a test, and now that God knows that Abraham
      "fears" him, God provides a ram as a substitute sacrifice for
      Isaac.</p>

      <p class="text2">The narrative is usually interpreted as a
      story about the testing of Abraham's faith. But Pollack
      points out a different perspective. Sarah, she says, Isaac's
      mother, is the one "who is destroyed, body and soul." Sarah,
      who is ignored throughout the entire episode, is mentioned
      again in the beginning of the next chapter only so that the
      reader can learn of her death. (Actually, it is Sarah for
      whom Isaac is an only child; Abraham has another son,
      Ishmael, with Hagar.) Pollack writes that Sarah's motherhood
      is "denied by God and ignored by Abraham, as he prepares to
      take her only child to sacrifice for this higher
      cause."<sup><a href="#n312">312</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Sarah's authority as a mother and her
      position as the grand matriarch of her people is completely
      undermined by this God's demand and Abraham's compliance. She
      is utterly disempowered by this cataclysmic event. In this
      context her death makes sense. It is the defeat of the
      matriarch, the subordination of the mother that had to
      precede the new covenant. Abraham passed the test. He not
      only was willing to obey his God's command to attempt to
      sacrifice his most beloved son, but he also succeeded in
      subverting the mother's authority over her child. He is now
      worthy to become the primary progenitor of a new nation. . .
      . (T)his story . . . is not only about faith. It is also, and
      most profoundly, about the shift of power and authority from
      women to men, about male domination which is always
      undergirded by the threat or implied threat of violence. The
      akedah is the definitive narrative of this paradigm
      shift.<sup><a href="#n313">313</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">4. Alternative Rituals</p>

      <p class="text2">As a parallel to discussion of alternative
      rituals to FGA above, it is worth taking a quick look at
      alternatives to MGA in the Jewish context. First, as noted
      above, it is now quite common to perform some sort of "naming
      ceremony" for newborn girls; this ritual seeks to elevate the
      birth of a girl to the same importance that the <i>berit
      mila</i> celebration gives to the birth of a boy.<sup><a
      href="#n314">314</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">With regard to the boys' ritual, a small
      number of Jews who are actively religious but who refuse to
      have their newborns altered have come up with some version of
      an alternative that celebrates the birth while omitting the
      procedure. In some versions, something other than the child's
      body is cut, to symbolize the traditional
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n315">315</a></sup> This
      alternative service, sometimes called a "Bris Shalom," has
      the advantage of being appropriate for both boy and girls
      babies, thus redressing a gender inequity that could
      otherwise only be addressed by cutting some part of the
      girl's body, "an idea that is repugnant and rejected by
      virtually all Jews."<sup><a href="#n316">316</a></sup> A few
      rabbis will preside over a naming ceremony for a boy that
      proceeds without genital cutting, and will later allow that
      boy to have a <i>bar mitzva</i> ceremony.<sup><a
      href="#n317">317</a></sup> Another alternative ceremony that
      works for both girls and boys is <i>brit rekhitza</i> or
      "covenant of washing," which harks back to Abraham's washing
      the feet of strangers. "This ceremony is a lovely way to
      welcome a baby boy into the covenant while acknowledging that
      as a 'stranger' he is entitled to gentle treatment."<sup><a
      href="#n318">318</a></sup></p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text2">Although it will be interesting to see
      whether these alternative ceremonies grow in years to come,
      it is certainly true that, for the foreseeable future, MGA
      will be practiced by most American Jews, whether or not they
      are in the minority who practice a ritually correct version
      of the rite, or settle for a surgical operation outside of a
      ritual context. For those who are concerned about the pain
      and trauma to male infants, therefore, it appears that the
      best strategy is to concentrate on advocating for adequate
      pain control.</p>

      <p class="a">C. Summary</p>

      <p class="text2">Before proceeding to the legal discussion in
      Part V it will be helpful to pause and make some comparisons
      between MGA and FGA. Because the focus of this article is on
      United States laws, I will compare the (illegal) practice of
      FGA on minors in the U.S., with MGA in the U.S.</p>

      <p class="text2">FGA does not bring any health benefits. In
      the third world countries where most FGA takes place, it is
      associated with horrendous risk of death and serious
      complications, even into maturity. It is usually performed
      without pain control, and young girls are often emotionally
      traumatized. When FGA is performed in the West, its illicit
      and "back room" nature makes it reasonable to assume that the
      risks remain very high. With the exception of the small nick
      proposed in Seattle, all forms of FGA remove substantial
      parts of a woman's sexual organs. The effect on the subjects'
      sexuality, while not adequately studied, is clearly negative.
      The procedure can be understood as gender subjugation, as a
      rite of passage to maturity and membership in the group, or
      as a sign of female independence and self-respect, as some
      practitioners and supporters insist. The reasons why parents
      subject their daughters to FGA include a mix of religion,
      custom, group cohesion, concern for cultural survival, family
      pressure, a misunderstanding of medical benefits, and
      economic concerns.</p>

      <p class="text2">MGA's health benefits are controversial and
      attenuated. No major medical group currently supports the
      practice of MGA. Despite clear calls for pain control from,
      e.g., the AAP, fewer than half of baby boys receive adequate
      analgesia. The risks of death and serious complications
      appear quite small, although better data is needed. Although
      MGA removes less tissue than most forms of FGA, some
      scientists argue that the foreskin is a substantial factor in
      sexual feeling and behavior. MGA removes significantly more
      tissue than the "nick" proposed in Seattle. The effect on the
      subjects' sexuality has not been adequately studied, but
      there is some evidence to suggest that it is negative. For
      Americans who are neither Jews nor Muslims, the procedure is
      purely a matter of aesthetics and custom, or some generally
      misunderstood view of the supposed health benefits. For
      religious Jews it is an obligation of the highest order, but
      the majority of American Jews do not have their sons' genital
      alteration performed in a ritually correct manner. The
      procedure can be understood as deeply sexist, as a
      celebration of group identity and cultural survival, as
      anti-erotic, and as a rite of passage. The reasons why
      parents subject their sons to MGA include religion, custom,
      group cohesion, family pressure, a misunderstanding of
      medical benefits, and economic motivations from those who
      perform circumcisions.<sup><a href="#n319">319</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Our revulsion toward cutting the genitals of
      girls should give us pause . . . for the themes the Western
      world abhors&mdash;removing part of the genitals to reduce
      sexual pleasure, carving children's bodies to conform to
      certain social ideals, visiting pain on helpless
      children&mdash;are all fully present in the history of male
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n320">320</a></sup></p>

      <p class="a">V. F<span class="sc2">IRST</span> A<span
      class="sc2">MENDMENT</span> I<span
      class="sc2">SSUES</span></p>

      <p class="text2">At the present time, MGA is no longer
      considered routine, has no strong medical benefit, and is a
      decision made by parents largely on religious and cultural
      grounds. MGA is legal in this country, with no oversight,
      whether it is practiced by physicians or by traditional
      <i>mohels</i>. FGA, on the other hand, a decision also made
      by parents on religious and cultural grounds, is illegal even
      if its actual expression is a ritual nick of less physical
      import and carrying less risk than the traditional male
      procedure. What this boils down to is, if you are an American
      Jew, you can have your baby boy genitally altered with
      impunity, even if it is done outside a hospital by an
      unlicensed ritual practitioner, and without the analgesia
      deemed "essential" by the AAP. But if you are recent
      immigrant from Somalia, even if you would take the
      enlightened route and subject your daughter to a ritual nick
      at the Seattle clinic, you (and the doctor) would be subject
      to criminal prosecution. This is unacceptable on First
      Amendment grounds.</p>

      <p class="text2">The "religion clauses" of the First
      Amendment of the U.S. Constitution read: <i>Congress shall
      make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
      prohibiting the free exercise thereof</i>. It is primarily
      the "free exercise" clause that relates to the issue before
      us.</p>

      <p class="text2">Criminalizing FGA clearly limits the ability
      of some parents to put their religious beliefs into practice.
      Of course, that is not necessarily a winning argument. There
      are many religious practices that are appropriately made
      illegal, because they present some danger to a state
      interest. We do not countenance human sacrifice, even for
      religious reasons, nor do we allow parents to refuse
      lifesaving therapies for their children on religious
      grounds.<sup><a href="#n321">321</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Until 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court employed
      a "balancing" test when a state interest conflicted with a
      religious practice. The Court inquired whether the law that
      burdened the free exercise of religion was necessary to meet
      some compelling state interest.<sup><a
      href="#n322">322</a></sup> If the law could not meet that
      test, it was struck down. However, in 1990, in a case
      involving a Native American who lost his job due to ritual
      use of peyote, the Court took a much less generous view of
      the Free Exercise Clause. After <i>Employment Division v.
      Smith</i>, the government no longer has to prove that its law
      is narrowly tailored to meet some compelling state interest.
      It need only show that the law is "neutral" and "generally
      applicable."<sup><a href="#n323">323</a></sup> In other
      words, as long as the law was not written in order to target
      a specific religious practice,<sup><a
      href="#n324">324</a></sup> It does not matter if it happens
      to burden that practice, even if the state's interest is not
      compelling, and even if the law could have been written in a
      less onerous way. In <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v.
      City of Hialeah</i>, the law forbidding ritual sacrifice of
      animals was struck down because it criminalized only animal
      sacrifice associated with the Santeria religion; kosher
      (Jewish) butchering and non-religious killing of animals for
      food or sport were not criminalized. Therefore the law
      violated "the principle of general applicability."<sup><a
      href="#n325">325</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the case of FGA, the law forbidding any
      non-medical surgery on the genitals of a female minor is
      constitutionally flawed because it does not forbid parallel
      non-medical surgery on the genitals of a male minor. Other
      writers have focused on the equal protection problem here, as
      the law appears to protect little girls but not little
      boys.<sup><a href="#n326">326</a></sup> In this article, I
      focus on the "free exercise" problem. It is obvious that the
      writers of the federal and state laws criminalizing FGA had
      religion very much in mind, as they made clear that "any
      belief that the operation is required as a matter of custom,
      ritual, or standard of practice may not be taken into
      consideration."<sup><a href="#n327">327</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In this case, we may imagine male and female
      genital alterations as two circles with some degree of
      overlap. Although there are many important differences
      between the two practices, there is clearly an area where the
      risks of harm to the child are substantially the same.
      Indeed, if we compare the Seattle proposal to the unregulated
      practice of traditional <i>berit mila</i>, it appears that
      the latter involves more skin removed, with less likelihood
      of adequate pain control and no systematic reporting system
      for complications. The Seattle proposal was "less injurious
      to the health, welfare and safety of girls than male
      circumcision is to the health, welfare and safety of
      boys."<sup><a href="#n328">328</a></sup> The primary
      difference between the operation proposed in Seattle (as well
      as some extremely minor forms of FGA already in practice) and
      the one performed daily on newborn males in America, is that
      the first is associated with "bizarre" practices brought to
      America by strange people practicing strange customs, while
      the other is a Western practice with which we are comfortable
      and familiar. (To be fair, another important difference is
      that the circle comprising all of FGA includes much more
      horrible practices, both quantitatively and qualitatively. I
      will address that issue below.)</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">If then, we "match up"
      a deeply religious Muslim couple who wish to have their
      daughter altered and who believe it is a religious
      obligation, and who are willing to accept the Seattle
      compromise, with a deeply religious Jewish couple who wish to
      have their son altered because they believe it is a religious
      obligation, it is hard to justify why the first couple's wish
      is illegal and the second's is not.</span> If we imagine that
      the Muslim girl's experience will be a tiny nick with proper
      pain control in a hospital context, while the Jewish boy's
      experience will be a somewhat larger operation by a
      nonmedical practitioner without adequate pain control, the
      justification becomes even more difficult. We could also
      imagine a second set of "matched" couples. In this case, we
      could have a Jewish couple who are planning a surgical
      operation, without the attendant ritual, by a physician who
      is not a <i>mohel</i>. Nonetheless, if questioned about their
      decision they insist that it is part of being Jewish, and
      that leaving their boy unaltered is unthinkable; they don't
      know if they will ever join a synagogue, educate the boy
      religiously, or have him <i>bar mitvah</i>, but they do know
      that leaving him uncut will make him look odd to his Jewish
      friends, may have a negative effect on his ability to marry a
      Jewish girl, and will bring down the wrath of their parents.
      Match that couple with a couple from sub-Saharan Africa who
      are vague about their religious beliefs but have a general
      feeling that to leave their little daughter uncut is somehow
      non-Islamic; further, they have good reason to fear that
      their daughter, if left uncircumcised, will be laughed at,
      perhaps ostracized, and have a very difficult time marrying
      within their culture. Again, what is the justification for
      respecting the first couple's mix of beliefs and custom, but
      not the second?</p>

      <p class="text2">In <i>Lukumi Babulu Aye</i>, the Court said
      that "(a) law burdening religious practice that is not
      neutral or not of general application must undergo the most
      rigorous of scrutiny." To survive that scrutiny, the law must
      be "narrowly tailored" in pursuit of state interests "of the
      highest order."<sup><a href="#n329">329</a></sup> What state
      interests can be identified which meet that criterion?</p>

      <p class="text2">The best argument in defense of the
      constitutionality of laws criminalizing FGA is that allowing
      even the benign Seattle compromise will handicap health and
      government workers in stamping out the more horrible forms of
      this practice. Because FGA in its most common forms around
      the world is mutilating and life-threatening, it is
      reasonable to adopt a "zero tolerance policy" to make it
      absolutely clear to immigrants that this practice is never
      acceptable. When the debate became public in Seattle, a
      number of activists, including those from cultures where FGA
      is the rule, protested that offering any form of FGA would
      seriously dilute their efforts to educate immigrant parents.
      Further, an argument could be made that, once a "nick" is
      allowed, it would be difficult if not impossible for the
      state to make sure that this did not become a loophole
      through which the worst elements of FGA would slide.<sup><a
      href="#n330">330</a></sup> As MGA is not anywhere close to as
      mutilating and threatening to life and health as are many
      forms of FGA, this argument would serve as a constitutionally
      valid distinction between the two practices.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, our First Amendment
      jurisprudence tells us that the law must be narrowly tailored
      to meet the state interest, or be "the least restrictive
      means."<sup><a href="#n331">331</a></sup> With respect to
      FGA, other possibilities exist. The law could require that
      FGA only be performed by physicians (or other licensed health
      care providers, such as nurse practitioners), or at least be
      performed under medical supervision. That would address the
      concern that traditional practitioners would use the loophole
      of a "nick" to perform larger surgeries and without proper
      precautions. True, this would still place upon FGA a burden
      that does not currently exist with respect to MGA, but given
      the real dangers associated with FGA, such a requirement
      might well pass muster as "the least restrictive means."</p>

      <p class="text2">A number of commentators have made the point
      that allowing something like the Seattle compromise will
      strengthen, not weaken, the ability of educators to persuade
      immigrants away from their traditional FGA practices. A
      willingness to compromise shows respect for the immigrants'
      culture and religion and exhibits tolerance within the
      necessary limits of protecting children against abuse.<sup><a
      href="#n332">332</a></sup> The fact that a significant number
      of Somali women were willing to take up Harborview Hospital's
      offer suggests that the "ritual nick" could have become an
      important tool in educating the immigrant community and in
      giving parents an alternative to sending their girls back to
      Somalia or hiring a backstreet traditional practitioner.</p>

      <p class="text2">Further, as long as the U.S. continues to
      countenance MGA, the criminalization of even the "ritual
      nick" cannot fail to dilute the persuasiveness of the
      official stance against FGA, while carrying the unmistakable
      taint of intolerance and double standards. Gollaher comments,
      "if male circumcision were confined to developing nations, it
      would by now have emerged as an international <i>cause
      c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, stirring passionate opposition
      from feminists, physicians, politicians, and the global human
      rights community."<sup><a href="#n333">333</a></sup> It is
      helpful to remember how the Seattle story began: with
      cognitive dissonance on both sides, as doctors routinely
      asked patients if they wanted their newborn boys circumcised,
      and patients (routinely!) answered that yes, they wanted both
      their boys <i>and</i> their girls circumcised. "Female
      circumcision will never stop as long as male circumcision is
      going on. How do you expect to convince an African father to
      leave his daughter uncircumcised as long as you let him do it
      to his son?"<sup><a href="#n334">334</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Doriane Lambelet Coleman asserts:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <span class="yellow">[A] state such as Washington has two
        options. It can begin performing symbolic female
        circumcisions, or it can stop circumcising or condoning the
        circumcision of boys. While the latter option would
        immediately raise substantial and very legitimate First
        Amendment concerns for parents whose religion requires
        circumcision&mdash;concerns that could be articulated just
        as easily by parents of boys and girls&mdash;it is clear
        that the choice must be made one way or the other. The
        bottom line is that the state cannot treat parents
        differently on the basis of their child's
        gender.</span><sup><a href="#n335">335</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">Nor, I would add, can a
      state or the federal government treat parents differently on
      the basis of their differing religious beliefs.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Facing up to the religious discrimination
      inherent in the current legal state of affairs is a good
      beginning. Just acknowledging that the complex, fuzzy reasons
      why a secular Jew would alter her son are no more or less
      worthy of respect than the complex, fuzzy reasons why a
      Somali mother would alter her daughter, is an important first
      step. Beyond that, I make the following recommendations.
      These recommendations are a compromise that seeks to protect
      young girls and boys from traumatic genital alteration, while
      respecting the important motivations that underlie both FGA
      and MGA. Further, by closing somewhat the gap between the
      total legal condemnation of any form of FGA and the complete
      legal indifference to MGA, these recommendations will go some
      way toward showing respect for immigrants from cultures that
      practice FGA and removing the taint of religious
      intolerance.</p>

      <div class="2">
        <p>(1) Federal and state laws should be rewritten to allow
        the sort of minor genital nick, with proper pain control
        and in hygienic circumstances, contemplated by Harborview
        General Hospital. (Of course, this would not obligate
        health care providers to offer that service.)</p>

        <p>(2) <span class="yellow">States should exercise some
        control over the practice of MGA when performed without
        medical necessity on minors.</span></p>

        <div class="2">
          <p>(a) States should gather data on all MGA, whether or
          not it is performed in the hospital, and whether or not
          the practitioner is a physician. All complications of MGA
          should be reported, to allow for a better understanding
          of the medical implications of this practice and also to
          allow oversight over nonmedical practitioners.</p>

          <p>(b) Nonphysician ritual practitioners of MGA should be
          certified. At present, this is probably the most serious
          operation one can perform without being charged with
          practicing medicine without a license. While requiring a
          medical license might well be overkill, requiring some
          sort of board certification, effected by the religious
          community but with government oversight, seems
          reasonable. The state regulates the hygienic practices of
          the people who cut our hair and our fingernails, so why
          not a baby's genitals?</p>

          <p>(c) Adequate pain control should be a legal
          requirement. Failure to provide it, within a clinical or
          a traditional setting, should be considered grounds for
          child abuse.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text2">In conclusion, it has not been my goal to
      soften or subvert the opposition to FGA of minors. However, a
      close look at the suggested Seattle compromise and its
      outcome shows us that there is significant overlap between
      some forms of FGA and the common practice of MGA in America.
      But one practice is illegal, while the other is not even the
      object of governmental oversight or record-keeping. Analysis
      of the motives behind the two practices&mdash;religious,
      medical, cultural, social&mdash;do not support such a
      disparity. The rhetoric of the activists, and the language of
      the federal and state laws against FGA, all suggest that this
      disparity is driven at least in part by a deep lack of
      respect for motivations that drive parents to perform FGA, as
      contrasted with the respect given the motivations behind MGA.
      Because laws criminalizing FGA burden the free exercise of
      religion, and because they appear to target only one type of
      religious practice while ignoring other like practices, they
      must be narrowly tailored to meet a substantial government
      interest. However, the crude sweep of the current laws
      criminalizing FGA does not meet that standard. In the
      recommendations above, I suggest a number of steps to address
      the disparity of treatment, while strengthening society's
      proper concern for the health and welfare of all children in
      America.</p>

      medieval Jewish physician, philosopher and author of <i>Guide
      for the Perplexed</i>, seemed to accept that circumcision
      made intercourse less pleasurable for both parties, and was
      thus a corrective to unbridled sexual passion. A
      thirteenth-century French Maimonides disciple, Isaac ben
      Yediah, was quite explicit in his description. When a woman
      has sex with an uncircumcised man:<br />
       (S)he feels pleasure and reaches an orgasm first. When an
      uncircumcised man sleeps with her and then resolves to return
      to his home, she brazenly grasps him, holding onto his
      genitals and says to him, "come back, make love to me." This
      is because of the pleasure that she finds in intercourse with
      him, from the sinews of his testicles&mdash;sinew of
      iron&mdash;and from his ejaculation&mdash;that of a
      horse&mdash;which he shoots like an arrow into her womb.

      all circumcisers be qualified physicians, but by insisting
      that the child's consent be obtained, which obviously
      excludes eight-day-old babies. The law was motivated by

      Roman Catholic missionaries settled in Egypt in the 17th
      century, they forbade female genital alteration among their
      flock, under the misapprehension that it was a Jewish custom.
      However, the unaltered girls of these Catholic converts were
      unable to find husbands when they grew up; their male
      coreligionists refused to marry them, choosing instead
      (genitally altered) girls from the surrounding culture. The
      College of Cardinals in Rome was forced to rescind its
      decision. Lane &amp; Rubinstein, <i>supra</i> <a

      Day Adventist publication subtitled "A Magazine of Religious
      Freedom," says, "Populations practicing female genital
      mutilation quickly cite religion as justification. But the
      truth seems to be rooted more in culture, tradition, and
      sexual control of women." Bailey, <i>supra</i> <a
      href="#n20">note 20</a>, at 11. The article continues: "Among
      Muslim populations religious scholars concede that the Koran
      makes no mention of FGM, and no established religion in the
      world requires, or even suggests, that this procedure has a
      true religious significance." <i>id</i>. (citation omitted).
      Doriane Lambelet Coleman cites a number of authors who
      "reject or marginalize" the religious importance of FGA to
      its followers, including Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, in her
      statement for the Congressional Record in favor of the
      Schroeder bill outlawing the practice. Coleman, <i>supra</i>
      <a href="#n77">note 77</a>, at 729 &amp; n.28 (noting that
      opponents of female genital alteration reject the view that
      such a practice is dictated by religion).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related issue has to
      with the origins of female genital alteration. It is common
      for writers to imply that, because the practices predates
      Islam (or any of today's religions) it cannot be an Islamic
      religious obligation. Karen Hughes writes that "many FGM
      proponents adhere to the mistaken belief that FGM originated
      as a requirement of Islam." Karen Hughes, Note, <a
      href="http://www.brooklaw.edu/students/journals/bjlp/abstracts/hughes.shtml"

      Mutilation in the United States</i></a>, 4 J.L. &amp; P<span
      class="sc1">OL</span>'<span class="sc1">Y</span> 321, 331
      (1995). Jane Wright writes that "(r)eligion is often stated
      as a reason for FGM. However, the practice predates all the
      major religions which practise the operation," Jane Wright,
      <i>Female Genital Mutilation: An Overview</i>, 24 J. A<span
      class="sc1">DVANCED</span> N<span class="sc1">URSING</span>
      251, 253 (1996). The problem with this argument is that most
      of today's religious practices can be traced to earlier
      customs of the cultures that surrounded and/or preceded them.
      No one argues that male genital alteration is not an
      authentically Jewish religious practice, simply because the
      practice predates Judaism by thousands of years and was
      certainly adopted by the ancient Israelites from the
      surrounding Egyptian culture. <i>See</i> G<span
      class="sc1">OLLAHER</span> <i>supra</i> <a href="#n7">note
      7</a>, at 1-6 (examining ancient Egyptian circumcision
      practices).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="n205"
      name="n205"></a>205. The parenthetical statement, "(FGM is
      not required by any religion)," without further discussion,
      is an example of the sort of unthinking arrogance with which
      Westerners often approach this issue. Anne J. Davis,
      <i>Female Genital Mutilation: Some Ethical Questions</i>, 17
      M<span class="sc1">ED</span>. &amp; L. 143, 144 (1998). It is
      instructive to compare this attitude with a parallel instance
      regarding the Jewish bris, or ritual male circumcision. A
      1951 article in the Archives of Pediatrics suggested that,
      instead of the mohel who traditionally performs both the
      surgical and ritual aspects of the ceremony, Jewish families
      engage a physician to do the first, while a rabbi of their
      choice "officiates." The author defends this departure from
      tradition by equating it with other examples of flexibility
      in Judaism. "Mosaic Dietary Law is another very important law
      to be observed in Judaism, and as everyone knows, many of our
      best Jewish families enjoy pork chops and Virginia ham in
      their menus. Our religious leaders apparently do not
      disapprove of the infractions of the above laws." R<span

      discourse of Islam may be conceived of as a more or less
      flexible superstructure erected over the shari'ah, which in
      turn may be defined as the set of injunctions emanating from
      the Qur'an and Sunnah (exemplary prophetic practice). Those
      who deal with this superstructure, and help it flex and bend
      to meet new circumstances, may be loosely defined as the
      'ulama', those who have knowledge. This amorphous group of
      people, women and men, are recognized in their communities by
      their knowledge. Winkel, <i>supra</i> <a href="#n203">note

      genital alteration because it is the most familiar in the
      United States and it is associated with a larger population
      than American Muslims (although Muslims will probably
      outnumber Jews in America very shortly). If there was a
      movement to make MGA illegal in the U.S. on the same terms as
      FGA, it would doubtless be Jews who would be put forward as
      those whose religious rights could not possibly be so
      trampled upon. Although Jews have often felt marginal and
      oppressed in the U.S., they are certainly a much more
      integrated and accepted minority than Muslims, and one with
      much stronger representation in the legislatures and the
      courts (not to mention the medical and legal
      professions).<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret that it is
      beyond the purview of this article to analyze this question
      from a different perspective&mdash;keeping the "Muslim"
      variable constant, and asking why no one questions the Muslim
      practice of male genital alteration. (This seems to be part
      of the confusion expressed by the Somali refugees in Seattle,
      who were told that the hospital would gladly circumcise their
      boys, but not their girls.) In some African cultures, boys
      are routinely circumcised at adolescence, without analgesics,
      and presumably with the same lack of sanitation and medical
      care as the girls. Nelson Mandela has a powerful description
      of this event in his autobiography. <i>See</i> N<span
      class="sc1">ELSON</span> M<span class="sc1">ANDELA</span>,
      L<span class="sc1">ONG</span> W<span class="sc1">ALK</span>
      <span class="sc1">TO</span> F<span class="sc1">REEDOM</span>
      30-34 (1994). Why is there no outcry over this? Is it because
      male genital alteration, at whatever age and in whatever
      culture, is too close to the prevailing American norms to be
      attacked, for fear of bringing our own practices under
      scrutiny?</span> 

      <blockquote>
        Often, male or female circumcision is performed without
        anaesthesia in a barbaric manner, by persons without any
        medical training, such as barbers or midwives, using
        rudimentary instruments, causing complications which
        sometimes lead to death. We have many tragic testimonies on
        female circumcision but none on male circumcision as
        obviously nobody is interested in the latter topic. Still
        today, I can recall my youth and hear the screams coming
        from my young Muslim neighbours while they were being
        circumcised.

      note that, while circumcision is the sign of belonging to the
      covenant, it does not confer Jewishness on a boy. Even males
      who are not circumcised are considered Jewish, if their
      mothers are Jewish (or if either parents is Jewish, in the
      Reform tradition). Circumcision, however, is the obligation
      of a Jewish father, and he is in derogation of his religious
      duties to God, the community, and to his son, if he fails to
      have it done. Failing that, other members of the community,
      or the young man himself when he is old enough, is obligated
      to arrange for the circumcision. <i>See</i> also
