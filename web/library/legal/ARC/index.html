<HEAD><BASE HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/ARC/"></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><PRE>          NEW LEGAL GROUP FORMED TO COMBAT CIRCUMCISION

A new non-profit international network of attorneys has been formed
to address legal matters pertaining to the genital mutilation of
children, particularly the practice of male genital mutilation or
circumcision.

Attorneys for the Rights of the Child (ARC) is working to eliminate
this outmoded and illegal surgical procedure.  We do this by
raising judicial, legal, and public awareness regarding the male
child's inherent legal and human rights to physical integrity and
self-determination.  ARC is developing a network of attorneys to
assist families whose sons were circumcised without parental
consent, parents whose sons were circumcised below "standard of
care" and those whose sons died from circumcision.

ARC will spearhead the development of a network of attorneys
prepared to assist plaintiffs wishing to expand the legal standard
on this issue to make legal relief available to circumcised males.

ARC promotes the incorporation of genital integrity considerations
into relevant fields including medical ethics, psychology, the
rights of children and youth, and other issues.  Already, ARC
representatives have published pertinent articles in legal and
medical journals, and have presented papers at various respected
conferences, including the Fourth International Symposium on Sexual
Mutilations in Lausanne, Switzerland and, more recently, at the
Seventh Interdisciplinary Conference on Male Sexual Victimization
in Orinda, California.

Any interested attorney is encouraged to contact us to obtain a
copy of our introductory mailing, including an informational flyer
and membership form.  Charter membership in ARC is available for
$35.  Please make your check payable to "Attorneys for the Rights
of the Child" and mail to J. Steven Svoboda, Esq., 2961 Ashby Ave.,
Berkeley, CA 94705, telephone: 510-848-4437, e-mail:
svoboda1@flash.net.

Persons seeking legal counsel in matters related to circumcision may
contact ARC for a referral to a knowledgeable attorney.
