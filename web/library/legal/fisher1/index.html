      <p class="justify"><font size="5"><b>L</b></font>ORD NATHAN,
      in his book "Medical Negligence", says that "It may very well
      be negligent for a practitioner to adhere to a once approved
      but now outworn and discredited practice." This is not a
      pious platitude emanating from a legal theorist, it is a
      practical point about which a decision must be reached when
      any doctor faces a legal action because of harm alleged to be
      due to treatment which has fallen into desuetude. Two actions
      against doctors, one settled a few years ago and one
      comparatively recently illustrate the point.</p>

      <p class="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1957,
      after an uncomplicated delivery, an infant did not begin
      spontaneous respiration. Various methods were used to
      stimulate breathing and were unsuccessful, so finally the
      obstetrician asked for "warm and cold tubs". The doctor
      immersed the infant in the warm water and almost immediately
      realized the water was scalding. The infant suffered first-
      and second-degree burns to the back, chest, both forearms,
      hands and fingers. The burned areas healed; there was
      permanent scarring but residual disability only to the third,
      fourth and fifth fingers of the left hand.</p>

      <p class="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other
      and somewhat similar case involved an infant whose delivery
      in 1963, was precipitate and who, like the first patient,
      failed to breathe spontaneously. The infant was placed in a
      resuscitator, and at the request of the obstetrician, a
      consultant who was present poured ether over the baby's
      abdomen. Some ether must have sprayed on to an exposed
      heating element in the resuscitator and it ignited
      immediately. The baby received burns to the scrotum, both
      legs and feet, to both arms and to the neck and the right
      cheek. Healing occurred, scars resulted and, though none of
      them produced disability, it was judged that several of them
      would be permanent.</p>

      <p class="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the
      untrue and unfair comment sometimes made about doctors is
      that they will not give evidence for plaintiffs in actions
      against other doctors. That this general statement is usually
      untrue is demonstrated by the presence of medical experts for
      plaintiffs at almost every malpractice action. Doctors do
      refuse to testify for plaintiffs and properly so, when they
      feel that plaintiffs have no grounds for complaint about the
      services doctors have rendered them. Doctors refuse also, and
      quite properly, to testify for other doctors when they feel
      the other doctors have rendered less than competent services;
      because this is true, and it should be emphasized that it is
      proper and right for it to be so, some actions against
      doctors that, on the face of them might be considered
      defensible, must be settled. So it was with these two
      actions.</p>

      <p class="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of
      doctors were consulted. Stated in general terms, the opinion
      of these doctors was that they could not honestly help
      because the treatments used were both of the kind described
      by Lord Nathan as "once approved but now outworn and
      discredited". They felt, again stated in general terms, that
      knowledge of the ineffectiveness of these procedures was
      widely enough disseminated among doctors that the defendant
      doctors could not escape responsibility for harm that
      resulted from treatment which involved risk when no
      corresponding or greater benefit could be expected. The
      doctors consulted there fore could not provide helpful
      testimony.</p>

      <p class="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without
      expert testimony to show that the mishaps occurred during the
      use of necessary and approved treatment it was not possible
      to justify either doctor's actions and the claims had to be
      settled.</p>

      <p class="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among a
      doctor's duties is the duty not only to use up-to-date and
      modern treatment when it is available but to stop using a
      treatment if it has been demonstrated either that the
      treatment is more dangerous than it should be or that it is
      so ineffective that risks outweigh benefits. When the
      profession as a whole has had demonstrated and has been
      convinced of the inapplicability or unsuitability or
      ineffectiveness of a form of treatment, a doctor cannot
      excuse himself for ill results merely by saying he was taught
      the methods, that they had been standard practice and that he
      continued to use them. A doctor may not have any legal
      responsibility for being in the van of the profession, but he
      has a responsibility to keep up with the body of the
      profession.</p>
