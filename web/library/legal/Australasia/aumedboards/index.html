<H2>Medical Licensing Boards of Australia</H2>

<P>CIRP provides the addresses of Australian Medical Licensing Boards.
Persons who believe a medical doctor has been negligent, or otherwise has behaved improperly or in an unethical fashion in relation to the circumcision of male infants as described below, should file a complaint against
the practitioner and/or the hospital.

<P>Such actions as:
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="/library/normal/">premature retraction</A> of the foreskin
  of an intact child;
  <LI>solicitation for surgery or promotion of circumcision;
  <LI>failure to provide information on <A 
  href="/library/treatment/">conservative treatments</A> for foreskin
  problems;
  <LI>performance of circumcision without full
  <A href="/news/1997.10.04_Herald/">informed consent</A>;
  <LI>use of coercion to obtain consent;
  <LI>failure to use <A href="/library/pain/">appropriate analgesia</A>;
  <LI>delegation of the surgery to an unlicensed or inadequately
  trained individual; and
  <LI>error or negligence resulting in a
  <A HREF="/library/complications/">botched circumcision</A> or surgical
  complications
</UL>

are examples of behaviour which should be reported to 
the appropriate State Board. 

<P><I>Even if the practitioner's misbehaviour does not result in actual injury,
you should not fail to report the complaint to the appropriate medical
licensing board.</I> The disciplinary action taken will help to prevent
injuries to children in the future.
