      <h1>Circumcision Deaths</h1>

      <p>Some babies die of complications of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> There has been a need to assemble
      information concerning death from complications of
      circumcision in one convenient location. This page is
      designed to fill that need.</p>

      <p>Deaths occur secondary to loss of blood or systemic
      infection from the circumcision wound.</p>

      <p>A few deaths are reported in the medical literature. Other
      medical literature discusses the frequency of those deaths. A
      few deaths are reported in the popular press.</p>

      <p>There is reason to believe that many deaths from
      circumcision are attributed to other causes. For example, if
      a baby were to die of meningitis that was contracted through
      the circumcision wound, the death may be attributed to
      meningitis while ignoring the fact that the baby would not
      have had meningitis if he had not been circumcised.</p>

      <p>Circumcision originated before the dawn of history. There
      was no knowledge of sanitation or the need for a sterile
      operating environment. Jews have traditionally performed
      circumcision on the eighth day after birth for many thousands
      of years. The medical literature was still reporting numerous
      deaths from ritual circumcision in the early twentieth
      century.<sup><a href="#n2">2, 3</a></sup> There must have
      been vast numbers of babies who died under those conditions
      through the centuries. Jewish law allows parents who have had
      three sons die from circumcision to leave the fourth son
      intact.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>Doctors are highly motivated to conceal the true cause of
      circumcision death. Neonatal circumcision has no medical
      indication and is now considered to be an unnecessary<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> non-therapeutic<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> operation. It is unethical to carry
      out such operations on minors who cannot consent for
      themselves.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Consequently, most
      doctors who have a baby die after a circumcision would prefer
      to attribute the results of his unethical operation to
      secondary causes, such as infection or bleeding, while
      ignoring the primary cause, which is the circumcision that
      resulted in the infection or bleeding. It is, therefore, very
      hard to identify the total number of deaths that occur from
      circumcision. One senses that one may be seeing only the "tip
      of the iceberg," with the vast majority of deaths from
      circumcision being concealed. The deaths undoubtedly cause an
      increase in infant mortality. Male infant mortality is higher
      than female infant mortality. It is not known how much of
      this increased mortality is due to the practice of male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Several doctors have given estimates of the number of
      deaths that occur each year. Douglas Gairdner reported 16-19
      actual deaths a year in England and Wales from neonatal
      circumcisions in the 1940s.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      Sydney Gellis believed that "there are more deaths from
      complications of circumcision than from cancer of the
      penis.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> There are various
      figures for the number of deaths from penile cancer ranging
      from 200 to 480 deaths per year. Robert Baker estimated 229
      deaths per year from circumcision in the United
      States.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Bollinger estimated
      that approximately 119 infant boys die from
      circumcision-related each year in the U.S. (1.3% of all male
      neonatal deaths from all causes).<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup></p>

      <p>There are several case reports of death in the medical
      literature. These are deaths from various infections.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-5</a>,<a href="#n13">13-15</a></sup> Sauer
      reported the death of an 18-day-old infant from
      Staphylococcal bronco-pneumonia.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Hiss <i>et al.</i> reported the death
      of an infant in Israel from haemorrhage and hypovolemic shock
      after ritual circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p>There are several newspaper accounts of boys who have died
      after circumcision. These are from bleeding and from
      complications of anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16-17,19-21</a>,<a
      href="#n22">22-36</a></sup></p>

      <p>Several coroner's reports of deaths from circumcision are
      known to exist.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> Demetrius Manker died from blood
      loss in Dade County, Florida on June 23, 1993.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> The coroner's report on the death of
      a previously healthy one-month-old infant, Ryleigh Roman
      Bryan McWillis, less that 48 hours after his
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> is available.
      Baby Ryleigh died of hypovolemic shock, after exsanguination
      caused by hemorrhage at the circumcision wound.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup>
      Ryleigh's mother said, "<i>I unplugged his life support at 5
      a.m. on the 22nd of August, one month and one day after he
      was born.</i>"<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup></p>

      <p>Despite the abundant evidence of death from
      circumcision-related-causes, the March 2009 <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/"
      target="_blank">Circumcision Policy Statement</a> of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics omitted any mention of
      possible death from circumcision-related-causes, thereby
      helping to keep American parents <i>un</i>informed of the
      possibility of death following circumcision.</p>

      <p>Many African tribes have initation ceremonies in which a
      youth or young man is initiated into manhood. The youths are
      sent to a camp in a remote area where initiation ceremonies,
      including circumcision, take place. The circumcisions are
      carried out by persons without medical training. African
      tribal ritual circumcision produces reports of death or
      serious injury every year.<sup><a href="#n28">28-36</a>, <a
      href="#n39">39,40</a></sup> The <i>Mail and Guardian</i>
      reports seven dead in the Fall of 2003 and a total of 250
      dead since 1995.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup></p>

      <p>Amitai Moshe, age 8 days, went into cardiac arrest after a
      ritual circumcision at Golder's Green Synagogue, London. He
      was taken from the synagogue directly to hospital and died
      eight days later.<sup><a href="#n43">43-45</a></sup></p>

      <p>A family doctor in Ontario circumcised an unnamed healthy
      infant at seven days of age. The infant suffered multiple
      complications and died seven days later of
      <i>hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></p>
