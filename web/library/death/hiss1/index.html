      <i>SUMMARY.</i> Lethal complications following ritual
      circumcision are extremely rare, the most common being
      sepsis. We present here a case of fatal haemorrhage from a
      tiny incision of the glans, following a "home" circumcision
      of a 6-week-old baby. The post-mortem examination disclosed
      idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. It is suggested that the
      previously undiagnosed hepatic condition was responsible for
      the fatal haemorrhage.<br />

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision is a simple surgical
      procedure performed all over the world, in the USA it is the
      most common operation performed in males.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> It is estimated that 1.2 million
      newborn males are circumcised in the USA annually. A great
      number of cultures including Jewish, Muslim, African,
      Australian, Polynesian and some South American aborigines
      practice male circumcision as part of their ritual
      traditions.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> About one in six
      boys and men in the world has been circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n2">3</a></sup> The main potential medical benefits
      that support this practice include prevention of phimosis,
      paraphimosis, balanitis, a decrease in the risk of cancer of
      the penis and a reduction of the risk of urinary-tract
      infections among infants. The most common complications of
      circumcision include haemorrhage, sepsis and surgical trauma.
      It is estimated that the overall complication rate of this
      procedure ranges from 0.2 to 5%.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Currently, there is an ongoing debate
      regarding the health advantages of circumcision. Although the
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated in 1989 that
      there are no valid medical indications for circumcision in
      the neonatal period, their current position acknowledges that
      there are potential medi-cal benefits which must be weighted
      against its risks.<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> There are
      very few reports in the literature regarding a lethal outcome
      from circumcision complications, most are from sepsis;<sup><a
      href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> 500 000 consecutive circumcisions in
      New York were fatality free.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> We
      present the only case as far as we are aware, reported in the
      medical literature, of fatal haemorrhage due to a surgical
      misadventure in the course of a circumcision, in a baby
      affected by idiopathic neonatal hepatitis &ndash; a
      heterogeneous hepato-biliary disorder of undetermined
      cause.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <h4>CASE REPORT</h4>

      <p class="text2">A healthy "small for date," 6-weeks-old male
      infant of Ethiopian origin, underwent ritual circumcision.
      The procedure was performed by his own father at home
      following the tradition of Ethiopian Jews.</p>

      <p class="text2">The preputial skin was incised with a sharp
      and clean razor after being pulled over the glans and the
      inner preputial epithelium was freed with a rudimental
      metallic clamp. Profuse external haemorrhage from the surgery
      site developed almost immediately. The attempts to control
      the bleeding by applying continuous local pressure failed and
      12 h later the infant was rushed to the nearby regional
      medical center. On admission the patient presented with
      severe hypo-volemia with an haemoglobin count of 6.6 g/%,
      severe metabolic acidosis and extreme bradycardia.</p>

      <p class="text2">The baby was responsive only to painful
      stimuli, rectal temperature was 35.2&deg;C and there was no
      further active bleeding from the glans, which was immediately
      covered with a thick film of gelatin foam (Gelfoam).</p>

      <center>
        <img src="hiss1-fig1.jpg" width="440" height="700"
        alt="Figure One" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Despite immediate tracheal intubation with
      assisted respiration and administration of bicarbonate,
      adrenalin and atropine and fluids, the severe bradycardia
      persisted and he was pronounced dead 3 1/2 h later.</p>

      <p class="text2">The following day an autopsy was performed
      at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine. The body weighed
      2660 g, the crown-heel length was 51 cm and the head
      circumference was 32 cm. The conjunctivae were pale, with no
      petechial haemorrhages or yellowish discoloration. No
      external malformations or injuries were noted except for a
      small wound on the penile shaft covered by clotted blood and
      gelatin foam.</p>

      <p class="text2">The total length of the penis was 2.2 cm,
      the whole prepuce had been removed through a horizontal
      incision on the dorsal aspect and an oblique incision towards
      the scrotum on the ventral side. The oblique cut transected
      the frenulum and incised the glans immediately above at the
      level of the corona glandis. No major blood vessel, such as
      the superficial dorsal penile arteries and vein, was cut. On
      the ventral surface the remaining skin covered 1.6 cm of the
      shaft while on the dorsal side 1.9 cm were covered. On the
      ventral aspect of the denuded shaft a 0.4 cm nick was
      detected, covered by small blood clots adhered to the wound
      (Fig. 1). Anatomical dissection of the penis did not reveal
      any structural abnormalities. Gross examination of the
      internal organs did not reveal abnormalities except for a
      micronodular appearance of the liver, which weighted 95 g
      (normal). Histological examination of all organs did not
      reveal abnormalities except for the liver, which showed
      various features of neonatal hepatitis, including severe
      lobular disarray with moderated mononuclear infiltration,
      macrovesicular steatosis, bridging fibrosis and areas of
      nodular regeneration. Scattered multinucleated giant cells,
      hepatocelular and canalicular cholestasis, excessive
      extramedullary haematopoiesis and moderated haemosiderosis
      were also observed (Fig. 2).</p>

        <img src="hiss1-fig2.jpg" width="440" height="373"
        alt="Figure Two" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The cause of death was determined as severe
      hypovolaemic shock from a deep cut through the glans during
      circumcision. The profuse bleeding resulted from idiopathic
      neonatal hepatitis, which was diagnosed on the basis of
      hepatic microscopic examination only since serum tests for
      clotting disorders were not performed at the hospital.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">In the Jewish tradition, circumcision should
      take place on the eighth day after birth and should be
      performed by a "Mohel" (a man, not necessarily a physician,
      especially trained for this religious task).<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Some congregations deviate from
      these ritual prescriptions and have the ceremony performed on
      a later date and by the male head of the family.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The aim of circumcision is to excise
      sufficient fore-skin to leave the glans uncovered.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> The key factors to be observed are
      attention to asepsis, not excessive excision, haemostasis and
      cosmesis.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the majority of cases there is only minor
      bleeding from the incision, all that is required to achieve
      haemostasis is gentle pressure on the area. Complications
      arise as a result of the operator's inexperience rather than
      of the method employed.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      Excessive bleeding may be due to anomalous vessels <sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> or the presence of a bleeding
      disorder.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although there are references to fatal
      complications of neonatal circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15&ndash;17</a></sup> the authors were unable to
      trace specific case reports in the medical literature. To the
      best of our knowledge, all fatal cases resulted either from
      complications of anaesthesia or sepsis.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> There are, however, cases of
      near-fatal haemorrhage following circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the reported case the father of the
      infant, lacking the necessary experience, carried out the
      ritual procedure. The minuscule incision on the penile shaft,
      which on an otherwise healthy infant, most probably would
      have resulted only in minor bleeding, caused massive
      haemorrhage, in this infant who suffered from idiopathic
      neonatal hepatitis. The baby's death was the result of fatal
      bleeding, not only because of the delay in medical assistance
      &ndash; which cannot be underestimated &ndash; but mainly
      because of the underlying blood coagulation disorder. The
      severity of bleeding appeared to be related to the degree of
      liver-function impairment. The existing condition, which
      among others precipitates hypoprotrobinemia,<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> was such that in this case the
      normal coagulation cascade was severely compromised.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The circumcision debate is entering a new
      era. In 1989, the AAP balanced its stands concluding that
      "newborn circumcision has potential benefits and advantages
      as well as disadvantages and risks," their current position
      acknowledges that there are potential medical benefits which
      must be weighted against its risks.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are contraindications to newborn
      circumcision; patients with hypospadias, epispadias and
      megalourethra should not undergo circumcision at birth
      because the foreskin may subsequently be required for
      urethral reconstruction. Circumcision is relatively
      contraindicated on patients with bleeding diathesis,
      prematurity, and severe medical problems.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The present case report should raise the
      awareness of the practitioner to the possible lethal
      complications resulting from a mishap during circumcision on
      a compromised child. Furthermore family physicians,
      neonatologists, obstetricians and paramedical staff, who are
      in contact with parents who desire to have their newborn
      circumcised, should advise them to request an expert and in
      case of any complications to report to a medical
      practitioner. This is the first reported case of fatal
      haemorrhage following ritual circumcision. A greater
      awareness of possible complications to this common and widely
      believed "safe," surgical procedure is suggested.</p>
