      <h4>FATAL STAPHYLOCOCCUS BRONCHOPNEUMONIA<br />
       FOLLOWING RITUAL CIRCUMCISION</h4>

      <p class="author">L<span class="8">OUIS</span> W. S<span
      class="8">AUER</span>, M.D., E<span class="8">VANSTON</span>,
      I<span class="8">LL</span>.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">J. B.</span> was born on
      December 1, 1942.&nbsp;&nbsp; His weight was 3,628
      Gm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial examination revealed no
      defects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother was unable to nurse for lack
      of milk.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the fifth day, a sterilized,
      evaporated milk formula was given ; first as complemental,
      then as supplemental food.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the seventh day,
      the bleeding time (Duke&rsquo;s method) was 45 seconds ; the
      coagulation time (Lee and White&rsquo;s method), 2 minutes
      and 15 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ritual circumcision was performed
      by a mohel, in the hospital, on the ninth day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The umbilical cord dropped off on the tenth day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On that day a tightly bound, blood-soaked bandage was
      removed, aseptically, by a nurse.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was
      accompanied by rather profuse oozing of blood.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      sterile gauze bandage was applied but not as tightly as the
      original.&nbsp;&nbsp; The infant was apparently well while in
      the maternity nursery, but gained weight rather
      slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp; There had been no fever, stools were
      normal, and the weight was 3,350 GM. (7 pounds 6 ounces) on
      the tenth day, when mother and infant left the hospital.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the thirteenth day, the rectal
      temperature was 103.2&deg; F. The infant was
      pale.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no cough ; anorexia was
      marked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart, lungs, abdomen, throat and
      ears were found to be normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight had not
      increased.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumcision wound was definitely
      infected.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the pus was wiped away from the
      glans with sterile gauze, a slight defect at the corona could
      be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently the circumcision blade had
      accidentally cut away a slight amount of the glans
      penis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The infection seemed to center at this
      point.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the abdominal wall, about one
      centimeter above the base of the penis a subcutaneous,
      slightly elevated movable gland, smaller than a pea could be
      seen and palpated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulfathazole ointment (5 per
      cent) , spread on sterile gauze, was applied to the penis and
      changed frequently each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulfadiazine, 0.12
      GM., was given in a teaspoon of food 4 times daily for three
      days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anorexia persisted, but clinical signs were
      absent.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no cough.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      infant was not examined thereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp; At midnight
      on the eighteenth day of life, several cubic centimeters of
      blood and mucus were vomited, spontaneously, and <span
      class="yellow">the infant expired</span> before medical aid
      arrived.</p>

      <p class="text2">The only necropsy findings were: multiple
      (over fifty), sharply demarcated, grey abscesses (3 to 10 mm.
      in diameter), distributed throughout the lungs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The circumcision wound had nearly healed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      papable gland, noted above, had disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pus,
      taken from one of the aseptically incised lung abscesses,
      showed on direct smear, many single, gram-positive cocci;
      there were were no chains.&nbsp;&nbsp; Capsule stain showed
      no encapsulated organisms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Culture showed
      <i>Staphylococus aureus</i> in pure culture.</p>

      <p class="text2">An infected circumcision wound and an
      accidentally incised glans penis were the portal of entry for
      this fatal staphylococcic blood-borne infection of both
      lungs.</p>
