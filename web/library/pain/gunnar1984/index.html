        <blockquote>
          <p class="text1">Eighteen, healthy male newborns, 2-5
          days old, were subjects in this study of the effects of a
          pacifier on the newborn's behavioral and adrenocortical
          responses to circumcision. Half of the subjects were
          randomly assigned to a condition in which they were
          encouraged to suck on a pacifier during circumcision,
          while half served in a no pacifier, control condition.
          Behavioral observations were made of 1/2 hour before,
          during, and after circumcision and 30 minutes later. The
          results showed that stimulating the newborn with the
          pacifier reduced crying by about 40%. Reducing crying,
          however, had no significant effect on adrenocortical
          response. Elevations of serum cortisol predicted average
          behavioral state following circumcision, whereas crying
          during circumcision did not. Furthermore, there was
          evidence that the neonatal adrenocortical system was
          sensitive in variations in surgical procedures. The
          results indicate the importance of obtaining data on both
          behavioral and hormonal systems in studies of stress and
          coping in human newborns.</p>

      <p class="text1">The pituitary-adrenocortical system plays a
      major role in an organisms adaptation to traumatic, stressful
      conditions (Mason, 1968, Selye, 1956). In animals and adult
      humans, measures of adrenocortical activity have proven to be
      highly sensitive indices of stress (Frankenhaeuser, 1980,
      Hennessy and Levine, 1979). Recent work with non-human
      primates also indicates that this neuroendocrine system is
      sensitive to stressors early in development (see review by
      Coe and Levine (1981); but little is known about the response
      to stress in human infants, or the relationship between
      adrenocortical activity and infant behavior.</p>

      <p class="text1">Although it was once believed that in humans
      the neonatal pituitatry-adrenocortical system was relatively
      insensitive to stress (Gutai et al., 1972; Hillman and
      Giroud, 1965), more recent work has demonstrated that
      stressors, such as circumcision, will produce striking
      elevations in serum cortisol during the first week of life
      (<a href="../gunnar/">Gunnar et al., 1981a</a>; <a
      href="../talbert/">Talbert et al., 1976</a>). Measures of
      adrenocortical activity have also been shown to be correlated
      with behavioral state in the newborn. Specifically,
      elevations in serum cortisol have been found to correlate
      with behavioral distress or crying (<a
      href="/library/pain/anders1/">Anders et al., 1970</a>; Gunnar
      et al., 1981a; <a href="/library/pain/tennes1/">Tennes and
      Carter, 1973</a>). This correspondence between crying and
      adrenocortical activity suggests that stimuli which
      effectively reduce crying might also effectively modify the
      hormonal stress response during the newborn period.</p>

      <p class="text1">To examine this possibility, in the
      following study newborn males were given pacifiers and were
      encouraged to engage in non-nutritive sucking during
      circumcision. The results of a previous study showed that
      permitting the newborn to suck on a pacifier was effective in
      reducing crying during this surgical procedure. (<a
      href="../gunnar/">Gunnar et al., 1981a</a>). However, because
      being given a pacifier was not a controlled aspect of that
      study, too few subjects were given pacifiers to clearly
      assess the effects of reduced crying on the adrenocortical
      response to circumcision. Work with non-human primate infants
      has shown that contact with mother, of which nipple-contact
      is an important component, not only reduces behavioral
      stress, but also reduces the infant's adrenocortical response
      to stressors such as disruption of the social group, capture
      and handling, and rehousing in novel environments (Coe et
      al., 1978; Gunnar et al., 1981b). Thus, it was possible that
      stimuli which effectively reduced crying in newborns might
      also modify the newborn's adrenocortical response to
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Method</h4>

      <p><i>Subjects and Conditions</i></p>

      <p class="text1">The subjects were 18 healthy, male,
      2-5-day-old newborns. The subjects averaged 3594 g at birth,
      had 1-min Apgar scores greater than 7, and were between 38
      and 42 weeks gestation. Three were delivered by elective
      Caesarean section; the remainder were delivered vaginally.
      Half the infants were randomly assigned to a <i>pacifier</i>
      condition, in which they were encouraged to such on a
      pacifier during circumcision, while half were assigned to a
      no pacifier, control condition. There were no differences
      between conditions on any of the subject variables.</p>

      <p><i>Procedure</i></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Parental consent</i>. Parents of healthy
      newborn males were contacted on the second day postpartum.
      The purpose and procedures of the study were described and
      written consent was obtained. Of the 85 males born in the
      nursery during the course of this study, 46% met the
      requirements for this study, and consent was obtained from
      parents of 50% of those infants. Not all of these infants
      were included in the sample, however, because of problems in
      scheduling.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Serum Cortisol</i>. Blood samples for
      serum cortisol determination were obtained immediately before
      circumcision (<i>pre-session</i>) and 30 min later
      (<i>post-session</i>). Each sample was obtained from a scalp
      vein within 5 min (<i>X</i>=124 sec) from the time the
      newborn was picked up to be sampled. The samples were
      immediately centrifuged and the serum separated and stored at
      -20C. Cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay using the
      Amerlex cortisol RIA kit (Amershal Corporation). This assay
      in highly specific to cortisol; however the values obtained
      reflect some small amount of cortisone (1.6%) and
      corticosterone (0.6%) activity.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Behavioral Measures</i>. Two observers
      recorded the newborn's behavior for the 1/2 hours before,
      during (first to second blood sample), and following
      circumcision. Before and after circumcision the newborn's
      behavioral state was recorded every 30 sec using the 6-point
      scale shown in Table I. Before circumcision the newborn's
      behavioral state was observed in the nursery. After
      circumcision the infants were observed while they were with
      their mothers being fed and comforted. Estimates of
      inter-observer agreement were calculated in 2 hours and 52
      minutes of observation, using 20 pretest subjects. Agreement
      estimates were calculated in two ways. First, estimates of
      percent agreement were obtained for each behavioral state.
      These averaged 85%. Next, average state scores were computed
      by summing the state scores for each subject and dividing by
      the number of coding intervals in the observation. The
      Pearson correlation coefficient for these values was
      0.99.</p>

      <p class="text1">During circumcision, observers recorded
      state 6 crying every 30 sec, as well as a combined measure of
      body tension and activity scored on a 3-point scale (1 =
      quiet, 2 = moderate, 3 = high). A score of 1 or quiet was
      recorded when the newborn showed little or no movement during
      the majority of the 30-sec coding interval, and in addition,
      did not evidence rigid or tense muscle tone. A score of 3 or
      high activity was recorded if the newborn strained against
      the circumstraint straps, evidenced rigid muscle tone, and/or
      moved his head and upper torso vigorously during the majority
      of the coding interval. A score of 2 or moderate activity was
      assigned for movement and body tension midway between these
      two extremes. Observer agreement estimates calculated on 5
      test subjects were all above 75% for these measures. It
      should be noted that the behavioral state scale was not used
      to score behavioral state during circumcision because
      previous work indicated that newborns display a mixture of
      states during this surgical procedure. Finally, in the
      pacifier condition, observers also recorded sucking (1 =
      none, 2 = moderate, and 3 = vigorous) every 30 sec.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Circumcision</i>. The newborns were
      circumcised between 0700 and 1900 hours on the day of
      discharge. Seven physicians, including four junior residents,
      performed the circumcisions using three circumcision methods.
      The three methods were: (1) Plastibell<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> (1 pacifier, 1 control), a procedure
      involving progressive necrosis of the foreskin over several
      days; (2) Standard Gomco clamp (7 pacifier, 5 control), a
      procedure involving clamping the foreskin, then waiting 5 to
      6 min before removing the foreskin; and modified Gomco clamp
      (1 pacifier, 3 control), a procedure involving removing the
      foreskin as soon as the Gomco clamp was secured. The average
      duration of circumcision was 17.3 minutes (17.7 pacifier;
      16.8 control) from the time the newborn was strapped to the
      circumstraint board until he was taken off the board.
      Immediately following circumcision the newborn was dressed,
      swaddled, and put in his crib where he stayed until the
      second blood sample was taken. This post-circumcision waiting
      period averaged 12.7 minutes. It should be noted that the
      adult diurnal rhythm in adrenocortical activity is not
      present in the newborn and does not establish itself until
      the second year of life (see review by Hung et al. (1978)).
      Thus, the different clock times at which blood samples were
      obtained could not have influenced the results.</p>

      <p class="text1">Infants in the pacifier condition were given
      the pacifier to suck on as they were being strapped to the
      surgical board. An experimenter continued to stimulate them
      to suck on the pacifier until the second blood sample was
      taken. Infants in the control condition were not given
      pacifiers, but were dressed, swaddled, and otherwise soothed
      as soon as the circumcision was over. It should be noted that
      circumcision involved the combination of a number of
      stressors (e.g., physical restraint, tissue damage, and in
      the present study, venipuncture). It was not the purpose of
      this study to determine the relative contributions of each
      stressor to the newborn's pituitary-adrenal or behavioral
      response.</p>

      <h4 align="center">Results</h4>

      <p class="text1">Prior to circumcision, infants in the
      pacifier and control conditions did not differ in either
      average behavioral state (<i>t</i>(13)=1.63,NS)<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> or serum cortisol concentration
      (<i>t</i>(16)=0.21,NS). Before circumcision the infants were
      in quiescent states (deep sleep, light sleep or drowsy),
      exhibiting basal serum cortisol concentrations (<i>X</i>
      &plusmn; S.E. =6.7 &plusmn; 1.27 &micro;g/dl). There was no
      significant relationship between different behavioral states
      in this quiescent range and pre-session serum cortisol levels
      (Pearson <i>r</i>(13) = 0.006,NS).</p>

      <p class="text1">Infants in the pacifier condition sucked
      moderately to vigorously on the pacifier during 49% of the
      coding intervals while they were strapped to the surgical
      board, and during 63% of the intervals during the entire
      period between the 2 blood samples. Stimulation with the
      pacifier significantly reduced crying. Newborns in the
      pacifier condition cried during only 46% of the coding
      intervals while they were being circumcised, as compared to
      81% of the intervals for newborns in the control condition,
      <i>t</i>(16) = 6.95, p&lt;0.01. Newborns in the pacifier
      condition were also less active during circumcision, than
      were newborns in the control condition. The percentage of
      coding intervals during which moderate activity was recorded
      was 26% (pacifier) versus 5% (control), <i>t</i>(16) = 2.87,
      p&lt;0.05. A similar difference was noted for quiet or no
      activity (pacifier = 24%, control = 10%, <i>t</i>(16) = 2.25,
      p&lt;0.05. High activity almost always co-occurred with
      crying and was not analyzed separately.</p>

      <p class="text1">Once the circumcision was over and the
      newborns were dressed, swaddled and returned to their cribs,
      the behavioral differences between groups diminished. Neither
      the average percentage of coding intervals spent crying
      (pacifier = 19%, control = 35%, t(16) = 0.87, NS), nor the
      average percentage of quiet activity (pacifier = 48%, control
      = 34%, t(16) = 1.31, NS) differed significantly by condition
      during the waiting period between the end of the circumcision
      and post-session blood sample, when the newborns were with
      their mothers being fed (pacifier = X &plusmn; = 2.23
      &plusmn; 0.26; control = 2.53 plus minus 0.25, <i>t</i>(14) =
      0.83, NS).</p>

      <p class="text1">Although behavioral differences were
      observed during circumcision, these differences were not
      reflected in the post-session serum cortisol values.
      Post-session values averaged 24.2 &plusmn; 1.32 &micro;g/dl
      for the pacifier group and 24.7 &plusmn; 1.60 &micro;g/dl for
      the control group, t(16) = 0.24, NS. Additionally, there was
      no evidence that the failure to observe an effect on
      post-session serum cortisol values was a function of the
      different circumcision technique employed.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Measures of &Delta;-cortisol (post-session
      minus pre-session values) were used to examine the
      relationship between adrenocortical activity and individual
      differences in behavior. Percent crying during circumcision
      was not significantly related to &Delta;-cortisol in either
      condition, pacifier <i>r</i>(7) = 0.25, NS. Average
      behavioral state following circumcision was positively
      related to &Delta;-cortisol for newborns in both conditions,
      pacifier <i>r</i>(6) = 0.71, p&lt;0.05. However, in neither
      condition did crying during circumcision predict behavioral
      state following circumcision, pacifier <i>r</i>(6) = 0.05,
      NS) and control <i>r</i>(6) = 0.05, NS.</p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, exploratory analyses were conducted
      to examine the sensitivity of the behavioral and hormonal
      measures to differences in circumcision procedures. Because
      only two Plastibell circumcisions were performed, the effects
      of this circumcision procedure were not analysed. Instead,
      responses to two versions of the Gomco clamp procedure were
      examined. Elevations in serum cortisol differed significantly
      as a function of procedure, <i>t</i>(14) = 3.01,
      <i>p</i>&lt;0.01 (t calculated using the formula for small
      samples and unequal <i>N</i>s (Spence et al., 1954). The
      modified procedure produced higher post-session cortisol
      values 29.0 &plusmn; 1.47 &micro;g/dl., <i>N</i> = 4), than
      the standard procedure (22.6 &plusmn; 1.04 &micro;g/dl.,
      <i>N</i> = 12. This effect appeared to be due to procedure,
      rather than how long the infant was strapped to the
      circumstraint board. The correlation between post-session
      serum cortisol and duration of circumcision (strapped down to
      pick up) was not significant using all of the subjects in the
      sample, <i>r</i>(16) = 0.10, NS.</p>

      <p class="text1">Because only one infant in the pacifier
      condition was circumcised using the modified procedure,
      crying during circumcision was examined only for infants in
      the control condition. The values for percent crying
      completely overlapped and were 71, 79, and 80% for the
      control subjects circumcised by the Modified Gomco procedure
      and 65, 80, 83, 92, and 97% for the control subjects
      circumcised by the Standard Gomco procedure. Following
      circumcision, however, the modified procedure was associated
      with more behavioral arousal (<i>X</i> = 3.38 &plusmn; 0.19),
      than the standard procedure (<i>X</i> = 2.05 &plusmn; 0.12,
      <i>t</i>(14) = 5.54, <i>p</i>&lt;0.01 (formula for small
      samples and unequal <i>N</i>s (Spence et al. (1954)).</p>

      <h4 align="center">Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Permitting the newborn to engage in
      non-nutritive sucking significantly reduced crying and motor
      activity during circumcision. It is unlikely that these
      effects were due to response substitution, as newborns in the
      pacifier condition cried and rejected the pacifier during
      parts of the circumcision procedure. Nor were these results
      solely due to stimulation of an incompatible response. While
      sucking and crying were incompatible, body tension, straining
      against the circumcision straps, and other signs of
      distressed motor activity were not incompatible with sucking.
      These data are consistent with the results of other studies
      which indicate that non-nutritive sucking has a potent
      calming effect on behavior during the neonatal period
      (Burroughs, et al., 1978; Kessen and Leutzendorff, 1963).</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Although newborns in the pacifier
      condition showed less behavioral distress than newborns in
      the control condition, post-session levels of serum cortisol
      did not differ by condition. Newborns in both conditions
      evidenced striking elevations in serum corticoids 30 min
      after the onset of circumcision.</span> The failure to
      observe an effect of the pacifier condition could not be due
      to group differences prior to circumcision. Pre-session serum
      cortisol did not differ by condition. Nor was there evidence
      that differences in surgical technique masked effects of the
      soothing procedures on adrenocortical activity.</p>

      <p class="text1">There are, however, at least three reasons
      why reductions in behavioral distress may not have been
      reflected in measures of the neonates'
      pituitary-adrenocortical response in this study. First,
      measuring serum cortisol levels 30 min after the onset of
      circumcision may have been too early to detect an effect of
      differences in behavioral distress. There is some evidence
      that differences in the intensity of highly stressful events
      may be reflected in the duration, rather than in the peak
      magnitude of the adreno-corticoid response (Vernikos-Danellis
      and Heybach, 1980). Similarly, Coe and Levine (1981) have
      reported that manipulations which reduce the infant squirrel
      monkey's behavioral reaction to maternal separation are not
      reflected in serum corticoid levels at 30 min but are
      apparent in levels measured 60 min after the onset of
      separation. Thus it is possible that measures of serum
      cortisol obtained at a later time point might have reflected
      the differences in behavioral distress observed in the
      Pacifier and Control conditions. However, the fact that the
      30-min time point was sensitive to differences in surgical
      technique make this explanation of the results less
      compelling.</p>

      <p class="text1">Second, the reduction in behavioral stress
      produced by giving the newborn a pacifier may have been too
      slight to result in any reduction in the newborn's
      adrenocortical response. This explanation seems very
      reasonable, but is difficult to reconcile with the results of
      our previous study which showed a high positive correlation
      between serum cortisol elevations and equally small
      variations in behavioral distress (<a
      href="../gunnar/">Gunnar et al., 1981a</a>). In that study,
      however, even though some of the newborns were given
      pacifiers by the nursing staff, because that was not a
      controlled aspect of the study, the nurses did not actively
      attempt to encourage sucking once the newborn became highly
      distressed. In the present study we encouraged the newborns
      to suck on the pacifier throughout the circumcision. Thus in
      the previous study behavioral distress may have been a more
      direct expression of the amount of endogenous pain or stress
      the newborn was experiencing, whereas in the present study
      differences in behavioral stress were due to exogenous
      stimulation with the pacifier. <span class="yellow">In short,
      encouraging the newborn to suck on the pacifier may have
      masked the behavioral expression of the newborn's underlying
      physiological state, without calming the newborn sufficiently
      to produce a change in physiological arousal. This
      explanations points to the importance of obtaining both
      behavioral and physiological measures in studies of stress or
      coping.</span></p>

      <p class="text1">Finally, it may well be that stimuli that
      calm the newborn behaviorally have little effect on the
      adrenocortical response when the stressor involves pain or
      tissue damage. <span class="yellow">Nothing that we were
      doing to help calm the newborn in any way altered the fact
      that the newborn was experiencing an apparently painful event
      that resulted in tissue damage. Under these circumstances
      activity of the adreno- cortical system may be less affected
      or unaffected by CNS activity mediating behavioral
      arousal.</span> Examining the effects of "pacifying" stimuli
      on the neonates' adrenocortical response to other types of
      potentially stressful stimuli should provide insights into
      which stressors are more directly mediated by behavioral
      arousal during the newborn period.</p>

      <p class="text1">Even though post-session serum cortisol
      values did not reflect an effect of the pacifier
      manipulation, they did indicate that the neonatal
      pituitary-adrenocortical system was highly sensitive to
      variations in surgical procedures. Furthermore, the results
      showed that measures of individual differences in post
      session adrenocortical levels were capable of predicting
      behavioral state following circumcision. During the 1/2 hour
      following circumcision behavioral state was not a function of
      whether the newborn had been given a pacifier during
      circumcision, but was related to the magnitude of the
      newborn's adrenocortical response to the surgery. Newborns
      who showed higher elevations in serum corticoids were
      behaviorally more aroused following circumcision when they
      were with their mothers being fed. A closer examination of
      this result suggested that is was due to differences in
      surgical procedures.</p>

      <p class="text1">Newborns who were subjected to the modified
      Gomco procedure both showed greater elevations in serum
      corticoids and were more behaviorally aroused following
      circumcision than were newborns subjected to the standard
      Gomco procedures. It is not clear why these effects were
      observed, however, one explanation may be the rate at which
      stressful or painful effects of the circumcision occurred. In
      informal observations we noted that the newborns often showed
      intense behavioral distress when the Gomco clamp was put on
      and when it was taken off. While the clamp was in place
      newborns in both conditions often calmed down. In the
      modified Gomco procedure putting the clamp on and taking it
      off occurred in a relative rapid sequence, whereas in the
      standard version more than 5 min elapsed between these two
      events. Work with mature organisms indicates that the
      adrenocortical system responds more vigorously to stressful
      events that occur at a more rapid rate (see review by
      Hennessy and Levine, (1979)). These data may indicate that a
      similar process plays a role in regulating adreno- cortical
      activity in the human newborn. However the small sample size
      involved in the comparison makes all interpretations
      tentative.</p>

      <p class="text1">Regardless of the explanation of these
      findings, however, these data suggest that measures of
      adrenocortical activity are sensitive to variations in
      stressful events in the newborn period, and provide
      information about the newborn's response to stressors that
      may not be detected when only behavioral measures are
      obtained. <span class="yellow">Examining both behavioral and
      adrenocortical responses, thus appears to be a fruitful
      avenue through which to explore address and coping processes
      in the human newborn.</span></p>

      Measures of behavioral state post-circumcision were not
      obtained for the two subjects circumcised using the
      Plastibell technique. This decision was based on concern that
      this technique might produce different physical stimulation
      after surgery than that resulting from the Gomco procedure,
      which might influence behavioral state. If so, it would add
      noise to the data that could not be partialled out, because
      only 2 subjects were circumcised by the Plastibell
      technique.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a id="n2" name="n2"></a> <sup>2</sup>
      Because of problems in scheduling, 3 subjects were not
      observed prior to circumcision. When questioned, however, the

      sleeping quietly before the circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">The article by Gunnar et al. (1984) is a
      major contribution to the discussion of circumcision pain.
      They suggest that although crying during circumcision may be
      reduced about 40% by using a pacifier, the underlying stress,
      as measured by adrenocortical response is not diminished.</p>

      <p class="text1">The study does not mention the more
      fundamental question: Why is it necessary to perform
      nonreligious circumcision almost routinely? Every country,
      with one exception, that adopted routine neonatal
      nonreligious circumcision has either abandoned the practice
      or markedly reduced the rate of performance. This may be
      noted in the present rates - Britain, 1%; New Zealand, 8%;
      and Canada and Australia, about 30%.</p>

<i>To the Editor</i>:

   We thank Dr. Wallerstein for his comments on our article.  The
intent of our work is to understand stress factors and their effects
on the newborns, ultimately with an eye to determining the best modes
of helping the newborn to cope with stress.  With regard to Dr.
Wallerstein's fundamental question, "to circumcise or not to
circumcise?" we agree.  <span
class="yellow">The most effective way to reduce the stress of
circumcision would be to abandon the practice.</span>
