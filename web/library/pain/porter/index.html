      [Abstract] 

      <p>Porter, Fran Lang; Miller, Richard H.; and Marshal Richard
      E. Neonatal Pain Cries: Effect of Circumcision on Acoustic
      Features and Perceived Urgency. Child Development, 1986, 57,
      790-802. The relation between neonatal pain cry features
      elicited by painful circumcision procedures and the perceived
      urgency of those cries was investigated. Vocalizations were
      recorded during circumcision of 30 normal newborn males,
      analyzed by spectrographic methods and validated with
      computer intervals; shorter, more frequent vocalizations;
      higher peak fundamental frequencies; fewer harmonics; and
      greater variability of the fundamental. Cries elicited by the
      most intrusive procedures were judged by adult listeners to
      be the most urgent, and cries from similarly invasive
      procedures were judged to be of the same degree of urgency.
      Cries appeared to be judged along 3 dimensions described by
      harmonic, temporal, and pitch characteristics. Subjective
      judgments and objective quantitative data converge to
      demonstrate that infants' cries are perceived as varying and
      objectively, do systematically vary with respect to the the
      intensity of the painful stimuli.</p>
