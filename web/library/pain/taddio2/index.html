        <p class="abs"><b>Background</b> <span
        class="yellow">Preliminary studies suggested that pain
        experienced by infants in the neonatal period may have
        long-lasting effects on future infant behaviour.</span> The
        objectives of this study were to find out whether neonatal
        circumcision altered pain response at 4-month or 6-month
        vaccination compared with the response in uncircumcised
        infants, and whether pretreatment of circumcision pain with
        lidocaine-prilocaine cream (Emla) affects the subsequent
        vaccination response.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Methods</b> We used a prospective cohort
        design to study 87 infants. The infants formed 3 groups --
        uncircumcised infants, and infants who had been randomly
        assigned Emla or placebo in a previous clinical trial to
        assess the efficacy of Emla cream as pretreatment for pain
        in neonatal circumcision. Infants were videotaped during
        vaccination done at the primary care physician's clinic.
        Videotapes were scored without knowledge of circumcision or
        pretreatment status by a research assistant who had been
        trained to measure infant facial action, cry duration, and
        visual analogue scale pain scores.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Findings</b> Birth characteristics and
        infant characteristics at the time of vaccination,
        including age and temperament scores, did not differ
        significantly among groups. Multivariate ANOVA revealed a
        significant group effect (P&lt;0.001) in difference
        (vaccination minus baseline) values for percentage facial
        action, percentage cry time, and visual analogue pain
        scores. Univariate ANOVAs were significant for all outcome
        measures (p&lt;0.05): infants circumcised with placebo had
        higher difference scores than uncircumcised infants for
        percentage facial action (136.9 <i>vs</i> 77.5%),
        percentage cry duration (53.8 vs 24.7%) and visual analogue
        scale pain scores (5.1 vs 3.1 cm). There was a significant
        linear trend on all outcome measures, showing increasing
        pain scores from uncircumcised infants, to those
        circumcised with Emla, to those circumcised with
        placebo.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Interpretation</b> Circumcised infants
        showed a stronger pain response to subsequent routine
        vaccination than uncircumcised infants. Among the
        circumcised group, preoperative treatment with Emla
        attenuated the pain response to vaccination. We recommend
        treatment to prevent neonatal circumcision pain.</p>

      <p class="text"><font
      face="arial"><b>Introduction</b></font><br />
       Neonatal circumcision is a common surgical procedure in male
      infants. Despite evidence that circumcision causes intense
      pain and short-term alterations in infant feeding, sleeping,
      and crying behaviours,<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup>
      analgesia is rarely given.<sup><a href="#n4">4-6</a></sup>
      There is a common belief that the effects of circumcision
      pain are short-lived and clinically insignificant, and,
      therefore, that the benefits of analgesic treatment do not
      outweigh the risks of adverse effects from currently
      available therapies.<sup><a href="#n7">7-8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked
      at the foundation for the belief that the effects of
      circumcision pain are short-lived by examining infant
      behaviour several months after surgery. We analysed data from
      a clinical trial that studied the use of topical
      lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream (Emla, Astra Pharma, Canada)
      during routine vaccination at 4 or 6 months.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Male infants showed a greater pain
      response than female infants. This difference may be linked
      with neonatal circumcision in male infants. Male infants who
      had been circumcised also exhibited a greater pain response
      than those who had not been circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> This initial analysis raised
      concerns about the possible long-term effects of untreated
      pain in infants, especially those who have repeated
      experience of pain. However, we could not draw definite
      conclusions because of the post-hoc nature of the analysis
      and the small sample size. The objectives of our study were,
      therefore, to investigate prospectively whether neonatal
      circumcision affects infant pain response to routine
      vaccination 4-6 months after surgery and whether vaccination
      response is affected by pretreatment of neonatal circumcision
      pain with Emla.</p>

      <p class="text"><font
      face="arial"><b>Methods</b></font><br />
       We carried out a prospective cohort study of 87 healthy,
      full-term, male, newborn infants who had, when aged 5 days or
      less, participated in a clinical trial that investigated the
      safety and efficacy of Emla cream for neonatal
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> The
      participants in this study included uncircumcised boys, who
      served as controls (n=32), and circumcised boys who had been
      randomly assigned to treatment with Emla (n=29) or placebo
      (n=26) during circumcision. All parents who had allowed their
      infants to participate in the circumcision trial were asked
      to enroll their infants in this study and sign a consent form
      for their participation. We recruited uncircumcised infants
      from the same study by the same inclusion criteria as for the
      circumcised infants, the difference being that their parents
      had chosen not to have their infants circumcised. The
      protocol received approval from the Research Ethics Boards of
      the Hospital for Sick Children and Women's College
      Hospital.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      setting for this study was the clinic of the infant's primary
      care physician, where vaccination was done. Each infant's
      physician was contacted before the study commenced and
      informed about its purpose and procedures. One of the
      investigators telephoned all the parents 2-4 weeks before the
      anticipated date of the 4-month or 6-month vaccination to
      obtain details of the appointment date and time. We chose to
      study pain response during routine vaccination at 4 or 6
      months to reduce the effects of fear and anticipation on
      infant pain response seen in older infants and children, and
      because vaccination pain responses do not vary greatly within
      this age range.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents
      were sent copies of the revised infant temperament
      questionnaire for infants aged 4-8 months,<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> to complete within the 2 weeks
      before the vaccination appointment. An investigator met one
      or both parents and their infant at the primary care
      physician's clinic on the day of the vaccination, and the
      parents returned the completed questionnaire to the
      investigator at that time. The vaccination procedure was
      standardised across settings. The infant was physically
      examined before the vaccination. If the infant was unsettled
      by this examination, the parents were asked to settle him.
      Immediately before the vaccination the infant was placed
      supine on the examination table. A physician or nurse then
      gave the infant an intramuscular injection of the vaccine
      (0.5 mL DPT-Polio &amp; Act-HIB, Connaught Laboratories,
      Ontario, Canada) in the left or right thigh. An investigator
      recorded the infant's face for a minimum of 20 s with a video
      camera (Panasonic, Ontario, Canada, model #PV-S770A-K),
      before, during, and for up to 1 minute after the
      vaccination.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents
      were instructed not to hold the infant for the first 30 s
      after the injection but were not discouraged from touching or
      speaking to him during the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text"><font face="arial"><i>Pain
      assessment</i></font><br />
       Infant pain response was scored from the videotape by a
      research assistant who was unaware of the purpose of the
      study and the treatment group status of the infants. The
      research assistant was trained to score reliably infant pain
      reactions using the neonatal facial coding system<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> and cry duration (test-retest
      k=0.76, p&lt;0.001).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three
      behavioural pain measures were used to assess pain: infant
      facial action, cry duration, and visual analogue scale
      scores. Infant facial action was a composite score from three
      specific facial actions (brow bulge, nasolabial furrow, and
      eyes squeezed shut) taken from the neonatal facial coding
      system.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> This system is a
      sensitive and specific way of rating infant pain,<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,15</a></sup> and is the most extensively used
      behavioural pain measure in infant pain research.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> The neonatal facial system was
      chosen as the primary outcome measure for this study because
      it is considered to be the gold standard for infant pain
      assessment. We used these three facial actions because they
      are particularly sensitive for indicating pain.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> The three facial actions and cry
      duration were coded as present or absent for each 1 s period
      of the 20 s before the vaccination (baseline), and the first
      20s during and after the vaccination. These data were then
      converted into percentages of time that the infants exhibited
      the actions or cried (ie, %time=number of times action
      observed/20x100, where 20 was the number of assessments made
      during the 20 s period).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
      overall facial action pain score for the procedure was
      calculated by adding together the facial action scores for
      the three specific facial actions. The overall facial action
      pain score ranged from 0-300%. Percentage cry duration ranged
      from 0-100%. Visual analogue scale pain scores were rated
      with a 10 cm pain ruler. The revised infant temperament
      questionnaire records the relative frequency with which
      infants exhibit particular responses to specified situations,
      such as feeding or bathing. Nine temperament characteristics
      were derived from the questionnaire. The revised infant
      temperament questionnaire has favourable psychometric
      properties; internal consistency and test-retest reliability
      coefficients are reported to be 0.83 and 0.86,
      respectively.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> As well as
      being scored for the nine different categories, infants were
      assigned an overall temperament rating of easy (1),
      intermediate-low (2), slow to warm up (3), intermediate-high
      (4), or difficult (5). The numerical scores were used for
      ease of analysis. On the day of vaccination, parents were
      asked questions about their infant's last feeding and nap
      times, ingestion of paracetamol for vaccination-fever
      prophylaxis, and previous painful experiences. Information on
      birth characteristics and previous vaccinations was obtained
      from the infant's medical records. Socioeconomic status was
      scored by the Blishen scale<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>
      based on maternal occupation.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We based
      the calculation of necessary sample size on the difference in
      pain scores between circumcised and uncircumcised infants
      observed in our initial study of vaccination pain
      responses,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> in which the mean
      visual analogue scale pain score (unpublished) was 4.6 cm in
      the circumcised group and 2.7 cm in the uncircumcised group,
      and the SD was about 2.5 cm. Setting an alpha of 0.05 and
      beta of 0.2, and to account for possible drop-outs such as
      parents who refused to let their children participate, those
      lost to follow-up, or those who could not be included for
      reasons arising after initial contact, we estimated that
      about 30 infants per group were needed.<sup><a

      percentage cry duration, and visual analogue scale pain
      scores among the groups, by multivariate ANOVA. Univariate,
      one-way ANOVAs were carried out only if the multvariate ANOVA
      was significant (p&lt;0.05). The pattern of significant
      differences between pairs of means was examined by post-hoc

      establish the significance of the rank order among the
      groups, with the expectation that the Emla-treated group
      would have a pain response intermediate to those of the other
      groups. Demographic characteristics were compared among
      groups by ANOVA or chi-squared test, as appropriate.
      Temperament scores were analysed by multivariate ANOVA. The
      strength of linear relations between pain measures and infant
      variables was assessed by the Pearson or Spearman correlation

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
      were no significant differences among the three groups in any
      demographic characteristics at the time of vaccination (table
      2). Infant temperament was similar in all groups
      (multivariate ANOVA main group effect; p=0.20); (table 3), as
      were birth characteristics (table 4). 64 clinics took part in
      the study. Five (6%) infants were held by a parent during
      vaccination, and 76 (87%) were vaccinated with a 25-guage
      needle. Eight infants were pretreated with Emla for
      circumcision pain openly in the clinical trial from which
      they were recruited.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multivariate ANOVA
      revealed a significant group effect for difference in pain
      scores (p&lt;0.001). Univariate ANOVAs (figure) showed
      significant group effects for percentage facial action
      (p=0.04), percentage cry duration (p=0.01), and visual
      analogue pain scores (p=0.02). Post-hoc analysis showed that
      the group circumcised with placebo had higher difference
      scores (p&lt;0.05) than the uncircumcised group for
      percentage facial action (136.9 vs 77.5%), percentage cry
      duration (53.8 vs 24.7%), and visual analogue scale pain
      scores (5.1 vs 3.1 cm). In addition, visual analogue scale
      pain scores were significantly higher in infants circumcised
      with placebo than in those circumcised with Emla (5.1 vs 3.3
      cm; p&lt;0.05). There was a significant linear trend
      (p&lt;0.05) in all three outcome measures, with scores
      increasing from the uncircumcised to the circumcised with
      placebo group.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main
      results were similar when the analysis was repeated by
      univariate ANCOVAs with vaccination pain score as the outcome
      and baseline value as the covariate.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Characteristics of the
      infants, such as age, weight, temperament, ingestion of
      paracetamol, time of last feeding, and time of last sleep
      before vaccination, did not correlate significantly with the
      pain response (table 5).</p>

      <p class="text"><font
      face="arial"><b>Discussion</b></font><br />
       <span class="yellow">This study showed that neonatal
      circumcision in male infants is associated with increased
      pain response in vaccination 4-6 months after surgery. The
      results support our previous finding of a higher pain
      response in circumcised than uncircumcised male infants
      during routine vaccination.</span><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
      postulate that circumcision may induce long-lasting changes
      in infant pain behaviour because of alterations in the
      infant's central neural processing of painful stimuli.
      Transmission of noxious afferent input from the periphery
      (eg, brought about by skin incision) to the spinal cord
      induces a sustained state of central neural sensitisation or
      hyperexcitability that amplifies subsequent input from the
      wound and leads to increased postoperative pain. The specific
      mechanisms by which noxious peripheral stimulation induces
      long-lasting central neuronal changes are not yet fully
      established, but the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor
      ion-channel complex, excitatory aminoacids (eg, glutamate),
      and C-fibre neuropeptides (eg, substance P) have been
      implicated. Peripheral noxious stimulation leads to the
      release of excitatory aminoacids and neuropeptides in the
      dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of the NMDA
      receptor in dorsal horn neurons produces an increase in
      intracellular calcium and other secondary messengers, which
      stimulate protein kinases and new gene expression.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20,21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      study was designed to investigate whether premedication with
      a topical local anaesthetic for circumcision pain would
      attenuate the pain response to vaccination several months
      later in circumcised infants. We postulated that Emla would
      at least partially block nociceptive afferent input
      originating from the surgical site at the time of
      circumcision and, therefore, any long-lasting consequences of
      this input on the central nervous system. <span
      class="yellow">The results of this study do not entirely
      support this hypothesis.</span> Differences in vaccination
      pain response between infants pretreated with Emla and those
      given no anaesthesia for circumcision pain were seen for
      visual analogue scale pain scores, but not for facial action
      and cry duration. However, there was no significant trend for
      Emla-treated infants to have an intermediate pain response
      across all three measures of pain (figure). Although primary
      afferent injury discharge and subsequent noxious
      perioperative events contribute to enhanced postoperative
      pain,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> other factors, such as
      postoperative inflammatory inputs, may also induce a state of
      central sensitisation.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup>
      Insufficient afferent blockade during circumcision and in the
      days that follow surgery may have contributed to central
      sensitisation in both treated and untreated circumcision
      groups. Study of the vaccination pain response of infants who
      had received more effective circumcision pain management (ie,
      dorsal penile nerve block and adequate postoperative pain
      management) would be interesting.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
      vaccination pain response displayed by the infants
      circumcised without analgesia was higher than the
      uncircumcised infants, this response may not be specific only
      to pain. The site of injury during vaccination differed from
      that during circumcision. In addition, vaccination pain
      measured by facial action and cry duration did not differ
      significantly between infants circumcised with or without
      Emla. Although postsurgical central sensitisation (allodynia
      and hyperalgesia) can extend to sites of the body distal from
      the wound,<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> suggesting a
      supraspinal effect, the long-term consequences of surgery
      done without anaesthesia are likely to include post-traumatic
      stress as well as pain.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">It is, therefore, possible that the greater
      vaccination response in the infants circumcised without
      anaesthesia may represent an infant analogue of a <a
      href="/library/psych/ptsd2/">post-traumatic stress
      disorder</a> triggered by a traumatic and painful event and
      re-experienced under similar circumstances of pain during

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors
      other than circumcision may account for the observed
      differences in pain response. For example, there may be
      differences in genetic attributes, socioeconomic status, and
      parent-infant interactions between people who have their sons
      circumcised and those who do not. However, race and
      socioeconomic status did not differ between groups in this
      study and there were no observable qualitative differences in
      the way parents interacted with their infants during the
      vaccination.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another
      possible explanation is that parents of infants who have
      undergone painful surgical procedures such as circumcision
      begin to interact differently with their infants compared
      with parents whose infants have not undergone such
      procedures. Parents' patterns of behavioural reinforcement
      may develop so that by the age of 4 or 6 months, circumcised
      infants may display a heightened pain response to
      vaccination. Infant temperament was measured to discern
      differences among groups due to effects of the infants'
      personalities. However, the revised infant temperament
      questionnaire did not show any differences in infant
      behaviour among the groups.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep
      potential bias during data collection to a minimum, we
      standardised the infants' position before vaccination.
      Second, we waited for infants to calm down if they were
      unsettled by the physical examination. Third, each infant was
      videotaped in his own primary physician's clinic. Finally,
      videotapes were coded by a research assistant who was not
      aware of the status of infants in each treatment group or the
      purpose of the study.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
      other investigators have studied the long-term effects of
      untreated pain in newborn infants. Fitzgerald and
      colleagues<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> showed that
      repeated heel lancing may induce a state of hyper-sensitivity
      in pain response, and that this atypical response can be
      prevented by pretreatment with Emla. Grunau and
      colleagues<sup><a href="#n27">27,28</a></sup> found that
      children born prematurely have a tendency to somatise and
      interpret pictures of pain-producing situations differently
      from other children. Finally, long stays in hospital and
      repeated medical procedures in the perinatal period have been
      proposed as factors affecting long-term cognitive and motor
      deficits seen in low-birthweight infants.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29,30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">The results of this study are consistent with
      studies of pain response in animals and behavioural studies
      in humans showing that injury and tissue damage sustained in
      infancy can cause sustained changes in central neural
      function, which persist after the wound has healed and
      influence behavioural responses to painful events months
      later. Pretreatment and postoperative management of neonatal
      circumcision pain is recommended based on these results.
      Investigation of the neurological basis of these effects is
      warranted.</span></p>
