      <a id="vanhowe" name="vanhowe"></a> <b>Neonatal
      circumcision</b> 

      <p class="text1">Sir&mdash;Taddio and colleagues (March 1, p
      599)<sup>1</sup> clearly demonstrate that neonatal
      circumcision has a long-term psychological impact on the
      developing neonate, leaving circumcised boys with symptoms
      similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.<sup>2</sup> The
      results of their preliminary study<sup>3</sup> prompted
      several international organisations, such as the <a
      href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons</a>, to condemn neonatal circumcision,
      and their new study validates this condemnation. On the basis
      of their preliminary findings, Taddio et al recommended
      anaesthetic for neonatal circumcision; however, their latest
      study has failed to support their hypothesis that topical
      anaesthetic would protect boys from the effect of
      circumcision on later response to painful situations, which
      is not surprising.</p>

      <p class="text1">In their recent review of published work,
      Puthoff and colleagues<sup>4</sup> concluded that
      lidocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) has been shown to be
      neither a safe nor an effective anaesthetic for neonatal
      circumcision. On the basis of present information EMLA cannot
      be recommended for this procedure. When Taddio and colleagues
      recommended the use of local anaesthetic in their preliminary
      study, several workers responded to the editor that a
      recommendation against neonatal circumcision would have been
      more appropriate.<sup>5</sup> After this recent study, Taddio
      et al recommend "pretreatment and postoperative management of
      neonatal circumcision pain"<sup>1</sup> which is laudable.
      However, now that other confounding factors have been
      controlled for and it is clear that neonatal circumcision
      either with or without anaesthetic "may induce long-lasting
      changes in infant pain behaviour because of alterations in
      the infant's central neural processing of painful stimuli",
      what prevents them from denouncing a procedure with no
      clearly proven medical benefit?</p>

      <p class="text1">Sir&mdash;Taddio and colleagues<sup>1</sup>
      recommend pretreatment with EMLA in circumcision. All newborn
      babies encounter painful experiences before birth, during
      delivery, and during the first week of life.<sup>2</sup>
      Painful events such as intramuscular vitamin K administration
      and the Guthrie test are routinely done without analgesia
      during the first week of life. Furthermore, infants requiring
      intensive care may receive a multitude of small yet painful
      stimuli. We investigated the pain response to antecubital
      venepuncture in 25 sedated newborn infants to evaluate
      whether pretreatment with lidocaine/prilocaine 5% cream
      (EMLA, Astra) alters the pain response.</p>

      <p class="text1">All 25 babies were in our intensive care
      unit and were mechanically ventilated with a Siemens 300
      ventilator in pressure-regulated volume control mode. None of
      the 25 infants had evidence of brain damage. Stable
      haemodynamic and ventilatory conditions together with the
      absence of recent (&lt;12 h) painful procedure was a
      prerequisite for inclusion in the study. Sedation was
      achieved by continous administration of midazolam (006 mg kg1
      h1; Roche). The strength of the pain response to the
      venepuncture was measured with the Comfort score,<sup>3</sup>
      which can be used to assess distress during painful or
      distressing procedures in ventilated patients.</p>

      <p class="text1">12 babies (32 [SD 11] weeks) were pretreated
      with EMLA and 13 (30 [13]) with placebo cream. The cream was
      applied 90 minutes before venepuncture. In infants pretreated
      with EMLA Comfort score evaluation before and after
      venepuncture did not differ. In the placebo-group, however, a
      significant increase in Comfort score (256 [72] vs 327 [22],
      p&lt;005 unpaired t-test) after venepuncture was seen.
      Moreover, Comfort score values required several hours (42
      [31] h) to return to baseline values. The protective effect
      of EMLA cream on painful cutaneous procedures in newborn
      babies is supported by our data, despite the concomitant use
      of sedative drugs.</p>

      <p class="text1">Sir&mdash;We commend Taddio and
      colleagues<sup>1</sup> on the intention of their study. As
      primary care physicians we should be ever vigilant for the
      comfort of our patients, and any effort we can make to
      identify and alleviate suffering will always be of benefit.
      However, when such a study is undertaken it is imperative
      that the conclusions be generalisable to most populations. In
      our particular hospital we do about 500 neonatal
      circumcisions per year. Dorsal penile nerve blockade with 1%
      lidocaine without epinephrine is the exclusive method, and
      anaesthetic agent is used in most of these patients. EMLA is
      occasionally used on our paediatric ward for phlebotomy and
      insertion of intravenous lines with only fair success.</p>

      <p class="text1">Taddio and co-workers chose to use EMLA for
      anaesthesia, rather than the more effective dorsal penile
      nerve block, but note in their discussion: "study of the
      vaccination pain response of infants who had received more
      effective circumcision pain management (ie, dorsal penile
      nerve block and adequate postoperative pain management) would
      be interesting".<sup>1</sup> Use of a gold standard for
      anaesthesia in this setting would have made their conclusions
      more convincing. The intention of this study was noble and
      will certainly help primary care physicians understand and
      better treat pain in all our patients. However, until proper
      study of dorsal penile nerve block is undertaken, evaluation
      of subsequent pain response cannot be adequately
      examined.</p>

      <p class="text1">Sir&mdash;After reading Taddio and
      colleagues' report<sup>1</sup> two issues remain unresolved.
      First, why did the research ethics board of the Hospital for
      Sick Children and Women's College Hospital approve painful,
      elective surgery on infants without anaesthesia? If this
      experimental protocol had been proposed in research animals,
      the arm of the study without anaesthesia would have been
      disallowed. When parents and patients discover that your
      institution is undertaking painful experiments on infants
      without anaesthesia that would not be allowed in animal
      research, would they come to distrust your institution in the
      manner that many African-American males distrust research
      protocols since the Tuskeegee Syphilis Study was
      published?<sup>2</sup> As physicians, we should "first do no
      harm". If we agree that useless pain may have long-term
      negative effects, then painful, elective surgery should not
      be allowed without adequate anaesthesia.</p>

      <p class="text1">Second, since parental consent may not be
      adequate for painful, unanaesthetised, cosmetic surgery on
      infants,<sup>3-5</sup> I suggest that circumcisions be done
      on consenting adults. Adults could describe the pain
      associated with unanaesthetised circumcision and, therefore,
      the pain assessment would be less inferential. Although the
      pain assessment in an adult study would be less abstract, I
      fear volunteers would be hard to find.</p>
