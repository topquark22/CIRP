      <p>[Abstract]</p>

      <p><b>Objective.</b> We conducted a national survey of
      pediatric, family practice, and obstetrics and gynecology
      residency program directors to determine the curriculum
      content and predominant practices in US training programs
      with regard to neonatal circumcision and anesthesia/analgesia
      for the procedure.</p>

      <p><b>Methods.</b> Residency directors of accredited programs
      were surveyed in two mailings of a forced response and short
      answer survey (response rate: 680/914, 74%; pediatrics 83%;
      family practice 72%; obstetrics 71%).</p>

      <p><b>Results.</b> Pediatric residents were less likely than
      family practice [odds ratio (OR), 0.04; 95% confidence
      interval (CI), 0.02-0.08] or obstetrical (OR, 0.14; 95% CI,
      0.08-0.23) residents to be taught circumcision. Training and
      local custom were rated as important determinants of medical
      responsibility for neonatal circumcision. Pediatric residents
      training in programs in which community pediatricians perform
      circumcisions were more likely to learn circumcision (OR,
      39.0; 95% CI, 14.3-110.6) as were obstetric residents (OR,
      79.0; 95% CI, 22.4-306.4) training in programs in which
      community obstetricians perform circumcision. In programs
      that teach circumcision, pediatric (84%; OR, 3.4; 95% CI,
      1.7-7.1) and family practice (80%; OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.2)
      programs were more likely than obstetric programs (60%) to
      teach analgesia/anesthesia techniques to relieve procedural
      pain. Overall, 26% of programs that taught circumcision
      failed to provide instruction in anesthesia/analgesia for the
      procedure. Significant regional variations in training in
      circumcision and analgesia/anesthesia techniques were noted
      within and across medical specialties.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions.</b> Residency training standards are not
      consistent for pediatric, family practice, and obstetrical
      residents with regard to neonatal circumcision or instruction
      in analgesia/anesthesia for the procedure. Training with
      regard to pain relief is clearly inadequate for what remains
      a common surgical procedure in the United States. Given the
      overwhelming evidence that neonatal circumcision is painful
      and the existence of safe and effective anesthesia/analgesia
      methods, residency training in neonatal circumcision should
      include instruction in pain relief techniques.</p>

      <p>Key words: neonatal circumcision, resident training.</p>
