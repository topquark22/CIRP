        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

        <p class="text2">Blood samples were obtained from 40
        full-term infants on the third day of life in conjunction
        with the blood obtained for routine screening for
        phenylketonuria. The behavioral states of the infants were
        observed during the half hour preceding the blood sample.
        Low cortisol levels were found to be associated with the
        sleep state and high levels with a period of fussiness or
        crying with little overlap between the two groups. No
        systematic relationship was found between cortisol and
        other parameters examined&mdash;sex, birthweight,
        birthweight for gestational age, recency of circumcision,
        or Apgar scores. One exception was that the infant whose
        Apgar score indicated fetal distress had an extremely high
        level of cortisol.</p>

        <p class="text2">In three normal infants an attempt was
        made to examine the relationship between plasma cortisol
        and the varying levels of chronic irritability which
        commonly occur during the first three months of life. The
        infants were observed in their homes for an hour during
        which developmental tests were administered, the mother was
        interviewed, and a blood sample was obtained. Plasma
        cortisol levels were found to vary with ratings of
        behavioral state at the time the blood sample was taken.
        Cortisol levels were independent of chronic fussiness
        ratings in two cases but weer highly correlated (+0.78) in
        the third case. This high correlation was discounted
        because of the apparent overriding influence of immediate
        state.</p>

        <p class="text2">The need for further investigation of the
        developmental course of the interrelationship between
        psychological factors and cortisol response is
        discussed.</p>
