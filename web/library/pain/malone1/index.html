      size="2">Two experiments were conducted on human neonates
      examining their behavior and adrenocortical activity in
      response to physical restraint. In both experiments, newborns
      (9 per condition in Experiment I; 10 per condition in
      experiment II) were tested in one of three conditions:
      Restraint, which involved strapping newborns to a
      circumstraint board for 20 min; Strapping Control, which
      involved stapping newborns to the board and then immediately
      taking them off the board and returning them to their cribs;
      and Control, which did not involve any restraining
      manipulation. In experiment 1, blood saamples for plasma
      cortisol determination were obtained via heel-stick
      immediately prior to the assigned manipulations and 30 min
      later. In Experiment II, only the postmanipulation blood
      sample was taken. Two behavioral states, Active Awake and
      Crying, were examined as indices of behavioral distress. In
      Experiment I, the effects of the blood sampling procedure on
      behavioral distress and plasma cortisol were significant;
      however, <span class="yellow">no significant effects of
      restraint were observed.</span> In Experiment II, restraint
      was associated with small but significant increases in
      behavioral distress and in plasma cortisol levels.</font></p>
