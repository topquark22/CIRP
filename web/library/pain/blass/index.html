      <h2>Sucrose as an analgesic for newborn infants</h2>

      <p><b>EM Blass and LB Hoffmeyer</b></p>

      Baltimore, Maryland.</p>

      <p>[Abstract]</p>

      <p>The effectiveness of sucrose as an analgesic agent for
      newborn infants was assessed during two standard painful
      hospital procedures: blood collection via heel lance and
      circumcision. Infants who drank 2 mL of a 12% sucrose
      solution prior to blood collection cried 50% less during the
      blood collection procedure than did control infants who had
      received 2 mL of sterile water. Crying of infants who
      ingested sucrose returned to baseline levels within 30 to 60
      seconds after blood collection whereas control infants
      required 2.5 to 3.0 minutes to return to baseline. Like
      findings were obtained for infants who received sucrose on a
      pacifier prior to and during circumcision. Specifically,
      control infants who underwent a standard circumcision
      procedure without intervention cried 67% of the time. A
      water-moistened pacifier reduced crying to 49% (P less than
      .01). Crying was reduced further to 31% (P less than .05) by
      providing infants with a sucrose-flavored pacifier to suck.
      These findings, which parallel results obtained in studies of
      pain in infant rats, provide a potent yet simple, benign
      intervention to help alleviate stress and pain routinely
      experienced by human infants.</p>
