      <p>Investigators<sup><a href="#n1">1-5</a></sup> who have
      correlated Pao<sub>2</sub> with transcutaneous Po<sub>2</sub>
      (tcPo<sub>2</sub>) have obtained blood samples from
      indwelling arterial lines because of concern that the pain of
      an arterial puncture may disturb oxygenation. To further
      define the effect of pain on tcPo2, normal male infants were
      monitored during circumcision. Simultaneous monitoring of the
      tcPo2 over the right upper side of the chest and left lower
      part of the abdomen enabled us to evaluate the possibility of
      right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus during
      the procedure of circumcision.</p>

      <center>
        <font face="arial"><b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</b></font>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten healthy male
      infants were circumcised at 48 to 72 hours of age after
      obtaining informed consent from the parents. All were born at
      term with one-minute Apgar scores greater than 7 and a mean
      birth weight of 3,350 g. Neither heart murmurs nor abnormal
      femoral artery pulses were detected immediately prior to
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure
      consisted of the following: about five minutes of cleaning
      the penis with povidone-iodine (Betadine) solution; adhesion
      lysis between glans and foreskin; dorsal foreskin clamping
      with forceps for two to four minutes followed by forceps
      removal and division of the crushed skin. A bloodless
      circumcision clamp (Gomco) was applied for five minutes
      before the foreskin was amputated. To discern the effect for
      each of the four painful manipulations, the interval from
      adhesion lysis to circumcision clamp removal was extended to
      20 minutes.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the study,
      a radiant overhead warmer was used to maintain the abdominal
      skin temperature at 36.0&deg;C. A nipple was offered for
      nonnutritive sucking. The period of continuous monitoring
      included at least 20 minutes before and after the
      circumcision. Transcutaneous oxygen electrodes (TCM1
      Radiometer) were affixed below the right clavicle and to the
      left of the umbilicus. Both electrodes were thermally
      insulated with expanded rigid polystyrene plastic caps so
      that the electrode heat consumption served as an indirect
      measure of local blood flow.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      Respiratory and heart rates were monitored with vital signs
      modules. All parameters were recorded continuously on a
      potentiometric recorder. The tcPo<sub>2</sub> electrodes were
      interchanged at the end of the monitoring periods to help
      separate instrumentation from physiologic differences.
      Average values were obtained from planimetry of the
      tracings.<sup><a href="#n">7</a></sup> Statistical
      comparisions used two-tailed <i>&tau;</i> testing.</p>

        <font face="arial"><b>RESULTS</b></font>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the studies
      demonstrated close concordance between the tcPo<sub>2</sub>
      tracings from the chest and abdomen (Fig 1). None of the
      infants showed a significant difference between chest and
      abdominal tcPo<sub>2</sub> during the quiet or crying
      intervals. Both tcPo<sub>2</sub> tracings decreased with pain
      and remained at a lower level until crying ceased. During
      brief respites from crying, the tcPo<sub>2</sub> was often
      exceeded.</p>

      for foreskin clamping, 13 mm Hg for circumcision clamp
      application, and 19 mm Hg for circumcision clamp removal. The
      negligible response to foreskin clamping probably reflects
      the absence of a quiet interval before this event in contrast
      to adhesion lysis and circumcision clamp removal, both of
      which followed manipulation-free intervals of five or more
      minutes, and circumcision clamp application, which was
      preceded by variable freedom from stimulation. The average
      postevent tcPo<sub>2</sub> for each of the four manipulations
      was not significantly different than that for any of the
      other three.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision in
      neonates has been shown to affect adrenal cortical
      functions,<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> immediate
      postoperative behavior and possibly long-term
      behavior.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The present study
      demonstrates that circumcision also affects the heart rate,
      respiratory rate, and tcPo2 both during and immediately after
      the procedure. The observed decrease in tcPo2 with pain might
      result from momentary decreases in alveolar ventilation
      during crying. Right-to-left shunting at the atrial level,
      with crying, as shown by Lind et al<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> during the first two weeks of life,
      is also a possible explanation. The close concordance of
      chest and abdominal tcPo<sub>2</sub> indicates that despite
      vigorous crying right-to-left shunting through the ductus
      arteriosus did not occur in our sample of 2- to 3-day-old,
      term male infants. The absence of hypoxic symptoms in this
      group of term infants is in accord with our prediction that
      healthy infants should not be compromised by a transient
      decrease of 20 mm Hg in tcPo<sub>2</sub>.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 10 mm Hg decrease
      in mean tcPo<sub>2</sub> after the circumcision could reflect
      increased minute ventilation in lungs fully expanded from
      recent crying. Although Martin et al<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> have also observed meant
      tcPo<sub>2</sub> less than 80 mm Hg in healthy infants, it is
      possible that an allowance should be made for the thicker
      skin of term infants since the electrode temperature of
      44&deg;C and the warm-up period of 20 minutes were based on
      correlation (<i>r</i> =.95) between the tcPo<sub>2</sub> and
      Pao<sub>2</sub> in premature infants.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The response to pain
      by each individual infant was surprisingly consistent. That
      is, some infants had abrupt decreases in tcPo<sub>2</sub> and
      increases in heart and respiratory rates with each of the
      painful stimuli while other infants repeatedly had attenuated
      responses. These individual variations in the response to
      pain underline the limited reliability of arterial punctures
      for assessment of resting Pao<sub>2</sub>. Since the
      tcPo<sub>2</sub> often exceeded baseline values after crying
      ceased, there is also the possibility that delay in drawing
      an arterial blood sample could result in obtaining a
      Pao<sub>2</sub> that is greater than the baseline.</p>
