Anesthesia for Neonatal Circumcision:<br>
Local Anesthesia is Better Than Dorsal Penile Nerve Block</h1>

</p>
Several studies document the benefit of dorsal penile nerve block
for neonatal circumcision, but the literature does not address the use
of local anesthesia. A randomized, controlled, prospective study was
conducted to compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block versus
local anesthesia. Thirty infants were randomly divided into three equal
groups (<i>N</i> = 10): an unanesthetized control group, a group given
dorsal penile nerve block, and a group given local anesthesia. Heart
rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and crying were monitored
continuously before, during, and after circumcision. During
circumcision, both the dorsal penile nerve block group and the
local-anesthesia group demonstrated smaller increases in heart rate,
smaller drops in oxygen saturation, and less crying compared with
unanesthetized controls (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). Both techniques worked well
in anesthetizing the dorsal aspect of the penis; however, during those
steps of circumcision involving trauma to the ventral aspect of the
penis, the local-anesthesia group demonstrated smaller increases in
heart rate and less crying compared with infants given dorsal penile
nerve block (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). Cortisol levels measured 30 minutes
postoperatively were lower in the local-anesthesia group than in either
the controls or the dorsal penile nerve block group (<i>P</i> &lt;
.05). Dorsal penile nerve block had no effect on postoperative cortisol
levels. No complications occurred. Although both types of anesthesia
attenuated the physiologic responses to circumcision, local anesthesia
demonstrated greater efficacy than dorsal penile nerve block while being
simpler to perform.

<p>
Clearly, the newborn experiences pain during circumcision. The neural
pathways that relay painful stimuli, the cortical and subcortical
centers that perceive pain, and the required neurotransmitters are all
present and functional before birth <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Neonatal
circumcision produces increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and
plasma cortisol levels and decreases in the transcutaneous partial
pressure of oxygen <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. The
pain of neonatal circumcision has been correlated to changes in crying
patterns evaluated by objective methods (spectrographic and
computer-based analysis) and by subjective interpretation
<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. Increased wakefulness and irritability are
present the first hour after circumcision <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>, and
behavior is altered for more than 22 hours afterward. Use of anesthesia
eliminates these behavioral changes. During the first 2 postoperative
days, the anesthetized infants are more attentive, have better motor
responses, are less irritable, and are more capable of quieting
themselves when disturbed. These behavioral changes imply that neonatal
pain is more than just a reflex response <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.

<p>
In 1978, <A HREF="/library/pain/kirya1/">Kirya and Werthmann</A> <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> introduced the
technique of dorsal penile nerve block for newborn circumcision. The
paired dorsal penile nerves lie in the Buck fascia at the 10- and
2-o'clock positions. The nerves ramify 1 cm distal to the root of the
penis. Also within the Buck fascia, the dorsal penile arteries lie just
medial to the nerves, and in the midline is the deep dorsal penile
vein. The superficial penile vein is located in the midline above the
fascia <a href="#fig1">(Figure 1)</a>. To perform dorsal penile nerve
block, the penile root is identified and a 26-gauge needle is inserted
0.5 cm distal to the root at the 10- and 2-o'clock positions
<a href="#fig2">(Figure 2)</a>. The needle is advanced posteromedially
to a depth of no more than 0.25-0.5 cm, and 0.2-0.4 mL of 1% lidocaine
without epinephrine is injected bilaterally into the subcutaneous
tissue. Before infiltration, it is imperative to aspirate in order to
prevent accidental intravascular injection <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.

<p>
Several studies have documented the effectiveness of dorsal penile nerve
block by parameters such as crying, heart rate, respiratory rate,
transcutaneous oxygen saturation, plasma cortisol levels, and subjective
analysis <a href="#ref6"">[6-9]</a>. The literature does not address the
use of simple local infiltration for neonatal circumcision.  This study
was undertaken to compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block and
local anesthesia by objective parameters: heart rate, transcutaneous
oxygen saturation, the presence or absence of crying, and postoperative
plasma cortisol levels.

<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>
All healthy male newborns with no contraindication to circumcision
were eligible candidates. Approval for this study was obtained from the
Institutional Review Board of the University of Florida Health Science
Center, Jacksonville. Informed written consent was obtained from the
infant's mother. No additional charges were incurred by entry into the
study. A total of 30 infants were randomly assigned to three groups
(<i>N</i> = 10): an unanesthetized control group, a group given dorsal
penile nerve block, and a local-anesthesia group. All three groups were
comparable with regard to birth weight (3433 +- 526 g), race (57% white,
43% black), gestational age by Dubowitz score (39.6 +- 1.4 weeks),
baseline heart rate (126 +- 14 beats per minute), and baseline
transcutaneous oxygen saturation (99 +- l%). The mean age for the
local-anesthesia group (1.9 +- 0.3 days) was older than that for the
controls (1.3 +- 0.5 days) (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The mean age for the
dorsal penile nerve block group (1.5 +- 0.5 days) was similar to that of
the other two groups.

<p>
All infants were fasting for at least 3 hours before circumcision. The
infants were brought to a quiet room, strapped to a circumcision board
(Circumstraint), and wrapped in warm sheets. A cardiac monitor and a
pulse oximeter (Nellcor, Hayward, CA) were applied for continuous
monitoring. The infant was not disturbed for at least 2 minutes in order
to obtain stable baseline measurements. All anesthetic procedures and
circumcisions were performed in an identical manner between 7 and 11 AM
by the principal investigator. Dorsal penile nerve block was
administered as described by Kirya and Werthmann <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.
Using a 26-gauge tuberculin syringe, 0.4 ml of 1% lidocaine without
epinephrine was injected on either side at the 10- and 2-o'clock
positions at the base of the penis. Local anesthesia was performed by
injecting 0.4 ml of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine subcutaneously into
the foreskin at both the 10- and 2-o'clock positions at the level of the
corona <a href="#fig2">(Figure 2)</a>. Circumcision was postponed until
5 minutes after anesthesia. The Gomco clamp (1. 1 cm) was used for
circumcision. Heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and crying
were recorded for the following intervals: during administration of
anesthesia, 5 minutes after administration of anesthesia (5 minutes
after restraint for the controls), during each step of circumcision
(lateral clamping, blunt dissection of the foreskin from the glans,
dorsal clamping and cutting, placement of the bell, and clamping of the
Gomco), immediately after circumcision, and 5 minutes after
circumcision. For each step, the heart rate recorded was the peak heart
rate sustained during or immediately after that step. Oxygen saturation
was recorded as the nadir sustained during or immediately after each
interval. Crying was recorded as present or absent. Crying was defined
to be present if any degree of crying occurred during or after the
procedural interval. Infants were observed for 30 minutes
postoperatively, at which time blood was drawn via heel-stick for plasma
cortisol measurement. The samples were promptly centrifuged and the
plasma was frozen (-20C). Because of improper handling cortisol levels
were not obtainable for the first three infants; this reduced the sample
size to nine for each group. Cortisol levels were measured by
Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories TDx Analyzer,
Chicago, IL). This method has a sensitivity of 0.45 mg/dL. The
inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation are less than 9%
with this method.

<p>

The data for heart rate, oxygen saturation, and cortisol levels were
statistically analyzed using Student <i>t</i> test, with alpha levels
adjusted to control for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni
procedure. The data for crying were analyzed by the

&lt;chi&gt;<sup>2</sup> <i>[Transcriber's note: &lt;chi&gt;-squared]</i>
test using the Bonferroni procedure to control for multiple
comparisons. Differences were considered significant at <i>P</i> &lt;
.05. Values are expressed as the mean +- SD.

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
Administration of both forms of anesthesia immediately caused a moderate
increase in heart rate, a slight drop in oxygen saturation, and crying
in most of the infants. The degree of these responses was similar for
both dorsal penile nerve block and local anesthesia (<i>P</i> &gt;
.05). Five minutes after anesthesia, these parameters returned to
baseline values.

<p>
Throughout the circumcision, the control group demonstrated marked
increases in heart rate. The group given dorsal penile nerve block had
smaller increases in heart rate compared with the control group during
the first four steps of circumcision (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The
local-anesthesia group showed little change in heart rate compared with
controls during every step of circumcision and immediately afterward
(<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The infants given local anesthesia had smaller
increases in heart rate compared with the dorsal penile nerve block
group during three procedural intervals (dissection of the foreskin,
placement of the bell, and clamping of the Gomco) (<i>P</i> &lt;
.05). All three groups returned to baseline heart rate values 5 minutes
after the procedure <a href="#fig3">(Figure 3)</a>.

Oxygen saturation dropped progressively in the unanesthetized controls
as they were being circumcised. Crying and increased intrathoracic
pressure are believed to cause the desaturation. For the first step of
circumcision (lateral clamping), no differences in oxygen saturation
were noted among the three groups.  The dorsal penile nerve block group
had a higher mean oxygen saturation compared with the control group
during the next three steps (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The local-anesthesia
group maintained oxygen saturation levels in comparison with the
controls during each of the last four steps of circumcision (<i>P</i>
&lt; .05). Immediately after and 5 minutes after circumcision, oxygen
saturation was similar for all three groups <a href="#fig4">(Figure

Every unanesthetized infant cried during every step of circumcision.
During dorsal clamping and cutting and immediately post-circumcision,
there were fewer infants crying in the group given dorsal penile nerve
block than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The
local-anesthesia group had four infants (40%) who did not cry at any
time during or after circumcision, in contrast to the control and dorsal
penile nerve block groups, in which every infant cried during part or
all of the procedure (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). For each step of circumcision,
there were fewer infants crying in the local-anesthesia group than in
the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; .05).  Compared with the dorsal penile
nerve block group, there were fewer infants crying in the
local-anesthesia group during three procedural intervals: lateral
clamping, placement of the bell, and clamping of the Gomco (<i>P</i>
&lt; .05) <a href="#tab1">(Table 1)</a>.

<p>
The time necessary to complete the circumcisions was similar for all
groups (7 +- 2 minutes). No complications of any type occurred in any of
the infants studied.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>
In 1987, the <A HREF="/library/pain/aap/">American Academy of Pediatrics</A> stated that anesthesia
should not be withheld from neonates solely because of the infant's age
or perceived degree of cortical maturity <a href="#ref10">[10]</a>.
Physicians still may be reluctant to use anesthesia for the circumcision
of newborns because of concerns regarding efficacy and safety.  Numerous
studies have described the benefits of dorsal penile nerve block
<a href="#ref5"">[5-9]</a>, <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>, but no alternatives
to regional block are described in the literature.

<p>
The unanesthetized infants demonstrated marked physiologic responses to
circumcision: crying, tachycardia, lowered oxygen saturations, and
elevated cortisol levels. Both dorsal penile nerve block and local
anesthesia modified these changes. As in previous studies, dorsal penile
nerve block blunted changes in heart rate, oxygen saturation, and crying
<a href="#ref6">[6-9]</a>. Postoperative cortisol levels were similar in
the dorsal penile nerve block group (19.9 +- 4.4 mg/dL) and the control
group (19.3 +- 7.6 mg/dL). Williamson and Evans <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>
also found that dorsal penile nerve block had no effect on cortisol
levels 30 minutes post-circumcision: Unanesthetized infants and infants
given dorsal penile nerve block had identical levels (22.9 mg/dL). In a
similar study, Stang et al <a href="#ref9">[9]</a> showed lower cortisol
levels 30 minutes postoperatively in infants given dorsal penile nerve
block (14.0 mg/dL) than in infants given a saline injection (19.3
mg/dL), but again no difference was noted between infants given dorsal
penile nerve block and unanesthetized controls (16.7 mg/dL). Stang's
group demonstrated lower cortisol levels 90 minutes after circumcision
in infants given dorsal penile nerve block compared with unanesthetized
controls, but at this point there was no longer a difference between
those given dorsal penile nerve block and those given saline.

<p>
In this study, infants given local anesthesia had lower plasma cortisol
levels 30 minutes after circumcision (11.4 +- 5.4 mg/dL) compared with
both the control group and the group given dorsal penile nerve block
(<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The local-anesthesia group was older (1.9 +- 0.3
days) than the control group (1.3 +- 0.5 days). It was postulated that
this might have influenced the cortisol data; however, when this
parameter was analyzed independently, it was found to have no effect on
cortisol levels.

<p>
Local anesthesia prevented crying and tachycardia more consistently than
dorsal penile nerve block during those steps of circumcision involving
ventral trauma. This suggests that dorsal penile nerve block was less
effective at anesthetizing the ventral aspect of the penis. Incomplete
anesthesia may have been a result of technical difficulty in performing
dorsal penile nerve block. Deeper injection into the Buck fascia may
have produced a better block; however, because of the proximity of the
dorsal vessels, bleeding complications would have been more likely to
occur.

<p>
In reviewing the literature on dorsal penile nerve block for neonates, I
have found only two minor complications: bleeding and hematoma, both
secondary to penetration of the superficial penile vein
<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>, <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. Sara and Lowry
<a href="#ref13">[13]</a> have reported two cases of gangrene of the
glans following circumcision using dorsal penile nerve block in a
13-month-old and a 3-year-old. The authors postulated that trauma to the
dorsal vessels caused bleeding into the restricted space between the
Buck fascia and the corpora cavernosa, resulting in tamponade of the
dorsal arteries and subsequent ischemia. Using the local-anesthesia
technique, the anesthetic is injected away from any major vessels and
consequently would be less likely to result in bleeding or intravascular
injection. The amount of lidocaine necessary to anesthetize the newborn
penis has been shown to be well below toxic levels
<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>.

<p>
Though both dorsal penile nerve block and local anesthesia are capable
of attenuating the physiologic responses to circumcision, local
anesthesia was more effective at preventing crying, tachycardia, and
release of cortisol by the adrenals. Local anesthesia is also a simpler
technique and is theoretically less likely to result in serious
complications.
