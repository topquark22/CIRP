<P>
<B>Background.</B> Previous reports have suggested that healthy, full-term 
newborn infants who are in more aroused behavioral states tend to 
respond more robustly to painful events. Others have shown that acutely 
ill premature and full-term infants who undergo significant handling and 
immobilization as part of required nursery procedures respond less 
robustly to concurrent painful events. 
<P>
<B>Purpose.</B> To investigate, using an experimental manipulation, the effect 
of arousal associated with handling and immobilization on response to 
acute pain in generally healthy, premature and full-term newborn 
infants. 
<P>
<B>Methods.</B> Infants were randomly assigned to a group that underwent a 
series of handling and immobilization procedures before a heelstick or 
to a group that underwent the heelstick without previous handling and 
immobilization. Heart rate, behavioral state, and facial activity were 
compared between the handled (n = 21) and nonhandled (n = 27) infants 
during an undisturbed baseline, a preparatory, and a standard heelstick 
procedure. 
<P>
<B>Results.</B> In the handled group, heart rate increased over baseline 
levels in response to the handling but promptly returned to prehandling 
levels. There were no significant differences between handled and 
nonhandled groups in mean heart rate, behavioral state, or facial 
activity during the baseline or preparatory periods before the 
heelstick. However, in response to the heelstick, handled infants had a 
higher mean heart rate, greater behavioral arousal, and displayed more 
facial activity as compared with nonhandled infants. 
<P>
<B>Conclusions.</B> Healthy premature and full-term newborn infants who 
undergo common nursery experiences such as handling and immobilization 
as part of their routine care can exhibit greater physiologic and 
behavioral reactivity to subsequent painful procedures. The effects of 
the previous handling may be undetectable, using conventional indices of 
reactivity, until the painful event. These findings emphasize the 
importance of identifying reliable markers of previous stress, 
particularly for newborn infants who may become clinically compromised 
as a result of the physiologic instability associated with response to 
pain. Key words: pain, newborn infant, heelstick, handling, 
immobilization.
