            <h4>Abstract</h4>

            <p>The aim of this basic observational study was to
            initiate development of a reliable ethogram of neonatal
            distress-related pain behavior. The videotapes of 10
            full-term male newborns were observed repeatedly and
            systematically to inductively generate an exhaustive
            and structured listing of behavior. All 10 neonates
            were 72 hours of age or less, and all underwent the
            same distress-inducing events associated with newborn
            male circumcision. The reliably established ethogram
            contained 235 molecular and molar items for describing
            variation in neonatal motor movement, body postures,
            responsiveness, self-comfort, respiration, and
            vocalization. Also included were items for describing
            three distress-provoking stimuli: ambient sound,
            procedure-related stimuli, and innate responses made by
            the neonates. Novel descriptions contained in the
            ethogram extend knowledge of how neonates respond
            behaviorally to pain and non-pain situations. In
            combination with existing knowledge, they provide the
            descriptive prerequisites needed to distinguish newborn
            pain and the basis for further investigating important
            but poorly understood topics, such as newborn ability
            to self-organize or recover from significant exposure
            to pain and stress.</p>
