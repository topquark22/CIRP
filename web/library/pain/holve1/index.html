      <h2>Regional anesthesia during newborn circumcision. Effect
      on infant pain response.</h2>

      <p><b>Holve RL, Bromberger PJ, Groveman HD, Klauber MR, Dixon
      SD, Snyder JM.</b></p>

      <p>A controlled, double-blind investigation was undertaken to
      determine whether regional anesthesia by dorsal penile nerve
      block (DPNB) could effectively minimize the pain and
      behavioral disruptions usually associated with newborn
      circumcision. Fifteen infants had DPNB with lidocaine, eight
      control infants had DPNB with saline, and eight additional
      control infants were circumcised without undergoing DPNB.
      Newborn distress was gauged by subjective observation,
      measurement of heart rate, and the percent of time spent
      crying in six sequential timed intervals during circumcision.
      Ninety-three percent of subjects who received lidocaine were
      observed to have a decrease in agitation after anesthetic
      administration. The mean increase in heart rate during
      circumcision was at least 50 percent less in the lidocaine
      injected group than in either control group (p less than
      0.01). Infants who had DPNB with lidocaine cried 50 percent
      less during circumcision compared to combined controls (p
      less than 0.01). DPNB was easily administered, and there were
      no significant complications. Physicians who circumcise
      newborns have good reason to employ the technique of dorsal
      penile nerve block with lidocaine to minimize infant pain and
      distress.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This study reflects that DPNB
      reduces but does <i>NOT</i> eliminate the pain, stress, and
      trauma of neonatal circumcision in most but <i>NOT</i> all
      infants.]</p>
