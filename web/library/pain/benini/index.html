      <hr />

      <p><b>Objective</b><br />
       To determine the efficacy of topical anesthetic cream,
      eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA), in alleviating
      pain from neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Design</b><br />
       Randomized, controlled trial.</p>

      <p><b>Setting</b><br />
       Normal newborn nursery in a university teaching
      hospital.</p>

      <p><b>Patients</b><br />
       Twenty-seven newborn, full-term male neonates, aged 1 to 3
      days.</p>

      <p><b>Outcome measures</b><br />
       Heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, facial
      activity and crying.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b><br />
       Compared with baseline, all newborns experienced pain as
      evidenced by increased heart rate of an average of 40 beats
      per minute (F[8, 25]=14.12; <i>P</i>&lt;.0001) decreased
      oxygen saturation of 3% (F[8, 25]=15.02; <i>P</i>&lt;.0001),
      and more facial actions indicative of pain (F[8, 25]=5.25;
      <i>P</i>&lt;.002) during all phases of the procedure.
      Compared with placebo, EMLA significantly attenuated the pain
      response as shown by lower heart rate of an average of 25
      beats per minute (F[1, 25]=14.92; <i>P</i>&lt;.001), higher
      oxygen saturation of 5%, particularly during the clamping and
      lysis phases (F [1, 25]=19.83; <i>P</i>&lt;.0001), 20% less
      facial activity (F[1, 25]=12.01; <i>P</i>&lt;.002), and 15%
      less crying during the clamping, Gomco clamp application, and
      incision of the foreskin. There were no differences between
      groups in the spectral crying parameters.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b><br />
       Circumcision procedure produces pain responses that EMLA
      diminishes. Thus, EMLA may be a useful agent for pain
      management in neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p align="right">(<cite>JAMA</cite>. 1993;270:850-853)</p>
      <hr />

      <p class="text2">Circumcision on male neonates without
      benefit of anesthesia or analgesia is common practice<sup><a
      href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. Disregard of pain experienced by
      infants during this procedure almost never occurs in older
      children or adults. The belief that pain is not experienced
      in the same way by infants, or that it is inconsequential,
      continues to pervade pediatric practice despite data that
      infants do experience pain with at least short-term
      significant sequelae. Some of the most compelling data
      reflect a stress response to more intense pain that affects
      physiological stability<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>,
      morbidity<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>, and
      behavior<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a
      href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Local anesthetics have been used for the
      circumcision procedure. Several reports of dorsal penile
      nerve block with lidocaine have indicated that they are
      effective in decreasing crying, diminishing heart rate
      increases and oxygen saturation decreases <sup><a
      href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>, and
      diminishing the increases in serum cortisol levels<sup><a
      href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. One study <sup><a
      href="#ref9">9</a></sup> did not find a difference in serum
      cortisol levels between infants who had received the penile
      block and those who had not. In a randomized double-blind
      study<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>, newborns who
      received a mixture of topical 4% lidocaine mixed with acid
      mantle cream 2 hours prior to circumcision, experienced lower
      heart rates and less crying than those newborns who did not
      receive the lidocaine mixture. Respiratory rate and oxygen
      saturation were not affected. This was perhaps because the
      lidocaine suspension did not reach all the tissue involved in
      the procedure. In another double-blind randomized
      study<sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup> with 24 newborns,
      application of lidocaine during anesthetized surgery
      decreased the need for postprocedure analgesia.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although local anesthesia appears to be the
      most effective means of controlling pain from circumcision
      procedure, there remains the pain of administering the
      lidocaine by injection, as well as the risk of the agent
      entering the blood system if it is injected into vessels
      accidentally. A topical anesthetic agent that would reach the
      effected tissue would be ideal. Eutectic mixture of local
      anesthetics (EMLA) is a 1:1 oil/water emulsion of a eutectic
      mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine hydrochloride bases.
      Ranges of 78% to 82% total dermal analgesia with doses of 0.5
      to 2.0 mL of 5% EMLA have been achieved after 60 minutes
      under an occlusive dressing in adults, lasting for at least 2
      hours<sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. No studies of rate
      of absorption or percentage of total analgesia achieved have
      been conducted on infants, although EMLA has been used in
      infants in Europe for heelstick<sup><a
      href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">This study was designed to test the efficacy
      of topical anesthetic EMLA in diminishing the pain from
      circumcision in the newborn male infant. Although we believe
      that unanesthetized circumcision may be harmful for newborns,
      we used a control placebo group, as the current practice at
      our institution is not to give anesthesia or analgesia for
      the procedure.</p>

      <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>

      <h4>Patients</h4>

      <p class="text2">Twenty-eight newborn males were enrolled
      into the study after informed consent was obtained from the
      parents. The criteria for inclusion in the study were
      gestational age between 37 and 42 weeks, product of
      uncomplicated vaginal or cesarean section delivery, 5-minute
      Apgar score of 7 or more, birth weight greater than 2500 g,
      postnatal age less than 7 days of life, procedure performed
      between 8 AM and 2 PM, and parental request for circumcision.
      The sample size was estimated from previous studies on infant
      pain<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a
      href="#ref10">10</a></sup> and was based on heart rate
      difference of 30 beats per minute with an SD of 30 beats per
      minute. Using Colton's formula<sup><a
      href="#ref14">14</a></sup> and setting an &lt;alpha&gt; of
      .05 and a &lt;beta&gt; of .90, 13 newborns per group were
      needed. These newborns were randomly assigned to the EMLA or
      placebo group.</p>

      <h4>Procedure</h4>

      <p class="text2">Before the scheduled time of the
      circumcision, the cream (.05 mL), either EMLA or sterile
      petroleum jelly, was applied with a cotton-tipped swab on the
      outside of the prepuce and covered with an occlusive gauze
      dressing that was taped to itself. The newborn was then
      swaddled and left in a crib for the next 45 to 60
      minutes.</p>

      <p class="text2">The newborn was then unswaddled and
      connected to a pulse oximeter. The dressing was removed for a
      10-minute baseline measurement. The newborn was then placed
      in a supine position on a circumcision board (CIRCUMSTRAINT,
      Olympic Surgical Co, Seattle, Wash) with arms and legs
      restrained just below the shoulders and at the groin with
      canvas straps for the procedure. The procedure was conducted
      by one of three attending pediatricians in the nursery. The
      following phases comprised the procedure: baseline,
      restraint, clamping the dorsal side of the foreskin,
      longitudinal incision of the foreskin, lysis of adhesions
      between the foreskin and the glans, application of Gomco
      clamp (Gomco Inc, St Louis, Mo), cutting of the foreskin,
      removal of the Gomco, and removal of the restraints.</p>

      <h4>Measures</h4>

      <p class="text2">Heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen
      saturation were measured second to second by the Nellcor
      pulse oximeter (Nellcor Inc, Hayward, Calif) placed on the
      newborn's foot. The mean value for each phase was used for
      comparisons between groups.</p>

      <p class="text2">Facial expression was recorded during all
      phases of the procedure on a video camera. The tapes were
      then coded in the laboratory by assistants who were blinded
      to the design of the study. Coding was conducted according to
      the Neonatal Facial-Action Coding System developed by Grunau
      and Craig<sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. Coding was done
      on a second-to-second basis using a stop-frame playback
      system. The 10 facial actions were scored, but only those
      seven that had previously been associated with pain response
      were entered into analysis. These included brow bulge, eye
      squeeze, nasolabial furrow, open lips, vertical mouth
      stretch, horizontal mouth stretch, and taut tongue.
      Interrater reliability between the coders was &lt;kappa&gt;
      of at least 0.7 on all categories. For purposes of analyses,
      a total facial action score computed by summing the seven
      categories was used.</p>

      <p class="text2">Crying was recorded into an audio recorder
      via a microphone. Percentage of time crying was calculated
      for each phase. The first cry in each phase was digitalized
      by Fast Fourier Transform using the CSPEECH<sup><a
      href="#ref16">16</a></sup> software program. Spectral
      features of crying were analyzed, including maximum
      fundamental frequency, relative spectral energy, and harmonic
      structure (dysphonia percentage). These features reflect a
      tensing of the vocal tract and have been associated with pain
      in infants<sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>, which is
      consistent with a stress-arousal model of pain response
      proposed by Anand<sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a
      href="#ref19">19</a></sup> and Lester<sup><a
      href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. The duration of crying was
      measured as percentage of time crying in each phase.</p>

      <p class="text2">Analysis was conducted using the SPSS for
      personal computer package. Repeated measures analysis of
      variance was conducted using the multivariate analysis of
      variance (MANOVA) program and contrasting baseline values
      with each of the other eight phases in turn. Mean values for
      heart rate, oxygen saturation, total facial action, and
      duration of crying were analyzed separately. Repeated
      measures MANOVA was used for the three spectral cry features,
      and both multivariate and univariate effects were
      examined.</p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <p class="text2">Twenty-eight newborns who met the selection
      criteria were enrolled. There were no refusals for consent to
      participate. One newborn for whom data were collected was
      subsequently excluded as the gestational age was later
      ascertained to be below the cutoff. The sample
      characteristics were similar for each group. The mean birth
      weight for the EMLA group was 3690 kg and 3527 kg for the
      placebo group, the mean gestational age was 39.3 weeks for
      the EMLA group and 39.2 weeks for the placebo group, mean
      ages were 2.5 days for the EMLA group and 2.8 days for the
      placebo, and mean Apgar score at 5 minutes was 9.18 for the
      EMLA group and 9.25 for the placebo group.</p>

      <p class="text2">Overall, newborns in the placebo group
      showed a greater response to the procedure than the EMLA
      group. Group means for each phase can be seen in Figs 1
      through 4.</p>

      <p class="text2">Heart rate <a href="#fig1">(Fig 1)</a> was
      significantly different between groups (F [1, 25]=14.92;
      <i>P</i>&lt;.001), between phases (F [8, 25]=14.12;
      <i>P</i>&lt;.001), and between groups across phases (F [8,
      25]=5.436; <i>P</i>&lt;.002). The magnitude of the
      differences between groups was 15 to 20 beats per minute and
      between phases was 25 to 55 beats per minute. The points at
      which heart rates were significantly higher from baseline for
      the placebo group vs the EMLA group were at clamping (F [1,
      25]=11.37; <i>P</i>&lt;.003) and application of the Gomco (F
      [1, 25]=8.78; <i>P</i>&lt;.007). Heart rate for both groups
      was significantly higher from baseline in all phases except
      the cutting of the foreskin (F [8, 25]=.086; P=.772).</p>

      <h3>COMMENT</h3>

      <p class="text2">This study shows that the topical anesthetic
      cream EMLA has an anesthetic effect in newborns undergoing
      circumcision. Newborns in this study who had an application
      of EMLA 45 to 60 minutes prior to circumcision showed less
      increase in heart rate, less decrease in oxygen saturation,
      less facial actions, and less crying associated with pain
      than newborns who had received placebo cream. There were no
      spectral cry differences in the two groups.</p>

      <p class="text2">There were several limitations to this
      study, including the small sample size, which diminishes the
      generalizability of the findings. The safety of EMLA was not
      tested, as serum levels of lidocaine or prilocaine
      hydrochloride were not obtained and the newborns were only
      observed during the procedure until return to baseline. While
      the efficacy of EMLA was tested, it was not compared with
      other methods of pain control, such as penile nerve block or
      sucrose. If EMLA were to be shown to be the most effective
      agent available, there is still the difficulty of
      implementing its use, as it takes 45 to 60 minutes to be
      effective and might be difficult for busy pediatricians to
      allot that much time for its effect. The pharmacodynamics of
      applying EMLA to a newborn glans penis have not been studied,
      and, considering the increased vascularity of that part of
      the body and the age of the patient, less time may be
      needed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Data showed significant differences between
      the groups, which indicate that EMLA has an anesthetic effect
      for circumcision. However, there were more significant
      changes from baseline to most phases of the procedure,
      demonstrating that the procedure was still a stressful event.
      There were significant differences between baseline and
      restraint, before any tissue injury occurred. All newborns
      began crying and showing facial grimacing as they were put
      onto the circumcision board. The unswaddling of the newborns
      for the baseline produced distress response in some newborns,
      such that the baseline measures were not true baseline
      values, even though the newborns were significantly less
      distressed at that time than in other phases of the
      procedure. From that "baseline" to the restraint, there were
      significant changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation and
      increases in facial action and crying. These changes indicate
      that the newborns were significantly distressed by the
      restraint before the invasive part of the procedure
      began.</p>

      <p class="text2">Those earlier reports of the effect of
      penile blocks<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a
      href="#ref7">7</a></sup> or sucrose<sup><a
      href="#ref21">21</a></sup> showed statistical differences in
      outcome measures between groups, but none of the
      interventions appeared to eliminate the distress of the
      procedure. The question still remains as to whether or not
      the EMLA merely decreased perceived pain of circumcision or
      gave total local anesthesia, as it apparently does for other
      tissue-damaging procedures<sup><a
      href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">This study shows that EMLA is an effective
      agent in reducing pain of circumcision, but further study is
      required. The timing of the peak effectiveness of EMLA may be
      different for newborns, and different again for the more
      vascular area of the glans penis. Several studies on the
      pharmacodynamics of EMLA in newborns are needed before
      further clinical studies are conducted. Following that,
      future studies should include monitoring of serum lidocaine
      levels and observations for 48 to 72 hours after the
      procedure for untoward effects. There should be other
      comparison groups, such as penile nerve block or sucrose, to
      determine the relative efficacy of EMLA. Other interventions
      in conjunction with EMLA, such as changes in the procedure
      requiring less restraint, need to be tested if the goal is to
      decrease the total distress as well as the pain of the
      procedure.</p>
