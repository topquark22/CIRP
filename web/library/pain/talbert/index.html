        role of the fetal adrenal cortex in the initiation or

        the fetal lung<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> has been
        suggested by several authors. While there is presumptive
        clinical evidence that the fetus and newborn are able to
        respond to stress with increased output of adrenal cortical
        hormones,<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> the
        responsiveness of the hypotholamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
        has not been studied in infants during the first few hours
        of life. This study was designed to measure changes in
        plasma cortisol and cortisone resulting from circumcision
        during the first 6 hours of extrauterine life.</p>

        <h4 align="center">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h4>

        <p class="2">Five normal newborn male infants delivered
        vaginally after the spontaneous onset of labor were
        selected for study, and appropriate informed consent was
        obtained. After stabilization in the newborn nursery for a
        brief period and before 6 hours of age, 0.6 ml of blood was
        obtained by heel stick utilizing a long point B-D
        microlance after routine alcohol skin preparation and air
        drying. Circumcision was then performed by the Gomco clamp
        technic. Blood was again obtained as described above at 20
        minutes and 40 minutes after initiation of the circumcision
        procedure.</p>

        <p><i>Method for determination of cortisol and
        cortisone</i></p>

        <p class="2">The blood samples were centrifuged, and serum
        was drawn off and stored at 4 C until assayed.</p>

        <p class="2">Cortisone and cortisol were measured as
        previously described<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> except
        that corticoid binding serum was obtained from pooled
        chicken blood and the thin-layer chromatography step was
        eliminated.</p>

        <h4 align="center">RESULTS</h4>

        <p class="2">Table 1 shows the results of cortisol
        determinations in this group of infants. Cortisone data are
        given in Table 2. Mean baseline levels for cortisol and
        cortisone, respectively, were 5.8 and 7.3 ug/100 ml. Twenty
        minutes after the initiation of the circumcision procedure
        the mean cortisol level had risen to 14.7 ug/100 ml and the
        mean cortisone level had risen to 8.5ug/100 ml. Forty
        minutes after beginning the procedure the levels of
        cortisol remained significantly higher than baseline. Both
        the absolute and percentage rise in cortisone levels were
        of lesser magnitude than the rise in cortisol and, although
        consistent, did not achieve statistical significance in
        this small group of patients.</p>

        <h4 align="center">DISCUSSION</h4>

        <p class="2">Liggins and Howie in 1972, reported on a large
        controlled series of premature infants whose mothers had
        been treated with betamethasone. There was a significant
        reduction in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome
        in the infants of patients treated as long as 24 hours
        before delivery and whose infants were less than 32 weeks
        gestational age.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Bauer et al
        showed a decreased incidence of the respiratory distress
        syndrome and increased cord blood cortisol levels in
        premature infants whose membranes had been ruptured longer
        than 16 hours. They suggested that the rise in cortisol
        level and resulting maturation of the fetal lungs were due
        to fetal stress.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> However,
        Jones et al, in a much larger study, were unable to show
        any beneficial effect of premature rupture of the
        membranes; specifically, there was no reduction in the
        incidence of the respiratory distress syndrome after
        prolonged premature rupture of the membranes.<sup><a
        href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">Anders et al studied plasma cortisol levels in
        various behavior states in infants from 1 to 15 weeks of
        life, and showed that there was a marked rise in plasma
        cortisol levels after 20 minutes of crying.<sup><a
        href="#n7">7</a></sup> More recently Tennes and Carter
        confirmed that cortisol levels were higher in crying
        infants than sleeping infants but found that babies
        circumcised in the 24 hours preceeding study had no
        significant elevation of plasma corticoids.<sup><a
        href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">Infants suffering from the respiratory
        distress syndrome have higher levels of plasma cortisol
        than do those infants at the same gestational age without
        the respiratory distress syndrome.<sup><a
        href="#n12">12</a></sup> However, if cortisol levels are
        studied at birth prior to the development of respiratory
        distress syndrome, those infants destined to develop
        respiratory distress syndrome have a lower level of plasma
        cortisol than those infants who will retain normal
        respiratory function.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> These
        data have been interpreted to indicate that cortisol
        participates in the maturation of the fetal lungs and the
        initiation of surfactin production and that those infants
        with low cortisol levels are, therefore more susceptible to
        development of respiratory distress syndrome.</p>

        <p class="2">Several studies have shown higher levels of
        cortisol and cortisone in the fetal circulation in patients
        delivered by cesarean section.<sup><a
        href="#n2">2,13</a></sup> It has been suggested by some
        investigators that the increased cortisol levels in fetal
        circulation following labor may be at least partially due
        to the fetal stress induced by labor.<sup><a
        href="#n9">9,13</a></sup> However it is equally plausible
        that part of the cause for increased levels may result from
        a prelabor surge of cortisol similar to that demonstrated
        in the sheep by Bassett et al<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
        and suggested in the human by Murphy.<sup><a
        href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">While there is substantial body of clinical
        evidence that the fetus and neonate can respond to stress
        with increased output of adrenal corticoids,<sup><a
        href="#n7">7,8,11</a></sup> to our knowledge this is the
        first study documenting such a response in the first 6
        hours of life. During and following circumcision there was
        an immediate and consistent rise in both cortisol and
        cortisone levels, the former achieving greater statistical
        significance. Both the absolute and percentage rise in the
        cortisol level were greater than the rise in cortisone
        level, findings consistent with the data reported by
        Hillman and Giroud in 1965.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
        These investigators stimulated newborns during the first 3
        days of life with 5 IU of ACTH and showed a rise in plasma
        cortisol from a mean of 5.9 to 25.9ug/100 ml, along with a
        smaller but significant rise in the plasma cortisone level.
        This study documents similar changes resulting from
        circumcision, presumably in response to endogenous
        ACTH.</p>

        <p class="2">This study does not purport to answer the
        question of whether the elevated levels of cortisol and
        cortisone following vaginal delivery are a fetal response
        to the stress of labor as suggested by Pokoly<sup><a
        href="#n13">13</a></sup> or are a reflection of a prelabor
        surge of cortisol as suggested by others.<sup><a
        href="#n2">2,4</a></sup> However, the data do suggest that
        the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is responsive to
        the stress of circumcision during the first six hours of
        life.</p>
