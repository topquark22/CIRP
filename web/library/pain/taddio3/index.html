<B>BACKGROUND:</B> Pain of circumcision is only partially relieved by 
single modalities, such as penile nerve block, lidocaine-prilocaine 
cream, and sucrose pacifiers. 
<P>
<B>OBJECTIVE:</B> To assess the effectiveness of a combination of
interventions on the pain response of infants undergoing 
circumcision. 
<P>
<B>METHODS:</B>
Cohort study. Group 1 included infants circumcised using the 
Mogen clamp and combined analgesics (lidocaine dorsal penile 
nerve block, lidocaine-prilocaine, acetaminophen, and sugar-coated 
gauze dipped in grape juice). Group 2 included infants 
circumcised using the Gomco clamp and lidocaine-prilocaine. 
Infants were videotaped during circumcision, and pain was 
assessed using facial activity scores and percentage of time spent 
crying. 
<P>
<B>RESULTS:</B> There were 57 infants in group 1 and 29 infants in 
group 2. Birth characteristics did not differ between groups. Infants
in group 1 were older than infants in group 2 (17 days vs 2 days) (P 
&lt; .001). The mean duration of the procedure was 55 seconds and 
577 seconds for infants in group 1 and 2, respectively (P &lt; .001). 
Facial action scores and percentage of time spent crying were 
significantly lower during circumcision for infants in group 1 (P <
.001). The percentage of time spent crying was 18% and 40% for 
infants in groups 1 and 2, respectively. No adverse effects were 
observed in infants in group 1; 1 infant in group 2 had a local skin 
infection. <P>
<B>CONCLUSIONS:</B> Infants circumcised with the Mogen 
clamp and combined analgesia have substantially less pain than 
those circumcised with the Gomco clamp and lidocaine-prilocaine 
cream. Because of the immense pain during circumcision, 
combined local anesthesia and analgesia using the Mogen clamp 
should be considered.<P>
