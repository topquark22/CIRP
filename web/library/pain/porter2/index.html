      [Abstract] 

      <p>Porter, Fran Lang; Porges, Stephen W. and Marshall,
      Richard E. Newborn Pain Cries and Vagal Tone: Parallel
      Changes in Response to Circumcision. <i>Child
      Development</i>, 1988 59, 495-505. Clinical Studies have
      demonstrated that the cries of chronically stressed infants,
      medical compromised infants are characteristically higher and
      more variable in pitch than those of healthy infants. Other
      studies have indicated that the vagal tone of chronically
      stressed infants is significantly reduced in comparison to
      that of normal infants. A neural model of cry production has
      been proposed which suggests that decreased vagal tone among
      infants at risk may, in fact, be related to these increases
      in cry pitch. <span class="yellow">Using routine,
      unanesthetized circumcision as a model of stress we were able
      to examine the relationship between cry acoustics and vagal
      tone in normal, healthy newborns undergoing an acutely
      stressful event.</span> Vocalizations, heart, and respiratory
      waveforms were continuously recorded from 49 (32
      experimental; 17 control) 1-2 day-old, full-term infants
      during preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods.
      <span class="yellow">Vagal tone, as measured by the amplitude
      of respiratory sinus arrhythmia extracted from heart rate
      data, was significantly reduced during the severe stress of
      circumcision, and these reductions were paralleled by
      significant increases in the pitch of the infants'
      cries.</span> In addition, individual differences in vagal
      tone measured prior to circumcision surgery were predictive
      of physiological and acoustic reactivity to subsequent
      stress. These results emphasize the potential role of vagal
      control of the autonomic nervous system during stress.</p>
