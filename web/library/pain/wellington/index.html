      <h2>Attitudes and Practices Regarding Analgesia for Newborn
      Circumcision</h2>

      <p><b>N Wellington and MJ Rieder</b></p>

      <p>Department of Paediatrics,<br />

      Hospital of Western Ontario</a>,<br />
       London, Canada.</p>
      [Abstract] 

      <p><b>Study Objective.</b> To determine attitudes regarding
      routine use of analgesia for newborn circumcision among
      primary care physicians in southwestern Ontario.</p>

      <p><b>Design.</b> Questionnaire survey conducted among all
      family physicians and pediatricians belonging to the London
      Academy of Medicine. The majority of pediatric primary care
      in this region is provided by family physicians.</p>

      <p><b>Setting.</b> Metropolitan center in Southwestern
      Ontario.</p>

      <p><b>Respondents.</b> A questionnaire was mailed to 279
      physicians; 171 (61%) responded.</p>

      <p><b>Results.</b> Seventy-four (43%) respondents performed
      circumcisions. Among physicians performing circumcisions, a
      minority (17; 24%) used any form of analgesia. The most
      commonly used analgesic (14; 20%) was oral ethanol. Only 3
      (4%) physicians used dorsal penile nerve block. The most
      common reasons listed for not employing analgesia were lack
      of familiarity with analgesia use among neonates (56%), lack
      of familiarity with the technique of dorsal penile block
      (50%), and concern over adverse effects of analgesic drugs
      (49%) and regional analgesia (44%). Only a small minority of
      physicians (7; 12%) responded that they believe that neonates
      do not feel pain, and 20 (35%) believe that neonates do not
      remember pain.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions.</b> Despite evidence that neonates
      perceive pain and that there is a physiologic stress response
      to circumcision which can be reduced if analgesia is
      employed, <span class="yellow">the vast majority of
      physicians performing newborn circumcisions either do not
      employ analgesics or employ analgesics of questionable
      efficacy.</span> Lack of familiarity with the use of
      analgesics among neonates and with dorsal penile block in
      particular are the most common reasons cited for lack of
      analgesic use. Educational efforts and research into less
      invasive techniques of analgesia for newborn circumcision are
      urgently required.</p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: As of 2003, the incidence of
      non-therapeutic circumcision of male children in Ontario has
      declined greatly. In 2003, 84 percent of newborn boys is
      Ontario managed to avoid circumcision. That percentage
      increases each year so it probably is higher today. Canadians
      have reached a <a href="/news/nationalpost08-30-02a/"
      target="_blank">consensus</a> that avoidance of circumcision
      is better that anaesthesia.</p>
