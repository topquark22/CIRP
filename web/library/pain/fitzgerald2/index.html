            <p class="text2">The postnatal period is a critical
            time in the development of spinal sensory systems. It
            is a time of structural and functional reorganization
            of sensory connections accompanied by marked changes in
            expression of molecules, receptors, and channels
            associated with sensory transmission. (Alvares and
            Fitzgerald 1999; Fitzgerald and Jennings 1999). In
            addition, it is becoming increasingly evident that
            these postnatal events are dependent upon neural
            activity and that synaptic development requires defined
            patterns of afferent inpt (Ben-Ari 2002; Debski and
            Kline 2002; Fox 2002). <span class="yellow">Abnormal or
            excessive activity related to pain and injury in early
            life may therefore change the course of development and
            cause long-term changes in somatosensory and pain
            processing</span> (Alvares et al. 2000; Anand 2000).
            <span class="yellow">Clinical studies suggest that
            early pain related to surgical and procedural
            intervention during intensive pain management of
            premature neonates can have long-term consequences upon
            pain behavior and perception in later life.</span>
            (Porter et al. 1999; Grunau 2000). This chapter
            discusses clinical and laboratory evidence for these
            changes and outlines possible underlying
            mechanisms.</p>

            <p class="section">EVIDENCE THAT EARLY PAIN EXPERIENCE
            ALTERS FUTURE<br />
             SOMATOSENSORY PROCESSING: HUMAN STUDIES</p>

            <p class="text2">Preterm infants in intensive care can
            receive many invasive procedures, and adequate levels
            of analgesia are frequently hard to gauge (Anand and
            Porter 1998). Even the youngest preterm infant will
            display clear responses to noxious stimuli and tissue
            injury (Johnston et al. 1995; Fitzgerald and DeLima
            2000). Several studies have addressed whether early
            pain experience, if excessive or repeated, may alter
            future pain responses. These responses have been
            divided into shorter-term changes (days and weeks) and
            longer term changes (months and years).</p>

            <p>SHORTER-TERM EFFECTS</p>

            <p class="text2">Several studies have investigated
            lasting pain and sensitivity in and around an area of
            injury in infants. They have been shown that even very
            young preterm babies are capable of displaying a
            prolonged cutaneous sensitization or hyperalgesia for
            days or weeks, when exposed to repeated painful
            stimulation such as heel lances (Fitzgerald et al.
            1989). In addition, secondary hyperalgesia can be
            observed, for instance in the contralateral limb
            following local ischemic injury (Andrews and Fitzgerald
            1994). The area around an abdominal surgical wound
            shows a similar enhanced cutaneous sensitivity in the
            postoperative period (Andrews and Fitzgerald 2002). A
            recent study shows that reactions (evidenced by
            grimacing or crying) to the pain caused by venipuncture
            on the forearm are also increased in full-term infants
            who have undergone repeated heel lances in the previous
            24&ndash;36 hours, compared to control infants (Taddio
            et al. 2002). This effect, which extends to increased
            grimacing or crying even during non-noxious skin
            cleansing, suggests a spread of central sensitization
            well outside the area of direct injury.</p>

            <p class="text2">Other studies have asked a rather
            different question: Does the overall experience of
            several weeks of intensive care alter pain
            responsiveness? These studies do not demonstrate an
            enhanced response. In fact, facial expression and
            autonomic and other biobehavioral measures show that
            pain responses in infants of 32 weeks postconceptional
            age who have undergone 4 weeks of repeated invasive
            procedures can be blunted compared to those of
            age-matched controls. (Johnston and Stevens 1996;
            Grunau et al. 2001).</p>

            <p class="text2">The debate on how best to measure pain
            responses in such studies continues (Stevens and Franck
            2001), and it is very clear that there is great
            individuality of response, even at very young ages
            (Franck et al. 2000); Morison et al. 2001). One
            advantage of measuring cutaneous sensitization and
            hyperalgesia is that they are relatively simple
            spinally mediated responses with direct parallels with
            laboratory studies (Fitzgerald and DeLima 2001).
            Interestingly, it appears that below 32 weeks,
            grimacing (facial action coding) and autonomic
            responses may also be mediated subcortically, because
            there is no difference in these responses to heel lance
            in intact and severely brain-injured infants
            (Oberlander et al. 2002).</p>

            <p>LONGER-TERM EFFECTS</p>

            <p class="text2">While understanding the persistent
            effects of early pain over days and weeks is extremely
            important for adequate pain management and recovery,
            our interest here really lies in the potential for such
            stimuli to cause changes in responses lasting into
            childhood, adolescences, or adulthood. Very few data
            are available in this area, and what little information
            we have is hard to interpret. Grunau (2000) emphasized
            the complexity of such studies and the need for careful
            design and interpretation. As yet no studies have been
            directed toward sensitivity in and around the site of
            the injury itself as the child matures.</p>

            <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">One important
            study shows that boys who have been circumcised at
            birth show increased pain responses to vaccinations at
            4&ndash;6 months compared to those who have not (Taddio
            et al. 1995). In a follow-up, prospective study on 87
            infant boys, uncircumcised infants were found to have
            the lowest pain scores at vaccination 4&ndash;6 months
            later, followed by those circumcised after treatment
            with lidocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA), while those
            circumcised after placebo cream showed the greatest
            responses (Taddio et al. 1997).</span></p>

            <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">There is evidence
            of persistent hypersensitivity following infant
            surgery.</span> A follow-up study of infants 3 months
            after corrective surgery for unilateral hydronephrosis
            showed that the majority still displayed increased
            abdominal sensitivity compared with control infants of
            the same age (Andrews et al. 2003).</p>

            <p class="text2">Again, the situation is somewhat
            different when examining preterm infants and the
            effects of multiple invasive procedures in intensive
            care. The blunting of pain responses after several
            weeks of intensive care, as described above, appears to
            have disappeared by the time the infants are 4 months
            old. Biobehavioral pain responses to blood collection
            by finger lance at 4 months were similar overall
            between former low birth weight infants and term-born
            controls (Oberlander et al. 2002). This finding appears
            inconsistent with the pioneering study of 195 toddlers
            at 18 months of varying birth weights from 480 g to
            over 2500 g, in which parents perceived the lowest
            birthweight groups to have the lowest pain
            responsiveness and where, unlike the case for toddlers
            of greater birth weight, there was no relationship
            between temperament and pain perception (Grunau et al.
            1994a). Also in older children of 4.5 years,
            &ldquo;somatization,&rdquo; the occurrence of numerous
            pains that cannot be accounted for medically, was
            significantly greater in the lowest birth weight
            children. (Grunau et al. 1994b), although this finding
            was not observed at age 8&mdash;10 years (Grunau et al.
            1998). Interestingly, these older children do rate
            pictures of painful events as more painful than do
            their peers of normal birth weight (Grunau et al.
            1998).</p>

            <p class="text2">All of these longer-term studies are
            hard to design due to confounding factors such as
            gestational age at birth (Grunau 1994a), length of
            intensive care stay (Johnston and Stevens 1996),
            intensity of the stimulus (Porter et al. 1999a),
            therapeutic management (Grunau et al. 2001), and
            parenting style (Grunau 1994b). In addition, children
            born preterm can have reduced cortical growth
            (Ajayi-Obe et al. 2000), reduced cognitive test scores,
            and increased incidence of attention deficit and
            hyperactivity disorder and other behaviors (Bhutta et
            al. 2002.) The older the child gets, the harder the
            studies are to conduct because learned patterns of
            behavior within families are major determinant of
            perceived sensitivity to pain (MacGregor et al.
            1997).</p>

            <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Changes, if they
            occur, may be hard to detect in human subjects because
            the very plasticity that we are investigating may act
            elsewhere in the nervous system to compensate for the
            adverse effects of altered or excessive inputs.</span>
            For instance, in contrast to the intense pain that
            occurs in adults, no chronic long-term pain follows
            brachial plexus avulsion at birth, and there is
            excellent restoration of sensory function and
            localization of restored sensation in avulsed spinal
            root dermatones following surgical repair (Anand and
            Birch 2002). This finding is consistent with the
            observation in rat pups that despite profound
            alteration of plantar hindpaw innervation induced by
            early nerve transection, cutaneous nociceptive impulses
            maintain an essentially normal spatial organization
            (Holmberg and Schouenborg 1996). In these cases of
            early nerve damage, an impressive reorganization must
            have taken place in the central nervous system to limit
            the sensory deficit.</p>

            <p class="section">EVIDENCE THAT EARLY PAIN EXPERIENCE
            ALTERS FUTURE<br />
            SOMATOSENSORY PROCESSING: ANIMAL STUDIES</p>

            <p>BEHAVIORAL STUDIES</p>

            <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">A key step toward
            evaluating the impact of early pain upon future
            somatosensory processing is to establish animal models
            where tissue injury or repeated noxious stimuli applied
            at infancy lead to changes in adult sensory
            behavior.</span> Such models have been reported, but
            the effects depend critically upon the nature of the
            injury.</p>

            <p class="text2">Exposure to repetitive needle pricks
            to the paw four times a day in rat pups from post-natal
            (P) days P0 to P7 produces hypealgesia, in the form of
            reduced hot-plate latencies, at day P16, but this does
            not last into adulthood (Anand et al. 1999). The
            neonatally injured animals do, however, show an
            increased preference for alcohol and manifest other
            behavior changes as adults. On the other hand, a more
            severe injury of repeated 10% formalin injections into
            paws from P1 to P7 leads to hypoalgesia in adulthood,
            in the form of increased hot-plate and tail-flick
            latency. Preemptive morphine treatment before the first
            injection of formalin ameliorates the effects in males
            only, but the situation is complicated by the fact that
            morphine alone at birth increases adult tail-flick
            latencies more severely than does an injury. In this
            model, neonatal pain and morphine decrease alcohol
            preference (Bhutta et al. 2001). The difference of
            these results may be explained by the fact that
            formalin is a more damaging stimulus that may lead to
            some sensory neuron death (Tsujino et al. 2000),
            whereas repeated needle prick will presumably produce
            only local inflammation.</p>

            <p class="text2">The longterm effects of an injection
            of inflammatory agents at birth is a subject of some
            controversy and clearly depends on the agent and dose
            used. Nociceptive thresholds fall in neonatal animals
            within a few hours of an inflammatory lesion (Jiang and
            Gebhart 1998; Marsh et al. 1999), but the question here
            is whether the effects last beyond the resolution of
            the peripheral damage. One report describes hindpaw
            injection of 0.25% carrageenan in newborn rat pups
            causing mechanical and heat hypoalgesia in 60-day-old
            adults while increasing the hyperalgesia produced by an
            injection of complete Freund&rsquo;s adjuvant (CFA)
            (Lidlow et al. 2001). These effects were reversed if
            the neonatal inflammation was accompanied by four
            injections of sciatic bupivacaine nerve block, lasting
            up to 9 hours after the inflammation. However, in two
            other separate blinded studies, no changes in
            mechanical or heat responses were observed in adults
            following neonatal carrageenan injection (Alvares et
            al. 2000); Walker and Fitzgerald 2002). Despite the
            profound and long-lasting inflammation (14 days)
            produced by a single injection of 10 &micro;L 2%
            carrageenan in the neonatal hindpaw, no difference was
            found in the three groups (neonatal carrageenan,
            saline, and anesthetic only) in mechanical or heat
            thresholds (either between left and right paws or
            between inflamed and control groups) at any stage
            tested. In addition, the reapplication of 2%
            carrageenan or CFA in these rats, when they had reached
            maturity, caused normal inflammatory, hypealgesic, and
            allodynic responses that did not differ from that of
            controls. A stronger inflammatory agent (25 &micro;L
            CFA) injected into the hindpaw at birth also leaves
            adult baseline thermal withdrawal latencies unchanged,
            but following a second challenge with CFA, hyperalgesia
            increases very slightly and the time course but not the
            magnitude of the formalin response is altered (Ruda et
            al. 2000). The volume and doses of inflammatory agents
            used in infant rats for such studies must be considered
            with care. Injection of 25 &micro;L CFA in a newborn
            rat leaves the paw swollen into adulthood (Walker and
            Fitzgerald 2001) and thus is clearly not an injury that
            resolves itself in the neonatal period.</p>

            <p class="text2">Another type of injury that has been
            investigated is a full-thickness skin wound in the hind
            paw of the newborn rat pup, which heals rapidly. A
            long-lasting hypersensitivity, in the form of lowered
            von Frey mechanical threshold, persists in the
            previously injured region (Reynolds and Fitzgerald
            1995; DeLima et al. 1999). The effect is apparent after
            one week and persists for at least six weeks (DeLima et
            al. 1999); it only occurs if the wound is made in the
            postnatal period (Reynolds et al. 1997). In this case,
            local sciatic nerve block with bupovacaine for the
            first 24 hours after wounding did not affect the onset
            or magnitude of mechanical hypersensitivity.</p>

            <p class="text2">While changes in animal behavior are
            important, they are prey to almost as many confounding
            factors as human studies. There is considerable
            advantage in looking for direct effects of early injury
            upon the development of neural connections. <span
            class="yellow">Analysis at the cellular level can
            reveal changes in sensory connections that are not
            evident in behavioral tests.</span></p>

            <p class="text2">Early peripheral inflammation has a
            transient influence on the postnatal development of rat
            primary sensory neuron subtypes (Beland and Fitzgerald
            2001). This phenomenon has been studied using
            calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to label
            peptide-containing and IB4 to label
            non-peptide-containing nociceptive neurons and using
            NF200 to label larger non-nociceptive neurons.
            Following carrageenan inflammation in rats on day P1,
            the normal rise in IB4-positive binding on the dorsal
            root ganglion occurs earlier but is the same as
            controls by day P21. The CGRP-positive population
            increases at 2 and 6 days after carrageenan, because of
            an increase in both small CGRP/IB4 and larger
            CGRP/NF200 double labeled cells, but again, is normal
            by 3 weeks. The effects are different from adult
            inflammation, where carrageenan causes a transient
            increase in CGRP/IB4 cells only (Beland and Fitzgerald
            2001).</p>

            <p class="text2">There is a clear acute effect (within
            2-5 hours) of carrageenan inflammation upon the
            properties of dorsal horn cells, including increased
            spontaneous activity, evoked responses, and A-fiber
            sensitization, although the pattern of effects is age
            dependent (Torsey and Fitzgerald 2002). These
            short-term effects do not last beyond the acute
            inflammation, however, and in parallel with the
            behavioral results described above, the dorsal horn
            properties 6 weeks later do not differ from controls
            (C. Torsney and M. Fitgerald, unpublished
            transcript).</p>

            <p class="text2">CFA injections on the neonate, on the
            other hand, do cause long-lasting changes in spinal
            circuitry that can be observed in the adult. These
            consist of expanded central C-fiber terminal fields and
            CGRP expression and increased fos-like
            immunoreactivity, a measure of neuronal activity in
            dorsal horn neurons (Ruda et al. 2000; Tachibana et al.
            2001). These central changes must be viewed in the
            context of very severe damage caused by large volumes
            of inflammatory agents that may have neuropathic and
            systemic consequences and that may produce an
            inflammatory response that lasts into adulthood (Walker
            and Fitzgerald 2002).</p>

            <p class="text2">Of all the early models of pain, <span
            class="yellow">skin wounding at birth has some of the
            longest-lasting peripheral and central consequences
            upon sensory connections. The wound heals rapidly, but
            the sensory nerve terminals in the area show a profound
            sprouting response, which long outlasts the injury (at
            least 12 weeks in the rat)</span> (Reynolds and
            Fitzgerald 1995); De Lima et al. 1999; Alvares et al.
            2000). <span class="yellow">The effect is most dramatic
            when wounds are performed at birth and decreases
            progressively with age at wounding.</span> This is a
            sensory A- and C-fiber nerve response with no
            sympathetic involvement (Reynolds and Fitzgerald 1995).
            <span class="yellow">In addition, skin wounding at
            birth leads to a long-lasting expansion of dorsal horn
            cell receptive fields, which is clearly observed at six
            weeks</span> (C. Torsney and M. Fitzgerald, unpublished
            observations).</p>

            <p class="text2">The only other infant model that leads
            to central changes of this kind is neonatal colonic
            distension or irritation with mustard oil between
            postnatal days 8 and 21, which leads to sensitization
            of the abdominal withdrawal reflex and heightens the
            responses of viscerosensitive neurons during colon
            distension in adult rates. This model appears to lead
            to chronic visceral hypersensitivity in the adult in
            the absence of identifiable peripheral pathology and
            only occurs if the colon is distended in young animals
            (Al-Chaer et al. 2000).</p>

            <p class="section">MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE EFFECTS OF
            EARLY PAIN<br />
            EXPERIENCE UPON FUTURE SOMATOSENSORY PROCESSING</p>

            <p class="text2">The mechanisms by which early
            experience alters somatosensory processing are likely
            to involve activity-dependent changes in the developing
            nervous system. The influence of sensory experience
            upon the formation of somatosensory synaptic
            connections is well established in the rodent
            trigeminal system, where alternations in whisker
            stimulation doing a critical period of postnatal
            development result in receptive field reorganization in
            the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex (O&rsquo;Leary et
            al. 1994; Fox 2002; Kaas and Catania 2002). This period
            of plasticity is transitory, usually encompassing only
            a short time soon after the onset of the sensory
            stimulus, which is immediately postnatal for whisker
            barrel formation (Fox 1992), and after eye opening in
            relation to the visual cortex (Berardi et al. 2000). If
            the source of activity is altered during this critical
            period, normal patterns of connectivity are disrupted.
            A common mechanism has been proposed whereby synaptic
            connections are strengthened when pre- and postsynaptic
            activity is correlated, which those connections that
            are uncorrelated being weakened and eliminated (Feldman
            et al. 1999; Sanes and Yamagata 1999). The molecular
            basis of this mechanism is thought to involve the
            induction of N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent
            long-term potentiation and depression (Fox 2002). In
            support of this theory, normal sensory connectivity
            patterns are disrupted in NMDA-R1-receptor knockout
            mice (Isawato et al. 1997). While the limits of sensory
            connections are dependent upon afferent terminal
            patterns, functional somatotopic maps are determined by
            the size and pattern of receptive fields of individual
            target neurons, and the construction of these
            respective fields in the developing visual system is
            also NMDA-dependent (Huang and Pallas 2001).</p>

            <p class="section">EVIDENCE FOR ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT
            DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
            SPINAL SENSORY PATHWAYS</p>

            <p class="text2">Spinal cord dorsal horn somatosensory
            maps also undergo postnatal refinement over a critical
            postnatal period. Primary afferent A fibers extend more
            superficially to laminae I and II of the dorsal horn at
            early postnatal stages, with a subsequent gradual
            withdrawal down to lamina III or below over the first
            three postnatal weeks (Fitzgerald et al. 1994; Beggs et
            al. 2002). This withdrawal is accompanied by a
            progressive reduction in A-fiber input to the
            susstantia gelatinosa (Park et al. 1999; Nakatsuka et
            al. 2000) and a gradual reduction in the cutaneous
            receptive field size of dorsal horn cells (Fitzgerald
            and Jennings 1999; Torsney and Fitzgerald 2002). The
            postnatal refinement of sensory inputs in the spinal
            dorsal horn is likely to contribute to sensory
            processing and may underlie the increase in cutaneous
            mechanical reflex thresholds that occurs between birth
            and adulthood (Fitzgerald 1999; Fitzgerald and Jennings
            1999).</p>

            <p class="text2">The postnatal withdrawal of A-fiber
            terminals from the substantia gelatinosa may be the
            result of a competitive process because neonatal
            destruction of C fibers with capsaicin prevents the
            effect (Torsney et al. 2000). Recently we have shown
            that chronic, local exposure of the dorsal horn of the
            lumbar spinal cord to the NMDA antagonist MK801 from
            birth prevents the normal functional and structural
            reorganization of A-fiber connections (Beggs et al.
            2002). Dorsal horn cells in spinal MK801-treated
            animals, investigated at 8 weeks of age by &ldquo;in
            vivo&rdquo; electrophysiological recording, had
            significantly larger cutaneous mechanoreceptive fields
            and greater A-fiber-evoked responses than did
            vehicle-treated controls. C-fiber-evoked responses were
            unaffected. Chronic application of MK801 also prevented
            the normal structural reorganization of A-fiber
            terminals in the spinal cord. The postnatal withdrawal
            of superficially projecting A-fiber primary afferents
            to deeper laminae did not occur in treated animals,
            although C-fiber afferent terminals and cell density in
            the dorsal horn were apparently unaffected. Spinal
            MK801-treated animals also had significantly reduced
            behavioral reflex thresholds to mechanical stimulation
            of the hindpaw compared to na&iuml;ve and vehicle
            treated animals, whereas noxious heat thresholds
            remained unaffected. The results indicate that the
            normal postnatal structural and functional development
            of A-fiber sensory connectivity within the spinal cord
            is an activity dependent process requiring
            NMDA-receptor activation (Beggs et al. 2002).</p>

            <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The finding that
            blockade of NMDA activation of the dorsal horn neurons
            during a critical period of development selectively
            alters the normal development of spinal sensory
            connections demonstrates the plasticity and
            vulnerability of the system. It seems likely,
            therefore, that altered patterns of C-Fiber excitation
            resulting from local injury in neonates will modify
            synaptic connectivity within the central nervous system
            via an NMDA-dependent mechanism and so alter the normal
            maturation of sensory pathways.</span></p>

            <p class="section">CONCLUSION</p>

            <p class="text1">In common with other areas of the
            central nervous system, synaptic development of spinal
            sensory connections is experience or activity
            dependent. Evidence from both animal and human studies
            shows that alterations in the patterns of sensory
            activity that can arise from tissue injury and pain in
            early life may disrupt normal synaptic organization
            within the somatosensory system. While these studies
            are incomplete and more investigation is needed in this
            area, <span class="yellow">the potential clinical
            importance of neonatal plasticity in pain development
            is clear.</span></p>
