      [Abstract] 

      <p><b>Study Objective.</b> To change physician attitudes and
      practices regarding the routine use of local and regional
      anesthesia for newborn circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Design.</b> Interventional study, followed by an audit
      of physician practice over a 1-month period, 1 year following
      interventions.</p>

      <p><b>Setting.</b> The newborn nurseries of the Women's
      Pavilion, Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton.</p>

      <p><b>Interventions.</b> A broad range of awareness and
      educational programs were directed at physicians who perform
      newborn circumcisions, including posters, newsletters,
      presentations at grand rounds, video recordings, and
      practical "hands-on" demonstration of the techniques of local
      anesthesia to the prepuce and dorsal penile nerve block.</p>

      <p><b>Results.</b> Only one physician was using local
      analgesia for newborn circumcision prior to the introduction
      of the educational program. The audit, performed 12 months
      later, documented 46 circumcisions performed by 22
      physicians, each performing between 1 and 6 circumcisions
      (median = 1). Sixteen of the 22 physicians (73%) used either
      local anesthesia to the prepuce (19 cases) or dorsal penile
      nerve block (13 cases) during circumcisions. Thus, local
      analgesia was used in 66% (32/48) of all circumcisions. Six
      physicians, performing 16 circumcisions, do not use any form
      of analgesia.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions.</b> <span class="yellow">This simple
      educational program has been associated with a remarkable
      change in attitudes and practice regarding local analgesia
      for neonatal circumcision.</span> Our ideal objective, which
      we hope to achieve through repeated education and practical
      demonstrations of the techniques to interested physicians, is
      that all newborn circumcisions are performed under local or
      regional anesthesia in our institution.</p>
