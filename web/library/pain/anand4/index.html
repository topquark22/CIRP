      <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract</b><br />
       Self-destructive behavior in current society promotes a
      search for psychobiological factors underlying this epidemic.
      Perinatal brain plasticity increases the vulnerability to
      early adverse experiences, thus leading to abnormal
      development and behavior. Although several epidemiological
      investigations have correlated perinatal and neonatal
      complications with abnormal adult behavior, our understanding
      of the underlying mechanisms remains rudimentary. Models of
      early experience, such as repetitive pain, sepsis, or
      maternal separation in rodents and other species have noted
      multiple alterations in the adult brain, correlated with
      specific behavioral phenotypes depending on the timing and
      nature of the insult. The mechanisms mediating such changes
      in the neonatal brain have remained largely unexplored. We
      propose that lack of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      activity from maternal separation and sensory isolation leads
      to increased apoptosis in multiple areas of the immature
      brain. On the other hand, exposure to repetitive pain may
      cause excessive NMDA/excitatory amino acid activation
      resulting in excitotoxic damage to developing neurons. These
      changes promote two distinct behavioral phenotypes
      characterized by increased anxiety, altered pain sensitivity,
      stress disorders, hyperactivity/attention deficit disorder,
      leading to impaired social skills and patterns of
      self-destructive behavior. The clinical important of these
      mechanisms lies in the prevention of early insults, effective
      treatment of neonatal pain and stress, and perhaps the
      discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that limit neuronal
      excitotoxicity or apoptosis. <small>Copyright 2000 S. Karger

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: Apoptosis is defined by
      <i>Stedman's Medical Dictionary</i> (1995) as "simple
      deletion of scattered cells by fragmentation into membrane
      bound particles which are phagocytosed by other cells;
      believed to be due to programmed cell death."]</p>

      <p class="text2">Aberrant behavior, mental illness, and drug
      abuse have reached epidemic proportions amongst adolescents
      and adults today. The high prevalence of such
      psychopathologies imposes a signficant burden of direct and
      indirect health care costs in developed countries [<a
      href="#n1">1, 2</a>]. Self-destructive behaviors (e.g.,
      suicide, drug abuse) are also associated with social
      disruption and the propagation of sexually transmitted
      diseases, leading to extensive societal and emotional
      consequences [<a href="#n3">3</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">While the causes of such behavior are no
      doubt complex, adverse experiences around birth (many of
      which are preventable) may change the course of brain
      development and predispose individuals to abnormal behavior.
      Indeed several investigations have correlated perinatal and
      neonatal complications with these adult psychopathologies
      Abnormal conditions around birth have been associated with
      behavioral and emotional problems during childhood [<a
      href="#n4">4-8</a>], major psychoses such as schizophrenia
      [<a href="#n9">9</a>], anxiety or depression, suicides in
      adolescence [<a href="#n13">13</a>] and adulthood [<a
      href="#n14">14, 15</a>], altered responses to pain [<a
      href="#n16">16-18</a>], or intractable pain states [<a
      href="#n19">19</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Much progress has been made in understanding
      the neurobiological basis for altered adult behavior
      resulting from experimental manipulations in the neonatal or
      perinatal period [<a href="#n20">20, 21</a>]. These elegant
      studies have mainly focused on neuroanatomical, hormonal, and
      neurochemical alterations in the adult brain casued by models
      of early experience, such as repetitive pain, sepsis, or
      maternal separation. However, changes occurring in the
      neonatal brain as a result of these experimental
      manipulations have been largely unexplored. As a result,
      little is known about the pathogenesis or underlying
      mechanisms that lead to the neurobiological or behavioral
      changes noted in adult animals. We propose novel hypotheses
      that may help to investigate the mechanisms leading to
      long-term changes in adult rat behavior, resulting from
      modification in brain structure and function during the
      neonatal period.</p>

      <h4>Long-Term Behavioral Sequelae Related to Perinatal
      Complications</h4>

      <p class="text2">Based on a cross-sectional case-control
      study comparing 412 suicide victims with 2,901 matched
      controls, Jacobson et al. [<a href="#n14">14</a>] related
      adult self-destructive behavior with the traumatic
      experiences around the birth of these individuals. They
      suggested that imprinting at birth may predispose individuals
      to certain patterns of behavior that remain masked throughout
      most of adult life, but may be triggered during conditions of
      extreme stress [<a href="#n14">14</a>]. In subsequent
      studies, these authors controlled for genetic, socioeconomic
      and demographic factors by using biological siblings as
      controls. For suicides committed by violent means (e.g., by
      using a firearm, jumping from a height or in front of a
      train, hanging and strangulation), the significant risk
      factors were those perinatal events that were likely to cause
      pain in the newborn [<a href="#n15">15</a>]. A composite
      score derived from factors such as forceps or vacuum
      delivery, presentation other than vertex, resuscitation and
      other neonatal complications was significantly correlated
      with adult suicide in male infants. [<a href="#n15">15</a>].
      Multiple risk factors markedly increased the likelihood of
      the male off-spring subsequently committing violent suicide
      (relative risk [RR] confidence intervals [CI] 1.8-13.0).
      Maternal opioid therapy during delivery reduced the risk for
      subsequent suicides (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.69), perhaps by
      making the infants less sensitive to the painful
      interventions at birth [<a href="#n15">15</a>]. Another study
      [<a href="#n13">13</a>] comparing 52 adolescents who
      committed suicide and 104 matched controls found that lack of
      antenatal care, chronic maternal disease during pregnancy,
      and neonatal respiratory compromise increased the risk for
      adolescent suicide (RR 3.42, 95% CI 1.87-5.30).</p>

      <p class="text2">Interestingly, sedatives given in the
      absence of painful interventions were noted to increase the
      risk for subsequent drug abuse. Administration of multiple
      doses of opiates, barbiturates and nitrous oxide to mothers
      during delivery were found to increase the occurrence of
      subsequent opiate (RR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-12.0, p = 0.002) or
      amphetamine (RR 5.6, 95% CI 1.6-16.9, p = 0.005) addiction in
      the offspring as compared to when no drug was given [<a
      href="#n22">22, 23</a>]. Obstetric factors had greater
      influence on future drug addiction than socioeconomic factors
      [<a href="#n24">24,25</a>] Neonatal hypoxia was not a
      significant risk factor in any of these studies [<a
      href="#n13">13-15</a>, <a href="#n22">22-25</a>] suggesting
      that such long-term effects were not associated with
      extensive brain damage. Conversely, maternal smoking during
      pregnancy showed a dose-response relationship with persistent
      criminal behavior in male offspring, after controlling for
      demographic, parental, and perinatal risk factors [<a
      href="#n26">26</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Full-term neonates who experienced stressful
      deliveries also showed increased behavioral responses to heel
      lancing and increased cortisol responses to vaccination at
      4-6 months age [<a href="#n27">27</a>]. Gunnar et al. [<a
      href="#n28">28, 29</a>] reported that infants born following
      obstetric complications showed altered responses to handling
      and an elevated adrenocortical response to a second heelstick
      performed 24 h later. Together these data suggest that
      prenatal or perinatal stress may enhance subsequent responses
      to stressful or painful events, and perhaps alter adult
      behavior.</p>

      <h4>Long-Term Neurobehavioral Effects Related to Neonatal
      Interventions</h4>

      <p class="text2">Early clinical interventions in human
      neonates have multiple long-term effects [<a
      href="#n30">30,31</a>] that can be briefly summarized here.
      Ex-premature infants often have more educational, behavioral
      and emotional difficulties during school age [<a
      href="#n32">32, 33</a>] and adolescence [<a
      href="#n7">7,8,34</a>] as compared to their ex-full term
      peers. There is not evidence relating these long-term
      outcomes to neonatal pain or stress, although such an
      association may be supported by preliminary findings from the
      clinical studies reviewed below.</p>

        diagram of the effects of neonatal brain and maternal
        separation on brain plasticity in the neonatal and
        long-term effects on subsequent brain development and

        isolation in the neonatal period may lead to decreased NMDA
        activity and increased apoptosis in multiple areas of the
        immature brain. These early changes will predispose
        individuals to develop a behavioral phenotype associated
        with anxiety and stress disorders during adult life. On the
        other hand, exposure to repetitive pain may cause execesive
        NMDA/EAA activation resulting in excitotoxic damage to
        developing neurons. These changes may promote a behavioral
        phenotype characterized by decreased pain sensitivity and
        hyperactivity during adult life. These two distinct
        behavioral phenotypes will resulted in impaired
        social/cognitive skills and specific patterns of
        self-destructive behavior.</span> </td>

      <p class="text2">Multiple invasive procedures in premature
      infants cause marked fluctuations in intracranial pressure
      leading to early intraventricular hemorrhage or
      periventricular leukomalacia [<a href="#n30">30</a>]. In
      preterm infants of 24-32 weeks gestation, the incidence of
      poor neurological outcomes (severe intraventricular
      hemorrhage, PVL, or neonatal death) were reduced by
      continuous infusions of low-dose morphine in a randomized
      clinical trial [<a href="#n35">35</a>]. Nursing interventions
      that provide comfort/analgesia were correlated with a
      decreased incidence of severe IVH and improved neurological
      and cognitive function during later infancy [<a
      href="#n36">36</a>]. Preterm neonates exposed to care in a
      neonatal intensive care unit for 4 weeks had increased
      physiological responses and diminished behavioral responses
      to heel lancing as compared to age-matched controls, and this
      pattern of responses was most strongly predicted by the
      number of painful procedures that the former group had
      received [<a href="#n37">37</a>].</p>

      reported that 18-month-old ex-preterm neonates were less
      sensitive to pain as compared with ex-full term infants. The
      greater the number of procedures they had experienced as
      neonates, the less responsive they were to pain during
      infancy [<a href="#n38">38</a>]. Altered behavior continued
      at older ages (4-5 years), with increased somatization in the
      ex-preterm infants [<a href="#n16">16</a>], and greater
      affective responses to depicted medical pain at the age of
      8-10 years [<a href="#n17">17</a>]. Thus exposure to painful
      stimuli may alter the responses to subsequent stimuli,
      implying that the clinical benefits of optimal pain
      management may persist well beyond the duration of
      therapeutic effects.</p>

      young infants can readily learn tasks and retain their
      responses over a period of several days [<a
      href="#n40">40</a>]. Together, these studies provide evidence
      for classical associative learning in both newborn animals
      and humans, and promote the possibility that memories for
      pain may be recorded biologically [<a href="#n41">41</a>],
      but are not accessible to conscious recall [<a
      href="#n40">40</a>]</p>

      <h4>Some aspects of Normal Neonatal Development</h4>

      <p class="text2">By themselves, the clinical correlations
      reviewed above are not sufficient to postulate the long-term
      effects of early experience. Corroborative data from animal
      experiments and mechanistic explanations of how abnormal
      sensory inputs in the neonatal period may lead to long-term
      changes in brain structure and behavior are necessary to
      substantiate these clinical observations. The following
      sections describe the impact of abnormal simulation in the
      newborn period within the context of maternal-infant
      interactions from human and animal experiments. We propose
      mechanistic hypotheses based on overstimulation or
      understimulation of newborns that may provide a plausible
      rationale for some of the clinical observations noted
      above.</p>

      <p class="text2">Figure 1 outlines some normal processes that
      regulate early brain development and abnormal sensory
      experiences that can alter the cellular mechanisms, the
      organization of stress-responsive systems, and subsequent
      behavior. The mechanisms for these phenomena can only be
      examined within the framework of what now constitutes normal
      stimulation for the newborn infant (associated with factors
      such as maternal-infant interaction [<a href="#n42">42</a>],
      neonatal painful stimulation [<a href="#n43">43</a>], brain
      growth and plasticity).</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Maternal-Infant Interaction</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies of
      newborn behavior have demonstrated a dynamic interactive
      process of the neonatal with its mother and environment [<a
      href="#n44">44-46</a>]. In this setting, both maternal and
      infants behaviors play pivotal roles in producing
      mother-infant bonding and providing optimal stimulation for
      development of the neonate's brain. It was proposed that the
      mother-infant relationship represents the prototype for
      relationship with the self and all other social relationships
      [<a href="#n47">47</a>], thus highlighting its importance in
      subsequent behavior.</p>

      <p class="text2">Maternal-infant interactions were examined
      by Bowlby [<a href="#n48">48-50</a>], who then proposed the
      general concepts of attachment theory. He described the
      response to maternal separation in two phases, a 'protest'
      phase representing highly activated attachment behavior, and
      a 'despair' phase to prepare the infant for passive survival
      through a combination of energy conservation and withdrawal
      from danger [<a href="#n48">48</a>]. Hofer [<a
      href="#n">42</a>] discovered the maternal regulators of
      infant physiology and behavior, and classified them into
      three categories: (a) thermal-metabolic, (b)
      nutrient-interoceptive, and (c) behavioral-sensorimotor.
      These regulated the infant's activity level, sucking
      behavior, oxygen consumption, sleep-wake states, circadian
      rhythms, as well as hormonal, cardiovascular, immune and
      neuroendocrine responses. From this perspective, infantile
      responses to maternal separation were viewed as resulting
      from a single mechanisms, that is, a release from maternal
      regulation. [<a href="#n42">42</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Kuhn and Schanberg [<a href="#n51">51</a>]
      noted that sensorimotor stimulation of the infant rat altered
      the regulation of growth hormone secretion, and Field [<a
      href="#n52">52</a>] reported the beneficial effects of
      tactile-kinesthetic stimulation on weight gain and
      development of preterm neonates. Recently these principles
      have helped to formulate 'kangaroo care' (placement of
      preterm neonates between their mother's breasts), which may
      provide additional physiological and neurodevelopmental
      benefits in critically ill neonates [<a href="#n53">53,
      54</a>]. Several lines of evidence underscore the importance
      of maternal care-giving practices on neonatal physiology and
      brain development, with similar results reported in a variety
      of species [<a href="#n42">42</a>]. The neonatal brain
      appears to be well equipped for the transmission and
      integration of all sensory stimuli (auditory, visual, and
      tactile) required for the developmental tasks in this time
      period.</p>

      <p class="text2">The long-term effects of physical handling
      or other enrichment paradigms in neonatal animals further
      substantiate the importance of early childhood experiences.
      For example, Pieretti et al. [<a href="#n55">55</a>] found
      that newborn mice removed from the dam for 10 min each day
      developed significantly higher latencies for the tail flick
      and hot plate tests at P25 and P45, and these effects were
      inhibited by naloxone pretreatment. The vast literature on
      the long-term effects of postnatal handling [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>, <a href="#n56">56-58</a>] suggests highly
      specific effects on adult behavior and cognitive ability.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Behavioral and Cognitive Activity of
      Human Newborns</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within hours
      after birth, human infants show significantly increased
      preferences for their mothers voice [<a href="#n59">59</a>],
      smell [<a href="#n60">60</a>], and facial features [<a
      href="#n61">61</a>] over those of a stranger. Term and
      preterm neonates actively regulate their behavioral states to
      maintain an optimum level of stimulation, and unstressed
      infants can smoothly transition from one behavioral state to
      another [<a href="#n62">62, 63</a>]. Even very premature
      neonates actively perceive, learn, and organize information
      [<a href="#n64">64</a>], while constantly striving to control
      their sensory input [<a href="#n62">62, 65</a>]. Preterm
      infants will mount a coordinated response to a painful
      stimulus [<a href="#n66">66, 67</a>] associated with changes
      in their arousal, behavior, and physiology [<a
      href="#n68">68, 69</a>]. Als et al. [<a href="#n70">70</a>]
      have noted that preterm infants actively approach and favor
      experiences that are developmentally supportive and actively
      avoid experiences that are developmentally disruptive. These
      behaviors support conservation of energy, sleep-wake cycles
      and the achievement of developmental milestones. Improved
      clinical and neuromaturational outcomes have resulted from
      developmentally supportive nursing care [<a href="#n36">36,
      71</a>] and 'kangaroo care' in preterm infants [<a
      href="#n54">54</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Increased Sensitivity to Pain in
      Neonates</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The traditional view
      that neonates were relatively insensitive to pain was refuted
      more than a decade ago. [<a href="#n66">66, 72</a>]. A
      comparative study of human infants and rat pups reported that
      withdrawal reflex thresholds increased during gestation and
      with postnatal age, suggesting lower pain thresholds at
      earlier developmental stages [<a href="#n73">73</a>].
      Multiple other studies have demonstrated that the intensity
      and duration of pain responses were developmentally regulated
      [<a href="#n74">74-77</a>]. Teng and Abbott [<a
      href="#n75">75</a>] found that thresholds for
      formalin-induced pain increased 2.4-fold from 3 to 15 days of
      age, and 11-fold from the newborn to the adult rat. Thermal
      stimulation using withdrawal latencies to a hot plate [<a
      href="#n76">76</a>] or tail flick [<a href="#n77">77</a>]
      also reported lower pain thresholds in the younger rats.
      Mechanisms underlying increased pain sensitivity in neonatal
      rat pups are summarized in table 1 and described elsewhere
      [<a href="#n78">78-81</a>]. The 2 weeks after birth in new
      born rat pups and the last trimester of human gestation
      represent critical windows for the organization of spinal
      cord mechanisms [<a href="#n78">78, 79</a>]. During these
      critical periods, the supraspinal transmission of pain
      impulses at is facilitated, whereas modification of these
      impulses is rudimentary. [<a href="#n82">82-84</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">For many years, cortical activity was not
      thought to be necessary for pain perception [<a
      href="#n85">85</a>]. Studies using positron emission
      tomography challenged these concepts by showing activation of
      the anterior cingulate cortex, primary somatosensory cortex,
      and the prefrontal cortex [<a href="#n86">86, 87</a>].
      Multiple lines of structural and functional evidence now
      support the role of cortical mechanisms for pain perception
      in adult humans and animals [<a href="#n88">88</a>]. Neonatal
      positron emission tomography scans also indentified
      somatosensory areas as the most active sites in the
      developing brain [<a href="#n89">89</a>]. By 24-26 weeks of
      gestation, putative nociceptive fibers from the
      ventroposterior thalamus have fully penetrated the primary
      somatosensory cortex, providing the final anatomical link for
      the developing pain/tactile system [<a href="#n90">90</a>].
      Cellular organization of the somatosensory cortex and other
      supraspinal areas during early development is largely
      determined by the initiation of incoming afferent activity
      and activity-dependent changes in gene expression.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Mechanisms of Neonatal Brain
      Plasticity</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel
      experiments in the somatosensor and visual cortex suggest
      that activity-dependent effects on gene expression underlie
      the establishment of cortical maps during development [<a
      href="#n91">91</a>]. Current data suggest complex
      interactions between early neonatal experience and the gene
      products controlling cellular and neurotransmitter
      development, which may lead to apoptosis in development in
      developing cortical neurons. For example, insulin-like growth
      factors and their receptors were most abundant in the sensory
      cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum [<a href="#n92">92</a>].
      Trophic factors such as IGF-1 promote neuronal survival and
      differentiation, whereas other trophic factors (such as BDNF,
      NT4/5, NT-3, via TrkB receptors) chemotactically stimulated
      the migration of embryonic neurons to their cortical targets
      [<a href="#n93">93</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The neonatal period is characterized by peak
      rates of brain growth [<a href="#n94">94, 95</a>] and
      cortical neurons are endowed with an exhuberant production of
      synaptic vesicles [<a href="#n96">96</a>]. During the
      processes of migration and differentiation, large numbers of
      neurons undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death from
      diverse areas of the developing cortex. Using
      semiquantitative methods, Rabinowitz et al. [<a
      href="#n97">97</a>] calculated that the number of neurons in
      the human cortex reaches a maximumat 28 weeks of gestation,
      then then declines by about 70% to achieve a stable number of
      neurons at birth. The lack of afferent inputs produced by the
      blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in
      developing neurons markedly accentuated the occurrence of
      apoptosis in the neonatal rat brain with the maximun effects
      occurring in 7-day-old (P7) rates [<a href="#n98">98</a>].
      Thus NMDA activity in the neonatal rat brain may be required
      for cell survival and the factors that regulate apoptosis in
      the neonatal brain would play important roles in the final
      development of the somatosensory cortex.</p>

      <p class="text2">The density of NMDA receptors increases
      postnatally reaching peak levels of expression in the
      neonatal brain [<a href="#n99">99, 100</a>]. Whole-cell
      patch-clamp analysis showed NMDA-induced Ca2+ currents
      developing at P7 whereas AMPA/KA-induced currents were larger
      and developed earlier [<a href="#n101">101</a>]. Depending on
      the cellular context, Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive
      Ca2+ channels increased cell survival, whereas Ca2+ influx
      via the MNDA receptors in postnatal neurons mediated
      excitotoxic cell death [<a href="#n102">102-104</a>]. The
      peak susceptibility to MNDA-mediated excitotoxicity occurred
      between P7 and P15, from accentuation of its metabolic
      effects [<a href="#n105">105, 106</a>] or reduction of the
      voltage-dependent Mg2+ block [<a href="#n">107</a>],
      potentially correlated with the expression of NMDA subunits
      in immature neurons [<a href="#n108">108</a>]. Permanent
      alterations in the structure of NMDA receptors occurred
      following exposure to neonatal hypoxic stress, resulting in
      increased susceptibility to NMDA-induced toxicity thereafter
      [<a href="#n109">109, 110</a>]. NMDA receptors play a central
      role in thte activity-dependent changes in dendritic length
      or spine density, synaptic stability, long-term potentiation
      (LTP) or depression, and other processes that mediate the
      heightened plasticicy of the neonatal brain. [<a
      href="#n82">82, 90, 111</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">NMDA-dependent mechanisms are not only
      implicated in the spinal transmission of pain but also in the
      long-term effects of pain (such as hyperalgesia, allodynia,
      windup, and central sensitization [<a href="#n">112</a>])
      leading to the pathogenesis of chronic pain states [<a
      href="#n113">113, 114</a>]. Accumulating evidence suggests
      that exposure to repetitive neonatal pain may promote an
      increased susceptibility to chronic pain states mediated by
      NMDA-dependent neuroplasticity [<a href="#n19">19</a>, <a
      href="#n115">115</a>]. Although intense research activity has
      focused on peripheral and spinal cord mechanisms that support
      these phenonema [<a href="#n114">114, 116</a>], we believe
      that the significant role of NMDA-mediated neuroplasticity in
      supraspinal areas remains unexplored. The following findings
      suggest such a role.</p>

      <p class="text2">Craig and Malenka [<a href="#n41">41</a>]
      demonstrated that projections from the ventrobasal thalamus
      to layer IV neurons in the somatosensory (S1) cortex are
      organized by NMDA-dependent LTP. Induction of LTP occurred in
      P3-P7 rats but was absent in P8-P14 rates [<a
      href="#n41">41</a>]. Further experiments showed that
      NMDA-mediated LTP is responsible for the learning and memory
      associated with classical fear conditioning [<a
      href="#n117">117, 118</a>], and that early experiences can
      modify the capacity for learning in the adult [<a
      href="#n119">119</a>]. It is particularly fascinating that
      the capacity for adult learning can be enhanced [<a
      href="#n119">119</a>] or inhibited [<a href="#n120">120,
      121</a>] by neonatal experiences. Thus it is plausible that
      the underlying templates for subsequent cognitive ability and
      vulverability to psychiatric disorders may be formed as a
      result of abnormal neonatal stimulation [<a href="#n9">9, 14,
      15</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Critical Periods of
      Vulnerability</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical periods of
      vulnerability occur just before and after birth, when the
      development of the underlying neoronal circuitry is more
      susceptible to pertubation than at any other time of life.
      Disruptive experiences at this time may have a greater impact
      on subsequent neurobiological and behavioral development [<a
      href="#n42">42, 47</a>]. There is increasing clinical
      appreciation for the long-term, often permanent effects of
      early sensory experiences on the patterns of subsequent
      behavior [<a href="#n">20</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">A search for critical periods may be aided
      by the ontogenetic changes in pain threshold during early
      development. Falcon et al. [<a href="#n77">77</a>] found that
      the nadir for thermal pain thresholds in infant rats occurred
      at P6 and similar age-related patterns were noted in
      thresholds for the cutaneous withdrawal reflex [<a
      href="#n73">73</a>] and foot-shock responses [<a
      href="#n122">122</a>]. When rat pups of different age groups
      (P4, P7, P14) were tested in different graded stimuli in our
      laboratory, the number of ultrasonic cries at P7 were
      significantly increased (ANOVA, F = 57.94, p &lt; 0.0001).
      Pain behaviors occurred in response to saline injections
      (0.01%) at all ages tested (P4, P7, P14). Thus, sensitivity
      to painful stimulation may be maximal in rat pups at 6-9 days
      of age, a period that corresponds with the neurological
      maturity of full term infants at birth.</p>

      <p class="text2">We postulate that a critical window of
      neonatal brain development occurs around the time of birth in
      human neonates and at 6-9 days in rat pups. This period also
      coincides with the peak rates of brain growth [<a
      href="#n95">95</a>] and an exuberant production of synaptic
      sites [<a href="#n96">96</a>]. At this time, the dorsal horn
      of the spinal cord and other supraspinal regions show a peak
      density of NMDA receptors [<a href="#n99">99, 100</a>],
      decreased thresholds for NMDA- or kainate-induced seizures
      [<a href="#n123">123</a>], an increased magnitude of Ca2+
      currents from NMDA activity [<a href="#n107">107</a>], and a
      greater susceptibility of brain cells to NMDO induced
      toxicity [<a href="#n102">102, 103, 124</a>]. Neonatal brain
      cells have altered molecular mechanisms for Ca2+ signalling
      [<a href="#n102">102</a>] which appear to determine neuronal
      survival, whereas blockade of NMDA receptors in this period
      causes widespread apoptosis [<a href="#n98">98</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Data related to normal brain development in
      the neonate reviewed above support the assertion that adverse
      sensory experience during the neonatal period may have
      widespread and far-ranging effects on subsequent
      developmental events. In the sections below, we examine the
      effects of overstimulation or understimulation in neonatal
      rat pups leading to permanent changes in adult behavior and
      cognitive ability.</p>

      <h4>Abnormal stimulation of the Newborn</h4>

      <p class="text2">Numerous animal experiments over the past 30
      years have demonstrated the long-term effects of early
      experience on subsequent behavior [<a href="#n21">21,
      125</a>]. These data suggest that both excessive sensory
      stimulation and the lack of appropriate stimulation in
      neonatal rats may lead to permanent changes in adult rat
      behavior, altered hormonal or immune responses to subsequent
      stress, associated with altered expression of
      neurotransmitters, their receptors, and/or other cellular
      processes associated with repetitive neonatal pain and
      maternal separation, used repetively as representative models
      of over-or understimulation.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Longterm effects of pain in neonatal
      rats</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-term effects
      of acute or repetive pain in neonatal rat pups have remained
      largely unexplored. Reynolds and Fitzgerald [<a
      href="#n126">126</a>] reported that skin wounds placed in
      newborn rates (at P0, P7) caused a marked hyper-innervation
      and decreased thresholds in the injured area lasting longer
      than 3 months after the injury. Nerve sprouting from A and C
      fibers was markedly increased around skin wounds place on the
      day of birth (P0) as compared with older ages, and was
      stimulated by nerve growth factor in older rats and unknown
      neurotrophic factors in the neonate [<a
      href="#n127">127</a>]. Neonatal rats subjected to
      carrageenan-induced inflammation on P1 developed a persistent
      expansion (by approximately 30%) in the receptive field of
      the dorsal horn neurons [<a href="#n128">128</a>], although
      the mechanisms mediating these changes remain unknown.</p>

      <p class="text2">Behavioral changes in rats following
      exposure to repetitive pain as neonates were first reported
      from our laboratory [<a href="#n129">129</a>]. Rat pups
      subjected to four needle pricks each day from P0 to P7 showed
      greater preference for alcohol as adults, increased defensive
      withdrawal and hyper-vigilance behavior. Interestingly, these
      animals had diminished neuronal activity in the somatosensory
      cortex following hot-plate exposure as compared to the adult
      rats receiving tactile stimulation as neonates. These results
      were correlated with greater exploratory and escape behavior
      seen in the tactile group, whereas the experimental animal's
      behavior was more reflective of fear conditioning [<a
      href="#n129">129</a>]. Further experiments showed that
      exposure to prolonged inflammatory pain (repetitive formalin
      injections in the neonatal period) was associated with
      decreased body weight, decreased pain sensitivity (hot plate
      tests), and decreased locomotor activity in the adult rat.
      Amongst the rats exposed to neonatal pain, adult females had
      increased alcohol preference and consumption as compared to
      males, consistent with our previous findings from repetitive
      acute pain [<a href="#n129">129</a>]. These preliminary
      results suggest that neonatal pain leads to an increased
      expression (and/or coupling) of opiod receptors in adult rats
      [<a href="#n128">128</a>], which is increased preference for
      sucrose [<a href="#n130">130, 131</a>], decreased pain
      sensitivy, and the normalization of locomotor activity by
      concomitant morphine treatment in neonatal rats [<a
      href="#n132">132</a>]. When morphine preceded the neonatal
      formalin injections, it was noted to reverse or ameliorate
      the long-term effects from exposure to neonatal inflammatory
      pain. Thus, the persistent behavioral changes from repetitive
      neonatal pain depend on the type of stimulation (needle prick
      vs. inflammation), age at the time of stimulation, concurrent
      treatment with opioids, and perhaps other unexplored factors.
      The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these changes are
      the focus of intense reseach activity.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Longterm Effects of Maternal
      Separation</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prolonged maternal
      separation leads to the development of exaggerated hormonal
      responses and altered neurotransmitter release, which is
      qualitatively different from the effects of postnatal
      handling [<a href="#n133">133, 134</a>]. Persistent effects
      of maternal separation occurred only if the daily separation
      paradigm exceeded 180 min [<a href="#n56">56</a>], leading to
      elevated baseline and stress-induced plasma corticosterone
      levels, and reduced efficiency of glucocorticoid negative
      feedback in adult rats [<a href="#n56">56, 135</a>]. Repetive
      maternal separation in neonatal rats was associated with
      accentuated stress responses, increased vulnerabity to stress
      and anxiety disorders, neophobia, early development of
      diabetes, hypertension, cognitive defects, and shorter life
      spans in adult rats [<a href="#n136">136, 137</a>]. Adult
      rats isolated as neonates for 1 h/day from P2 to P9 had
      reduced susceptibility to an amphetamine challenge [<a
      href="#n138">138</a>]. Enhanced amphetamine effects were
      associated with elevated dopamine levels in the ventral
      stratum, possibly linked to pertubations of the dopamine
      receptor systems as a result of isolation [<a
      href="#n139">139</a>]. Early isolation may contribute to the
      sensitization of reward mechanisms in adult animals, from
      changes in the dopaminergic mesolimbocortical pathways [<a
      href="#n140">140, 141</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Any links between the animal experimental
      data reviewed above and recent epidemiological data on the
      long-term effects of perinatal or neonatal complications are
      speculative at best. <i>How do adverse neonatal experiences
      lead to long-term changes in behavior and brain function?</i>
      For these relationships to be investigated rigorously, the
      potential mechanisms by which the experimental findings can
      be applied to explain such preliminary data must be
      understood. Answers to such questions will not only help to
      understand the mechanisms by which long-term effects are
      produced, but will also define the clinical importance of
      interventions that treat or reduce the impact of abnormal
      stimulation.</p>

      <h4>Proposed Cellular Mechanisms</h4>

      <p class="text2">We propose two novel hypotheses that can be
      tested in the laboratory to explain the link between
      perinatal sensory experiences and adult behavior: (a)
      excessive neonatal stimulation resulting from perinatal
      trauma or other insults causes NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity
      in multiple areas of the developing brain, and (b) lack of
      appropriate sensory stimulation in the neonatal period serves
      to enhance the normal occurrence of developmental apoptosis
      in the neonatal brain.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Excitotoxicity Hypothesis</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prolonged pain
      causes excessive activation of central afferent pain
      pathways. This activation leads to release of glutamate and
      other excitatory neurotransmitters from spinal and
      supraspinal neurons. Binding of glutamate to metabatrophic
      and NMDA receptors causes removal of the MG2+ block and
      allows intracellular Ca2+ influx, ultimately leading to the
      phosphorylation of second messengers and altered gene
      regulation. NMDA-induced neuroplasticity is known to mediate
      the wind-up and central sensitization of pain pathways [<a
      href="#n112">112-115</a>]. It is evident that these phenomena
      are accentuated and prolonged in the developing nervous
      system [<a href="#n19">19</a>, <a href="#n101">101-107</a>,
      <a href="#n112">112-115</a>], although the supraspinal
      excitotoxic effects of pain-related NMDA activity have not
      been investigated in immature animals.</p>

      <p class="text2">We hypothesize that repetitive neonatal pain
      causes excessive NMDA activation leading to excitotoxic
      damage in the brain regions noted above. Figure 2 illustrates
      the well-known phenomenon of NMDA-mediated excitotoxity [<a
      href="#n142">142</a>]. Repetitive pain exacerbates
      excitotoxic damage, which may extend to adjacent neurons via
      nitric oxide and products of cell necrosis [<a
      href="#n112">112-115</a>]. Structural and functional changes
      in the NMDA receptor may increase the neonates sensitivity to
      future excitotoxic insults. Furthermore, NMDA
      receptor-mediated intracellular changes [<a
      href="#n101">101-103</a>] may lead to the development of
      hyperalgesic states by increasing the efficacy of NMDA
      receptor-activated Ca2+ channels. We predict that cumulative
      neuronal damage from repetitive pain during infancy results
      in abnormal behavior regulation during adolescence and adult
      life.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Apoptosis Hypothesis</i><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current
      mechanisms of apoptosis and their interaction with NMDA and
      opioid receptor systems is illustrated in figure 3. Apoptosis
      or programmed cell death is mediated by the stimulation of
      multiple cell surface receptors (e.g. death receptors DR1,
      DR2, DR3, DR4, DR5) or by the internal activation of reactive
      oxygen species, mitochondrial damage, or
      Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent mechanisms. The most prominent
      initiators of apoptosis include the binding of Fas ligand to
      CD95 (Fas/Apo 1/DR1), release of cytochrome C from
      mitochondria, or binding of tumor necrosis factor to its
      receptor (TNFR1), which activate the initator caspase enzymes
      (e.g., caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7) which, in essence,
      rapidly dismantle the organelles and genetic machinery of the
      cell. Caspase enzymes are differentially expressed in
      different tissues, and caspase-3 serves as the main effector
      enzyme in neurons. In situ hybridization histochemistry
      revealed a profound developmental regulation of the caspase-3
      transcript in rat brain, with relatively high levels of
      caspase-3 mRNA observed in neurons of the fetal and neonatal
      brain and low levels of mRNA in neurons of the adult brain
      [<a href="#n143">143</a>]. Spatial and temporal distributions
      of apoptotic cells in developing rodents showed an inverse

      reported recently that NMDA receptor blockade results in
      widespread activation of neuronal apoptosis in rat pups, and
      the peak effect occurred on P7. These data are consistent
      with previous reports suggesting that NMDA activation
      promotes the survival of developing neurons [<a
      href="#n104">104</a>]. These recent findings led us to
      hypothesize that the adverse behavioral effects of isolation
      may be mediated by aberrant regulation of apoptosis in the
      neonatal brain. Lack of stimulation from the environment will
      reduce afferent activity and may interfere with the
      ontogenetic regulation of apoptosis, leading to long-term
      behavior changes. The anatomical distribution of apoptosis
      resulting from isolation may be different from that
      determined by NMDA blockade and has not been
      investigated.</p>

      <h4>Clinical significance</h4>

      <p class="text2">The mechanisms of excitotoxicity and
      apoptosis described above must be explored to define whether
      abnormal stimulation around birth may predispose individuals
      to an number of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders. If
      the findings from epidemiological studies that have
      correlated early experiences and adult self-destructive
      behavior can be explained by patterns of increased
      excitotoxicity or apoptosis, novel therapeutic strategies can
      be developed [<a href="#n146">146</a>]. The clinical
      importance of these mechanisms lies in the prevention of
      early insults, developing effective treatments for neonatal
      pain and stress, and the discovery of novel therapeutic
      approaches that limit neuronal excitotoxicity or apoptosis.
      It would also be important to identify and provide such early
      intervention for children or adolescents who have been
      exposed to such perinatal or neonatal conditions. [<a
      href="#n4">4-11</a>]. For example, recent data suggest that
      environmental enrichment during development reduces
      spontaneous apoptotic cell death and protects against
      kainate-induced excitotoxicity [<a href="#n147">147</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The public health importance of abnormal
      stimulation during the neonatal period cannot be
      overemphasized. While programs for formulating appropriate
      health policies and public education campaigns must
      disseminate this message, it is also important for these
      effects to be investigated, particularly with a view to
      developing effective therapeutic strategies for the growing
      childen and adolescents who were exposed to abnormal
      conditions during the neonatal period.</p>
