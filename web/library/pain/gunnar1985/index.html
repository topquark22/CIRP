        Measures of behavioral state and plasma cortisol were
        obtained on 80 healthy, full-term, 2-3-day-old, male
        newborns who were scheduled to be circumcised. To establish
        baseline or precircumcision levels, the newborns were
        observed, and behavioral state was recorded for the half
        hour prior to circumcision. Blood was sampled via heelstick
        for plasma cortisol determination at the end of the
        observation period. The newborns were then circumcised and
        assigned randomly to one of 4 postcircumcision time-point
        groups. The time points were 30, 90, 120, and 240 min
        following the beginning of circumcision. Behavioral state
        was observed during circumcision and for the half hour
        prior to taking the second blood sample. The results showed
        a return to baseline cortisol levels sometime prior to 240
        min, with data from an additional group of 10 newborns
        indicating that the return occurred by 150 min. Behavioral
        distress during circumcision was associated with levels in
        plasma cortisol at 30 and 90 min. Quiet sleep was
        correlated negatively with plasma cortisol prior to
        circumcision, and significant increases in quiet sleep
        followed circumcision, with the greatest increase
        corresponding to the periods of most rapid reductions in
        cortisol.</p>
