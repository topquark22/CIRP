      <font size="+3">Neonatal circumcision and penile dorsal
      nerve<br />
       block&mdash;a painless procedure</font> 

      <p><i>Circumcision is the only surgical procedure, excluding
      cord clamping and cutting, which is routinely performed on
      normal, healthy newborn infants, usually during the first two
      or three days of life. Apparently no analgesic technique has
      been described nor suggested in association with neonatal
      circumcision. This is the first description of a technique of
      penile dorsal nerve block in neonatal circumcision. In 52
      instances using 0.5 ml of 1% lidocaine (Xylocaine) and a 1.2
      cm number 27 gauge needle PDNB was successfully and safely
      introduced with consistent elimination of pain rendering NC a
      painless surgical procedure.</i></p>

      <p><b>Christopher Kirya, M.B., Ch.B, D.C.H.,* and</b></p>

      <p><b>Milton W. Werthman, Jr., M.D., F.A.A.P.,</b>
      <i>Washington, D.C.</i></p>
      <br />
       

      <p>Circumcision has been practiced for centuries, being known
      in the era of the Pharaohs.<sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup>
      In different parts of the world it is performed for different
      reasons.<sup><a href="#n5">5-9</a></sup> Whatever these may
      be, little if any attention has been paid to the pain endured
      by the infant, and consequently, elimination of this
      pain.</p>

      <p>Anyone who circumcises a neonate, using any of the
      available techniques, sense the pain and stress that the
      manipulative stages of this procedure generate.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9-11</a></sup> During the procedure when the
      prepuce is clamped with the mosquito forceps, the infant
      cries vigorously, trembles, and tries to wriggle out of the
      restraint. He may eventually become plethoric, dusky, and
      mildly cyanotic because of the prolonged crying.
      Occasionally, this results in respiratory pauses or
      regurgitation of feedings. A pacifier may be offered or in
      some other rituals, a little wine is given to the baby, in
      the probable expectation that the procedure might be
      tolerable.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>The concept of regional nerve block is not new. It was the
      desire to extend this method of pain relief to the newborn
      infant, which prompted the development of this technique of
      PDNB for NC.</p>

      <p>The equipment for the procedure is standard with the
      addition of a syringe, a 1.2 cm No. 27 guage needle, and 1%
      lidocaine (Xylocaine) <i>without epinephrine</i>.</p>

      <p>ANATOMY OF THE PENIS</p>

      <p>A brief review of the anatomy of the penis is indicated
      before the technique is described. The penis has two main
      nerves. Despite being bilateral the nerves are designated
      dorsal nerves and the vessels as dorsal vein and dorsal
      artery as shown in Fig. 1.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Abbreviations used<br />
        NC: neonatal circumcision<br />
        PNDB: penile dorsal nerve block
      </blockquote>

      <p>At the penile root the nerves emerge between the dorsal
      and Colles fascia in almost one sheath on either side of the
      penis. The surface anatomy of these two dorsal nerves
      corresponds to 10 and 2 o'clock positions at the root of the
      penis. Ramifications of these nerves usually commence 1 cm
      distal to the penile root. The ideal site for PDNB is just
      proximal to these ramifications.</p>

        <p><b>Fig 1.</b> Cross-section of the anatomy of the penile
        root.</p>
      </center>

      <h3>TECHNIQUE</h3>

      <p>Using the equipment previously described and using aseptic
      precautions, the 10 and 2 o'clock areas are identified and
      the depth of the penile root into the pubis is established.
      This identification is important because it will dictate the
      approximate point distal to the penile root (0.5 cm) into
      which the infiltration is to be made. It may be necessary in
      an occasional infant whose penile root is embedded in pubic
      fat, to block the nerves at the junction of the pubic and
      penile skin.</p>

      <p>Stabilizing the organ with gentle traction of the skin of
      the penis, at an angle of about 20 to 25 degrees, the skin is
      pieced at one of the dorsolateral positions and the needle
      advanced postermedially into the subcutaneous tissue (Fig.
      2). The depth of the needle need not be more than 0.25 to 0.5
      cm. There should be no further resistance felt after the skin
      is penetrated, the tip of the needle remaining freely
      movable. At this point infiltration of 0.2 to 0.4 ml of 1%
      lidocaine is made, taking great care to avoid accidental
      vascular injection. Under no circumstances should the
      infiltration be made as the needle is advanced or withdrawn.
      The same procedure is repeated at the other dorsolateral
      position.</p>

      <p>Inevitably, since the penis is small, a circular lidocaine
      ring is formed and PDNB accomplished. The penis and prepuce
      should be insensitive to pain or pressure after two to three
      minutes.</p>

      <p>It is emphasized that the total volume of lidocaine is
      should not exceed 0.8 ml, since a large volume could cause
      pressure to the organ with subsequent theoretical necrosis.
      The same concern obtains in regard to hematoma formation.</p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <p>Fifty-two infants were circumcised after PDNB. One percent
      lidocaine volume ranged between 0.4 to 0.8 ml with an average
      of 0.5 ml. In all but two infants the response was excellent,
      demonstrated by too distal an injection on the left, since
      the child responded to painful stimuli with the application
      of forceps on that side only</p>

      <p>Bleeding at the injection site did not occur, except in
      one case in which the right superficial dorsal vein was
      penetrated.</p>

      <p>In all infants the lidocaine induced subcutaneous swelling
      at the penile root had disappeared in less than 24 hours
      after the procedure. Neither hematoma nor volume-induced
      pressure were observed.</p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p>To feel pain is one of the functions of normality, and
      every normal neonatel feels pain. The belief that infants "do
      not feel pain" or "won't remember it anyway" reflect concepts
      which cannot be substantiated. Nothing is known of the
      long-term effects of painful experiences sustained in the
      neonatal period on the subsequent shaping and realization of
      an infant's potential. Circumcision is painful and
      consequently stressful. Behavioral state in relation to
      stressful stimuli has been studied in the newborn infant and
      the endocrine response (adrenal) has been documented.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,12</a></sup> Using PDNB, the neonate can be
      spared the pain of circumcision and its consequent stress.
      The technique developed and described herein virtually
      abolishes circumcision pain as shown by a quiet child during
      the operation.</p>

      <p>No complications or untoward effects of lidocaine were
      encountered. The effect of lidocaine wore off completely
      within 30 minutes. The complications of circumcision
      described by others were not seen in this group.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13-17</a></sup></p>

      <p>Caution must be exercised in introducing the 27 guage
      needle, lest an occasional large superficial vein be
      accidentally punctured. Also, too vertical an introduction of
      the needle can cause the tip to lodge in the erectile tissue.
      This would result in firm fixation of the needle tip and not
      the loose mobility characteristic of proper sub-cutaneous
      placement. Hematomas are avoided and volume-induced pressure
      is not evident since the quantity of lidocaine is small.</p>

      <p>Until now, circumcision was known to both parents and
      doctor to be quite painful; hence, rarely were parents
      allowed to witness the procedure. Since the introduction of
      PDNB, marked relief is evident in the parents who either
      attend the ceremony or are invited to witness the
      circumcision. The response of the infants makes pain
      suppression desirable.</p>
