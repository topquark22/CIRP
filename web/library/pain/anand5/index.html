      <div class="title"><b>Consensus
      Statement for the Prevention and Management of Pain in the
      Newborn</b></div>

      <p class="text1"><i>K. J. S. Anand, MBBS,
      DPhil; and the International Evidence-Based Group for
      Neonatal Pain</i></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Objective</b> &nbsp; To
      develop evidence-based guidelines for preventing or treating
      neonatal pain and its adverse consequences. Compared with
      older children and adults, neonates are more sensitive to
      pain and vulnerable to its long-term effects. Despite the
      clinical importance of neonatal pain, current medical
      practices continue to expose infants to repetitive, acute, or
      prolonged pain.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Design</b> &nbsp; Experts
      representing several different countries, professional
      disciplines, and practice settings used systematic reviews,
      data synthesis, and open discussion to develop a consensus on
      clinical practices that were supported by published evidence
      or were commonly used, the latter based on extrapolation of
      evidence from older age groups. A practical format was used
      to describe the analgesic management for specific invasive
      procedures and for ongoing pain in neonates.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Results</b> &nbsp;
      Recognition of the sources of pain and routine assessments of
      neonatal pain should dictate the avoidance of recurrent
      painful stimuli and the use of specific environmental,
      behavioral, and pharmacological interventions. Individualized
      care plans and analgesic protocols for specific clinical
      situations, patients, and health care settings can be
      developed from these guidelines. By clearly outlining areas
      where evidence is not available, these guidelines may also
      stimulate further research. To use the recommended
      therapeutic approaches, clinicians must be familiar with
      their adverse effects and the potential for drug
      interactions.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Conclusion</b> &nbsp;
      Management of pain must be considered an important component
      of the health care provided to all neonates, regardless of
      their gestational age or severity of illness.</p>
