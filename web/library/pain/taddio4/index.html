      <p><b>CONTEXT:</b> Hospitalized infants undergo repeated
      invasive procedures. It is unknown whether cumulative
      experiences with pain lead to anticipatory pain behaviors and
      hyperalgesia.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To determine whether newborns who are
      born to mothers with diabetes and undergo repeated pain learn
      to anticipate pain and exhibit more pain during a painful
      procedure than normal infants.</p>

      <p><b>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:</b> Prospective
      cohort study of 21 full-term newborns born to mothers with
      diabetes and 21 born to mothers with uneventful pregnancies,
      at a university teaching hospital between August 1999 and
      October 2000. Infants of diabetic mothers underwent repeated
      heel lances in the first 24 to 36 hours of life for
      monitoring of blood glucose concentrations. Pain responses of
      all infants undergoing a venipuncture on the dorsum of the
      hand to obtain blood for the newborn screening test after the
      first day of life were compared. In addition, from September
      through November 2001, 12 infants of diabetic mothers and 12
      normal infants were compared for pain reactions to
      intramuscular vitamin K injection after birth.</p>

      <p><b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:</b> Percentages of time observed
      grimacing and crying and visual analog scale (VAS)
      scores.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Raters were blinded to exposure group.
      Median baseline scores for grimacing, crying time, and VAS
      did not differ significantly between groups (P =.27, P =.32,
      and P =.32, respectively). Median scores (interquartile
      range) for grimacing during skin cleansing were higher in
      infants of diabetic mothers (22.2% [77.5%] vs 0% [15%]; P
      =.03). The VAS scores for both groups were zero, but the
      distribution of the scores was significantly different (86%
      of normal infants vs 52% of infants of diabetic mothers had
      scores of zero) (P =.04). During venipuncture, infants of
      diabetic mothers had higher median scores for grimacing
      (81.7% [32.5%] vs 40% [73.4%]; P =.01), VAS (69% [27.5%] vs
      5% [60.5%]; P =.002), and crying (40.2% [77%] vs 0% [54.8%];
      P =.03) compared with normal infants. There were no
      differences between groups on any pain measure in response to
      intramuscular injection.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Newborns who had
      diabetic mothers and were exposed to repeated heel lances in
      the first 24 to 36 hours of life learned to anticipate pain
      and exhibited more intense pain responses during venipuncture
      than normal infants.</span></p>
