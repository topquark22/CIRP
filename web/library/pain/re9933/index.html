      <p class="text1"><b>ABSTRACT. Acute pain is one of the most
      common adverse stimuli experienced by children, occurring as
      a result of injury, illness, and necessary medical
      procedures. It is associated with increased anxiety,
      avoidance, somatic symptoms, and increased parent distress.
      Despite the magnitude of effects that acute pain can have on
      a child, it is often inadequately assessed and treated.
      Numerous myths, insufficient knowledge among caregivers, and
      inadequate application of knowledge contribute to the lack of
      effective management. The pediatric acute pain experience
      involves the interaction of physiologic, psychologic,
      behavioral, developmental, and situational factors. Pain is
      an inherently subjective multifactorial experience and should
      be assessed and treated as such. Pediatricians are
      responsible for eliminating or assuaging pain and suffering
      in children when possible. To accomplish this, pediatricians
      need to expand their knowledge, use appropriate assessment
      tools and techniques, anticipate painful experiences and
      intervene accordingly, use a multimodal approach to pain
      management, use a multidisciplinary approach when possible,
      involve families, and advocate for the use of effective pain
      management in children.</b></p>

      Pediatrics; APS, American Pain Society.</font></p>

      <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

      <p class="text2">An important responsibility of physicians
      who care for children is eliminating or assuaging pain and
      suffering when possible. It has been well documented,
      however, that in this regard a substantial percentage of
      children have been undertreated.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The most common type of pain
      experienced by children is acute pain resulting from injury,
      illness, or, in many cases, necessary medical procedures.
      There is extensive literature that describes how to evaluate
      and treat acute pain in children using low-cost, widely
      available, convenient, and safe methods; this information,
      however, has not been readily applied.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although this statement focuses on acute
      pain, it is the obligation of primary care physicians,
      general pediatricians, pediatric surgeons, and pediatric
      subspecialists to recognize and address all types of pain,
      including acute pain, chronic pain, recurring pain,
      procedure-related pain, and pain associated with terminal
      illness. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the
      American Pain Society (APS) jointly issue this statement to
      underscore the responsibility of pediatricians to take a
      leadership and advocacy role to ensure humane and competent
      treatment of pain and suffering in all infants, children, and
      adolescents.</p>

      <p class="text2">A major aim of pain treatment is to
      eliminate pain-associated suffering. Pain is an inherently
      subjective experience and should be assessed and treated as
      such. <span class="yellow">Pain has sensory, emotional,
      cognitive, and behavioral components that are interrelated
      with environmental, developmental, sociocultural, and
      contextual factors. Suffering occurs when the pain leads the
      person to feel out of control, when the pain is overwhelming,
      when the source of the pain is unknown, when the meaning of
      the pain is perceived to be dire, and when the pain is
      chronic.</span><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> The concepts of
      pain and suffering go well beyond that of a simple sensory
      experience.</p>

      <p class="text2">Barriers to the treatment of pain in
      children include the following: 1) the myth that children,
      especially infants, do not feel pain the way adults do, or if
      they do, there is no untoward consequence; 2) lack of
      assessment and reassessment for the presence of pain; 3)
      misunderstanding of how to conceptualize and quantify a
      subjective experience; 4) lack of knowledge of pain
      treatment; 5) the notion that addressing pain in children
      takes too much time and effort; and 6) fears of adverse
      effects of analgesic medications, including respiratory
      depression and addiction. Personal values and beliefs of
      health care professionals about the meaning and value of pain
      in the development of the child (eg, the belief that pain
      builds character) and about the treatment of pain cannot
      stand in the way of the optimal recognition and treatment of
      pain for all children.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although the AAP and the APS support the
      ethical mandate to treat appropriately all pediatric pain and
      suffering, this policy statement focuses on common acute pain
      experiences. Most acute pain experienced in medical settings
      can be prevented or substantially relieved. Comprehensive
      pediatric care considers all aspects of distress and also
      should address these aspects in a compassionate, effective,
      timely, and multidimensional manner. Anxieties that are
      experienced by children and other symptoms that contribute to
      suffering need to be considered in the treatment plan for
      pain. Effective pain management thus generally involves an
      interdisciplinary therapeutic approach with a combination of
      pharmacologic, cognitive-behavioral, psychologic, and
      physical treatments.</p>

      <p><b>PAIN ASSESSMENT</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Health care professionals should anticipate
      predictable painful experiences and monitor the condition of
      patients accordingly. To treat pain adequately, ongoing
      assessment of the presence and severity of pain and the
      child's response to treatment is essential. Reliable, valid,
      and clinically sensitive assessment tools are available for
      neonates through adolescents.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      In a hospital setting, pain and response to treatment,
      including adverse effects, should be monitored routinely and
      documented clearly and in a visible place, such as on the
      vital sign sheet, to facilitate treatment and communication
      among health care professionals.</p>

      <p class="text2">Pain can be assessed using self-report,
      behavioral observation, or physiologic measures, depending on
      the age of the child and his or her communication
      capabilities. Specific measures vary in their validity and
      usefulness. Accurate acute pain assessment requires
      consideration of the plasticity and complexity of children's
      pain perception, the influence of psychologic and
      developmental factors, and the appreciation of the potential
      severity and specific types of pain experienced.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Because pain is a subjective
      experience, individual self-report is often favored; however,
      it is important to be sure that children, particularly those
      between 3 and 7 years of age, are competent to provide
      information before their report of location, quality,
      intensity, and tolerability are accepted. Observation of
      behavior should be used to complement self-report and can be
      an acceptable alternative when valid self-report is not
      available.</p>

      <p class="text2">When communication is difficult, personal
      assumption by health care professionals on the meaning of the
      behavior should be examined carefully. Pain expression
      reflects the physical and emotional state, coping style, and
      family and cultural expectations and can be misinterpreted by
      the health care professional. For example, stoic or depressed
      children with severe pain may not report or show expected
      behavioral evidence of the severity of the pain. Pain
      experienced by children with special health care needs or
      developmental disabilities may be particularly difficult to
      assess accurately. Careful and thorough assessments are
      necessary when communication with the patient may be
      problematic, as may be the case with children who are
      cognitively impaired, severely emotionally disturbed, or
      impaired in sensory or motor modalities. Cultural and
      language differences between the child and health care
      professional also require additional care in assessment. When
      such patients are unable to report pain, credible assessment
      usually can be obtained from the parent or another person who
      knows the child well. However, there is a relatively
      pervasive and systematic tendency for proxy judgments to
      underestimate the pain experience of others. Physiologic
      measures should be recognized as usually reflecting stress
      reactions during acute pain and usually are only tenuously
      correlated with self-report of pain.</p>

      <p><b>PROCEDURE-RELATED PAIN</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The key to managing procedure-related pain
      and distress is anticipation. The approach to procedural pain
      varies according to the anticipated intensity and duration of
      expected pain, the context and meaning as seen by the child
      and family, the coping style and temperament of the child,
      the type of procedure, the child's history of pain, and the
      family support system. Procedures should be performed by
      persons with sufficient technical expertise or who are
      directly supervised by individuals with technical expertise
      so that pain is minimized to the greatest extent possible.
      Children and parents should receive appropriate information
      about what to expect and appropriate preparation about how to
      minimize distress. It is advisable in appropriate situations
      to have parents present and prepared with specific ways of
      comforting their children.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6,7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The treatment approach should be multimodal
      and meet the child's needs. Depending on the nature of the
      procedure and characteristics of the child, optimal pain
      control may be obtained with interventions ranging from deep
      sedation and anesthesia to strategies aimed at facilitating
      competent coping with the procedure in ways that enhance
      self-esteem with little or no pharmacologic support.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Cognitive behavioral strategies that
      involve the use of imagery, relaxation, and self-regulation
      can provide pain relief independently or in conjunction with
      other pain management modalities.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,8</a></sup> Other complementary approaches, such
      as massage or use of heat compresses, may be beneficial.
      Strategies that reduce distress and worry for parents and
      children have been associated with reductions in children's
      report of pain sensation and observations of their pain
      behavior. For each of these approaches, a quiet environment,
      calm adults, and clear, confident instructions increase the
      likelihood that the specific pain management strategy
      selected will be effective.</p>

      <p class="text2">Local anesthetics and strategies to soothe
      and minimize distress should be considered even for simple
      procedures, such as venipuncture. <span class="yellow">Some
      common painful minor procedures, such as circumcision, do not
      always receive the warranted attention to comfort issues.
      Available research indicates that newborn circumcisions are a
      significant source of pain during the procedure and are
      associated with irritability and feeding disturbances during
      the days afterward.</span><sup><a href="#n9">9-11</a></sup>
      Opportunities for alleviating pain exist before, during, and
      after the procedure, and many interventions are
      effective.<sup><a href="#n12">12-17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">For procedural pain that is predictably
      severe and for which local measures give inadequate relief,
      such as for bone marrow aspirations, the use of systemic
      agents is required to bring pain to acceptable levels. The
      use of anxiolytics or sedatives alone for painful procedures
      does not provide analgesia but makes a child less able to
      communicate distress. The child still experiences pain during
      the procedure, and there are no data on the short- or
      long-term sequelae of this strategy. When it is necessary to
      use sedation and analgesia for painful procedures, the
      guidelines issued by the AAP<sup><a
      href="#n18">18,19</a></sup> should be followed. These
      guidelines recommend that sedation be conducted in a
      monitored setting with resuscitative drugs and equipment
      available and that agents be administered by a competent
      person. The guidelines stipulate that one person is assigned
      to monitor the child's condition and another qualified person
      is present to respond to medical emergencies.</p>

      <p><b>OPERATIVE PAIN AND TRAUMA-ASSOCIATED PAIN</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The study of operative and postoperative
      pain has contributed enormously to the understanding of
      effective assessment and treatment of pain, and this
      knowledge can be applied to many other areas of pediatric
      pain management.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Data support
      the concept that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by
      good pain treatment.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> Although
      there have been sophisticated technologic advances in
      postoperative pain treatment, such as epidural
      anesthesia<sup><a href="#n21">21-23</a></sup> and
      patient-controlled analgesia,<sup><a
      href="#n24">24,25</a></sup> most postoperative pain in
      children also can be treated effectively in a simple,
      cost-effective manner by the pediatrician and other health
      care professionals without advanced techniques.</p>

      <p class="text2">Plans for postoperative pain management
      should be discussed with the family and generated before
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Basic elements of
      pharmacologic treatment include type of analgesic, dose,
      timing, and routes of delivery. Postoperative pain management
      encompasses the use of different classes of drugs, including
      opioids and nonopioid analgesics. Opioids, such as fentanyl
      citrate, morphine sulfate, and hydromorphone hydrochloride,
      are indicated to manage moderate to severe postoperative
      pain. Meperidine hydrochloride, because of metabolic products
      and adverse effects, is not an opioid of choice for the
      management of pain.<sup><a href="#n7">7,26</a></sup> The use
      of other analgesics, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory agents in combination with opioids, can
      reduce the amount of opioid required.</p>

      <p class="text2">Starting doses of analgesics for children
      are provided in the Agency for Health Care Policy and
      Research<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> guidelines on acute
      pain management. Analgesic treatment should include proper
      dosing according to body weight, physiologic development, and
      the medical situation. The goal is to control the pain as
      rapidly as possible, and thus, the starting dose should be
      optimal and further doses should be titrated depending on
      patient response. Administration of multiple, small,
      ineffective doses of analgesic may result in the prolongation
      of pain, exacerbation of anxiety, and even severe adverse
      effects of the analgesic, such as respiratory depression.</p>

      <p class="text2">Early effective treatment is safer and more
      efficacious than delayed treatment and results in improved
      patient comfort and possibly less total analgesic
      administered. Except in extenuating circumstances, medication
      should not be given intramuscularly, because it is painful
      and absorption can be variable. Oral administration is
      preferred for mild to moderate pain. When the child needs
      immediate pain relief, intravenous administration is
      indicated when regional routes are not appropriate or readily
      available. For moderate to severe pain expected to persist,
      continuous dosing or around-the-clock dosing at fixed
      intervals is recommended; there are few indications for an
      as-needed regimen used alone. Dosages and the interval
      between doses should be adjusted on the basis of assessment
      of the patient's response.</p>

      <p class="text2">Addressing the adverse effects of opioid
      use, such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus, is important to
      minimize distress and to ensure that adequate pain management
      is not compromised. Anticipated common adverse effects
      associated with prolonged opioid use (eg, constipation)
      should be prevented or promptly treated. The potential
      synergistic sedative effects of analgesics, anxiolytics,
      antiemetics, and antihistamines require ongoing assessment of
      sedation and analgesia. As the child recovers from painful
      surgery, the analgesic regimen is changed according to need
      but generally should not be stopped abruptly. Although there
      is an increasing trend toward same-day surgery or rapid
      discharge after surgery, quality research on the effects of
      these changes from surgical and pain management standpoints
      is lacking. Formal provisions, including communication with
      the family, must be made for adequate analgesia at home.</p>

      <p class="text2">As part of the comprehensive assessment and
      management of trauma necessitating emergency treatment, pain
      should be addressed in the emergency department with
      provisions made for pain management at home. Severe trauma
      may lead to hospitalization in an intensive care unit, and
      the management of pain may risk being compromised because of
      the primary emphasis on life-supporting critical care
      interventions. In severe trauma, the psychologic effect of
      the injury and the intensive care unit experience necessitate
      the optimal treatment of pain to reduce the total burden of
      suffering. Pain may be attributable to a variety of causes,
      including the trauma, surgical procedures, restricted
      movement, underlying disease, and the presence of lines,
      tubes, and drains.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Because of
      the diversity and complexity of the clinical issues present,
      pain treatment, including choice of drug, dosage, route, and
      mode (continuous vs intermittent) of administration, must be
      tailored to the individual patient and analgesics given in
      the overall context of what is best for the patient.
      Communication among caregivers and an interdisciplinary
      approach are helpful. Attention should be paid to optimizing
      sleep-wake cycles, because sufficient sleep will enable the
      child to cope better when awake. Prolonged pain may require
      use of opioids for an extended duration.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> Dosages should be adjusted to
      compensate for the development of physical tolerance, and
      weaning strategies should be used to minimize or obviate
      withdrawal symptoms.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>ACUTE ILLNESS</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Pain associated with acute illness, such as
      otitis media, pharyngitis, meningitis (headaches), and pelvic
      inflammatory disease (pelvic pain), also should be addressed.
      Types of treatment are determined by the severity of the pain
      and by the particular illness and situation. Pharmacologic
      intervention may include the use of acetaminophen,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and locally
      applied medications. As with other situations that involve
      pain, nonpharmacologic treatment, such as distraction,
      relaxation, and physical therapies, also can be used
      effectively in conjunction with medications.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Ample knowledge about
      pediatric pain exists to treat children humanely and
      effectively, but it is not universally applied.</span>
      Multiple sources of information are available, and it is
      important that pediatricians expand their knowledge base and
      advocate for the appropriate treatment of pain in children.
      This may include the institution of and adherence to
      educational requirements and quality improvement guidelines
      for the treatment of pediatric pain. Pediatricians are
      encouraged to advocate for and facilitate the use of services
      offered through child life programs that can have a dramatic
      effect in improving psychologic and physical comfort. In many
      treatment centers, pain is a continuous quality improvement
      measure and included as a fifth vital sign.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is need for more research to elucidate
      further the strategies for optimal pain management and the
      effect of the pain experience. <span class="yellow">It is
      unacceptable that almost no potent analgesics have received
      approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use in
      children.</span> Children deserve the benefit of systematic
      research on the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of such
      medications.</p>

      <p class="text2">Treatment of children will improve as pain
      management education expands and as the issue of pediatric
      pain is brought into greater public awareness. Education of
      parents and others in the community who deal with children in
      pain is an important pediatric issue. When pediatricians
      consistently make comfort a priority for their patients and
      help others to treat pain more effectively, the treatment of
      pain in children will improve.</p>

      <p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Opportunities exist for improving pediatric
      pain management. Pediatricians can facilitate the comfort of
      their patients by using the following strategies:</p>

      <ol class="text">
        <li>Expand knowledge about pediatric pain and pediatric
        pain management principles and techniques.</li>

        <li>Provide a calm environment for procedures that reduces
        distress-producing stimulation.</li>

        <li>Use appropriate pain assessment tools and
        techniques.</li>

        <li>Anticipate predictable painful experiences, intervene,
        and monitor accordingly.</li>

        <li>Use a multimodal (pharmacologic, cognitive behavioral,
        and physical) approach to pain management and use a
        multidisciplinary approach when possible.</li>

        <li>Involve families and tailor interventions to the
        individual child.</li>

        <li>Advocate for child-specific research in pain management
        and Food and Drug Administration evaluation of analgesics
        for children.</li>

        <li>Advocate for the effective use of pain medication for
        children to ensure compassionate and competent management
        of their pain.</li>
