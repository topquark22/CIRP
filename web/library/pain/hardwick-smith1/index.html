      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To determine whether a difference in the
      behavioral and physiologic response to circumcision can be
      demonstrated between neonates undergoing the procedure with
      ring block and those receiving no anesthesia.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Forty healthy male newborns were assigned
      randomly to receive either ring block or no anesthesia.
      Indices of perceived pain including crying time, behavioral
      state, oxygen saturation, and heart and respiratory rates
      were recorded at baseline and at intervals during the
      circumcision. Infants were reassessed 2 minutes and 2 hours
      postoperatively.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Infants receiving ring block cried less
      than did controls (P &lt; .001). Anesthetized infants had
      smaller increases in heart rate (P &lt; .005) and
      demonstrated less arousal (P &lt; .005) during each operative
      interval. For all operative intervals combined, anesthetized
      infants had a smaller decrease in oxygen saturation (P &lt;
      .001) and a smaller increase in respiratory rate (P = .005)
      than did controls. Two minutes postoperatively, anesthetized
      infants had returned to their baseline behavioral state,
      whereas controls remained significantly more aroused (P &lt;
      .005). Two hours postoperatively, there were no significant
      differences in any variables between the groups, nor between
      each group and its baseline. There were no complications
      related to anesthesia administration.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Neonatal circumcision causes behavioral
      and physiologic changes consistent with the perception of
      pain. Ring block is an effective method of anesthesia for
      this procedure.</p>
