      <h1>Comparison of Ring Block, Dorsal Penile<br />
       Nerve Block, and Topical Anesthesia<br />
       for Neonatal Circumcision</h1>

      <h2>A Randomized Controlled Trial</h2>

      <p class="abs"><b>Janice Lander, PhD; Barbara Brady-Freyer,
      MN; James B. Metcalfe, MD, FRCSC; Shermin Nazerali, MPharm;
      Sarah Muttit, MD, FRCPC.</b></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="abs"><b>Context.</b> - Beliefs about the safety
        and effectiveness of current anesthetics have resulted in
        many newborns being circumcised without the benefit of
        anesthesia.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Objective.</b> - To compare ring block,
        dorsal penile nerve block, a topical eutectic mixture of
        local anesthetics (EMLA), and topical placebo when used for
        neonatal circumcision. The placebo represented current
        practice, with no anesthetic for neonatal circumcision.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Design.</b> - A randomized controlled
        trial.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Setting.</b> - Antenatal units in 2
        tertiary care hospitals in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Participants.</b> - A consecutive sample
        of 52 healthy, full-term male newborns, aged 1 to 3
        days.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Interventions.</b> - Physiological and
        behavioral monitoring occurred in a series of trials:
        baseline, drug application, preparation, circumcision, and
        postcircumcision. Surgical procedures defined the following
        4 stages of the circumcision: cleansing, separation, clamp
        on, and clamp off. Methemoglobin level was assessed 6 hours
        after surgery.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Main Outcome Measures.</b> - Heart rate,
        cry, and methemoglobin level.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Results.</b> - Newborns in the untreated
        placebo group exhibited homogeneous responses that
        consisted of sustained elevation of heart rate and high
        pitched cry throughout the circumcision and following. Two
        newborns in the placebo group became ill following
        circumcision (choking and apnea). The 3 treatment groups
        all had significantly less crying and lower heart rates
        during and following circumcision compared with the treated
        group. The ring block was equally effective through all
        stages of the circumcision, whereas the dorsal penile nerve
        block and EMLA were not effective during foreskin
        separation and incision. Methemoglobin levels were highest
        in the EMLA group, although no newborn required
        treatment.</p>

        <p class="abs"><b>Conclusions.</b> - The most effective
        anesthetic is the ring block; EMLA is the least effective.
        It is our recommendation that an anesthetic should be
        administered to newborns prior to undergoing
        circumcision.<br />

      <p class="justified">CIRCUMCISION OF male newborns is a
      controversial procedure. Some favor the procedure as a means
      of reducing problems such as sexually transmitted diseases
      and urinary tract infection.<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup>
      Others view circumcision as unnecessary or
      disfiguring.<sup><a href="#n4">4-5</a></sup> This debate has
      overshadowed an important problem. Many male newborns who are
      circumcised in North America do not receive
      anesthetics<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> (64%-96% in some
      areas<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>).</p>

      <p class="justified">Researchers have assessed several
      anesthetics for circumcision. Dorsal penile nerve block,
      which was first described by Kirya and Werthmannn,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> is the procedure that has been most
      investigated and recommended. Clinicians and other health
      care workers, however, have not been swayed by evidence
      demonstrating its benefits<sup><a href="#n9">9-11</a></sup>
      and safety.<sup><a href="#n12">12,13</a></sup> Indeed some
      physicians maintain that circumcision causes minimal pain,
      that newborns do not remember pain, or that a quick and
      efficient circumcision causes less pain than performing a
      block.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">Eutectic mixture of local anesthetics
      (EMLA) is a topical anesthetic that is used for minor
      procedures. It has not yet been recommended for use with
      neonates because of the risk of acquired methemoglobinemia
      caused by the newborns immature methemoglobin (metHB)
      reductase system. Efficacy of EMLA for neonatal circumcision
      has been evaluated, although its studies have design
      flaws.<sup><a href="#n14">14,15</a></sup> In both studies
      distress from being restrained coincided with distress from
      circumcision, and this introduced ambiguity and increased
      error variance. Another problem was that no established
      intervention, such as a dorsal penile nerve block or a ring
      block, was included to compare EMLA's efficacy.</p>

      <p class="justified">Ring block has been used for children's
      post circumcision analgesia,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      and there may be merit in using it for circumcision
      anesthesia in newborns. We were unable to find evidence of
      the efficacy of this approach when used for surgery among
      newborns.</p>

      <p class="justified">Therefore, we planned a randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial to compare dorsal penile nerve
      block, subcutaneous ring block and EMLA. Our primary
      hypotheses were as follows:<br />
       1. Newborns receiving placebo will have greater distress
      during and following circumcision than newborns receiving
      EMLA, dorsal penile nerve block, or ring block.<br />
       2. Application of a topical agent will cause less distress
      among newborns than infiltration of anesthetic for dorsal
      penile nerve block or ring block.<br />
       3. Distress caused by an unanesthetized circumcision will be
      greater than that caused by infiltration of the
      anesthetic.<br />

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <h4>Sample</h4>

      <p class="justified">At the time of the study, most neonatal
      circumcisions were being performed without anesthetics or
      analgesics in the region in which this study was conducted.
      The population in the area is multicultural, and newborns
      enrolled in the study represented diverse ethnic backgrounds.
      The sample was drawn from among healthy male newborns with a
      gestational age of 37 weeks or more scheduled for
      circumcision in Edmonton, Alberta. The study took place from
      September 1994 to October 1996. University and hospital
      institutional review boards approved the study protocol.
      Parents who requested circumcision for their newborn sons
      were asked for informed consent to participate.</p>

      <p class="justified">Exclusion criteria included (1) that the
      newborn was unable to remain in hospital for 6 hours after
      circumcision, (2) that the newborn was given drugs other than
      routine phytonadione and erythromycin eye ointment; and (3)
      that breast-feeding mothers received sulfonamides or
      salicylates, since both have been linked to methemoglobinemia
      and can be excreted in breast milk.</p>

      <h4>Outcome Measurements.</h4>

      <p class="justified">Physiologic measure of newborn distress
      included heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and
      palmar sweat.<sup><a href="#n17">17-19</a></sup> Behavioral
      measures of pain and newborns consisted of sleep-wake states
      and cry and motor responses, particularly facial
      expression.<sup><a href="#n20">20-21</a></sup> Heart rate,
      however, may be among the single most sensitive measure for
      acute distress among newborns and infants because it
      increases within seconds following a nociceptive stimulus. It
      was, therefore, identified as our primary outcome. In this
      study, continuous physiological data were collected by a
      Merlin monitor (Hewlett Packard Co, Andover, Md) and
      transmitted to a computer. A video recorder collected data on
      behavior among the newborns.</p>

      <p class="justified">Specimens were obtained for metHB via a
      heel stick 6 hours after circumcision, usually at the same
      time that other blood was collected. Approximately 0.1 to 0.3
      mL of blood was collected in a capillary tube and tested for
      metHB on the Co-oximeter 278 Blood Gas System (Chiron Inc,
      Markham, Ontario).</p>

      <h4>Medications</h4>

      <p class="justified">Topical Drugs. - Two-gram doses of EMLA
      and doses of placebo were prepared by the pharmacy and placed
      in 3-mL syringes. The placebo was an inactive cream that
      could not be distinguished from EMLA either by texture,
      color, or volume. The pharmacist placed the prepared syringe
      into an opaque envelope marked with a coded case number.</p>

      <p class="justified">Correct administration of EMLA is known
      to be important for the drug to be effective<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup>; however, no information was
      available at the start of the study about the application
      technique for circumcision, especially the correct waiting
      time. On the basis of earlier research about use of EMLA with
      children,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> we chose a
      90-minute application time and the following procedure.</p>

      <p class="justified">In preparation for drug application, the
      newborn's diaper was removed and his legs restrained. The
      drug was applied in a thick mound over the distal half of the
      penis by using the syringe as an applicator. The penis was
      then wrapped with a semipermeable dressing (Tegaderm).
      Afterward, the newborn was returned to his bassinet to await
      the circumcision. The dressing was checked every 10 minutes,
      and a new dose and dressing were applied if the dressing had
      leaked or the newborn urinated.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Parenteral Drugs.</b>-The pharmacist
      placed empty syringes in the opaque envelope along with
      instructions about the block to be done when preparing drugs
      for the infiltration groups. This envelope was placed in
      another envelope and coded in a way identical to topical
      cases.</p>

      <p class="justified">The drug was administered with a
      tuberculin syringe and a 1.2-cm, 27-gauge needle. For both
      dorsal penile nerve and ring blocks, 0.8 mL of 1% lidocaine
      without epinephrine was used. Newborns who had a dorsal
      penile nerve block had 0.4 mL of lidocaine infiltrated at the
      2 dorsolateral injection sites, using the method of Kirya and
      Werthmann.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Newborns who had a
      ring block had 0.8 mL of lidocaine without epinephrine
      infiltrated in a band or ring around the penis, halfway along
      the shaft of the penis, following the procedure Broadman et
      al<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> used for children's
      postcircumcision analgesia.</p>

      <p class="justified">Our pilot work indicated that newborns
      settle if allowed to rest 6 to 8 minutes after injection,
      thus allowing the distress associated with circumcision to be
      distinguished from other distress. Accordingly, newborns in
      this study were allowed to rest for 8 minutes at the
      conclusion of the application of the dorsal penile nerve or
      ring blocks.</p>

      <h4>Study Design</h4>

      <p class="justified">The newborn was taken to the procedure
      room 2 hours prior to the scheduled circumcision time. Data
      were collected in a series of trials: baseline A, drug
      administration, baseline B, preparation, circumcision, and
      postcircumcision. Video recording was continuous during all
      trials. Physiological monitoring occurred during all trials,
      with exceptions noted. Figure 1 summarizes the progress of
      the topical and infiltration groups through the trials or
      phases of the procedure.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Baseline A.</b>-This trial was
      completed at least 110 minutes before the circumcision, prior
      to drug administration. Newborns were placed on the padded
      circumcision mold, and electrodes were attached. Heart rate
      was recorded for 5 minutes. Newborns in the 2 infiltration
      groups were returned to their bassinets at the end of the
      trial.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Drug Administration.</b> - Newborns
      in the topical groups had their assigned drug applied by the
      assistant at the conclusion of the baseline A trial. Complete
      monitoring continued during application of the topical and
      for at least 4 minutes following the application. Afterward,
      the leads were disconnected, and the newborns were returned
      to their bassinets for a minimum of 90 minutes to await
      surgery.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Baseline B.</b> - Approximately 10
      minutes before the circumcision, physiological monitoring
      resumed. The newborn was moved to a padded, molded
      circumcision apparatus (Circumstraint, Olympic Medical,
      Seattle, Wash) and allowed to settle. Then a 2-minute
      recording was obtained from the quiet newborn.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Preparation and Drug
      Infiltration.</b> - this trial involved preparation of the
      newborn for the surgical procedure. Newborns in the topical
      groups had the dressing and drug removed, and their legs but
      not their arms were restrained. They were again allowed to
      settle for 8 minutes before surgery began. Newborns in the 2
      infiltration groups had their legs restrained, and a ring
      block or dorsal penile nerve block was administered by the
      physician, followed by an 8-minute rest. Once this phase or
      trial began, restraints remained on until the end of the
      circumcision, since our pilot had indicated that newborns
      become more distressed by the removal and reapplication of
      restraints than by having them remain on.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Circumcision.</b> - An experienced
      urologist, obstetrician, or pediatrician performed the
      surgery. The Gomco clamp procedure was used for circumcision
      in all cases.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Postcircumcision.</b> - At the end of
      the circumcision, the newborn was released from the
      restraints and monitored for at least 8 minutes. Then a gauze
      and petroleum jelly dressing were applied to the penis. The
      newborn was returned to his parents. Six hours after
      circumcision blood was collected from all newborns so that
      metHB levels could be compared across groups.</p>

      <h4>Study Blinds</h4>

      <p class="justified">The research assistant was unaware of
      group assignment until the drug application phase began. She
      remained blind to the type of topical (placebo or EMLA) but
      became aware of the general group: infiltration or topical.
      The physician became aware of some details of group
      assignment immediately before the circumcision. Like the
      assistant, he remained blind about the type of topical
      administered.</p>

      <p class="justified">Since type of infiltration procedure
      could be detected by a cursory look at the injection site, we
      did not attempt to blind physicians or assistants. In order
      that the study blind not be broken, no sensory testing was
      done to determine the adequacy of the block.</p>

      <h4>Data Preparation</h4>

      <p class="justified">Computer records of continuous heart
      rate data and videos of newborn behavior were prepared for
      analysis by matching physiological data and corresponding
      video segments for trials using event markers inserted during
      data collection. Heart rate graphs were constructed for each
      newborn over all trials. The data were examined for
      completeness.</p>

      <p class="justified">Videotapes were viewed independently by
      2 assistants who were unaware of group assignments. They
      recorded the periods that the newborns spent crying. As
      agreement among assistants was required, discrepant ratings
      of periods of newborn crying were resolved by having the
      raters and a third evaluator re-rate the tape. Periods of
      newborn crying were used to compute the proportion of time
      newborns spent crying (for any trial, the proportion of
      crying equals time spent crying divided by total trial
      duration).</p>

      <p class="justified">When assistants viewed videotapes, they
      documented events (including the surgical procedures) and
      time of occurrence. On the basis of these observations of
      events, 4 stages of the circumcision were identified. Codes
      were inserted in the data files to demarcate stages of
      circumcision for analysis of heart rate and crying. The
      stages consisted of cleansing (cleansing and draping);
      separation of foreskin from glans (probing, release of
      foreskin from glans, incision of foreskin); application of
      the clamp (bell on, clamp on, foreskin excised); and clamp
      removal (clamp off, bell off, examination, and wiping with
      swab).</p>

      <h4>Statistical Analyses</h4>

      <p class="justified">Since opinions vary about analysis of
      repeated measures, heart rate data were analyzed in several
      ways. We undertook a time-series analysis but could not
      identify a single model. Hence, we turned to analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) to examine heart rate. Data were handled
      with a number of ANOVA methods that provided consistent
      results. We present one approach in this article: repeated
      measures ANOVA of change in heart rate. Each measure of heart
      rate was subtracted from the baseline B mean heart rate,
      which produced the variable heart rate change B (ie, the rise
      or fall in heart rate). This approach was preferable to
      analysis of covariance (using baseline B as the covariate),
      since between-subject variance exceeded within-subject
      variance, and heart rate was a reliable measure.<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> Repeated measures reported in this
      article have been referred to as trial, stage, or time.</p>

      <p class="justified">Other variables were assessed with
      nonparametric analyses or ANOVA. Repeated measures ANOVA were
      used to assess proportion of cry. When appropriate, the Tukey
      honestly significant difference (HSD) was used for post hoc
      comparisons. For all statistical tests reported, including
      post hoc comparisons, the significance level was P=.05.</p>

      <p class="justified">We estimated sample size from previous
      studies about neonatal circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> using a heart rate difference of 26
      beats per minute and an SD of 26. We planned to recruit 27
      newborns per group, based on alpha = .05 and desired power =
      0.90. <sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="justified"><span class="yellow">Part way through
      the trial, physicians and members of the research team
      remarked that there were obvious differences in behavior of
      newborns in either infiltration group compared with those in
      both topical groups. This led us to reexamine our estimation
      of effect size as well as the ethical matters related to
      sample size.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> We, therefore,
      ended enrollment with the following sample sizes: ring block,
      n=12; dorsal penile nerve block, n=14; EMLA, n=15; and
      placebo, n=11.</span> The total number of completed cases was
      52. Our projected sample estimated power of 0.90 and a
      smaller effect than was observed. Our computed power for the
      sample data exceeded 0.95 for main research questions.</p>

      <p class="justified">We enrolled 54 newborns; 2 were
      withdrawn by parents soon after data collection commenced-one
      because the parents were unable to remain in hospital until
      completion of the study and the other so that the newborn
      could receive phototherapy. Parents of another 23 newborns
      were approached to participate but declined; their primary
      reason was that they were unable to remain in hospital for
      the duration of the study (Figure 2).</p>

      <h4>Characteristics of Newborns</h4>

      <p class="justified">Birth weight of 50 of the newborns
      ranged from 2500 to 4805 g. The other 2 newborns were
      fraternal twins of 38 weeks' gestation, and they weighed 2230
      and 2305 g. Of the newborns, 75% were delivered vaginally and
      25% by cesarean section. Newborns in this study were 1 to 3
      days of age when circumcised (92% were 2 days of age or
      younger). The groups were not significantly different for the
      following characteristics: weight, mean, 3594 g; newborn age,
      mean, 1.5 days; and 5-minute Apgar scores, mean, 9. Feedings
      were not withheld prior to circumcision, and time of last
      feeding was not significantly different for the groups (mean,
      116 minutes).</p>

      <h4>Effect of Physicians and Assistants</h4>

      <p class="justified">The 4 treatment groups were compared to
      determine if physicians and assistants had any differential
      effects on groups, since they could not be blinded to type of
      infiltration vs the topical. There were no significant
      differences among physicians (n=4) or assistants (n=3) in the
      time taken to complete each stage of circumcision, as well as
      the heart rate of the newborns and their crying during these
      stages (ANOVA).</p>

      <h4>Treatment Effects</h4>

      <p class="justified">The main outcome measures used to assess
      treatment efficacy were proportion of time spent crying and
      heart rate, and the key intervals of time were the
      circumcision and postcircumcision periods. Differences among
      groups during the various trials or stages of circumcision
      were of primary interest (stage or trial by treatment
      interactions), as were overall group differences (main
      treatment effect). Table 1 presents the groups' mean
      proportion of time crying and heart rate.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Hypothesis 1.</b>- We tested the
      first hypothesis using 2-way ANOVA (group and stage). Heart
      rate change B in the placebo group was significantly greater
      than in any other group at all stages of circumcision (Tukey
      HSD), thus confirming hypothesis 1.</p>

      <p class="justified">Tukey post hoc analysis also indicated
      that the 3 anesthetics led to significantly different
      outcomes during 2 stages of the circumcision. During foreskin
      separation, all groups were significantly different from one
      another. After the placebo group, heart rate change B was
      greatest for the EMLA group, followed by dorsal penile nerve
      block and ring block. During the clamp-off stage, the EMLA
      group's heart rate change B was smallest, and the placebo
      group's was the greatest. The 3 anesthetic groups did not
      differ significantly during the cleansing or clamp-on stages.
      Figure 3 illustrates mean heart rate change for the 4 groups
      during the stages of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="justified">We assessed group differences in heart
      rate change B during the immediate postcircumcision trial
      using 2-way ANOVA (group and time). We compared the groups at
      four 30-second intervals immediately following the last stage
      of circumcision. The placebo group's heart rate change B was
      greatest compared with the other groups (and this difference
      occurred at each time interval). These results also confirm
      hypothesis 1.</p>

      <p class="justified">Two-way ANOVA was used to assess cry
      proportions for the 4 groups during the 4 stages of
      circumcision and during the four 30-second intervals
      immediately after surgery. The placebo group cried a
      significantly greater overall proportion of time than all
      other groups, an average of 85% of the time during
      circumcision and 63% of the first 2 minutes following
      circumcision (a significant group effect). The groups did not
      differ significantly at any trial or interval (interaction of
      group and time).</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Hypothesis 2.</b>- The groups were
      also compared to assess distress caused by the drug
      administration procedure. The topical groups were combined
      for comparison with ring block and dorsal penile nerve block
      groups. The proportion of time that newborns cried during
      their drug administration trial was not significantly
      different for the groups (1-way ANOVA). Heart rate change B
      increased for all groups during drug administration, but the
      increase was greatest for the ring block, followed by dorsal
      penile nerve block. Within 15 seconds following the
      injections, the heart rates of newborns in the ring block and
      dorsal penile nerve block groups were not significantly
      different (t test). On average, newborns in the infiltration
      groups stopped crying 92 seconds after the block was
      administered, whereas newborns in the topical groups stopped
      crying 63 seconds after drug application.</p>

      <p class="justified"><b>Hypothesis 3.</b> - A common belief
      among clinicians and other health care workers is that the
      injection of a block is as painful or more painful than
      circumcision without anesthetic. We tested hypothesis 3: that
      performing a circumcision without anesthetic causes more
      distress than providing dorsal penile nerve or ring blocks
      (1-way ANOVA). To conduct this analysis, it was necessary to
      compare different groups at 2 different points in time
      (infiltration groups during the block, compared with placebo
      group during circumcision).</p>

      <p class="justified">Heart rate change B data for the dorsal
      penile nerve and ring block groups during drug administration
      were compared with heart rate change B data for the placebo
      group during circumcision. The placebo group's heart rate
      change B during circumcision was significantly greater than
      the heart rate change B of the infiltration groups during
      drug administration. The average length of time taken to
      perform a ring block was 48 seconds, whereas dorsal penile
      nerve block was completed on average in 25 seconds. These
      times can be compared with the average time taken to perform
      circumcision on the placebo group (3.5 minutes). Thus, heart
      rate change was greater and lasted longer with an
      unanesthetized circumcision compared with the effect of and
      time for infiltration of a block.</p>

      <h4>Adverse Outcomes</h4>

      <p class="justified">Analysis of metllB levels was conducted
      with nonparametric statistics. Of metHB levels in the EMLA
      group, 60% were above the median for the entire sample, which
      was significantly higher than in the other groups (using the
      Kniskal-Wallis ANOVA test). Two newborns in the EMLA group
      bad margin-ally elevated metHB levels that did not require
      treatment (2.4% and 4.5%). The mean metHB levels for the
      placebo, EMLA, dorsal penile nerve block, and ring block
      groups were 0.6%, 1.3%, 0.7%, and 0.4%, respectively.</p>

      <p class="justified">Injection sites were observed by the
      assistants 4 hours after circumcision. They recorded the
      occurrence of minor bruising at injection sites for half of
      the newborns in both infiltration groups. No newborn required
      treatment.</p>

      <p class="justified"><span class="yellow">A serious
      postsurgery incident was observed in 1 newborn in the placebo
      group. There was nothing remarkable about this newborn's
      history prior to the circumcision. His 1- and 5-minute Apgar
      scores were 9 and 10. He was last fed 3 hours before
      circumcision. During and following circumcision, the newborn
      reacted much the same as others who received a placebo
      (continuously elevated heart rate and high-pitched cry).
      About 2.5 minutes after the conclusion of surgery, the
      new-born had an episode that included abnormal posture (lack
      of tone in limbs), several periods of apnea (one lasting more
      than 25 seconds), and projectile vomiting. No physiological
      data were recorded during the episode, since the computer had
      lost contact with the monitor immediately prior to its onset.
      The newborn recovered following the episode.</span></p>

      <p class="justified"><span class="yellow">Another newborn in
      the placebo group had a choking episode with apnea after
      surgery. This began about 3.5 minutes after the circumcision
      and lasted less than 30 seconds.</span></p>

      <h4>COMMENT</h4>

      <p class="justified">Several beliefs explain the practice of
      performing circumcision without anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> One is that newborns experience little
      or no pain from circumcision. Without exception, newborns in
      this study who did not receive an anesthetic suffered great
      distress during and following the circumcision, and they were
      exposed to unnecessary risk (from choking or apnea).
      Therefore, we have concluded that circumcision should be
      performed with anesthetic.</p>

      <p class="justified">It is also not true that the injection
      from either ring block or dorsal penile nerve block causes as
      much pain as the circumcision. <span
      class="yellow">Circumcision without anesthesia causes greater
      distress than the pain of the infiltration, and this distress
      occurs for a longer period, and recovery takes
      longer.</span></p>

      <p class="justified">A third view is that superior surgical
      technique eliminates newborn distress from circumcision, thus
      removing the need for anesthetic. <span
      class="yellow">Although our physicians were highly
      experienced in performing circumcision and had excellent
      surgical technique, every newborn in the placebo group
      exhibited extreme distress during and following
      circumcision.</span></p>

      <p class="justified">Another justification for not providing
      anesthetic is the occurrence of infantile amnesia. It is true
      that as adults these newborns will not be able to retrieve
      the memory of their surgery and distress. This fact, however,
      cannot justify the practice of performing surgery without
      anesthetic.</p>

      <p class="justified">Of the 3 anesthetics considered in this
      investigation, ring block is clearly superior. It provides
      satisfactory anesthesia for all stages of the circumcision.
      While newborns fussed periodically over the restraints or
      being handled, they typically did not react to the most
      nociceptive elements of the circumcision (such as foreskin
      separation and incision). On average, their heart rate rose
      about 20 beats per minute from baseline as preparation for
      the surgery began with placement of the drapes.</p>

      <p class="justified">While the ring block takes about twice
      as much time to administer as the dorsal penile nerve block,
      newborns recover from both at the same rate. The ring block
      is easily accomplished, and the risks appear to be
      minimal.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="justified">Dorsal penile nerve block is the second
      choice. Physiological and behavioral data confirmed that the
      dorsal penile nerve block was not fully effective during the
      foreskin separation stage of the circumcision. Newborns cried
      and their heart rates rose at the start of this stage of
      circumcision. The clinical experience of one of us with
      adults (J.M.) and that of others<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> supports the findings of this study.
      Adult males have complained about incomplete anesthesia with
      dorsal penile nerve block.</p>

      <p class="justified">As to ease of administration, the dorsal
      penile nerve block may be technically more difficult to
      achieve than the ring block. In assessing safety, a low rate
      of complications has been found for dorsal penile nerve
      block, including a 1.2% rate of bruising or hematoma based on
      retrospective chart review,<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      and 11% based on survey.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      These rates may have been higher had examinations been made
      and recorded for all cases. Although assistants in our study
      recorded that minor bruising occurred in half of the newborns
      who had ring block or dorsal penile nerve block, their
      observations were not sufficiently detailed to evaluate
      extent of bruising. None of the newborns required treatment
      for bruising.</p>

      <p class="justified">Eutectic mixture of local anesthetics
      was also not fully effective during the stage of surgery
      where the foreskin is separated from the glans and incised.
      Eutectic mixture of local anesthetics was less effective than
      the dorsal penile nerve block judging by the newborns'
      responses, which were more intense and prolonged. All
      newborns in the EMLA group became rapidly distressed at the
      outset of the foreskin separation stage. These newborns
      typically settled by the clamp-off stage of circumcision.
      Overall, these outcomes suggest that EMLA does not penetrate
      to the depth required for circumcision and is not a prudent
      choice.</p>

      <p class="justified">The technique for administering EMLA
      poses a number of problems. Considerable technical skill is
      needed to apply the adhesive, semipermeable dressing that
      covers the topical. Regular monitoring is required to make
      sure that the drug has not shifted off the target area. The
      amount of time required between drug application and
      circumcision may not be practical in many nurseries.</p>

      <p class="justified">Some clinicians have suggested that EMLA
      may be more effective if placed both over and under the
      foreskin. That approach would likely cause the newborn
      distress, since insertion of a small probe during
      circumcision causes distress for newborns who do not have a
      block. The theoretical risk of methemoglobinemia remains,
      although it was not observed in this study.</p>

      <p class="justified">Lack of sensory testing to determine
      adequacy of infiltration block, lack of systematic and
      detailed examination of injection sites, and length of
      postoperative follow-up of newborns are limitations of our
      study. It would have been useful to follow newborns for
      several days to assess postoperative discomfort, but this was
      not possible with the current practice of short-term hospital
      stays following delivery. Sensory testing was not done to
      ensure the consistency of the handling of newborns.
      Inadequate performance of blocks seems unlikely, as there
      were no differences in outcomes across physicians.</p>

      <p class="justified"><span class="yellow">The results of this
      study suggest that an anesthetic should be administered to
      newborns prior to undergoing circumcision. The ring block was
      the most effective.</span></p>
