      <p>Pain and stress have been shown to induce significant
      physiological and behavioral reactions in newborn infants,
      even in those born prematurely. Infants who are born
      prematurely or seriously ill are commonly exposed to multiple
      painful and stressful events as part of their prolonged
      hospitalizations and required medical procedures. There is
      now evidence that these early events not only induce acute
      changes, but that permanent structural and functional changes
      may also result. This article reviews the growing body of
      evidence of likely long-term effects of early pain and stress
      on the human infant. It is hoped that a better understanding
      of this literature will promote more responsive and sensitive
      management of infants and young children during their
      encounters with the medical community and will ultimately
      facilitate the healthy growth and development of all
      children.</p>
