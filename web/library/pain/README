Introduction

Articles started to appear in the literature circa 1970 indicating
that newborns experienced "stress" from neonatal circumcision.[1,2,3]
Until then, doctors seemingly still did not believe that newborns
could actually feel pain. _Talbert et al_ demonstrated a rise in
serum cortisol in 1976.[4] Cortisol is a stress hormone that appears
in the blood serum during pain or stress. It is an accepted marker
for pain. This provided clear evidence that infants feel the pain
of circumcision.

The _American Academy of Pediatrics_ released its statement on
neonatal pain control in September 1987. The AAP stated clearly
"that local or systemic pharmacologic agents now available permit
relatively safe administration of anesthesia or analgesia to neonates
undergoing surgical procedures and that such administration is
indicated according to the usual guidelines for the administration
of anesthesia to high-risk, potentially unstable patients."[62]
_The Canadian Paediatric Society_ states that "the evidence of the
need for pain control is strong..." _The Australasian Association
of Paediatric Surgeons_ condemns neonatal circumcision but states
that if it is to be carried out,

   ...the procedure should be performed electively after six months
   of age. When performed, it should be carried out by a surgeon
   performing circumcisions on children on a regular basis with an
   anaesthetist using appropriate techniques. This would imply that
   the anaesthetist is fully trained in the art of paediatric
   anaesthesia, including the ability to perform caudal and penile
   regional, or local anaesthesia...

The definitive study of the human neonatal pain sensory mechanism
was published by _Anand and Hickey_ in the New England Journal of
Medicine in November 1987.[14] They wrote:

   Numerous lines of evidence suggest that even in the human fetus,
   pain pathways as well as cortical and subcortical centers
   necessary for pain perception are well developed late in gestation,
   and the neurochemical systems now known to be associated with
   pain transmission are intact and functional....Other responses
   in newborn infants are suggestive of integrated emotional and
   behavioral responses to pain and are retained in memory long
   enough to modify subsequent behavior patterns... [I]n decisions
   about the use of these techniques, current knowledge suggests
   that humane considerations should apply as forcefully to the
   care of neonates and young nonverbal infants as they do to
   children and adults in similar painful and stressful situations.

The evidence that neonates feel pain and suffer as much as do older
children and adults was conclusive.

Even with this information, the practice of unanesthetised neonatal
circumcision continued. This allowed doctors to conduct experiments
on human babies during the 1980s into the parameters of extreme
pain that would have been prohibited in laboratory animals.

All studies on the subject to date compare the pain experienced
under anesthesia to the pain of unanesthetized circumcision. None
compare the pain under anesthesia to the lack of pain experienced
by the non-circumcised infant. No method of pain control for neonatal
circumcision exists that is 100 percent effective. All circumcised
infants suffer during the procedure and afterwards.

_Taddio et al_ reported in 1997 that baby boys who are circumcised
with inadequate anesthesia exhibit behavior changes at six months
of age that are suggestive of "an infant analogue of post traumatic
stress disorder".[23]

EMLA topical anesthetic cream is much touted for relief of circumcision
pain, but studies show that it is only slightly effective for that
purpose.[50] It does not penetrate deeply enough. Dorsal penile
nerve block (DPNB) is more effective but DPNB does not block all
pain pathways so it is only partially effective. _Lander et al_
reported that ring block was more effective than EMLA or DPNB for
control of circumcision pain.[32]

WARNING: _EMLA cream is not approved for use in the first thirty
days of life due to the threat of methemoglobinemia, a blood
disease._

Lander's study was terminated after several infants circumcised
without anesthesia experiences apparent life threatening breathing
difficulties, including choking and apnea. The shock of circumcision
without anesthesia can produce additional dangerous _complications_
including pneumothorax[29], heart failure[30], and gastric rupture[31].

Very few children receive analgesia for the post-operative pain of
circumcision. _Howard et al_ studied the post-operative pain of
circumcision for a period of 24 hours.[19] It was severe and
persistent and continued beyond the 24 hour period of the study.

The medical community has by now extensively researched the need
for pain control in infants, as evidenced by the large number of
articles indexed below. Nonetheless, a recent survey published in
_OBG Management_ found that only 14 percent of US physicians who
are circumcisers use any form of anesthesia for the surgery.[58,61]
The American Academy of Pediatrics is expected to issue recommendations
for the use of anesthesia for newborn circumcision with its _position
statement_ scheduled for release later in 1998.
