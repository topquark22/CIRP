          <p><b><i>Objective.</i></b> Recognizing the concerns
          about the use of local anesthesia in neonatal
          circumcision, a painful procedure usually performed
          without analgesia or anesthesia, we undertook a study of
          acetaminophen for pain management of this procedure.</p>

          <p><b><i>Design.</i></b> A prospective, randomized,
          double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of
          acetaminophen analgesia in 44 healthy full term neonates
          undergoing circumcision was conducted. Beginning two
          hours before Gomco circumcision, neonates received either
          acetaminophen (15 mg/kg per dose, 0.15 mL/kg per dose) or
          placebo (0.15 mL/kg per dose) every six hours for 24
          hours. Neonates were monitored intraoperatively for
          changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, and crying time.
          Postoperative pain was assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 360
          minutes and 24 hours using a standardized postoperative
          comfort scoring system. Feeding behavior was also
          assessed before and after circumcision by nursing
          observation.</p>

          <p><b><i>Results.</i></b> Neonates in both groups showed
          significant increases in heart rate, respiratory rate,
          and crying during circumcision with no clinically
          significant differences between the groups. Postoperative
          comfort scores showed no significant differences between
          the groups until the 360-minute postoperative assessment,
          at which time the acetaminophen group had significantly
          improved scores. (P&lt;.05). <span class="yellow">Feeding
          behavior deteriorated in breast- and bottle-fed infants
          in both groups, and acetaminophen did not seem to
          influence this deterioration.</span></p>

          <p><b><i>Conclusions.</i></b> <span class="yellow">This
          study confirms that circumcision of the newborn causes
          severe and persistent pain.</span> Acetaminophen was not
          found to ameliorate either the intra-operative or the
          immediate postoperative pain of circumcision, although it
          seems that it may provide some benefit after the
          postoperative period. <i>Pediatrics</i> 1994;93:641-646;

      <p>Neonatal circumcision is the most common surgical
      procedure performed on males in the United States.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> As many as 86% of male neonates
      undergo this operation.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> It is
      unlikely that the frequency of this operation will decrease
      in the near future as the American Academy of Pediatrics has
      acknowledged that it has possible benefits.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Although there is clear
      neurophysiologic and clinical evidence that neonates are
      capable of mature pain perception, even at relatively
      immature gestational ages,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      neonatal circumcision is usually performed without analgesia
      or anesthesia.<sup><a href="#n6">6-11</a></sup> Dorsal penile
      nerve block has been shown to provide anesthesia and
      analgesia,<sup><a href="#n9">9,11,12</a></sup> but it is not
      widely used due to concerns of sufficient safety,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4,10</a></sup> the additional time required to
      perform the block and, the continued belief that the pain of
      circumcision is insignificant. The American Academy of
      Pediatrics supports the use of anesthetics and analgesics in
      neonates and in its statement on neonatal anesthesia
      recommends that "the decision to withhold such medication
      should be based on the same medical criteria used for older
      patients."<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p>Recognizing the concerns about the use of local anesthesia
      in neonatal circumcision, we undertook a study of
      acetaminophen for pain management of this procedure.
      Acetaminophen is used extensively for relief of mild to
      moderate pain after minor surgery, has a broad margin of
      safety<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> and is metabolized and
      excreted efficiently by newborns.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15-17</a></sup> To test the hypothesis that
      acetaminophen alleviates intraoperative and postoperative
      pain in neonatal circumcision, a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of
      acetaminophen analgesia in healthy full term neonates
      undergoing circumcision was conducted.</p>

      <h3 align="center">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>
      <b>Patient Population</b> 

      <p>All male neonates who met the study criteria defined below
      and who were delivered by staff obstetrical service of
      Rochester General Hospital from July 1992 to April 1993 were
      potentially eligible to participate in the study. Rochester
      General Hospital is a 526-bed community hospital affiliated
      with the University of Rochester School of Medicine and
      Dentistry with approximately 2500 deliveries per year.
      Parents requesting circumcision of healthy, appropriate for
      gestational age, full-term male newborns were asked to
      participate, and informed consent obtained for study
      participation. Full term was defined as 37 to 42 weeks
      gestation. Further eligibility criteria were (1) Apgar scores
      &gt;7 at 1 and 5 minutes; (2) absence of any chronic or
      infectious disease process; (3) no history of maternal
      illegal drug use or alcohol use; (4) absence of any other
      contraindication to circumcision, such as hypospadias,
      epispadias, or cordee of the penis; and (5) no family history
      of a bleeding disorder. The study protocol and consent form
      were approved by the hospital's Clinical Investigation
      Committee.</p>
      <b>Protocol and Data Collection</b> 

      <p>Using a computer generated random number list, neonates
      were randomized to either an acetaminophen or placebo group.
      Twenty-one infants were randomized to the placebo group, and
      23 to the acetaminophen group. The acetaminophen group
      received acetaminophen infant drops (Tylenol infant drops,
      McNeil Consumer Products), 15mg/kg per dose (0.15mL/kg per
      dose) every 6 hours for 24 hours (or until the neonate was
      discharged if this occurred before 24 hours), starting 2
      hours preoperatively. Neonates in the placebo group were
      treated for an identical period but received 0.15 mL/kg per
      dose of a placebo solution, colored and saccharin-sweetened
      to resemble the acetaminophen drops. Five single doses of
      either placebo or acetaminophen were dispensed to the
      hospital's mother baby unit for each infant. Medications were
      dispensed in nursing bottles containing individual prediluted
      doses ready for administration to the infant. Study
      medications for both groups were prediluted by pharmacy
      personnel with 4mL of sterile water. After administration of
      the acetaminophen or placebo, 4mL of sterile water were
      placed into the nursing bottle, swirled to dissolve any
      residual medication and given to the neonate. All nurses and
      physicians involved in the study were blinded to the group
      assignments.</p>

      <p>All circumcisions were performed in a quiet room
      specifically designated for circumcision procedures. All
      neonates were treated identically to the fullest possible
      extent. Circumcisions were performed between 6:30 AM and 8:00
      AM to allow one investigator to do all postoperative
      assessments and to guarantee relatively uniform routine care
      experiences for the neonates before evaluation. Neonates had
      received nothing by mouth for a minimum of 2 hours before
      circumcision, and not neonates were longer than 3 hours
      without feeding before the procedure. All neonates had
      uneventful newborn nursery courses and were at least 24 hours
      old at the time of circumcision.</p>

      <p>Intraoperatively, pain was assessed using crying time,
      heart rate changes, and respiratory changes. Heart rate was
      counted by a nurse via cardiac auscultation. Respiratory rate
      was determined by visual observation by a second nurse. heart
      rates and respiratory rates were assessed every 30 seconds
      beginning with the 3-minute preoperative observation and
      extending through the 3-minute postoperative observation.
      Crying time was assessed by the same investigator (C.R.H.)
      for all neonates and was determined using stopwatch
      measurements of crying vocalizations during each stage of the
      procedure. Pacifiers were offered to all neonates during the
      procedures.</p>

      <p>Neonates were restrained on a circumcision board for 3
      minutes before the surgical procedure to assess baseline
      measurements of crying time, heart rate and respiratory rate.
      All circumcisions were performed by the same physician
      (F.M.H.) using the same Gomco clamp technique in all
      neonates. For purposes of data interpretation, the operation
      was divided into the following stages: (1) 3 minutes baseline
      with limbs restrained; (2) cleansing of genital area; (3)
      dissection and lysis of adhesions; (4) Gomco clamp placement;
      (5) foreskin excision; (6) Gomco clamp removal and dressing
      placement; and (7) 3 minute postoperative period on the
      circumcision board without restraint. Mean heart rates and
      respiratory rates were calculated for each of these stages,
      as were percents of time spent in crying.</p>

      <p>The Postoperative Comfort Score described by Attia et
      al<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> (Table 1) which has
      previously been used in the assessment of postoperative pain
      in infancy,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> was utilized to
      assess postoperative pain. This score assesses 10 infant
      behaviors, each of which is scored 0, 1, or 2, resulting in
      possible scores from 0 to 20. The lower the score the more
      uncomfortable the infant. Each neonate was scored in the
      immediate preoperative period, and postoperatively at 30, 60,
      90, 120, and 360 minutes. Those neonates who were
      hospitalized long enough to allow for additional
      postoperative scoring at 24 and 48 hours were also assessed
      at those times. All comfort scores were obtained by the same
      physician (C.R.H.). Before scoring, the state of the neonate
      (quiet/awake, fussy, or sleeping) was recorded. The amount of
      time since the neonate was last fed and any blood drawing or
      other painful procedure (eg, immunization) that had occurred
      were also recorded.</p>

      <p>Two of the authors (C.M.H. and F.M.H.), both blinded to
      infant's circumcision status, performed a pilot test of the
      Postoperative Comfort Score in a group of 55 well, full-term
      newborns, 15 of whom were postcircumcision. Intraobserver
      reliability for this instrument was r=.90, and interobserver
      reliability was r=.85. A comfort score &lt;16 from &lt;1 hour
      to 70 hours postcircumcision identified neonates who had
      undergone circumcision with a positive predictive value of
      85% sensitivity and 100% specificity those neonates who were
      &lt;24 hours postcircumcision. Interobserver reliability was
      reverified (r &gt; .90) in the latter half of the current
      study in a subgroup of 13 neonates.</p>

      <p>Feeding behavior was evaluated before and after
      circumcision. In accord with standard nursing protocol at
      this hospital, nurses record breastfeeding behavior or
      formula intake each time an infant feeds. For the purposes of
      this study, preoperative feeding behavior was defined as
      follows for breast-fed neonates: (1) breastfeeding
      satisfactory, if by nursing observation the neonate was
      judged to have breastfed well for the two feedings before
      circumcision; and breast-feeding unsatisfactory, if by
      nursing observation the neonate was judged to have fed poorly
      on either of two breast-feedings before circumcision.</p>

      <p>All neonates were taken to their mothers for feeding
      immediately after circumcision. If, in postoperative
      feedings, a neonate who was in the satisfactory category was
      judged to have fed poorly in two breast feeding attempts, or
      if the neonate refused to be breast fed on two attempts, then
      breast feeding was judged to have deteriorated post
      operatively. If after two attempts at breast-feeding the
      neonate required formula supplementation (eg, the neonate was
      symptomatic with a blood glucose &lt;50) or the mother chose
      to feed the infant formula, breast-feeding was also judged to
      have deteriorated. If a neonate who had breast-fed poorly
      preoperatively fed well in postoperative feedings,
      breast-feeding behavior was judged to have improved.</p>

      <p>Formula intakes of bottle-fed neonates for the two
      feedings before circumcision were averaged. This average was
      recorded as the baseline formula intake for the neonate. If
      on the first post-operative feeding the neonate consumed
      &lt;50% of the preoperative volume of formula, feeding
      behavior was judged to have worsened.</p>

      <p>Power calculations base on the results of the pilot test
      of the Postoperative Comfort Score indicated that a group
      size of 18 neonates in each of the two test groups would
      allow detection of a 50% improvement in Postoperative Comfort
      Scores with 80% power and an alpha of .05 in a one-tailed
      analysis.</p>

        <p><b>Data Analysis</b></p>

        <p>Data analysis was performed using EPI Info, Version 5
        (Centers for Disease Control Shareware) and SPSS-PC
        statistical programs. Statistical comparisons were
        performed using the Student's &tau;-test for normally
        distributed continuous data, and The Wilcoxon two sample
        test for nonnormally distributed data. Categorical
        variables were tested for differences by &chi;<sup>2</sup>
        statistics, and 95% confidence intervals for proportions
        were calculated to examine the variance of the point
        estimates. Fisher's exact tests were also used whenever a
        cell size was &lt;5. Differences between groups for Post
        Operative Comfort Scores were analyzed using the Student's
        &tau;-test and analysis of variance techniques. Analysis of
        variance techniques tested for differences between the
        groups with the preceeding comfort scores treated as a
        covariate.</p>

        <p>Comparisons between groups were also performed for all
        outcome measures accounting for rates obtained in
        preoperative observations. Preoperative values were
        subtracted from subsequent measures of a particular pain
        measure to produce adjusted values. Appropriate statistical
        analysis was then performed on these adjusted values.</p>

        <h3 align="center">RESULTS</h3>

        <p>There was no significant differences between the study
        groups for birth rate, race, maternal age, gestational age,
        maternal smoking during pregnancy, method of delivery,
        maternal use of intravenous or intramuscular analgesics
        during labor, maternal use of local or epidural anesthesia
        during labor, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, method of
        infant feeding, age at circumcision, or time required for
        the procedure. Only the incidence of obstetric
        complications differed between the groups. Two neonates in
        the acetaminophen group were born to mothers with
        gestational diabetes (non-insulin dependent), and one was
        born to a mother with pregnancy induced hypertension,
        whereas there were no obstetric complications in the group
        receiving placebo. In all cases neonates were asymptomatic
        at birth with normal growth parameters. and uneventful
        newborn courses.</p>

      <p>There were no statistically significant differences in
      unadjusted heart rate or respiratory rate. (Table 2) between
      the acetaminophen and placebo groups at any stage of the
      circumcision procedure. Neonates in the placebo group cried
      significantly more than those in the acetaminophen group
      during foreskin removal (Table 2, P&lt;.05). These
      differences, however, were not evident when crying time was
      adjusted for baseline crying time (Table 3). The analysis of
      adjusted mean heart rates showed that the acetaminophen group
      had significantly greater changes in heart rate during the
      clamp removal and recovery periods of the procedure (P&lt;.05
      for each of these stages).</p>

      <h3 align="center">DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p>Numerous studies have shown that circumcision causes
      severe intraoperative pain as measured by changes in
      crying,<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> heart rate, respiratory
      rate, transcutaneous PO<sub>2</sub>, <sup><a
      href="#n12">12,20</a></sup> and cortisol levels.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Adequate anesthesia such as that
      provided by local anesthesia with lidocaine or dorsal penile
      nerve block has been shown to ameliorate changes in each of
      these parameters.<sup><a href="#n9">9,12,21-23</a></sup>
      Additionally, simple interventions like sucrose-flavored
      pacifiers have been shown to reduce crying time.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> In the current study the observed
      changes in intraoperative heart rate respiratory rate, and
      crying times were consistent with severe intraoperative pain,
      and no clinically relevant differences between the study
      groups for any of the intraoperative pain measures were
      observed. Although differences were observed between groups
      for adjusted mean heart rates in the final two stages of the
      circumcision procedure, they were unexpected because they
      occurred during the least invasive portions of the procedure,
      contrasted to all other outcome procedures, were not believed
      to be clinically relevant, and may have been the result of
      analysis of multiple measures. Acetaminophen, an analgesic of
      only mild to moderate potency, this seems to be an
      ineffective analgesic for the management of intraoperative
      pain associated with circumcision in the newborn.</p>

      <p>Both groups of neonates showed significant deterioration
      in their comfort scores at all postoperative assessments.
      Although the number of neonates remaining in the hospital for
      the 24-hour assessment was small, postoperative scores had
      not returned to preoperative values. Other studies have
      documented changes in the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior
      Assessment secondary to circumcision that have persisted for
      at least 24 hours.<sup><a href="#n6">6,11</a></sup> The
      overall deterioration in comfort scores observed in this
      study is consistent with those observations.</p>

      <p>The results of this study also suggest that acetaminophen
      is ineffective for pain management in the immediate
      postoperative period (ie, the first 2 hours
      postcircumcision). Clinical experience with circumcision pain
      in older children validates this conclusion as regional
      anesthesia, potent non-steroidal drugs, and narcotic
      analgesics are often used for postoperative pain control for
      circumcision outside the neonatal period.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25-27</a></sup></p>

      <p>There was significant improvement, however, in the group
      of neonates who received acetaminophen 6 hours
      postoperatively. It thus seems that acetaminophen may provide
      some analgesia in circumcised neonates after the immediate
      postoperative period. Due to the early discharge of neonates,
      the number of postoperative comfort scores at 24 hours was
      insufficient for statistical analysis, and we were unable to
      evaluate acetaminophen effects after 6 hours.</p>

      <p>One probable explanation for the observed failure of
      acetaminophen to control pain in the immediate postoperative
      period is that <span class="yellow">the pain of circumcision
      is too severe to be controlled by a mild analgesic like
      acetaminophen</span>. Thus, even though acetaminophen is
      simple and safe to administer to newborns, it may not be
      indicated for the treatment of pain of circumcision in the
      immediate postoperative period.</p>

      <p>Subtherapeutic levels of acetaminophen might also explain
      inadequate postoperative analgesia, as acetaminophen levels
      were not monitored. Pharmacokinetic studies have been
      conducted in neonates, however, and dosages similar to those
      used in older children are recommended for use in neonates.
      These same studies indicate that drug absorption and
      half-life may be prolonged in neonates, but that syrup forms
      of acetaminophen improve drug absorption. Thus, an every
      6-hour dosage schedule was chosen for this study.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16,28</a></sup></p>

      <p>Another possible explanation for the failure to
      demonstrate immediate postoperative effectiveness of
      acetaminophen is that the measure of pain used were not
      sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in pain levels.
      However, results from the pilot series showed that the
      Postoperative Comfort store was quite effective in
      discriminating circumcised neonates from noncircumcised
      neonates; and as already stated, other studies have used
      changes in similar parameters to assess the pain associated
      with circumcision and its control with potent
      analgesics.<sup><a href="#n18">18,19</a></sup> Furthermore,
      the observed sharp decrease followed by a gradual increase of
      the score postcircumcision supports the use of this
      instrument for evaluating neonatal pain.</p>

      <p>The observed deterioration in postoperative feeding
      behavior has been <a
      href="/library/birth/marshall2/">documented by other
      investigators</a>.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">Infants feed less frequently and are less
      available for interaction after circumcision.</span> Subdued,
      less interactive behavior has been documented frequently and
      are less available for interaction after circumcision.
      <sup><a href="#n6">6,11,30</a></sup> In this study,
      acetaminophen seemed to have no effect on this deterioration.
      Because most hospital discharges occurred 7 to 10 hours after
      circumcision, the data are inadequate to assess the duration
      of the effects on feeding. <span class="yellow">Neonatal
      circumcision are often performed on the day of discharge with
      many neonates leaving the hospital 3 to 6 hours
      postoperatively. Thus the observed deterioration in ability
      to breast-feed may potentially contribute to breast feeding
      failure. Furthermore some neonates in this study required
      formula supplementation because of maternal frustration with
      attempts at breast-feeding, or because the neonate was judged
      unable to breast-feed postoperatively.</span> This finding is
      disconcerting because early formula supplementation is
      associated with decreased breast-feeding duration.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30,31</a></sup> Because, the vast majority of
      male infants in the United States undergo unanesthetized
      circumcision, this preliminary observation deserves further
      study.</p>

      <p>In summary, <span class="yellow">this study confirmed that
      circumcision of the newborn causes severe and persistent
      pain.</span> Acetaminophen was not found to ameliorate the
      the intraoperative or the immediate postoperative pain of
      circumcision, although it may provide some benefit after the
      immediate postoperative period. Given the large numbers of
      newborns who undergo this painful surgical procedure, it is
      imperative that safe and easily administered methods of
      anesthesia be found and utilized.</p>
