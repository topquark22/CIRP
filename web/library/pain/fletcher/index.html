      <h2 align="center">PAIN IN THE NEONATE</h2>

      <p class="text2">It has generally been assumed that the
      ability of a child to feel pain increases with age and that
      neonates may not perceive pain or may perceive it only
      minimally. Assumed by whom? Certainly not by those who have
      observed their increasing heart and respiratory rates and
      profuse sweating to heel sticks or circumcision. And finally
      not by those who have seen babies gasp for every breath as
      they die from incurable lung disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Why then has surgery in neonates been
      conducted without anesthesia? Is this barbarism, as some have
      suggested?<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> Is it indifference
      to the plight of those too young to respond verbally, or is
      there another explanation? First, one must ask whether such
      operations are as common as has been thought. Probably not.
      The increased rate of anesthesia in the past few years has
      decreased their number dramatically. But why have needle
      sticks and circumcisions been routinely done without any
      thought of the pain incurred by the infant? More important,
      why are heel sticks, venipunctures, intubations, chest-tube
      insertions, and suctioning routinely done without much
      consideration of the physiologic or possible psychologic
      damage to the neonate?</p>

      <p class="text2">The reason these procedures are done without
      anesthesia is not barbarism. One must remember that
      neonatalogy, and perhaps neonatal anesthesiology
      specifically, are relatively new fields. Many sick neonates
      who are surviving through intensive care and surgery today
      would not have lived 20 years ago. In our preoccupation with
      survival and improved outcome, relatively little attention
      was paid to pain and its control. It was not indifference or
      lack or concern but a lack of awareness and a fixed but
      unfocused outlook that led to this situation.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this issue of the <i>Journal</i>, the
      excellent <a href="/library/pain/anand/">review</a> by Anand
      and Hickey on the biologic aspects of pain and its effects in
      the human neonate and fetus helps to explain this
      situation.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Among the 201
      references cited, approximately 20 articles appeared in
      journals that neonatologists read with reasonable frequency.
      Most of these articles deal with plasma opioids, apnea, the
      use of local anesthesia in circumcisions, or the response of
      the infant to environmental stress. A few more of the 201
      would probably have been available to anesthesiologists,
      particularly those who read the European literature. Unless a
      neonatalogist had made a concerted effort to study the topic
      of pain, a subject that has not until now been in the
      forefront of concern in neonatal care, he or she would not
      have had easy access to most of the information in the Anand
      study. Making this information accessible represents an
      important contribution.</p>

      <p class="text2">Good often comes from bad. In fact, change
      has already begun in neonatal intensive care units. More
      attention is being channeled into improving the environment
      by decreasing the intensity of the lighting,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> lowering noise levels, using more
      physiologic positioning of infants, limiting painful
      procedures, allowing more time for uninterrupted sleep,
      comforting infants after painful intervention, administering
      fentanyl when an infant is paralized with pancuronium, and
      using analgesics in postoperative patients. At Children's
      Hospital National Medical Center in Washington, where
      criticism from parents helped to bring questions about pain
      to the fore, anesthesia is now being used in virtually all
      neonatal surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">Safe anesthetic drugs for newborns now
      exist. The two most commonly used are the narcotic fentanyl
      and lidocaine, which is locally infiltrated into the skin
      used as a nerve block. Fentanyl is a potent analgesic whose
      precise method of action is unknown. It has been shown to
      block nocioceptive stimuli, to maintain hemodynamic
      stability, and to prevent the biochemistry and endocrine
      stresses of surgery that may be harmful to the
      newborn.<sup><a href="#n6">6-8</a></sup> In dose-response
      studies, Yaster has shown that the effects of a 12.5 mu-g of
      fentanyl per kilogram of body weight given in a bolus can
      last for 120 minutes of surgery before supplementation is
      needed.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Local infiltration of
      the skin or nerve block with lidocaine is effective, although
      intravenous injection should be avoided. There should be very
      little reason to perform cutdowns, chest-tube insertions, or
      circumcisions without using this agent.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neonatalogists need to continue to observe
      infants to recognize stress responses to pain and to treat
      them appropriately. We also need to urge our colleagues to
      see that infants receive analgesia and anesthesia. We must
      listen to and be honest with parents who at times have
      overwhelming fear about the pain their infants may be
      feeling.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recently, the <a
      href="/library/pain/aap/">Committee on the Fetus and Newborn,
      the Committee on Drugs, the Section on Anesthesiology, and
      the Section on Surgery of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> stated that local and systemic anesthetic
      agents are now available and relatively safe in neonates. The
      Anand and Hickey <a href="/library/pain/anand/">study</a>
      marshals the empirical evidence justifying the use of these
      drugs. The observations cited in this review should dispel
      the now outmoded notion that newborns are insensitive to or
      immune from pain. Consequently any decision to withhold
      anesthetic agents ought not to be based on the infant's age
      or perceived degree of cortical maturity; it should be based
      on the same criteria used in older patients.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There will necessarily be occasional
      unavoidable noxious stimuli in the neonatal intensive care
      unit. We must not attempt to provide such as stress-free
      experience in that setting that there is unchecked use of
      analgesia. <span class="yellow">But the evidence that
      nociceptive activity constitutes a physiologic stress in
      newborns is so overwhelming that physicians can no longer act
      as if infants were indifferent to pain. Neonatalogists,
      anesthesiologists, and surgeons must join with parents to
      guarantee that the best is done for newborns and to ensure
      that they are kept as free of pain as possible.</span></p>
