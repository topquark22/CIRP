        <font face="arial">Using data from one of our randomised
        trials, we investigated post-hoc whether male neonatal
        circumcision is associated with a greater pain response to
        routine vaccination at 4 or 6 months. Pain response during
        routine vaccination with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT)
        alone or DPT followed by <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type
        b conjugate was scored blind. 42 boys received DPT and 18
        also received HIB. After DPT, median visual analogue scores
        by an observer were higher in the circumcised group (40) vs
        26 mm, p=0.02) After HIB, circumcised infants had higher
        behavior pain scores. (8 vs 6, p=0.01) and cried longer 53
        vs 19 s, p=0.020. Thus neonatal circumcision may affect
        pain response several months after the event.<br />

      <p>In our randomised controlled trial of a topical
      anaesthetic cream (EMLA, eutectic mixture of local
      anaesthetics; Astra) on infant pain in routine
      diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccination, boys had
      higher pain scores than girls.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      If this sex difference is a real effect, it may be partly
      related to previous experience with acute pain, such as
      circumcision. Circumcised babies have short-term alterations
      in behaviour, sleep patterns, frequency of feeding, crying,
      fussiness, and heart rate. <sup>2-7</sup> Effects beyond the
      first few hours after the painful event have not been
      investigated. We have done a post-hoc analysis from our
      trial<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> to investigate whether
      circumcision was associated with pain scores during
      vaccination.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy boys aged 4-6 months
      (mean 5) who were vaccinated with DPT alone, or DPT and
      Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (HIB), were included.
      DPT was administered intramuscularly on the upper thigh 60
      minutes after treatment with EMLA or placebo. Infants who
      also received HIB were given an intramuscular dose several
      minutes after the DPT and on the opposite leg without EMLA or
      placebo. All injections were made by one or two
      paediatricians.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the DPT injection, an
      observer and the paediatrician who administered the vaccine
      (both unaware of treatment allocations) rated the infant's
      pain response on a 100 mm ungraded visual analogue scale
      (VAS: 0=nopain, 100-worst possible pain). We videotaped the
      infants during their one or two injections, until they
      settled. A coder who was unaware of the treatments rated the
      pain responses for all vaccinations on a modified behavioural
      pain scale (face, cry, and body movements). The total pain
      score was obtained by adding the scores of the components and
      varied between 0 and 10.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      Baseline pain scores, post procedural scores, net pain (ie,
      difference between baseline and post vaccination score), and
      duration of cry were assessed for all injections. Infants who
      had undergone painful procedures that were not routine (eg,
      lumbar puncture, surgery) were excluded from analyses.
      Infants who were in discomfort before the vaccine (ie,
      baseline behavioural pain scores greater than 2) were also
      excluded form analysis of pain for that vaccination.
      Statistical differences were calculated with Mann-Whitney,
      &chi;<sup>2</sup>, or Fisher's exact tests. Correlations were
      done with Spearman's method.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 42 boys who received
      DPT, 30 (71) had been circumcised. No significant differences
      were found between circumcised and uncircumcised infants in
      demographic</p>

      <p>characteristics. Observer's VAS pain ratings were higher
      for the circumcised boys (median 40 <i>vs</i> 26 mm, p=0.03)
      Paediatricians' VAS scores showed similar trend but were not
      significant (56 <i>vs</i> 30 mm, p=0.07). There was also a
      trend toward less crying for the uncircumcised boys (7.3
      <i>vs</i> 22.3s, p=0.06). The median post-vaccination pain
      score was 8 for the circumcised group compared with 7 in the
      uncircumcised group (p=0.2).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stratified the infants by
      whether they were premedicated with the local anesthetic
      (n=24) or placebo (n=18), and repeated the analyses. In the
      local anaesthetic group, both observer's and paediatricians'
      VAS scores were higher for circumcised boys (32 <i>vs</i> 10
      mm, p=0.004; and 35 <i>vs</i> 13 mm, p=0.01, respectively).
      The total duration of crying was longer (14 <i>vs</i> 5 s,
      p=0.004), and there was a trend toward higher
      post-vaccination scores (7 vs 6, p=0.1) in the circumcised
      group. These results suggest that the local anaesthetic was
      more effective on infants that were uncircumcised (ie, may
      not already be conditioned to pain). No significant
      differences were observed in the pain responses of the
      placebo-treated infants.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18 infants received the HIB
      vaccine; 13 (72%) had been circumcised. These infants were
      younger than than the other boys who participated in the
      trial (126 <i>vs</i> 140.5) days, p=0.02). They did not not
      differ, however, in other demographic characteristics, or in
      pain scores and cry duration for the first vaccine.
      Circumcision was positively associated with post-vaccine
      behavioural pain scores (r=0.61, p=0.007), net pain scores
      (r=0.67, p=0.002), and duration of crying (r=0.57, p=0.02).
      Circumcised boys had higher pain scores and cried longer
      (figure).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also looked at cultural
      background (eg, being Jewish) and maternal intervention on
      pain response. No significant associations were found. Since
      11 infants were initially excluded from the HIB analyses
      because of discomfort before injection, which may have
      introduced bias, analyses were repeated including those
      infants: the effects of circumcision on pain response were
      even more statistically significant.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male circumcision is the
      most common neonatal surgical procedure. <span
      class="yellow">It causes intense pain and measurable changes
      in behaviour that last up to 1 day.</span> We found that
      circumcision status was associated with increased infant pain
      response to routine vaccination at 4-6 months. Circumcised
      boys had significantly longer crying bouts and higher pain
      scores. That both outcome measures, pain index, and cry
      duration, were influenced by circumcision lends credibility
      to our observations. During the second (HIB) vaccination,
      circumcision status was more clearly associated with the
      observed pain response than after DPT. The DPT injection
      might have had a priming effect in circumcised infants which
      led them to exhibit even more pain after the HIB injection.
      The effects of memory and reinforcement on later nocioceptive
      experience in neonates are not known.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Because memory of pain is believed to
      be important in subsequent pain perception, and the main
      structures for memory are functional in the neonatal period,
      it is conceivable that pain from circumcision may have
      long-lasting effects<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> on pain
      response and/or perception.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-hoc nature of our
      analyses and the small sample sizes make our conclusions
      speculative. Nevertheless, we suggest that analgesia should
      be routine for circumcision to avoid possible long-term
      effects in infant boys' pain responses.</p>
