<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</center>

<p>Studies relevant to nociception and its consequences in the very
young have proliferated in recent years and the above review can
only survey a rapidly evolving field. Despite the promise of
continued scientific advances, certain fundamental questions lie
outside the realm of clinical investigation per se. For example,
questions regarding quality of life are often posed for the adult
patient with pain, for example due to cancer. In those settings,
the patient's verbal description are heavily weighted, as are his
or her functional abilities as a family member and productive
individual within society. Defining quality of life in normal
neonates, particularly in premature, is infinitely more difficult
given their inability to express or otherwise convey experiences
and emotions. Furthermore, "purposeful activity" is a concept that
is irrelevant to the neonatal setting.</p>

<p>Despite these difficulties, one must take into account the
neonate's potential to grow and develop, to overcome handicaps, and
to experience life to a degree far greater than in the adult. To
foster optimum development, stress during the perioperative period
or prolonged intensive care should be minimized.<sup><a href=
"#n3">3</a></sup> The recognition of highly developed nociceptive
systems, and evidence of clinical, physiologic, and psychologic
sequellae of inadequately treated pain in neonates and children,
mandate that aggressive treatment of pain is central to such care.
In the future, knowledge of nociceptive mechanisms and their
ontogeny in the human undoubtedly will be exploited to apply novel
treatments of pain in context-dependent manner. As this occurs, the
present perspective that pain and suffering are inevitable results
of each child's illness will have to be abandoned.</p>
