      Pain</b></font></p>

      <p><big><i>Pain has been a puzzle for many years. Now
      researchers<br />
      are discovering that babies have quite different pain<br />
      mechanisms to adults.</i></big></p>

      class="init">W</span>e all experience pain at some time.
      Fortunately the sensation is usually brief but in some cases
      it persists. Increasing understanding in recent years of how
      pain is processed in the brain has brought exciting
      breakthoughs in pain-killing treatments. But this research
      has focused on adults. When it comes to babies, things are
      quite different.</p>

      <p class="text2">Adults can describe and quantify their pain,
      report of the effectiveness of a pain-killer and develop
      strategies for coping with persistent problems. But this is
      not true of infants and children. Babies cannot tell you
      about pain and even school children find it hard to
      describe.</p>

      <p class="text2">Until about ten years ago, it was assumed
      infants simply did not experience pain. Babies born
      prematurely, would undergo essential but traumatic medical or
      surgical procedures without painkilling drugs. Even young
      children's analgesic requirements were considered to be much
      lower than adults.</p>

      <p class="text2">The problem was that little was known about
      the development of somatosensation - how the brain acquires
      its ability to detect body stimulation - and their was no
      information at all on the state of the nerve pathways that
      signal pain in newborn babies.</p>

      <p class="text2">In recent years, however, new biological
      knowledge has started to shed light on how our nerve pathways
      develop and reveal a very different picture.</p>

      <p class="text2">Our laboratory was the first to investigate
      how pain signaling, or nociception, develops in the newborn,
      and our first step was to establish whether the infant
      nervous system is capable of reacting to harmful stimulation
      in an organised predictable and measurable way.</p>

      <p class="text2">When adults and older children are hurt,
      specialised sensory nerves known as nociceptors send signals
      to the spinal cord and brain which prompt the body into
      automatic awarewess of pain. Since they cannot talk about it,
      it is very difficult to asses newborn infants' perception of
      pain, but it is possible to measure the protective reactions
      which, we know from adults, exactly parallel the sensation of
      pain.</p>

        alt="My spinal reflex response to a harmful stimuli is much greater than yours." />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">To test the level of pain processing in the
      human infant spinal cord, we focused on the reflex which
      causes the body to automatically draw back from a painful
      stimulus (Figure 1). We proposed that infants exposed to the
      kind of stimuli they might experience in intensive care or
      surgery would either respond weakly because their pain system
      is too immature to function properly, or they would react in
      a similar way to adults but perhaps less efficiently or
      completely.</p>

      <p class="text2">What we did not predict was that they would
      respond quite differently to adults, and that their
      somatosensory system would involve unique, short-lived
      signalling pathways not found in the mature nervous
      system.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="PainFig1.jpg" alt="Fig.1" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Figure 1 A
      pain in the foot sends messages to the spinal cord which are
      relayed to stimulate the flexor muscles which pull the limb
      toward the body and to inhibit the extensor muscles which
      take the limb away. Result: a reflex action to pull away from
      the cause of pain. The reflex message is projected to the
      brain where it can be measured to indicate the level of pain
      response.</b></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Our work showed that three key aspects of
      sensory processing in the spinal cord underlie responses to
      pain in the newborn.</p>

      <p class="text2">First, an infant's spinal sensory nerve
      cells are more excitable than an adult's. This makes their
      spinal reflex response to a harmful stimulus much greater and
      more prolonged.</p>

      <p class="text2">Second, individual sensory nerve cells in
      newborns are linked to much larger areas of skin - or
      receptive fields than in adults. This means reflex responses
      can be triggered from a larger body area. Receptive fields
      combine to form a 'map' or image of our body surface in our
      brain and enable us to locate a stimulus in a particular part
      of our body. In newborns, it appears, the larger receptive
      fields result in a less precise or 'smeared' body map
      compared to adults.</p>

      <p class="text2">Lastly, where adults only produce pain
      reflexes when they encounter harmful stimulation, newborns
      respond less selectively and produce the same reflex even to
      a light touch.</p>

      <p class="text2">We have revealed some of the mechanisms
      which underlie these sensory features. For example, we found
      that in newborns the sensory nerve fibres that communicate
      non-harmful touch - known as "A" fibres - end is a different
      part of the spinal cord from adults.</p>

      <p class="text2">The spinal cord cells in this area control
      several pain mechanisms such as those which cause the pain
      response to increase when exposed to a repeated stimulus, and
      those which trigger genes to produce chemicals in response to
      pain. In adults, the cells are only connected to pain
      transmitting 'C fibres' (see Figure 2), but in newborns,
      because of the different wiring, they can be triggered by
      non-painful, 'A" fibre stimulation.</p>

      <p class="text2">These nerve fibres from the brainstem start
      to grow down the spinal cord early in fetal life, but they do
      not extend branches into the spinal cord for some time, and
      do not function fully until soon after birth. This means the
      premature baby can not benefit from the natural pain-killing
      system which in adults dampens down pain messages as they
      enter the central nervous system.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="PainFig2.jpg" alt="Fig.2" />
      </center>

      <p class="caption"><b>Figure 2 Too close for comfort; pain
      and harmless touch sensations arrive at quite different areas
      of the spinal cord in adults. In newborns, fibres carrying
      touch messages (A fibres) terminate close to the
      pain-carrying C fibres which can cause infants difficulty in
      distinguishing pain from harmless touch.</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Do these discoveries mean that the newborn
      infant's spinal cord transmittts a different pain signal to
      the cortex to that of the adult? We think so.</p>

      <p class="text2">Much of the immaturity that we have found
      suggests newborns have a spinal sensory system that is more
      sensitive than the adult system. This may have a
      developmental advantage, encouraging weak nerves cells
      junctions to strengthen through plenty of activity. But it
      may also mean newborns have increased false alarms.</p>

      <p class="text2">They are also more likely to be more
      unpredicatable in their sensory responses, since their
      spread-out central terminals and large spinal cord cell
      receptive fields are likely to lead to poorer placing of
      stimuli and less selective responses.</p>

      <p class="text2">How this affects the brain and an infant's
      awareness of pain is unclear, since very little is known
      about the processing of pain in the brain. It is important to
      remember that these findings relate only to spinal cord pain
      mechanisms which are one step in the pain pathway, and that
      the actual experience or awareness of pain requires brain
      activity which we believe develops some time after birth
      along with memory, anxiety and other cognitive brain
      functions.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, the evidence is building up that
      the importance of adequate analgesia for infants and children
      goes beyond their immediate comfort and wellbeing. Reports in
      clinical and psychological literatue indicate early injury or
      trauma can have long-term consequences on sensory or pain
      behavior that extend into childhood and beyond.</p>

      <p class="text2">In adults, for example, MRC researcher
      Clifford Woolf has shown that when a sensory nerve is damaged
      or chronically inflamed, the nociceptive mechanisms change
      and the nervous system no longer relies on signals from the
      site of the injury to trigger pain. Instead, pain is
      generated by altered activity within the spinal cord and the
      brain itself is much harder to tolerate or to control. (see
      <i>MRC News</i> Issue 67).</p>

      <p class="caption"><font face="ariel" size="2"><b>Figure 3
      Surface nerve damage at birth can kill spinal nerve cells.
      Nearby surviving nerve cells then sprout to make new
      connections which can make the child hypersensitive to touch
      long after the wound has healed.</b></font></p>

      <p class="text2">We and others have established that the
      developing nervous system is even more vulnerable to injury
      than in adults and that changes to the pathways induced
      shortly after birth can become permanent. This is because
      newborn nerve damage not only results in the death of sensory
      nerve cells, but causes other sensory nerve terminals to
      sprout extensively and occupy areas normally exclusively
      devoted to the damaged nerve.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">These new sprouts form
      inappropriate connections with spinal nerve cord cells in
      areas far outside their normal termination region, causing
      the nervous system to become permanently distorted (See
      Figure 3). Even a simple skin wound at birth can trigger
      changes which result in the area becoming over-supplied with
      sensory nerve terminals. This leaves the area hypersensitive
      to touch long after the wound has healed</span> (see Figure
      4).</p>

      <p class="text2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Figure 4
      Lingering pain: For weeks after injury at birth damaged skin
      can stay more touch sensitive than uninjured
      skin.</b></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Although in the short term these changes
      could be called a useful compensatory device to make up for
      the loss of sensory input from an area, the long-term effects
      of a permanent alteration in the body's sensory mapping may
      be detrimental.</p>

      <p class="text2">Our aim now is to investigate the biological
      basis for this adaptability of the nervous system and the
      long-term consequences of early injuries. What we find will
      be of major importance for clinicians and babies in their
      care.</p>
