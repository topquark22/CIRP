Barry Meisel, Vol II no 1:

"Anyone who circumcises a neonate senses the pain and stress that
occurs during the manipulative stages of the procedure and certainly
when the prepuce is clamped with mosquito forceps and when the
dorsal slit is made. The infant cries vigorously, trembles and
tries to wiggle free. He may become cyanotic from prolonged crying."

Dorothy Greenbaum, Vol VII no 1:

"For the child, the experience is clearly more physical than
psychological. We know the child feels pain--measurements of heart
rate, 02 saturation, blood pressure, serum cortisol and recordings
of cry and facial grimaces all give evidence that the child does
indeed feel this. ... Anand's studies demonstrate that the baby
has an intact neuroanatomic apparatus for the conduction of
nociceptive impulses from the periphery to the sensory cortex. The
baby is capable of experiencing this as a trauma. And, it is a
trauma which affects his behavior in some cases for as long as
twenty-four hours after circumcision. The child is not a willing
participant here."
