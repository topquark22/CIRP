      <p class="section">INTRODUCTION</p>

      <p class="text1">T<span class="sc1">HE</span> <span
      class="sc1">PURPOSE</span> of this study was to examine the
      relationship between behavioral state and pituitary - adrenal
      cortical activity under conditions of physical trauma in the
      newborn. The pituitary-adrenal cortical system plays a major
      role in an organism's adaptation to traumatic conditions
      (Selye, 1956). Furthermore, in human adults and in animals
      activity of the pituitary - adrenal cortical system has been
      shown to be sensitive to changes in psychological state,
      especially under conditions eliciting anxiety and negative
      emotional arousal. (<a href="/library/pain/anders1/">Anders
      <i>et al</i>., 1970</a>; Hennessy &amp; Levine, 1979;
      Frankenhaeuser, 1980). We have only recently begun to examine
      the ontogenesis of these psychobiological relationships in
      human infants. Two studies have shown moderate, positive
      correlations between the neonates behavioral state (with
      crying on the high end of the scale) and serum cortisol
      concentrations (a measure of adrenocortical activity) (Anders
      <i>et al</i>., 1970; <a href="/library/pain/tennes1/">Tennes
      &amp; Carter, 1973</a>). Neither of these studies examined
      the relationship between behavioral state and increases in
      serum cortisol concentrations over pre-session or basal
      values (&Delta; cortisol), which is the psychobiological
      relationship most frequently studied in human adults and
      animals (Hennesy &amp; Levine, 1979; Frankenhaeuser, 1980).
      Furthermore, both studies examined infants under conditions
      of low or mild stress. No studies have examined whether these
      psychobiological relationships hold under conditions which
      can be considered traumatic in the neonatal period.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this study, circumcision was the physical
      trauma. Circumcision was chosen for the following reasons.
      First, although there is continuing controversy over the
      medical necessity and advisability of circumcision, it is
      estimated that between 69 and 97% of all males born in the
      United States are circumcised shortly after birth (Kaplan,
      1977). Thus circumcision is a potential traumatic event
      experienced by the majority of newborn males in this country.
      Second, few studies have found evidence of an adrenocortical
      response to physical stressors in the first week of life
      (Hillman &amp; Giroud, 1965; Gutai et al., 1972). The
      exception was a study by <a
      href="/library/pain/talbert/">Talbert <i>et al</i>.
      (1976)</a> who found increases in serum cortisol
      concentrations immediately following circumcision. In their
      study, however, circumcision was performed only 2-6 hours
      after birth. Most circumcisions are performed later, at 3-5
      days post-partum. There is some evidence that the neonatal
      adrenocortical system, while active during the first few
      hours after birth, may become less active or responsive, for
      several days, by 24-48 hr post-partum (Sippell <i>et al</i>.,
      1978). Thus we wanted to determine the responsiveness of the
      adrenocortical system to circumcision later in the neonatal
      period (3-5 days of age), when circumcision is typically
      performed. Finally, there is an increasing interest in the
      behavioral effects of circumcision (<a
      href="/library/birth/emde/">Emde <i>et al</i>., 1971</a>; <a
      href="/library/birth/anders/">Anders &amp; Chalemian,
      1974</a>; <a href="/library/psych/brackbill/">Richards <i>et
      al</i>., 1976</a>; <a
      href="/library/pain/rawlings1/">Rawlings <i>et al</i>.,
      1980</a>) Both operative and postoperative changes in
      behavior, including behavioral state, have been noted.
      However, no studies have been attempted to examine
      neuroendocrine correlates of these behavioral effects. Given
      the work on neonatal stress, adrenocortical response, and
      subsequent reductions in emotionality in animals (Levine,
      1969), and understanding of the psychobiology of neonatal
      stress in humans is clearly warranted.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the following study infants were
      circumcised at 3- to 5-days of age. Blood samples for serum
      cortisol determination were obtained immediately before and
      30 minutes after the beginning of surgery. Behavioral state
      were monitored for half hour periods before, during, and
      after circumcision. It was expected that (1) circumcision
      would produce significant increases in serum cortisol
      concentrations, and (2) increases in serum cortisol
      concentrations over pre-circumcision levels (&Delta;
      cortisol) Finally, the relationship between &Delta; cortisol
      and behavioral state post-circumcision was explored.</p>

      <p class="section">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</p>

      <p class="text2">Eight healthy male infants were circumcised
      at 57-80 hours after birth. Subjects were selected on the
      following basis: 1 min Apgar greater than 7, birthweight
      greater than 3000 g, normal neonatal course, absence of
      distress state (crying), and absence of arousing stimulation
      (e.g. bath, physical examination) during the half hour prior
      to circumcision. All infants were breastfed. Maternal age
      ranged from 21 to 33 yr. Parents' consent was obtained
      shortly after the infant's birth.*</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision was performed using the Gomco
      clamp method. Circumcision took between 16 and 36 min
      (average 20 minutes) from the time the infant was strapped to
      the surgical board until the infant was picked up. All
      circumcisions were performed between 08:00 and 15:00 hr, in
      all but one case by the same physician. Nursing procedures
      varied, with some nurses attempting to pacify the events
      during surgery, while others did not do so. It should be
      noted that circumcision involved the combination of a number
      of stressors (e.g. delay in feeding, physical restraint,
      tissue damage, and in the present study venipuncture). It was
      not the purpose of this study to determine the relative
      contributions of each stressor to the neonates
      pituitary-adrenal or behavioral response.</p>

      <p class="text2">Blood samples (0.6 ml whole blood via scalp
      venipuncture) were obtained for serum cortisol determination
      immediately before the infant was strapped to the surgical
      board and half an hour later or immediately following
      circumcision if the surgery lasted more than 30 min. This
      procedure involved 2 separate venipunctures. The samples were
      immediately centrifuged and the serum separated and stored at
      -20C. Cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay as described
      by Kao et al (1975). This assay is highly specific for
      cortisol; however the values reflected some small amounts of
      cortisone (0.3%) and corticosterone (1.7%) activity.</p>

      <p class="text2">Behavioral state was recorded for half hour
      periods before, during, and after circumcision. Two observers
      recorded the infant's state every 30 sec, using the six-point
      scale described in Table 1. Estimates of inter-observer
      reliability were obtained on 7 neonates (3 pre-test and 4
      actual subjects). Pearson correlation coefficients were
      computed using the total frequencies of each state before,
      during, and after circumcision, separately. All coefficients
      were above 0.90. In addition, for the purpose of examining
      the relationship between pituitary-adrenal activity and
      behavioral state, each behavioral state was weighted, as
      indicated in Table 1. The weights were then summed and
      averaged for each infant during each observation period
      (before, during, and after circumcision). Inter-observer
      reliablities for those weighted states were also quite high
      (r values &gt;0.90).</p>

      <p class="section">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Circumcision produced
      striking increases in serum cortisol concentrations as can be
      seen in Fig. 1 (paired t = 15.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
      Increases over pre-circumcision levels (&Delta; cortisol)
      ranged from 10 to 19 &micro;g/dl. Thus 30-40 minutes after
      the beginning of circumcision, concentrations of serum
      cortisol were 3-4 times greater than concentrations of serum
      cortisol immediately before circumcision. These results are
      consistent with results obtained by Talbert <i>et al</i>.
      (1976), indicating a similar responsiveness of the
      pituitary-adrenal cortical system to circumcision stress at
      2-6 hr and 3-5 days after birth.</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Circumcision also
      produced changes in behavioral state.</span> Figure 2 depicts
      the mean percentage of time in each state before, during, and
      after circumcision. This figure also shows the percentage of
      time spent in awake states (crying, active awake, alert and
      drowsy). Wakefulness increased during circumcision, with
      percent crying showing the greatest increase. On the
      six-point scale, with crying at the high end of the scale,
      the average behavioral state during circumcision was 4.7
      (range 3.8-5.2), compared to 2.4 (range 1.4-3.9) and 2.5
      (range 2.0-3.1) before and after circumcision, respectively.
      Thus, circumcision produced dramatic increases in behavioral
      state, primarily in the form of increased crying. This
      increase was short-lived, however, with average state
      returning to near pre-circumcision levels during the half
      hour after circumcision. The reasons for such a rapid return
      to apparent normality will be discussed below.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">As predicted, average
      behavioral state during circumcision was positively
      correlated with increases in serum cortisol concentrations
      over pre-circumcision levels</span> (Pearson <i>r</i> =
      +0.79, p&lt;0.05). The correlation of cortisol with crying,
      one component of behavioral state, was also significant
      (Pearson <i>r</i> = +0.71, p&lt;0.05). Thus, infants who
      showed more behavioral distress during circumcision were also
      evidencing greater increases in adrenocortical activity.
      These data indicate that the close correspondance between
      pituitary-adrenal activity and behavioral state is not
      restricted to conditions of low or mild stimulation, but also
      is clearly evident under conditions of intense, traumatic
      stimulation in the neonate.*</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Neonatal circumcision
      is performed without anesthesia and it is clearly stressful
      for the infant.</span> Examination of techniques which may
      reduce stress thus is warranted. In this study some of the
      nurses in attendance attempted to calm the infants during
      circumcision by using a pacifier, while others did not do so.
      Although this was not a controlled aspect of the study, half
      of the infants received pacifiers while half did not. Use of
      the pacifier significantly reduced crying. Crying in the
      pacifier group ranged form 20 to 46% of the time during
      circumcision, while crying in the no-pacifier group ranged
      form 57 to 64% of the circumcision time. Increases in serum
      cortisol concentrations (&Delta; cortisol) showed similar
      patterns, with the mean in the pacifier group being 14.0
      &micro;g/dl (S.E. = &plusmn;1.6). while the mean in the
      no-pacifier group was 16.3 &micro;g/dl (S.E. = &plusmn; 1.1).
      This difference was not significant in this small sample.
      Given the association between crying and adrenocortical
      response in the neonate, the possibility that pacifying
      stimuli may reduce the newborn's pituitary-adrenal response
      deserves further investigation in a larger sample. If such an
      effect could be shown, it would suggest that the cortisol
      response to circumcision is influenced by both psychological
      and physical factors. There is evidence that psychological
      factors can produce changes in pituitary-adrenal activity.
      (Hennessy &amp; Levine, 1979). The extent to which
      psychological stressors can produce a cortisol response is an
      open question and cannot be inferred from the data in the
      present study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, behavioral state following
      circumcision was examined. As noted earlier there was a rapid
      return to pre-circumcision state, with most infants being
      either drowsy or in light sleep during the half hour
      following circumcision. This contrasts with the finding by
      Anders &amp; Chalemain (1974) of greater wakefulness in the
      hour after circumcision. The rapid return to quiescent state
      in the present study was probably due to the infants being
      held, fed and comforted by their mothers.</p>

      <p class="text2">Average behavioral state following
      circumcision was negatively correlated with both &Delta;
      cortisol (Pearson <i>r</i> = -0.49) and percent crying during
      circumcision (Pearson <i>r</i> = -0.72, <i>p</i> &lt;0.05).
      Although only the correlation with crying reached statistical
      significance, thes data do suggest an inverse relationship
      between stress and subsequent behavioral state. This inverse
      relationship was demonstrated most clearly by two infants who
      were the only ones who spent any appreciable time in the most
      quiescent state, deep sleep following circumcision (27 and
      18% of post-circumcision observation intervals, vs 0-7% for
      the other infants). These two infants had experienced the
      most stressful circumcisions, as indexed by (1) the greatest
      increases in serum cortisol concentrations, (2) the two
      higher percent crying scores, (3) the longest circumcisions,
      and (4) the fact that neither infant was given a pacifier to
      calm them during circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">These data are open to several alternative
      interpretations. First, they may reflect the effects of
      fatigue. Second, <span class="yellow">several researchers
      have suggested the existence of a conservation-withdrawal
      coping process emerging early in development (Emde <i>et
      al</i>, 1971). Accordingly, the infant may withdraw into a
      quiescent state following intensely stressful experiences,
      thereby raising a stimulus barrier which prevents stimuli
      from having additional arousal-inducing effects.</span>
      Finally, the mothers may have been responsive to their
      babies' stress, and altered their own behavior accordingly,
      thereby providing more calming stimulation for the more
      stressed or distressed babies. Regardless of the stressful
      stimulation, the newborn is capable of altering behavioral
      state in a manner which should increase the rate of return to
      homeostasis. The relationship between state following
      circumcision and the time course of pituitary-adrenal
      cortical activity remains to be examined.</p>
