      <h2>Randomised trial of fentanyl anaesthesia<br />
       in preterm babies undergoing surgery:<br />
       effects on the stress response.</h2>

      <p><b>Anand KJ, Sippell WG, Aynsley-Green A</b></p>

      <p>In a randomised controlled trial, preterm babies
      undergoing ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus were given
      nitrous oxide and d-tubocurarine, with (n = 8) or without (n
      = 8) fentanyl (10 micrograms/kg intravenously) to the
      anaesthetic regimen. Major hormonal responses to surgery, as
      indicated by changes in plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline,
      glucagon, aldosterone, corticosterone,
      11-deoxycorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol levels, in the
      insulin/glucagon, molar ratio and in blood glucose, lactate,
      and pyruvate concentrations were significantly greater in the
      non-fentanyl than in the fentanyl group. The urinary
      3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratios were significantly
      greater in the non-fentanyl group on the second and third
      postoperative days. <span class="yellow">Compared with the
      fentanyl group, the non-fentanyl group had circulatory and
      metabolic complications postoperatively. The findings
      indicate that preterm babies mount a substantial stress
      response to surgery under anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and
      curare and that prevention of this response by fentanyl
      anaesthesia may be associated with an improved postoperative
      outcome.</span></p>
