          evaluate the effectiveness of the dorsal penile nerve
          block in reducing the stress of circumcision upon
          newborns, physiologic measurements in 30 healthy
          full-term infants (including transcutaneous oxygen
          levels, crying time, heart rate, and respiratory rate)
          were monitored continuously before, during, and after the
          operation. Infants receiving the dorsal penile nerve
          block with lidocaine (1% Xylocaine) (N = 20) experienced
          significantly less stress, as evidenced by smaller
          decreases in transcutaneous oxygen pressure levels, less
          time spent crying, and smaller increases in heart rate,
          than infants circumcised in an identical manner without
          anesthetic (N = 10). No complications resulted from
          injection of the local anesthetic or from the
          circumcision procedure itself. Inasmuch as dorsal penile
          nerve block has a low complication rate, is simple to
          learn, and adds little time or expense to the overall
          procedure, and if it proves to be as effective clinically
          as the physiologic data indicate, the dorsal penile nerve
          block should be considered for every infant undergoing
          circumcision. <i>Pediatrics</i> 1983;71:36-40; <i>newborn

      href="/library/pain/kirya1/">Kirya and Werthman</a><a
      href="#n1"><font size="2"><sup>1</sup></font></a> have
      developed a local anesthetic technique for newborn
      circumcision called the dorsal penile nerve block. The 52
      infants they studied experienced a low complication rate: one
      infant's circumcision bled slightly and one infant developed
      a small hematoma at the injection site. Kirya and Werthman
      reported that the infants who received the injection seemed
      quieter, but this factor was not compared using a control
      group. Kirya and Werthman did not measure the pain
      contributed by the injection itself, did not report the
      effects of the lidocaine (Xylocaine) on the newborn, and did
      not look for subsequent genitourinary side effects or the
      longer term behavioral effects.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      circumcision of full-term male infants has frequently been
      used as a model to study the physiologic response of newborns
      to pain. Adrenal cortical response<a href="#n2"><font

      Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font><sup><a href="#n5"><font
      size="2">5</font></a></sup> are all altered in a manner that
      has been attributed to the pain response. Some suggest that
      newborns do not feel pain because their nerve pathways are
      not sufficiently myelinated to transmit painful stimuli.<a
      href="#n6"><font size="2"><sup>6</sup></font></a> Some
      practicing physicians think that newborn circumcision does
      not require anesthesia because it is comparitively brief. The
      physiologic evidence contradicts both of these positions.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      current controlled study was undertaken to determine the
      effectiveness and risks of the dorsal penile nerve block in
      reducing some of the stress-induced physiologic alterations
      of newborns who undergo circumcision without anesthesia. If
      the dorsal penile nerve block is safe, effective, and easily
      implemented into current clinical practice, it should be
      learned and utilized by every physician who circumcises
      newborns.</p>

      <p><font face="arial" size="4">SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Newborn male infants admitted to a major university medical
      center were screened for entry into the study after
      circumcision consent had been obtained by the medical staff.
      Thirty newborns were selected for the study, after parental
      informed consent for participation was obtained. Each infant
      had voided following delivery and was clinically well.
      Additional screening for acceptance into the study included:
      one- and five-minute Apgar scores greater than 7; birth
      weight between 2,500 and 4,500 g; age at operation between 24
      and 72 hours; systolic blood pressure greater than 40 mm Hg
      immediately before the operation (to assure adequate
      perfusion pressure for accurate measurement of transcutaneous
      Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> levels); and gestational
      age by Dubowitz score of 38 to 42 weeks. Twenty infants were
      randomly assigned to the test group and ten to the control
      group, by the assignment of each eligible cluster of three in
      the order of control, anesthetized, and unanesthetized. Ten
      unanesthetized infants had previously been studied during
      circumcision by Rawlings et al<a href="#n5"><font
      size="2"><sup>5</sup></font></a>; therefore only ten
      additional control infants were included. The mean values for
      each of the screening criteria by groups are shown in Table
      1. There was no significant difference between groups for any
      of the entry data categories.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each
      infant studied was continuously monitored for a total of 26
      minutes. <a href="/library/pain/rawlings1/">Rawlings et
      al</a>,<a href="#n5"><font size="2"><sup>5</sup></font></a>
      who monitored transcutaneous Po<font
      size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> heart rate, and respiratory
      rate, waited five minutes between each step in the operative
      sequence for restabilization of the physiologic variable
      making the total time of study 60 minutes for each infant.
      Inasmuch as an actual circumcision procedure in clinical
      practice only takes approximately eight to ten minutes, the
      operation in this study was kept in sequence without waiting
      between each step to make the results parallel clinical
      practice. A transcutaneous oxygen electrode (TCM1 Radiometer
      was affixed to the skin below the right clavicle for
      transcutaneous Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>
      monitoring. The electrode was thermally insulated with a
      polystyrene cap so that the electrode heat consumption served
      as an induced measure of local blood flow. Respiratory and
      heart rate were measured by impedance pneumographsy and ECG
      modules respectively. Crying time was recorded by an event
      marker pen. All measurements were continuously recorded by a
      Grass model polygraph. Throughout the study, a radiant
      overhead warmer maintained the abdominal temperature at
      approximately 36.0oC. All infants were studied in a quiet
      room and were handled identically. All injections of the
      anesthetic and all circumcisions were performed by the
      principal investigator in an identical manner. No nipple or
      pacifier was given to any infant, as nonnutritive sucking may
      alter the transcutaneous Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>
      measurement. All infants had received nothing by mouth for at
      least two hours, and they were taken to the study area from
      the nursery in a quiet resting state.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
      the monitoring equipment was attached, each infant was
      further screened for acceptance into the study by
      demonstrating a stable five-minute base line transcutaneous
      Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> greater than 65 torr
      (labelled "baseline" in the figures). During the base line
      period, some infants continued to sleep, and others were
      alert or crying part of the time. Each infant was strapped
      onto the the restraint board, and the genital area was given
      a surgical scrub with povidone-iodine solution for one minute
      (these events are labeled "prep" in the figures). Subjects in
      the test group then received 0.2 to 0.4 ml of lidocaine
      (without epinephrine) injected subcutaneously over each
      dorsal nerve bilaterally, following the technique of Kirya
      and Werthmann<a href="#n1"><font
      size="2"><sup>1</sup></font></a> (labelled "inject" in the
      figures). The control group was monitored undisturbed through
      an equivalent four-minute period without an injection
      (labelled "inject" in the figures).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      three-minute period was allowed for dissection of the
      prepuce-glans plane, clamping and division of the dorsal
      prepuce, and turning the prepuce back to the corona in each
      infant (labelled "dissect" in the figures). A bloodless
      circumcision clamp (Gomco) was applied for five minutes
      before the foreskin was amputated (labelled "clamp" in the
      figures). The clamp was then removed, the infant was released
      from the circumcision board restraints, and a petroleum
      dressing was applied to the penile incision (labelled "off"
      in the figures). A five-minute postoperative period was
      monitored at the end of each procedure (labelled "post-line"
      in the figures).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Continuous changes from the five-minute base line in the
      transcutaneous Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>, heart
      rate, repiratory rate, and crying were recorded for each
      infant in 30-second intervals. Group means were compared by
      matched 20-second intervals. Statistical analysis was by
      unpaired &tau; tests for each 30-second interval sequentially
      throughout the study period by group. Inasmuch as the
      variance for some of the data did not meet the assumptions
      for homogeneity, a non-parametric test was used when
      appropriate (Mann-Whitney).</p>

      <p><font face="arial" size="4">RESULTS</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      transcutanous Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> for both
      groups decreased when the infants were strapped onto the
      circumcision restraint board and during the iodine scrub (Fig
      1). Injection of the lidocain in the anesthetized group
      delayed the time for return of the transcutaneous Po<font
      size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> toward the baseline 90 seconds,
      compared with the almost immediate posthandling recovery for
      the infants who did not receive injections. Usually a
      decrease in transcutanous Po<font
      size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> level is followed by a rebound
      above base line level.<a href="#n5"><font
      size="2"><sup>5</sup></font></a> Both groups of infants in
      this study displayed this response. After dissection of the
      prepuce-glans plane began (subsequent to waiting four minutes
      for the local block to take effect), the anesthetized gourp
      demonstrated a drop of 6 torr from the elevated
      transcutaneous Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> rebound
      level back toward the base line. The control group averaged a
      12-torr drop below base line transcutaneous Po<font
      size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> during the three minute
      dissection period. The transcutaneous Po<font
      size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> values of both groups rebounded
      after the decrease that occurred when the Gomco clamp was
      applied and remained above the base line levels until the
      infant was unstrapped and the petrolatum dressing was
      applied.</p>

      crying in the test group at the point of the anesthetic
      injection (<i>P</i> &gt; .05). However, the anesthetized
      group displayed less crying than the control group by the end
      of the four minutes required for the anesthetic to become
      effective. When the dissection of the preputial planes began,
      a dramatically significant difference between groups became
      evident. For the first 30-second interval of the operation,
      the anesthetized group's mean time spent crying was 2.8%

      Similar elevations in heart rate were recorded in both groups
      during the initial handling and scrub (Fig. 3). There was no
      significant difference between groups during the injection
      period. The anesthetized group's heart rate returned to the
      base line before that of the control group prior to
      dissection. The anesthetized group's heart rate continued to
      decrease below the base line to a relative bradycardia. A
      significant difference in the heart rates between groups was
      observed during the dissection and following the application
      of the circumcision clamp (<i>P</i> &gt; .0001). Both groups
      demonstrated heart rates lower than base line while resting
      undisturbed toward the end of the five-minute period that the
      clamp remained in place. The unstrapping of the infant from
      the circumcision restraint board produced an elevation in
      heart rate in both groups. Handling of the penis to apply the
      petrolatum dressing produced a statistically significant
      elevation in heart rate in the unanesthetized group compared
      with heart rate of the anesthetized group (<i>P</i> &gt;

      Physiologic variables of the two groups for the 30-second
      injection interval are shown in Table 2. A similar comparison
      of physiologic variables for the three minutes during
      dissection is shown in Table 3. Respiratory rates did not
      differ significantly between groups at any time during the 26
      minutes of the study. Although respiratory patterns varied
      with periods of crying (characterized by a slower respiratory
      rate) and subsequent hyperventilation, the mean respiratory
      rates between groups for equivalent 30-second intervals did
      not reflect specific pattern changes.</p>

      <p><font face="arial" size="4">DISCUSSION</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Although only the two dorsal penile nerves are targeted by
      the injection of the lidocaine, the ventral frenular penile
      nerve also seemed to be blocked by infiltration and extension
      within the potential subcutaneous space of the newborn's
      penis. This circumferential "ring-like" block at the base of
      the penis appeared to reduce the pain response effectively,
      as evidenced by the absence of an immediate cry when the
      hemostat was applied to the ventral prepuce after the
      four-minute wait for the anesthetic to take effect. The mean
      time for the physiologic variables to return to base line
      levels is an indirect indication of when effective blocking
      of pain may have been achieved. These mean values were as
      follows: transcutaneous Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>
      1.4 &plusmn; 0.7 torr, cry time 2.9% &plusmn; 1.2% per
      interval, and heart rate 1.7 &plusmn; 0.7 beats per minute.
      These data suggest that the two- to three-minute waiting
      period described by Kirya and Werthmann should usually be
      adequate. However two infants who received injections
      appeared to require five and seven minutes, respectively, for
      the anesthetic to take complete effect; these infants were
      eliminated from the study. Waiting time for the anesthetic to
      become effective should, therefore, be individualized. Prior
      to dissection, the prepuce should be tested with a hemostat
      and the operation should begin if or when no cry response is
      obtained.</p>

      Preoperative handling in both groups produced physiologic
      changes that were significantly different from the base line,
      and deserve further attention. Perhaps changing the method of
      restraint to swaddling, or warming the scrub solution would
      reduce this response. These physiologic changes induced by
      the preoperative handling were greater than the physiologic
      response to the injection of the anesthetic. Inasmuch as the
      difference between the anesthetized group and the control
      group for the 30-second interval during the injection was
      significant only in crying and did not extend beyond the
      immediate event, pain caused by the injection is not
      sufficient to condemn its use.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      half-life of lidocaine blood levels in neonates is four
      hours.<a href="#n8"><font size="2"><sup>8</sup></font></a>
      The dose of 4 to 8 mg given subcutaneously in infants weight
      2,500 to 4,500 g may have produced some generalized
      pharmacologic effect. Local anesthetic administration has
      been shown to depress spinal reflex activity.<a
      href="#n9"><font size="2"><sup>9</sup></font></a> However,
      the time of first postoperative voiding was sooner for the
      anesthetized group than for the control group (5.2 &plusmn;
      2.6 hours compared with 7.2 &plusmn; 4.5 hours in he control
      group), indicating no disruption of urologic function by the
      anesthetic. Other complications for which infants were
      observed by the nursing staff included bleeding, infection,
      and injection site hematomas. A physical examination was also
      performed 24 hours after circumcision. No short-term
      complications from the dorsal penile nerve block were
      observed during the course of this study.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      relative bradycardia occurred in both groups at the end of
      the "clamp" period. It may have been due to the depression of
      the heart rate commonly observed clinically following crying,
      or perhaps it was due to the anesthetic, or perhaps it was
      due to other unknown factors.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      physiologic changes reported here show that newborns are
      responsive to pain, but these changes do not fully reflect
      all aspects of the pain response. The physiologic changes in
      themselves are probably not detrimental to the well-being of
      healthy term infants. However, they do indicate pain by
      stress-directional changes in objective measures that do not
      occur in anesthetized infants. This level of pain would not
      be tolerated by older patients. In sick or premature infants
      who have endured other painful unanesthized procedures, the
      physiologic changes may be large enough to be clinically
      significant.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Although infants cannot verbally describe pain, the
      experiences may have profound physiologic and physiological
      effects. In addition to simply recording the amount of
      crying, a voice pattern analysis might distinguish cries of
      pain from other types of crying. One study using
      spectrographic analysis of newborn cries identified
      potentially abnormal infants, monitored recovery of sick
      infants, and predicted recovery of brain-damaged infants.<a
      href="#n10"><font size="2"><sup>10</sup></font></a> This
      technique might be useful in the study of infant pain as
      well.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      conclusion, the physiologic pain-stress response of well,
      normal, full-term male newborns to unanesthetized
      circumcision is significantly different from the response of
      infants circumcised under local anesthetic. Whenever the use
      of a local anesthetic is as simple as infiltrating lidocaine
      subcutaneously, adds little time or risk to the primary
      procedure, and is not otherwise contraindicated, it should be
      considered for its effectiveness in reducing the physiologic
      pain-stress response of newborns.</p>

      <p><font face="arial" size="4">IMPLICATIONS</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
      study has implications for other procedures performed on
      unanesthetized infants, such as chest tube insertions and
      lumbar punctures. Sick and premature infants may be at risk
      for ever more deleterious effects than physiologic stress
      response measured here in healthy, full-term infants.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Studies assessing the short-term behavioral changes produced
      in newborns circumcised without anesthesia have revealed
      sleep disturbances.<a href="#n11"><font
      size="2"><sup>11,12</sup></font></a> A controlled blind study
      using the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
      showed that 90% of the infants changed behavior categories
      after being circumcised without an anesthetic, when examined
      at one day and at 3 weeks, respectively, after surgery.<a
      href="#n3"><font size="2"><sup>3</sup></font></a> Some
      long-term behavioral consequences of unanesthetized newborn
      circumcision were suggested by studes of infant gender
      differentiation.<a href="#n4"><font
      size="2"><sup>4</sup></font></a> Short- and long-term
      behavioral and physiological effectiveness and side effects
      of using a local anesthetic in newborns merit further
      evaluation.</p>

      <p><font face="arial" size="4">SUMMARY</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      effectiveness of the dorsal penile nerve block in reducing
      the stress of neonatal circumcision was evaluated by
      monitoring several physiologic variables in 30 healthy
      full-term newborns. Transcutaneous oxygen levels, crying
      time, heart rate, and respiratory rate were monitored before,
      during, and after circumicision. Newborns receiving the 1%
      Xylocaine subcutaneous injection experienced significantly
      less stress, as evidenced by smaller decreases in
      transcutaneous oxygen levels, less time spent crying, and
      smaller increases in heart rate, than infants circumcised
      without an anesthetic. Inasmuch as the dorsal penile nerve
      block presents little additional risk, is simple to learn,
      adds little time or expense to the overall procedure, and
      appears to reduce the physiologic stress, it should be
      utilized for every newborn undergoing circumcision so long as
      it is not otherwise contraindicated.</p>
