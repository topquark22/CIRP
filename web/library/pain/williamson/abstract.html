<H2>Physiologic Stress Reduction by a Local
Anesthetic During Newborn Circumcision</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

   To evaluate the effectiveness of the dorsal penile nerve block in
   reducing the stress of circumcision upon newborns, physiologic
   measurements in 30 healthy full-term infants (including transcutaneous
   oxygen levels, crying time, heart rate, and respiratory rate) were
   monitored continuously before, during, and after the operation.
   Infants receiving the dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine (1%
   Xylocaine) (N = 20) experienced significantly less stress, as
   evidenced by smaller decreases in transcutaneous oxygen pressure
   levels, less time spent crying, and smaller increases in heart rate,
   than infants circumcised in an identical manner without anesthetic (N
   = 10). No complications resulted from injection of the local
   anesthetic or from the circumcision procedure itself. Inasmuch as
   dorsal penile nerve block has a low complication rate, is simple to
   learn, and adds little time or expense to the overall procedure, and
   if it proves to be as effective clinically as the physiologic data
   indicate, the dorsal penile nerve block should be considered for every
   infant undergoing circumcision.
