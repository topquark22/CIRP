      [Abstract] 

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Circumcision is a common neonatal
      surgical procedure routinely performed without the use of
      anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of topical lidocaine cream as an
      anesthetic for circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS.</b> Thirty newborns were studied in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study; 15
      received a topical 30% lidocaine cream and 15 received the
      cream base alone. Vital signs were recorded, and preoperative
      and postoperative serum beta-endorphin and lidocaine
      concentrations were measured. A videotape of the newborn was
      used to score behavioral changes.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS.</b> Comparisons of the vital signs
      precircumcision and postcircumcision showed no differences
      between the placebo and treatment groups, with the exception
      of mean systolic blood pressure, which significantly
      increased in the placebo-treated newborns (P &lt; .05). Serum
      beta-endorphin concentrations increased postoperatively in 11
      of 15 subjects receiving placebo, but decreased or remained
      unchanged in 10 of 15 subjects receiving lidocaine (<i>P</i>
      = .03, Fisher's exact test). When stress-related behaviors in
      the precircumcision and post-circumcision periods were
      compared, the mean increase in their occurrence was greater
      in the placebo than in the treatment group. There was no
      significant absorption of lidocaine as measured in the
      serum.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION.</b> Topical application of a 30% lidocaine
      cream as used in this study may be a safe and efficacious
      anesthetic for circumcision.</p>
