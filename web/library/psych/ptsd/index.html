      <p><b>309.89 Post-traumatic Stress Disorder</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The essential feature of this disorder is
      the development of characteristic symptoms following a
      psychologically distressing event that is outside the range
      of unusual human experience (i. e., outside the range of such
      common experience as simple bereavement, chronic illness,
      business losses, and marital conflict). The stressor
      producing this syndrome would be markedly stressing to almost
      anyone, and is usually experienced with intense fear, terror
      and helplessness. The characteristic symptoms involve
      reexperiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of stimuli
      associated with the event or numbing of general
      responsiveness, and increased arousal. The diagnosis is not
      made in the disturbance lasts less than one month.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The most common
      traumata involve either a serious threat to one's life or
      physical integrity;</span> a serious threat or harm to one's
      children, spouse, or other close relatives and friends;
      sudden destruction of one's home or community; or seeing
      another person who has been, or is being, seriously injured
      or killed as the result of physical violence. In some cases
      the trauma may be learning about a serious threat or harm to
      a close friend or relative, e. g., that one's child has been
      kidnapped, tortured, or killed.</p>

      <p class="text2">The trauma may be experienced alone (e. g.,
      rape or assault) or in the company of groups of people (e.
      g., military combat). Stressor producing the disorder include
      natural disasters (e. g., floods, earthquakes) accidental
      disasters (e. g., car accidents with serious physical injury,
      airplane crashes, large fires, collapse of physical
      structures), or deliberately caused disasters (e. g. bombing,
      torture, death camps). Sometimes there is a comcomitant
      physical component of the trauma, which may even involve
      direct damage to the central nervous system (e.g.,
      malnutrition, head injury). <span class="yellow">The disorder
      is apparently more severe and longer lasting when the
      stressor is of human design.</span> The specific stressor and
      its severity should be recorded on Axis IV (p. 18).</p>

      <p class="text2">The traumatic event may be experienced in a
      variety of ways. Commonly the person has recurrent and
      intrusive recollections of the event or recurrent distressing
      dreams during which the event is reexperienced. In rare
      instances there are dissociative states, lasting from a few
      seconds to several hours, or even days, during which
      components of the event are relived, and the person behaves
      as though experiencing the event at that moment. There is
      often intense psychological distress when the person is
      exposed to events that resemble an aspect of the traumatic
      event or than symbolize the traumatic event, such as
      anniversaries of the event.</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition to the reexperiencing of the
      trauma, there is persistent avoidance of stimuli associated
      with it, or a numbing of general responsiveness that was not
      present before the trauma. The person commonly makes
      deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts or feelings about the
      traumatic event and about activities or situations that
      arouse recollections of it. This avoidance of reminders of
      the trauma may include psychogenic amnesia for an important
      aspect of the traumatic event.</p>

      <p class="text2">Diminished responsiveness to the outside
      world, referred to as "psychic numbness" or "emotional
      anesthesia," usually begins soon after the traumatic event. A
      person may complain of feeling detached or estranged from
      other people, that he or she has lost the ability to become
      interested in previously enjoyed activities, or that the
      ability to feel emotions of any type, especially those
      associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality, is
      markedly decreased.</p>

      <p class="text2">Persistent symptoms of increased arousal
      that were not present before the trauma include difficulty
      falling or staying asleep (recurrent nightmares during which
      the traumatic event is relived are sometimes accompanied by
      middle or terminal sleep disturbance), hypervigilance, and
      exaggerated startle response. Some complain of difficulty in
      concentrating or completing tasks. Many report changes in
      aggression. In mild cases this may take the form of
      irritability with fear of losing control.</p>

      <p class="text2">In more severe forms, particularly in cases
      in which the survivor has actually committed acts of violence
      (as in war veterans), the fear is conscious and pervasive,
      and the reduced capacity for modulation may express itself in
      unpredictable explosions of aggressive behavior or an
      inability to express angry feelings.</p>

      <p class="text2">Symptoms characteristic of Post-traumatic
      Stress Disorder, or physiologic reactivity, are often
      intensified or precipitated when the person is exposed to
      situations or activities that resemble or symbolize the
      original trauma (e.g., cold snowy weather or uniformed guards
      for survivors of death camps in cold climates; hot humid
      weather for veterans of the South Pacific).</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Age-specific features.</b> Occasionally,
      a child may be mute or refuse to discuss the trauma, but this
      should not be confused with inability to remember what
      occurred. In younger children, distressing dreams of the
      event may, within several weeks, change into generalized
      nightmares of monsters, of rescuing others, or of threats to
      self or others. Young children do not have the same sense
      that they are reliving the past; reliving the trauma occurs
      in action, though repetitive play.</p>

      <p class="text2">Children may exhibit various physical
      symptoms, such as stomachaches and headaches, in addition to
      the specific symptoms of increased arousal noted above.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Associated features.</b> Symptoms of
      depression and anxiety are common, and in some instances may
      be sufficiently severe to be diagnosed as an Anxiety or
      Depressive Disorder. Impulsive behavior can occur, such as
      suddenly changing place of residence, unexplained absences,
      or other changes in life-style. There may be symptoms of an
      Organic Mental Disorder, such as failing memory, difficulty
      in concentrating, emotional lability, headache, and vertigo.
      In the case of life-threatening trauma shared with others,
      survivors often describe painful guilt feelings about
      surviving when others did not, or about the things they had
      to do in order to survive.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Age of onset.</b> The disorder can occur
      at any age, including during childhood.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Course and subtypes.</b> Symptoms usually
      begin immediately or soon after the trauma. Reexperiencing
      symptoms may develop after a latency period of months or
      years following the trauma, though avoidance symptoms have
      usually been present during this period.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Impairment and complications.</b>
      Impairment may be either mild or severe and affect nearly
      every aspect of life. Phobic avoidance of situations or
      activities resembling or symbolizing the original trauma may
      interfere with interpersonal relations such as marriage or
      family life. Emotional lability, depression, and guilt may
      result in self-defeating behavior or suicidal actions.
      Psychoactive Substance Abuse Disorders are common
      complications.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Predisposing factors.</b> Several studies
      indicate that preexisting psychopathological conditions
      predispose to the development of this disorder. However, the
      disorder can develop in people without any such preexisting
      conditions, particularly if the stressor is extreme.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Prevalence, sex ratio, and familial
      pattern.</b> No information.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Differential Diagnosis.</b> If an
      Anxiety, Depressive, or Organic Mental Disorder develops
      following the trauma, the diagnoses should also be made. In
      Adjustment Disorder, the stressor is usually less severe and
      within the range of common experience; and the characteristic
      symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, such as
      reexperiencing the trauma are absent.</p>

    of usual human experience and that would be markedly
    distressing to almost anyone, e. g., serious threat to one's
    life or physical integrity; serious threat or harm to one's
    children, spouse, or other close relatives and friends;
    sudden destruction of one's home or community; or seeing

        or aspects of the trauma are expressed).
    (2) recurrent distressing dreams of the event
    (3) sudden acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were
        recurring (includes a sense of reliving the experience,
        illusions, hallucinations, and dissociative [flashback]
        episodes, even those that occur upon awakening or when
        intoxicated)
    (4) intense psychological distress at exposure to events that
        symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event,
        including anniversaries of the trauma

C.  Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or
    numbing of general responsiveness (not present before the
    trauma), as indicated by at least three of the following:

        (psychogenic amnesia)
    (4) markedly diminished interest in significant activities
        (in young children loss of recently acquired
        developmental skills such as toilet training or language
        skills.
    (5) feeling of detachment or estrangement from others
    (6) restricted feeling of affect, e.g. unable to have loving
        feelings
    (7) sense of a foreshortened future, e. g. does not expect to

    (4) hypervigilance
    (5) exaggerated startle response
    (6) physiologic reactivity upon exposure to events that
        symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event
        (e.g., a woman who was raped in an elevator breaks out in
        a sweat when entering any elevator)

E.  Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in B, C, and D of at
