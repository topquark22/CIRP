        <h3>Re-enactment, Revictimization, and Masochism</h3>

      </div>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
      the formative years of contemporary psychiatry much attention
      was paid to the continuing role of past traumatic experiences
      on the current lives of people. Charcot, Janet, and Freud all
      noted that fragmented memories of traumatic events dominated
      the mental life of many of their patient and built their
      theories about the nature and treatment of psychopathology on
      this recognition. Janet<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup></font> thought that traumatic
      memories of traumatic events persist as unassimilated fixed
      ideas that act as foci for the development of alternate
      states of consciousness, including dissociative phenomena,
      such as fugue states, amnesias, and chronic states of
      helplessness and depression. Unbidden memories of the trauma
      may return as physical sensations, horrific images or
      nightmares, behavioral reenactments, or a combination of
      these. Janet showed how traumatized individuals become
      fixated on the trauma: difficulties in assimilating
      subsequent experiences as well. It is "as if their
      personality development has stopped at a certain point and
      cannot expand anymore by the addition or assimilation of new
      elements."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></font> Freud independently came to
      similar conclusions.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n43">43,45</a></sup></font> Initially, he thought all
      hysterical symptoms were caused by childhood sexual
      "seduction" of which unconscious memories were activated,
      when during adolescence, a person was exposed to situations
      reminiscent of the original trauma. The trauma permanently
      disturbed the capacity to deal with other challenges, and the
      victim who did not integrate the trauma was doomed to "repeat
      the repressed material as a contemporary experience in
      instead or . . . remembering it as something belonging to the
      past."<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup></font>
      In this article, I will show how the trauma is repeated on
      behavioral, emotional, physiologic, and neuroendocrinologic
      levels, whose confluence explains the diversity of repetition
      phenomena.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
      traumatized people expose themselves, seemingly compulsively,
      to situations reminiscent of the original trauma. These
      behavioral reenactments are rarely consciously understood to
      be related to earlier life experiences. This "repetition
      compulsion" has received surprisingly little systematic
      exploration during the 70 years since its discovery, though
      it is regularly described in the clinical literature.<font
      size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12,17,21,29,61,64,65,69,88,112,137</a></sup></font>
      Freud thought that the aim of repetition was to gain mastery,
      but clinical experience has shown that this rarely happens;
      instead, repetition causes further suffering for the victims
      or for people in their surroundings.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children seem more
      vulnerable than adults to compulsive behavioral repetition
      and loss of conscious memory of the trauma.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n70">70,136</a></sup></font>.
      However, responses to projective tests show that adults, too,
      are liable to experience a large range of stimuli vaguely
      reminiscent of the trauma as a return of the trauma itself,
      and to react accordingly.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n39">39,42</a></sup></font></p>
      <a id="behavioral" name="behavioral"></a> 

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>BEHAVIORAL RE-ENACTMENT</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In behavioral
      re-enactment of the trauma, the self may play the role of
      either victim or victimizer.</p>

      <p><b>Harm to Others</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Re-enactment of victimization is a major cause of violence.
      Criminals have often been physically or sexually abused as
      children.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n55">55,121</a></sup></font> In a recent prospective
      study of 34 sexually abused boys, Burgess et al.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> found a link
      with drug abuse, juvenile delinquency, and criminal behavior
      only a few year later. Lewis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n89">89,91</a></sup></font> has extensively studied
      the association between childhood abuse and subsequent
      victimization of others. Recently, she showed that of 14
      juveniles condemned to death for murder in the United States
      in 1987, 12 had been brutally physically abused, and five had
      been sodomized by relatives.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup></font> In a study of self-mutilating
      male criminals, Brach-y-Rita<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> concluded that "the
      constellation of withdrawal, depressive reaction,
      hyperreactivity, stimulus-seeking behavior, impaired pain
      perception, and violent aggressive behavior directed at self
      or others may be the consequence of having been reared under
      conditions of maternal social deprivation. This constellation
      of symptoms is a common phenomenon among a member of
      environmentally deprived animals."</p>

      <p><b>Self-destructiveness</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Self-destructive acts are common in abused children.
      Green<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53,54</a></sup></font> found that 41 per cent of
      his sample of abused children engaged in headbanging, biting,
      burning, and cutting. In a controlled, double-blind study on
      traumatic antecedents of borderline personality disorder, we
      found a highly significant relationship between childhood
      sexual abuse and various kinds of self-harm later in life,
      particularly cutting and self-starving.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n143a">143a</a></sup></font> Clinical reports also
      consistently show that self-mutilators have childhood
      histories of physical or sexual abuse, or repeated
      surgery.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n52">52,106,118,126</a></sup></font> Simpson and
      Porter<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n126">126</a></sup></font> found a significant
      association between self-mutilation and other forms of
      self-deprecation or self-destruction such as alcohol and drug
      abuse and eating disorders. They sum up the conclusions of
      many students of this problem in stating that
      "self-destructive activities were not primarily related to
      conflict, guilt and superego pressure, but to more primitive
      behavior patterns originating in painful encounters wih
      hostile caretakers during the first years of life."</p>

      <p><b>Revictimization</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Revictimization is a consistent finding.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n35">35,47,61</a></sup></font>
      Victims of rape are more likely to be raped and women who
      were physically or sexually abused as children are more
      likely to be abused as adults. Victims of child sexual abuse
      are at high risk of becoming prostitutes.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n38">38,72,125</a></sup></font>
      Russell,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n120">120</a></sup></font> in a very careful study of
      the effects of incest on the life of women, found that few
      women made a conscious connection between their childhood
      victimization and their drug abuse, prostitution, and suicide
      attempts. Whereas 38 per cent of a random sample of women
      reported incidents of rape or attempted rape after age 14, 68
      per cent of those with a childhood history of incest did.
      Twice as many women with a history of physical violence in
      their marriages (27 per cent), and more than twice as many
      (53 per cent) reported unwanted sexual advances by an
      unrelated authority figure such as a teacher, clergyman, or
      therapist. Victims of father-daughter incest were four times
      more likely than nonincest victims to be asked to pose for
      pornography.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>RE-EXPERIENCING AFTER ADULT
      TRAUMA</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
      are sporadic clinical reports,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12,59</a></sup></font> but systematic studies on
      re-enactment and revictimization in traumatized adults are
      even scarcer than in children. In one study of adults who who
      had recently been in accidents,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup></font> 57 per cent showed behavioral
      re-enactments, and 51 per cent had recurrent intrusive
      images. In this study, the frequency with which recurrent
      memories were experienced on a somatic level, as panic and
      anxiety attacks, was not examined. Studies of burned
      children<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n131">131</a></sup></font> and adult survivors of
      natural and manmade disasters<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n67">67,124</a></sup></font> show that, over time,
      rucurrent symbolic or visual recollections and behavioral
      re-enactments abate, but there is often persistent chronic
      anxiety that can be interpreted as partial somatosensory
      reliving, dissociated from visual or linguistic
      representations of the trauma.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n141">141</a></sup></font> There are scattered
      clinical reports<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64,65,109</a></sup></font> of people re-enacting
      the trauma on its anniversary. For example, we treated a
      Vietnam veteran who had lit a cigarette at night and caused
      the death of a friend by a VietCong sniper's bullet in 1968.
      From 1969 to 1986, on the exact anniversary of the death, to
      the hour and minute, he yearly committed "armed robbery" by
      putting a finger in his pocket and staging a "holdup," in
      order to provoke gunfire from the police. The compulsive
      re-enactment ceased when he came to understand its
      meaning.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>SOCIAL ATTACHMENT AND THE TRAUMA
      RESPONSE</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human
      beings are strongly dependent on social support for a sense
      of safety, meaning, power, and control.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n14">14,15,93</a></sup></font> Even our biologic
      maturation is strongly influenced by the nature of early
      attachment bonds.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup></font> Traumatization occurs when
      both internal and external resources are inadequate to cope
      with external threat. Physical and emotional maturation, as
      well as innate variations in physiologic reactivity to
      perceived danger, play important roles in the capacity to
      deal with external threat.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></font> The presence of familiar
      caregivers also plays an important role in helping children
      modulate their physiologic arousal.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n146">146</a></sup></font> In the absence of a
      caregiver, chidren experience extremes of under-and over
      arousal that are physiologically aversive and
      disorganizing.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup></font> The availability of a
      caregiver who can be blindly trusted when their own resources
      are inadequate is very important in coping with threats. If
      the caregiver is rejecting and abusive, children are likely
      to become hyperaroused. When the persons who are supposed to
      be the sources of safety and nurturance become simultaneously
      the sources of danger against which protection is needed,
      children maneuver to re-establish some sense of safety.
      Instead of turning on their caregivers and thereby losing
      hope for protection, they blame themselves. They become
      fearfully and hungrily attached and anxiously obedient.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></font> Bowlby<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> calls this
      "a pattern of behavior in which avoidance of them competes
      with his desire for proximity and care and in which angry
      behavior is apt to become prominent."</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Studies by Bowlby and Ainsworth<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> in humans, and by Harlow and
      his heirs<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n58">58,114</a></sup></font> in other primates,
      demonstrate the crucial role that a "safe base" plays for
      normal social and biologic development. As children mature,
      they continually acquire new cognitive schemata in which to
      frame current life experiences. These ever-expanding
      cognitive schemes decrease their reliance on the environment
      for soothing and increase their own capacity to modulate
      physiologic arousal in the face of threat. Thus, the
      cognitive preparedness (development) of an individual
      interacts with the degree of physiologic disorganization to
      determine the capacity for mental processing of potentially
      traumatizing experiences.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n137">137,141</a></sup></font></p>
      <a id="sex" name="sex"></a> 

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>SEX DIFFERENCES</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      frequency with which abused children repeat aggressive
      interactions has suggested to Green<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font> a link between the compulsion
      to repeat and identification with the aggressor, which
      replaces fear and helplessness with a sense of omnipotence.
      There are significant sex differences in the way trauma
      victims incorporate the abuse experience. Studies by Carmen
      et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22,71</a></sup></font> and others indicate that
      abused men and boys tend to identify with the aggressor and
      later victimize others wheras abused women are prone to
      become attached to abusive men who allow themselves and their
      offspring to be victimized further.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Reiker and colleagues<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n113">113</a></sup></font> have pointed out that
      "confrontations wih violence challenges one's most basic
      assumptions about the self as invulnerable and intrinsically
      worthy and about the world as orderly and just. After abuse,
      the victim's view of self and world can never be the same
      again: it must be reconstructed.to incorporate the abuse
      experience." Assuming responsibility for the abuse allows
      feelings of helplessness to be replaced with an illusion of
      control. Ironically, victims of rape who blame themselves
      have a better prognosis than those who do not assume this
      false responsibility: it allows the locus of control to
      remain internal and prevent helplessness. Children are even
      more likely to blame themselves: "The child needs to hold on
      to an image of the parent as good in order to deal with the
      intensity of fear and rage which is the effect of the
      tormenting experiences."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n113">113</a></sup></font> Anger directed against the
      self or others is always a central problem in the life of
      people who have been violated. Reikers concludes that "this
      'acting out' is seldom understood by either victims or
      clinicians as being a repetitive re-enactment of real events
      from the past."</p>
      <a id="separation" name="separation"></a> 

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>THE SEPARATION REPONSE</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Primates have evolved highly complex ways to maintain
      attachment bonds; they are intensely dependent on their
      caregivers at the start. In lower primates, his dependency is
      principally expressed in physical contact, in humans this is
      supplemented by verbal communication. McLean<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup></font> suggests
      that language is an evolutionary development from the
      mammalian separation cry that induces caregivers to provide
      safety, nurturance, and social stimulation. Primates react to
      separation from attachment figures as if they were directly
      threatened. Thus, small children, unable to anticipate the
      future, experience separation anxiety as soon as they lose
      sight of their mothers. Bowlby has described the protest and
      dispair phases of this response in great detail.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14,15</a></sup></font> As people
      mature, hey develop an ever-enlarging repertoire of coping
      responses, but adults are still intensely dependent upon
      social support to prevent and overcome traumatization, and
      under threat they still may cry out for their mothers.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup></font> Sudden,
      uncontrollable loss of attachment bonds is an essential
      element in the development of post-traumatic stress
      syndromes.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n45">45,88,92,138</a></sup></font> On exposure to
      extreme terror, even mature people have protest and dispair
      responses (anger and grief, intrusion and numbing) that make
      them turn toward the nearest available source of comfort to
      return to a state of both psychological and physiologic calm.
      Thus, severe external threat may result in renewed clinging
      and neophobia in both children and adults.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8,41,111</a></sup></font> Because
      the attachment system is so important, mobilization of social
      supports is an important element in the treatment of
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      People in general, and children in particular, seek increased
      attachment in the face of external danger. Pain, fear,

      efforts to attract increased care,<font size="2"><sup><a

      children may develop strong emotional ties with people who

      of the terror, and she starts to make excuses for his
      behavior. This pattern is so common that women engaged in
      these sorts of relationships become the recipients of intense
      anger for social service personnel. They are then called
      masochistic, and like other psychiatric terms, this can be
      employed pejoratively rather than conveying an understanding
      of the underlying causes and treatment of the problem.
      Walker<font size="2"><sup><a

      the study of traumatic bonding in such couples. A central

      The victim organizes her life completely around pleasing her
      captor and his demands. As Dutton and Painter point out, "her
      compliance legitimates his demands, builds up a store of
      repressed anger and frustration on her part (which may
      surface in her goading him or fighting back during an actual
      argument, leading to escalating violence), and systematically
      eliminates opportunities for her to build up a supportive
      network which could eventually assist her in leaving the
      relationship."</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Walker<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n145">145</a></sup></font> has clarified the operation
      of intermittent reinforcement paradigms in such
      relationships, applying the animal model of
      punishment-indulgence patterns. In child abuse or spouse
      battering, this mechanism is accentuated by the extreme
      contrast of terror followed by submission and reconciliation.
      When such negative reinforcement occurs intermittently, the
      reinforced response consolidates the attachment between
      victim and victimizer. During the abuse, victims tend to
      dissociate emotionally with a sense of disbelief that the
      incident is really happening. This is followed by the typical
      post-traumatic response of numbing and constriction,
      resulting in inactivity, depression, self-blame, and feelings
      of helplessness. Walker<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n145">145</a></sup></font> describes the process as
      follows: "tension gradually builds" (during phase one), an
      explosive battering incident occurs (during phase two), and a
      "calm, loving respite follows phase three). The violence
      allows intense emotional engagement and dramatic scenes of
      forgiveness, reconciliation, and physical contact that
      restores the fantasy of fusion and symbiosis.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n87">87,140</a></sup></font> Hence,
      there are two powerful sources of reinforcement: the
      "arousal-jag" or excitement before the violence and the peace
      of surrender afterwards, Both of these responses, placed at
      appropriate intervals, reinforce the traumatic bond between
      victim and abuser.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31,145</a></sup></font> To varying degrees, the
      memory of the battering incidents is state-dependent or
      dissociated, and thus only comes back in full force during
      renewed situations of terror. This interferes with good
      judgment about the relationship and allows longing for love
      an reconciliation to overcome realistic fears.</p>

      least four studies of family violence<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n40">40,48,63,132</a></sup></font> have found a direct
      relationship between the severity of childhood physical abuse
      and later marital violence. Interestingly, nonhuman primates
      subjected to early abuse and deprivation also are more likely
      to engage in violent relationships with their peers as
      adults.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n134">134</a></sup></font> as in humans, males tend to

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who are

      way of life. They see the chronic helplessness of their
      mothers and fathers' alternating outbursts of affection and

      resolution of differences, partners in relationships
      alternate between an expectation of perfect behavior leading
      to perfect harmony and a state of helplessness, in which all
      verbal communication seems futile. A return to earlier coping
      mechanisms, such as self-blame, numbing (by means of

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Chronic physiologic hyperarousal to stimuli reminiscent of
      the trauma is a cardinal feature of the trauma response, well
      documented in a large variety of traumatized individuals,
      including victims of child abuse, burns, rape, natural
      disasters, and war.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2,78,84,107,133,142</a></sup></font> Because of
      their decreased capacity to modulate physiologic arousal,
      which leads to reduced ability to utilize symbols and fantasy
      to cope with stress, they tend to experience later stresses
      as somatic states, rather than as specific events that
      require specific means of coping.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n142">142</a></sup></font> Thus, victims of trauma
      respond to contemporary stimuli as if the trauma had
      returned, without conscious awareness that past injury rather
      than current stress is the basis of their physiologic
      emergency responses. The hyperarousal interferes with their
      ability to make calm and rational assessments and prevents
      resolution and integration of the trauma.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n142">142</a></sup></font> They
      respond to threats as emergencies requiring action rather
      than thought.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Chronic hyperarousal in response to new challenges is also
      found in animals exposed to inescapable shock.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> In fact, this
      phenomenon drew our attention to the possibility of using
      this animal model for the study of human traumatization.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n142">142</a></sup></font> Human
      beings and other mammals are very similar biologically in
      respect to such relatively uncomplicated behaviors as fight,
      flight, and freeze responses. Exposure to inescapable
      aversive events has widespread behavioral and physiologic
      effects on animals including (1) deficits in learning to
      escape novel adverse situations, (2) decreased motivation for
      learning new options, (3) chronic subjective distress,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n94">94</a></sup></font> and (4)
      increased tumor genesis and immunosuppression.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n143">143</a></sup></font> All this
      is the result not of the shock itself but of a helplessness

      animal has in terminating shock.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Several neurotransmitters have been shown to be affected by
      inescapably fearful experiences in animals; they have low
      resting cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) norepinephrine, but under
      stress they respond with much higher elevations than other
      animals. Something has disturbed the organisms capacity to
      modulate the extent of arousal.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <a id="state-dependent" name="state-dependent"></a> 

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>STATE-DEPENDENT LEARNING</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both
      Janet<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup></font>
      and Freud observed that early memory traces can be activated
      by later events that cause partial reliving of earlier
      traumas in the form of affect states, anxiety, or
      re-enactments. Their patients generally had a poor memory for
      traumatic childhood events, until they were brought back, by
      means of hypnosis, to a state of mind similar to the one they
      were in at the time of the trauma. In the past few decades,
      these notions have gained scientific confirmation with the
      discovery of state-dependent learning; for example what is
      learned under the influence of a particular drug tends to
      become dissociated and seemingly lost until return of the
      state similar to the one in which the memory was stored.
      State dependency can be roughly related to arousal levels.
      For example, state-dependent learning in humans is produced
      by both psychostimulants and depressants: alcohol, marijuana,
      barbituates, and amphetamines as well as other psychoactive
      agents.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></font>
      Reactivation of past learning is relatively automatic:
      contextual stimuli directly evoke memories without conscious
      awareness of the transition. The more similar are the
      contextual stimuli are to conditions prevailing at the time
      of the original storage of memories, the more likely the
      probability of retrieval. Both internal states, such as
      particular affects, or external events reminiscent of earlier
      trauma thus can trigger a return to feeling as if victims are
      back in their original traumatizing situation. Thus, battered
      women who otherwise behave competently may experience
      themselves within the battering relationship like the
      terrified child they once were in a violent or alcoholic
      home.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n119">119</a></sup></font>
      Similarly, war veterans may be asymptomatic until they become
      intimate with a partner and start reliving feelings of loss,
      grief, vulnerability, and revenge related to the death of a
      comrade on the battlefield but that are now incorrectly
      attributed to some element of the current relationship.
      Disinhibition resulting from drugs or alcohol strongly
      facilitates the occurrence of such reliving experiences,
      which then may take the form of acting out violent or sexual
      traumatic episodes.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n107">107</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      During states of massive autonomic arousal, memories are laid
      down that powerfully influence later actions and
      interpretations of events. Long-term activation of memory
      tracts is observed in animals exposed to a highly stressful
      stimulus.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n51">51,81</a></sup></font> This pheromenon has been
      attributed to massive noradrenergic activity at the time of
      the stress.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n129">129</a></sup></font> In traumatized people,
      visual and motoric reliving experiences, nightmares,
      flashbacks, and re-enactments are generally preceded by
      physiologic arousal.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup></font> Activation of long-term
      augmented memory tracts may explain why current stress is

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under
      ordinary conditions, most previously traumatized individuals
      can adjust psychologically and socially. Studies have shown
      this to be true of victims of rape,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup></font> battered women,<font

      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font> Nonhuman primates subjected
      to extended periods of isolation may later become reasonably
      well integrated socially. However, they do not respond to
      stress in the same ways as their nontraumatized peers.
      Studies in the Wisconsin primate laboratory have shown that,
      even after an initial good social adjustment, heightened
      emotional or physical arousal causes social withdrawal or
      aggression.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup></font> Even monkeys that recover in
      other respects tend to respond inappropriately to sexual

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Stress causes a return to earlier behavior patterns
      throughout the animal kingdom. In experiments in mice,
      Mitchell and colleagues<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n98">98,99</a></sup></font> found that arousal state
      determines how an animal will react to stimuli. In a state of
      low arousal, animals tend to be curious and seek novelty.
      During high arousal, they are frightened, avoid novelty, and
      perseverate in familiar behavior regardless of the outcome.
      Under ordinary circumstances, an animal will choose the most
      pleasant of two alternatives. When hyperaroused, it will seek
      the familiar, regardless of the intrinsic rewards.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup></font> Thus shocked
      animals returned to the box in which they were originally
      shocked, in preference to less familiar locations not
      associated with punishment. Punished animals actually
      increased their exposure to shock as the trials
      continued.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n98">98</a></sup></font> Mitchell concluded that this
      perseveration is nonassociative, that is, if uncoupled from
      the usual rewards systems, animals seek optimal levels of
      arousal,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10,122</a></sup></font> and this mediates
      patterns of alternation and perseveration. Because novel
      stimuli cause arousal, an animal in a state of high arousal
      will avoid even mildly novel stimuli even if it would reduce
      exposure to pain.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>"THE COSTS OF PLEASURE AND THE BENEFITS

      Solomon<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup></font> proposes an "opponent
      process theory of acquired motivation" to explain addictive
      behavior that originates in frightening or painful events. He
      points out that frequent exposure to stimuli, pleasant or
      unpleasant, may lead to habituation; the resulting withdrawal
      or abstinence state can take on a powerful life of its own
      and may become an effective source of motivation. In drug
      addiction, for example, the motivation changes from getting
      high (pleasure) to controlling a highly aversive withdrawal
      state.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      contrast with drug taking, which initially is pleasant, many
      initially aversive stimuli, such as sauna bathing, marathon
      running, and parachute jumping, may also be eventually
      perceived as highly rewarding by people who have repeatedly
      exposed themselves to these frightening or painful
      situations. Parachute jumpers, sauna bathers, and marathon
      runners all feel exhilaration and a sense of well-being from
      the intially aversive activities. These new sources of
      pleasure become independent of the fear that was necessary to
      produce them in the first place. Solomon concludes that
      certain behaviors can become highly pleasurable: "&hellip;if
      they are derived from aversive processes they can provide a
      relatively enduring source of positive hedonic tone following
      the removal of the aversive reenforcer. Fear thus has its
      positive conquences."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n127">127</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Solomon and colleagues have applied these observations to
      imprinting and social attachment. Their research showed that
      young animals responded with increasing distress to repeated
      separations.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup></font> Habituation did not occur,
      and attachment in fact increased, provided that the
      imprinting object was presented at fairly regular intervals.
      Starr<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n130">130</a></sup></font>
      demonstrated that there is a critical decay duration, the
      time that it takes for the withdrawal response to the
      original stimulus to wear off. If the reinforcing stimulus of
      the imprinting or attachment object is presented at intervals
      greater than the critical decay duration, increased
      attachment does not occur. However, animals earlier exposed
      to repeated separations are more vulnerable to increased
      distress upon later separations: "repeated exposures to the
      imprinting object took less time and fewer exposures than did
      the original exposures." The strength of the imprinting
      eventually decays by disuse, but some residues of past
      experiences remain and facilitate the reactivation of the
      temporarily dormant system. Readdiction to nicotine and
      opiates occurs much faster than the initial addiction. If
      Starr is correct, similar processes account for social
      attachment to aversive objects and thus "the law of social
      attachment may be identical to the law of drug
      addiction."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n130">130</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Solomon and coworkers established experimentally that animal
      and people become habituated to the original stimulus,
      whether it is morphine, parachute jumping or marathon
      running, but the withdrawal syndromes that follow a large
      number of arousing events retain their integrity over time,
      and recur when the original stimuli are reintroduced.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n127">127</a></sup></font> Thus, the
      positive reinforcer loses some of its power, but the negative
      reinforcer gains power and lasts longer: parachute jumpers
      continued to feel exhilarated after jumping, even when they
      feel less year beforehand. Solomon hypothesized that
      endorphins are secreted in response to certain environmental
      stresses and play a role in the opponent process. We have
      recently found evidence that supports this view.</p>

      and others may be right in postulating that people can become
      physiologically addicted to each other. There is now
      considerable evidence that human attachment is, in part,
      mediated by the endogenous opiate system. Research in
      non-human primates shows that social attachment is related to
      the development of core neurobiologic functions in the
      primate brain. Early disruption of the attachment bond causes
      longlasting psychobiologic changes that not only reduce the
      capacity to cope with subsequent social disruption but also
      disturb parenting processes and create similar vulnerability
      into the next generation. In recent years knowledge about the
      brain circuits involved in the maintenance of affliative

      develop stress-induced analgesia (SIA) when re-exposed to

      that wounded soldiers require less morphine, he speculated
      that "strong emotions can block pain" because of the release
      of endogenous opioids. Our experiments show that even in
      people traumatized as adults, re-exposure to situations
      reminiscent of the trauma evokes as endogenous opioid
      response analogous to that of animals exposed to mild shock
      subsequent to inescapable shock. Thus, re-exposure to stress
      may have the same effect as the temporary application of
      exogenous opioids, providing a similar relief from
      anxiety.<font size="2"><sup><a

      Field<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n113">113</a></sup></font>
      has suggested that normal play and exploratory activity in
      infants are dependent on the presence of a familiar
      attachment figure who modulates physiologic arousal by
      providing a balance between soothing and stimulation. She,
      Reite,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n115">115,116</a></sup></font> and others have shown
      that in the absence of the mother, an infant experiences by
      psychological disorganizing extremes of under- and
      overarousal. This soothing and arousal may be mediated by
      alternate stimulation of different neurotransmitter systems,
      in which the endogenous opioid system is likely to play a
      role, especially in subjective experience of safety and
      soothing. Endogenous opioids decrease central noradrenergic
      activity,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font>
      and their activation may thus inhibit hyperarousal. Childhood
      abuse and neglect may cause a long-term vulnerability to be
      hyperaroused, expressed on a social level as decreased
      ability to modulate strong affect states. "On a continuum
      from low to high physiologic arousal there is an optimal
      level for every organism. The shape of an individual's
      optimal stimulation curve may depend on the level of
      stimulation received during early experience."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> As a result,
      people who were neglected or abused as children may require
      much higher external stimulation of the endogenous opioid
      system for soothing than those whose endogenous opioids can
      be more easily activated by conditioned responses based on
      good early caregiving experiences. These victimized people
      neutralize their hyperarousal by a variety of addictive
      behaviors including compulsive re-exposure to situations
      reminiscent of the trauma.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>CHILDHOOD TRAUMA, ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDS,
      AND<br />
       SELF HARM</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
      recent animal research is any guide, people, particularly
      children, who have been exposed to severe, prolonged
      environmental stress will experience extraordinary increases
      in both catecholamine and endogenous opioid responses to
      subsequent stress. The endogenous opioid response may produce
      both dependence and withdrawal phenomena resembling those of
      exogenous opiods. This could explain, in part, why childhood
      trauma is associated with subsequent self-destructive
      behavior. Depending on which stimuli have come to condition
      an opioid response, self-destructive behavior may include
      chronic involvement with abusive partners, sexual masochism,
      self-starvation, and violence against self or others. In a
      recent study, we found that patients' reports of early
      childhood physical and sexual abuse were highly correlated
      with self-mutilation and self-starvation in adulthood.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n143">143a</a></sup></font> This
      controlled study supports numerous other clinical reports
      about the relationship between childhood abuse and
      self-destructive behavior.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n52">52,106,118</a></sup></font> In these people,
      self-mutilation is a common response to abandonment; it is
      accompanied by both analgesia and an altered state of
      consciousness, and it provides relief and return to
      normality. The pain, cutting, and burning are apparent
      attempts at "repairing the cohesiveness of the self in the
      face of overwhelming anxiety."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup></font> This pattern is reminiscent
      of spouse abuse described by Walker:<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n145">145</a></sup></font> "tension gradually builds,
      an explosive battering (self-mutilating) incident occurs, and

      Bach-y-Rita<font size="2"><sup><a

      horrible may, in fact, produce somatic calm.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The

      <p align="center"><b>TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Compulsive repetition of the trauma usually is an unconscious
      process that, although it may provide a temporary sense of
      mastery or even pleasure, ultimately perpetuates chronic
      feelings of helplessness and a subjective sense of being bad
      and out of control. Gaining control over one's current life,
      rather than repeating trauma in action, mood, or somatic
      states, is the goal of treatment.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Although verbalizing the contextual elements of the trauma is
      the essence of treatment of acute post-traumatic stress, the
      essential elements of chronic post-traumatic reactions
      generally are retrieved with difficulty and often cannot be
      dealt with until reasonable control over current behavior can
      assure the safety of both the patient and those in the
      patient's immediate surroundings. Failure to approach
      trauma-related material very gradually leads to
      intensification of the affects and physiologic states related
      to the trauma, leading to increased repetitive phenomena. It
      is important to keep in mind that the only reason to uncover
      the trauma is to gain conscious control over the unbidden
      re-experience or re-enactments. Prior to unearthing the
      traumatic roots of current behavior, people need to gain
      reasonable control over the longstanding secondary defenses
      that were originally elaborated to defend against being
      overwhelmed by traumatic material such as alcohol and drug
      abuse and violence against self or others. The trauma can
      only be worked through after a secure bond is established
      with another person. The presence of an attachment figure
      provides people with the security necessary to explore their
      life experiences and to interrupt the inner or social
      isolation that keeps people stuck in repetitive patterns.
      Both the etiology and the cure of trauma-related
      psychological disturbance depend fundamentally on security of
      interpersonal attachments. Once the traumatic experiences
      have been located in time and place, a person can start
      making distinctions between current life stresses and past
      trauma and decrease the impact of the trauma on present
      experience.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n137">137</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Self-help organizations for people with addictions or with
      backgrounds that include childhood traumas or parental
      addictions have elaborated a model of treatment that appears
      to address many of the core issues of repetitive
      traumatization. These groups provide people with both human
      attachments and a meaningful cognitive frame for dealing with
      the sense of helplessness that is central to these problems..
      They focus on the development of "serenity," which can be
      understood both as a state of automatic stability and of
      being at peace with one's surroundings. These groups teach
      that the way to gain this serenity is by learning to trust,
      by surrendering, and by making contact and developing
      interpersonal commitments. They provide a support network
      that attempts to avoid the barriers that people create to
      bolster their individual differences, and they thus endeavor
      to circumvent the shame of being helpless and vulnerable that
      perpetuates social isolation. Shame and social isolation are
      thought to promote regression to earlier states of anxious
      attachment and to addictive involvements. In these circles it
      is said that: "No pain is so devastating as the pain a person
      refuses to face and no suffering is so lasting as suffering
      left unacknowledged."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> There is emphasis on living
      in the here and now, generally with the acknowledgement that
      in contrast to victimized children, adults can learn to
      protect themselves and make a conscious choice about not
      engaging in relationships or behaviors that are known to be
      harmful. The underlying assumption is that conclusions drawn
      from a child's perspective retain their power into adulthood
      until verbalized and examined. In a group context, victims
      can learn that as children they were not responsible for the
      chaos, violence and despair surrounding them, but that as
      adults there are choices and consequences.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23,137</a></sup></font></p>

      <p align="justify">These groups also teach that in order to
      avoid repetition, one has to give up the behavior, drug, or
      person involved in the addiction. Acknowledging the addictive
      quality of the involvement is known as overcoming denial.
      Avoiding acknowledging the feelings promotes acting out.
      Traumatized people need to understand that acknowledging
      feelings related to the trauma does not bring back the trauma
      itself, and its accompanying violence and helplessness. There
      must be emphasis on finding replacement activities and
      experiences that are more rewarding, successful and powerful
      in the immediate present. These may include being of help to
      victims of similar traumas as one's own.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Psychotropic medicines may be of help to decrease autonomic
      hypearousal and decrease all or none responses. Lithium, beta
      blockers, and serotonin reuptake blockers such as flouxetine,
      may be particularly helpful. By decreasing hyperarousal, one
      decreases the likelihood that current stress will be
      experienced as a recurrence of past trauma. This facilitates
      finding solutions appropriate to the current stress rather
      than the past.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n139">139</a></sup></font> The use of medications that
      affect the opioid system should be regarded as experimental
      and at this time needs to be avoided except in
      life-threatening cases.</p>

      our last study on patients with borderline personality
      disorder Judith Herman and I (unpublished data, 1988) asked
      our self-mutilating subjects what had helped them most in
      overcoming the impact of their childhood traumas, including
      their self-mutilation. All subjects attributed their
      improvement to having found a safe therapeutic relationship
      in which they had been able to explore the realities of their
      childhood experiences and their reactions to them. All
      subjects reported that they had been able to markedly
      decrease a variety of repetitive behaviors, including
      habitual self-harm, after they had established a relationship
      in which they felt safe to acknowledge the realities of both
      their past and their current lives.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>SUMMARY</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Trauma can be repeated on behavioral, emotional, physiologic,
      and neuroendocriniologic levels. Repetition on these
      different levels causes a large variety of individual and
      social suffering. Anger directed against the self or others
      is always a central problem in the lives of people who have
      been violated and this is itself a repetitive re-enactment of
      real events from the past.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      People need a "safe base" for normal social and biologic
      development. Traumatization occurs when both internal and
      external resources are inadequate to cope with external
      threat. Uncontrolable disruptions or distortions of
      attachment bonds precede the development of post-traumatic
      stress syndromes. People seek increased attachment in the
      face of danger. Adults, as well as children, may develop
      strong emotional ties with people whe intermittently harass,
      beat, and, threaten them. The persistence of these attachment
      bonds leads to confusion of pain and love. Assaults lead to
      hyperarousal states for which the memory can be
      state-dependent or dissociated, and this memory only returns
      fully during renewed terror. This interferes with good
      judgment about these relationships and allows longing for
      attachment to overcome realistic fears.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
      primates subjected to early abuse and deprivation are
      vulnerable to engage in violent relationships with peers as
      adults. Males tend to be hyperagressive, and females fail to
      protect themselves and their offspring against danger.
      Chronic physiologic hyperarousal persists, particularly to
      stimuli reminiscent of the trauma. Later stresses tend to be
      experienced as somatic states, rather than as specific events
      that require specific means of coping. Thus victims of trauma
      may respond to contemporary stimuli as a return of the
      trauma, without conscious awareness that past injury rather
      than current stress is the basis of their physiologic
      emergency responses. Hyperarousal interferes with the ability
      to make rational assessments and prevents resolution and
      integration of the trauma. Disturbances in the catecholamine,
      serotonin, and endogenous opioid systems have been implicated
      in this persistenence of all-or-nothing responses.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      People who have been exposed to highly stressful stimuli
      develop long-term potentiation of memory tracts that are
      reactivated at times of subsequent arousal. This activation
      explains how current stress is experienced as a return of the
      trauma; it causes a return to earlier behavior patterns.
      Ordinarily, people will choose the most pleasant of two
      alternatives. High arousal causes people to engage in
      familiar behavior, regardless of the rewards. As novel
      stimuli are anxiety provoking, under stress, previously
      traumatized people tend return to familiar patterns, even if
      they cause pain.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      "opponent process theory of acquired motivation" explains how
      fear may become a pleasurable sensation and that "the laws of
      social attachment may be identical to those of drug
      addiction." Victims can become addicted to their victimizers;
      social contact may activate endogenous opioid systems,
      alleviating separation distress and strengthening social
      bonds. High levels of social stress activate opioid systems
      as well. Vietnam veterans with PTSD show opiod-mediated
      reduction in pain perception after re-exposure to a traumatic
      stimulus. Thus re-exposure to stress can have the same effect
      as taking exogenous opioids, providing a similar relief from
      stress.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Childhood abuse and neglect enhance long-term hyperarousal
      and decreased modulation of strong affect states. Abused
      children may require much higher external stimulation to
      affect the endogenous opioid system for soothing than when
      the biologic concomitants of comfort are easily activated by
      conditioned responses based on good early caregiving
      experiences. Victimized people may neutralize their
      hyperarousal by a variety of addictive behaviors, including
      compulsive re-exposure to victimization of self and others.
      Gaining control over one's current life, rather than
      repeating trauma in action, mood, or somatic states, is the
      goal of treatment. The only reason to uncover traumatic
      material is to gain conscious control over unbidden
      re-experiences or re-enactments. The presence of strong
      attachments provides people with the security necessary to
      explore their life experiences and to interrupt the inner or
      social isolation that keeps them stuck in repetitive
      patterns. In contrast with victimized children, adults can
      learn to protect themselves and make conscious choices about
      not engaging in relationships or behaviors that are
      harmful.</p>
