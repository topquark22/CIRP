      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p class="text1">This report is a long term follow-up to a
      "classic" case in the pediatric, psychiatry, and sexology
      literature. In this case an XY individual had his penis
      accidentally ablated and was subsequently raised as a female.
      The initial reports were that this individual was developing
      into a normally functioning female. The present findings show
      the individual did not accept this sex of rearing. At puberty
      this individual switched to living as a male and has
      successfully lived as such from that time to the present. The
      significant factors in this switch are presented. In
      instances of extensive penile damage to infants it is
      standard to recommend rearing the male as a female.
      Subsequent cases should, however, be managed in light of this
      new evidence.</p>

      <p><b>Text</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Among the more difficult decisions
      physicians have to make involve cases of ambiguous genitalia
      or significantly traumatized genitalia. The decision as to
      how to proceed typically follows the following contemporary
      advice: "The decision to raise the child as a male centers
      around the potential for the phallus to function adequately
      in later sexual relations (pp. 580)."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> and "Because it is simpler to
      construct a vagina than a satisfactory penis, only the infant
      with a phallus of adequate size should be considered for a
      male gender assignment (pp. 1955)."<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> These management proposals depend upon
      a theory which basically says: "It is easier to make a good
      vagina than a good penis and since the identity of the child
      will reflect upbringing, and the absence of an adequate penis
      would be psychosexually devastating, fashion the perineum
      into a normal looking vulva and vagina and raise the
      individual as a girl." Such clinical advice, concerned
      primarily with surgical potentials, is relatively standard in
      medical texts<sup><a href="#n3">3-6</a></sup> and reflects
      the current thinking of many pediatricians<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> .</p>

      <p class="text2">This management philosophy is based on two
      pediatric beliefs held strongly enough that they might be
      considered postulates: 1) individuals are psychosexually
      neutral at birth, and 2) healthy psychosexual development is
      dependent upon the appearance of the genitals. These ideas
      arise most strongly from the original work of Money and
      colleagues.<sup><a href="#n8">8-12</a></sup> The following
      are typical pronouncements from that research: "... erotic
      outlook and orientation is an autonomous psychological
      phenomenon independent of genes and hormones, and moreover, a
      permanent and ineradicable one as well (pp. 1397)." <sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>; "It is more reasonable to suppose
      simply that, like hermaphrodites, all the human race follow
      the same pattern, namely, of psychological undifferentiation
      at birth." <sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> The first
      postulate was derived, not from normal individuals but from
      hermaphrodites and pseudohermaphrodites and the second
      postulate had only anecdotal support. Money no longer holds
      such extreme views<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> but his
      involvement in one particular case was significant enough
      that it became a totem in the lay press and a classic for the
      academic and medical community. And, as quoted above, the
      textbooks have not kept abreast of the new thinking.</p>

      <p><b>Report of a Patient:</b></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: Bruce (David) Reimer, along with
      his twin brother, Brian, were improperly and falsely
      diagnosed by an ignorant doctor, who confused the normal
      non-retractile foreskin of childhood with pathological
      phimosis. Non-retractile foreskin is a <a
      href="/library/normal/" target="_blank">normal condition</a>
      in childhood and no treatment is necessary. Nevertheless, the
      boys were scheduled for circumcision. The unnecessary
      circumcision was terribly botched and Bruce's penis was
      burned beyond repair. After that, Brian's circumcision was
      cancelled. Later Brian's penis developed normally, showing
      that no treatment was necessary.]</p>

      <p class="text1">The case involved a set of normal XY twins,
      one of whom, John (pseudonym), at seven months of age had his
      penis accidentally burned to ablation during phimosis repair
      by cautery.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> After a great
      deal of debate, the child was seen for consultation at <a
      href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hopkinshospital/"
      target="_blank">The Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> and, following
      the two postulates mentioned above, the recommendation was
      made to unequivocally raise the child as a girl, Joan
      (pseudonym). Orchiectomy and preliminary surgery to fashion a
      vagina followed within the year to facilitate feminization.
      Further surgery was to wait until Joan was older. This
      management was monitored and reinforced with yearly visits to
      Hopkins. The treatment was reported as developing
      successfully and that John was accepting life as Joan.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Although this girl is not yet a woman, her record to
          date offers convincing evidence that the gender identity
          gate is open at birth for a normal child no less than for
          one born with unfinished sex organs or one who was
          prenataly over-or underexposed to androgen, and that it
          stays open at least for something over a year after birth
          (pp. 98)."<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

          <p>"The girl's subsequent history proves how well all
          three of them [parents and child] succeeded in adjusting
          to that decision (pp. 95)."<sup><a
          href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The effect of such reports were widespread for theory and
      practice. Sociology, psychology and women's study texts were
      rewritten to argue that, as Time magazine (Jan 8, 1973)
      reported: "This dramatic case . . . provides strong support .
      . . that conventional patterns of masculine and feminine
      behavior can be altered. It also casts doubt on the theory
      that major sex differences, psychological as well as
      anatomical, are immutably set by the genes at conception."
      Lay and social science writings still echo this case and so
      do medical texts. <sup><a href="#n3">3-6</a></sup> , <sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> The following quote is typical:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "The choice of gender should be based on the infant's
          anatomy...Often it is wiser to rear a genetic male as a
          female. It is relatively easy to create a vagina if one
          is absent, but it is not possible to create a really
          satisfactory penis if the phallus is absent or
          rudimentary. Only those males with a phallus of adequate
          size which will respond to testosterone at adolescence
          should be considered for male rearing. Otherwise, the
          baby should be reared as a female."<sup><a
          href="#n15">15</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Our current report is in contrast to those
      reports and advice. It is based on a review of the medical
      clinical notes and impressions of therapists originally
      involved with the case and on contemporary interviews. One of
      us (H.K.S.) was the Head of the Psychiatry Department to
      which the case was referred in the patients home area. While
      the patient was assigned to the immediate care of female
      psychiatrists to foster female identification and role
      modeling, H.K.S. maintained direct supervisory control of the
      case. The unique character of this case attracted the
      attention of the British Broadcasting Co. and they invited
      M.D. as a consultant.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> In 1994
      and 1995, we collaboratively reinterviewed and recorded John,
      his mother and his wife to provide updated accounts of his
      progress. Findings are listed in general chronological order
      under the more appropriate of the two postulates for
      pediatric sexual assignment. John himself, while desiring to
      remain anonymous, strongly desires his case history be made
      available to the medical community to reduce the likelihood
      of others having his psychic trauma.</p>

      <p><b>Postulate 1: Individuals are psychosexually neutral at
      birth.</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Mother recalls: "As soon as he had the
      surgery, the doctor said I should now start treating him as a
      girl, doing girl things and putting him in girl's clothes.
      But that was a disaster. I put this beautiful little dress on
      him, . . . and he [immediately tried] to rip it off. . . I
      think he knew it was a dress and that it was for girls and he
      wasn't a girl."</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, Joan could act quite
      feminine when she wanted to, and was reported as doing so,
      e.g. mother was quoted to have said: "One thing that really
      amazes me is that she is so feminine. I've never seen a
      little girl so neat and tidy as she can be when she wants to
      be. . . (pp. 119)."<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> However,
      she most often, would prefer to reject such behavior. It was
      also more common that she, much more than the twin brother,
      would mimic Father. One incident Mother related was typical:
      When the twins were about 4 or 5 they were watching their
      parents. Father was shaving and Mother applying makeup. Joan
      applied shaving cream and pretended to shave. When Joan was
      corrected and told to put on lipstick and makeup like Mother,
      Joan said: "No, I don't want no makeup, I want to shave."</p>

      <p class="text2">Girl's toys, clothes and activities were
      repeatedly proffered to Joan and most often rejected.
      Throughout childhood Joan preferred boy's activities and
      games to those of girl's; she had little interest in dolls,
      sewing or girl's activities. Ignoring the toys she was given,
      she would play with her brother's toys. She preferred to
      tinker with gadgets and tools and dress up in men's clothing;
      take things apart to see what makes them tick. She was
      regarded as a tomboy with an interest in playing soldier.
      Joan did not shun rough and tumble sports nor avoid
      fights.</p>

      <p class="text2">John recalls of Joan at the age of 12 or 13
      wanting an umbrella: "I had a couple of bucks and went to the
      store to take a look at the umbrellas, and right beside the
      umbrellas was the toy section. I started to eyeball a machine
      gun. I said to myself 'Do I have enough money for that?'. . .
      I put the gun on the counter and asked the clerk if I had
      enough money. She had that look like 'You don't have enough
      but we'll let you go anyway.' I used it to play army with my
      brother". Brother often refused to let Joan play with his
      toys, so she also saved her allowance money and bought a
      truck of her own.</p>

      <p class="text2">Joan's realization that she was not a girl
      jelled between ages 9 and 11 years. John relates:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"There were little things from early on. I began to
          see how different I felt and was, from what I was
          supposed to be. But I didn't know what it meant. I
          thought I was a freak or something; . . . I looked at
          myself and said I don't like this type of clothing, I
          don't like the types of toys I was always being given, I
          like hanging around with the guys and climbing trees and
          stuff like that and girls don't like any of that stuff. I
          looked in the mirror and sees my shoulders are so wide, I
          mean there is nothing feminine about me. I'm skinny, but
          other than that, nothing. But that is how I figured it
          out. [I figured I was a guy] but I didn't want to admit
          it, I figured I didn't want to wind up opening a can of
          worms."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Joan knew she already had thoughts of
      suicide brought on by this sort of cognitive dissonance and
      didn't want additional stress. Joan fought both the boys as
      well as the girls who were always "razzing" her about her boy
      looks and her girl clothes. She had no friends; no one would
      play with her. "Every day I was picked on, every day I was
      teased, every day I was threatened. I said enough is enough .
      . ." Mother relates that Joan was good looking as a girl. But
      it was "When he started moving or talking, that gave him away
      and the awkwardness and incongruities became apparent."</p>

      <p class="text2">The other girls teased Joan so aggressively
      that she felt forceful retaliation was called for. One girl
      sat behind Joan and continued to hit her. "[John
      demonstrating] I grabbed her like that, by the shirt, and
      rammed her round the wall like this, threw her on the ground.
      . . until the teacher grabbed me." This resulted in Joan
      being expelled from school.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the absence of a penis, Joan often
      tried to stand to urinate. This made a mess as it was
      difficult to direct the urine stream. While she learned to
      sit and void she would nevertheless continue to occasionally
      stand and urinate. Despite admonitions against the behavior
      and the untidiness, Joan persisted to such an extent that, at
      school, she was caught standing to urinate in the girls'
      bathroom sufficiently often that the other girls refused to
      allow her entrance. Mother recalls the other girls
      threatening to "kill" her if she persisted. Joan would also
      go to the boy's lavatory to urinate.</p>

      <p class="text2">Joan was put on an estrogen regimen from the
      age of 12 years but rebelled against taking the hormones.
      They made her "feel funny" and she didn't want to feminize.
      She would often dispose of her daily dose. She unhappily
      developed breasts but wouldn't wear a bra. Things came to a
      head at the age of 14. In discussing her breast development
      with her endocrinologist she confessed "I suspected I was a
      boy since the second grade". The physician, who personally
      believed Joan should continue to take her estrogens and
      proceed as a girl, used that opening to explore in a
      nonjudgmental manner, the possible male or female paths
      available and what either one would mean. Since the local
      management team had already noticed Joan's preference for
      boys activities and refusal to accept female status and they
      had discussed among themselves the possibility of accepting
      Joan's change back to male, the endocrinologist explored
      Joan's options with her. Shortly thereafter, at age 14 years,
      Joan decided to switch to living as a male.</p>

      <p class="text2">Joan was the daily butt of her peer's jibes
      and the local therapists, having knowledge of her previous
      suicidal thoughts, went along with the idea of sex
      re-reassignment. In a tearful episode following John's
      prodding, his father told him of the history of what had
      transpired and why. John recalls: "All of a sudden everything
      clicked. For the first time things made sense and I
      understood who and what I was."</p>

      <p class="text2">John requested "male hormone" shots and
      gladly took these. He requested a mastectomy and phalloplasty
      The mastectomy was completed at the age of 14 years;
      surgeries for phallus construction were at age 15 and 16
      years. After the surgical procedures, John adjusted well. As
      a boy he was relatively well accepted and popular with both
      boys and girls. At 16 years, to attract girls, John obtained
      a windowless van with a bed and bar. Girls, who as a group,
      had been teasing Joan, now began to have a crush on John.
      When occasions for sexual encounters arose, however, he was
      reluctant to move erotically. When he told one girl friend
      why he was hesitant&mdash;that he was insecure with his
      penis&mdash;she gossiped at school and this hurt John very
      much. Nevertheless, his peers quickly rallied round and he
      was accepted and the girl rejected.</p>

      <p class="text2">John's life subsequently was not unlike
      other boys with an occult physical handicap. Subsequent to
      his return to male living he felt his attitudes, behaviors
      and body were in concert; they weren't when living as a girl.
      At the age of 25 he married a women several years his senior
      and adopted her children.</p>

      <p><b>Postulate 2: Healthy psychosexual development is
      intimately related to the appearance of the genitals.</b></p>

      <p class="text1">First in Baltimore, and then with the local
      therapists prior to the sex reassignment, Joan's expressed
      feelings of not being a girl would draw ridicule and she
      would be told something like: "All girls think such things
      when they are growing up". He recalls thinking: "You can't
      argue with a bunch of doctors in white coats; you're just a
      little kid and their minds are already made up. They didn't
      want to listen." To ease pressures to act as a girl, Joan
      would often not argue or fight the assignment and would "go
      along".</p>

      <p class="text2">Starting at age 7 years, Joan began to rebel
      at going for the consultations at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
      Her reason was discomfort and embarrassment with forced
      exposure of her genitals and constant attempts, particularly
      after the age of 8 years, to convince her to behave more as a
      girl and accept further vaginal repair. This was always
      strongly resisted and led to recurrent confrontations. To
      encourage the visits and temper Joan's reluctance to travel
      to the consultants, they were combined with vacation
      trips.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Baltimore, the consultants enlisted
      male-to-female transsexuals to convince Joan of the
      advantages of being female and having a vagina constructed.
      She was so disturbing by this that in one instance Joan, at
      age 13 years, ran away from the hospital. She was found
      hiding on the roof of a nearby building. After age 14 years,
      Joan adamantly refused to return to the hospital. Joan then
      came instead fully under the care of local clinicians. This
      group consisted of several pediatricians, 2 pediatric
      surgeons, an endocrinologist, and a team of
      psychiatrists.</p>

      <p class="text2">John recalls thinking, from preschool
      through elementary school, physicians were more concerned
      with the appearance of Joan's genitals than was Joan. Her
      genitals were inspected at each visit to The Johns Hopkins
      Hospital.. She thought they were making a big issue out of
      nothing and they gave no reason to think otherwise. John
      recalls thinking: "Leave me be and then I'll be fine . . .
      Its bizarre. My genitals are not bothering me, I don't know
      why its bothering you guys so much."</p>

      <p class="text2">When asked what Joan thought of her genitals
      as a youngster, John replied "I didn't really have anything
      to compare myself against other than my brother when we were
      taking a bath." Mother confirmed that as a devout family in a
      very conservative religious community there would be few
      opportunities for the twins to have seen anyone else's
      genitals. Nudity was never acceptable. At their yearly visit
      to The JohnsHopkins Hospital the twins were made to stand
      naked for inspection by groups of clinicians and to inspect
      each other's genitalia. This experience, in itself, was
      recalled with strong negative emotions. John's brother,
      decades later, recalls the experience with tears.</p>

      <p class="text2">John recalls frustration, which remains, at
      not having his feelings and desires recognized. Without
      consideration of genitals, with the obvious absence of a
      penis, he nevertheless knew he was not a girl. When he tried
      to express such thoughts: the doctors "would change the
      subject whenever I tried to tell [doctor] how I felt. [He]
      didn't want to hear what I had to say but wanted to tell me
      how I should feel." Clinical notes from the time report he
      felt "like a trapped animal".</p>

      <p class="text2">In middle school Joan had a very difficult
      time making friends. Her clothes and demeanor, to her peers,
      did not jibe. Because of her behaviors they teased her with
      names like: "caveman" and "gorilla". Few children would play
      with her. None of Joan's peers knew anything of her
      genitals.</p>

      <p class="text2">At first the local physicians, as did Joan's
      parents, continued to reinforce her feminine identity as
      suggested by the consultants and continued to treat Joan as a
      girl preparing her for vaginal reconstructive surgery and
      life as a female. Psychotherapy, primarily by female
      therapists, aimed to reinforce her female identity and
      redirect her male ideation. This became increasingly
      difficult due to Joan's growing insistence she did not see
      herself as a girl and anger at being treated as one. John
      recalls: "They kept making me feel as if I was a freak."</p>

      <p class="text2">John knew what the clinicians wanted and
      recognized it wasn't what he wanted. Starting at age 14,
      against the recommendations of the clinicians and family, and
      without yet knowing of the original XY status, Joan, as much
      as possible, refused to live as a girl. Jeans and shirt, due
      to their gender neutral status, were her usual preferred
      clothes; boys games and pursuits her usual activities. Joan's
      daytime fantasies and night dreams during elementary school
      involved seeing herself "as this big guy, lots of muscles and
      a slick car and have all kinds of friends. . ." She aspired
      to be a mechanic. She rejected requests to look at pictures
      of nude females he was supposed to emulate. Rorschach and
      Thematic Apperception Tests at the time elicited responses
      more typical of a boy than a girl. Her adamant rejection of
      female living and her improved demeanor and disposition when
      acting as a boy, convinced the local therapists of the
      correctness of sexual re-reassignment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Following the surgery for penile
      construction there was difficulty with urethral closure and
      despite repeated attempts at repair, that problem was never
      rectified. John now urinates through a fistula at the base of
      his penis while sitting down. Much of the penis is without
      sensation as are the areas of scaring from where the grafts
      were taken.</p>

      <p class="text2">John's first sexual partner was a girl. He
      was 18 years old. While living as a girl and afterward as a
      boy, John was approached sexually by males. He claims never
      to have been attracted to any and his responses to such
      questions were matter-of-fact and not homophobic. John thinks
      his first recognizable sexual interest occurred about the age
      of 17 or 18 years although he does recall wanting to go see
      the "sexy" Rockettes in New York on one of his trips to see
      the consultants.</p>

      <p class="text2">Coitus is "occasional" with his wife. This
      frequency is sufficient for his needs but is less than his
      wife would desire. They mostly pleasure each other with a
      great deal of physical affection and mutual masturbation.
      John can have coital orgasm with ejaculation.</p>

      <p class="text2">John recalls thinking it was small minded of
      others to think all his personality was summed up in the
      presence or absence of a penis. He expressed it thus: "Doctor
      . . . said, it's gonna be tough, you're going to be picked
      on, you're gonna be very alone, you're not gonna find anybody
      unless you have vaginal surgery and live as a female. And I
      thought to myself, you know I wasn't very old at the time but
      it dawned on me that these people gotta be pretty shallow if
      that's the only thing they think I've got going for me; that
      the only reason why people get married and have children and
      have a productive life is because of what they have between
      their legs." ... "If that's all they think of me, that they
      justify my worth by what I have between my legs, then I gotta
      be a complete loser."</p>

      <p><b>General comments:</b></p>

      <p class="text1">As an adult, John was asked "Why not accept
      being a female rather than fighting it?" His answer was
      simple. Basically he wanted to please his parents and placate
      the doctors so he often went along. But doing so didn't feel
      right and the confusion between his feelings and theirs he
      saw was mentally devastating and would lead to suicide if he
      were forced to continue. The most often voiced and deeply
      felt emotion expressed by Joan was always feeling different
      from what was expected or desired by others. At first, as a
      toddler, the feeling of being different was relatively
      amorphous. Then, even as a preschooler, it shifted to clearly
      being different from girls. And later, in elementary school,
      he began to not only feel different from girls but similar to
      the group called "boys". Certainly having a twin might have
      made this comparison much easier. Such a progression in
      thinking is common for atypical individuals such as
      homosexual males and females<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      and hermaphroditic individuals or those with ambiguous
      genitalia.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The transition was gradual. When Joan
      thought she might really be a boy, instead of the girl her
      parents and the doctors told her she was, the psychic discord
      greatly frightened her even though she had suspected such was
      true since second grade. When finally told the truth, she was
      relieved since her feelings now made sense. John's anger at
      not being told the truth from the beginning persists.</p>

      <p class="text2">Following John's sex re-reassignment, the
      family decided to disregard the clinical recommendation to
      move from their family home. Instead they stayed and were
      open about the change. Aside from the financial concerns, the
      parents decided the word would get out anyway. This strategy
      seemed to work and John was accepted in a way that Joan never
      was.</p>

      <p>John was given testosterone following his return to male
      status. As is typical of many teen-age boys, John began to
      work out with weights. He blossomed into an attractive
      muscular young man.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to John's wife: "Before he came
      along I was a lot tougher on the kids because I had to be.
      [Now] John is the real hard one and I am the soft one. ...
      There is no doubt who wears the pants in this family."</p>

      <p class="text2">John is a mature and forward looking man
      with a keen sense of humor and balance. While still bitter
      over his experience, he philosophically accepts what happened
      and is trying to make the most of it with support from his
      wife, parents and family. He has job satisfaction and is
      generally self-assured.</p>

      <p><b>COMMENT</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Long term follow-ups of case reports are
      unusual but often crucial. This up-date to a case originally
      accepted as a "classic" in fields ranging from medicine to
      the humanities completely reverses the conclusions and theory
      behind the original reports. Cases of infant sex reassignment
      require inspection and review after puberty; 5 and even 10
      year post sex reassignment follow-ups are still
      insufficient.</p>

      <p class="text2">Possibly the initial impressions of the
      consultants<sup><a href="#n11">11, 12</a></sup> were
      appropriate at the time and Joan's behavior shifted with
      development. However, it appears from clinical notes and
      impressions of the local physician's at the time, and John's
      contemporary recollections, that at no time was he fully
      accepting the sex reassignment as a girl. Indeed, the local
      physicians expressed their reservations early on.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> When it became obvious, however,
      that the original management program of maintaining this male
      as a girl was no longer tenable and proving psychologically
      damaging&mdash;even life threatening&mdash;they revised their
      thinking.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is also possible that interpretations
      from the early years were mistaken since it is often
      difficult to see results not in keeping with one's hypotheses
      and management plans. Behavioral manifestations of typical
      boy behaviors would thus repeatedly be interpreted as
      tomboyish. This was true regardless if this was in terms of
      preferred activities, games, toys or clothing. Significantly,
      the conclusions that hermaphrodites and pseudohermaphrodites
      offer a model for normal development had been challenged
      before.<sup><a href="#n19">19-24</a></sup> The implications
      of such challenges does not seem to have been accepted or
      integrated by the majority of pediatricians or
      surgeons.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">John was repeatedly admonished for behaving
      like a boy. Such management is in keeping with the
      belief,<sup><a href="#n25">25-28</a></sup> that any
      acquiescence to doubt expressed by the patient would decrease
      the likelihood of an eventual successful outcome. It is
      circular reasoning to contend that Joan did not accept the
      imposed sex of rearing because of ambiguity in treatment.
      There is no evidence of such and the initial reports held
      that the rearing was appropriate.<sup><a href="#n11">11,
      12</a></sup> It is known, particularly from transsexuals,
      that casting doubt as to sexual identity usually forces
      greater introspection and security regarding a preferred
      life's direction even though counter to upbringing, parent's
      wishes, social and cultural norms and may result in less than
      adequate genitalia.<sup><a href="#n29">29, 30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the case under consideration, the initial
      management protocol was predicated on postulates which saw
      successful treatment involving attention to a male's
      self-image supposedly dependent upon the adequacy of a
      functional penis. While it can be accepted that such adequacy
      is important there is no body of data establishing its
      centrality.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other considerations are in order. Gender
      reassignment as proposed for John, and the postulates upon
      which they are based, assume the individual will learn to
      accept rearing-appropriate sex-typical behaviors,
      particularly when the genitals are at issue. These situations
      range from the urinary to erotic to narcissistic. Such
      behaviors, while important, are only one aspect of an
      individual's total sexuality. An individual's sexual profile
      is comprised of at least five levels: gender Patterns,
      Reproduction, sexual Identity, Mechanisms and sexual
      Orientation (PRIMO).<sup><a href="#n31">31, 32</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The sex reassignment of John to Joan only
      attended to the gender patterns, and gender roles to which he
      would be subject with the expectations his identity and other
      levels would follow. Joan did indeed become aware of the
      social expectations concomitant with the female gender but
      these were not in keeping with those with which he felt
      comfortable. Standing to urinate, despite its housekeeping
      and social consequences is a dramatic display of preference.
      The sex reassignment thus obviously failed in the area in
      which it was most designed to succeed.</p>

      <p class="text2">But it failed in the other four levels as
      well. The contrast between the female gender-typical
      behaviors the child was being asked to accept and his inner
      directed behavior preferences presented a discordance that
      demanded resolution. Joan's analysis of the situation was
      that she best fit in, not as a girl but as a boy. Thus,
      despite her upbringing, Joan's sexual identity developed as a
      male. Sex reassignment also obviously went against Joan's or
      John's reproductive character. Castration removed any
      reproductive capacity. Certainly unaware of this as a child,
      John very much resents this now and decries this loss.
      Castration also removed the androgen source for sex-typical
      mechanisms of sexual arousal and other physiological
      processes. His ability to ejaculate returned with androgen
      treatment. The castration and surgical scaring, however, has
      dramatically reduced erotic sensitivity to the perineum and
      subsequently reduced this option. And significantly, as many
      studies strongly indicate, sexual orientation is prenataly
      organized or at least predisposed.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33-40</a></sup> The sex reassignment did nothing
      to effect sexual orientation. Joan remained totally
      gynecophilic despite being reared as a girl.</p>

      <p class="text2">Comments from John's parents reveals another
      important consideration. With a sex reassignment they are
      asked to make a dramatic psychological adjustment in how to
      rear an otherwise normal child. Mother herself required
      psychiatric treatment to help manage her feelings in this
      regard. The penile ablation, not withstanding, they were more
      comfortable dealing with their child's original sex and the
      accident than with a reassigned sex. Although they had
      definitely tried to make a success of the original sex
      reassignment, they were very supportive&mdash;while guilt
      ridden&mdash;of Joan's reversion to John.</p>

      <p class="text2">This last decade has offered much support
      for a biological substrate for sexual behavior. In addition
      to the genetic research mentioned above there are many
      neurological and other reports which point in this direction.
      <sup><a href="#n31">31,32</a></sup>, <sup><a
      href="#n41">41-56</a></sup> The evidence seems overwhelming
      that normal humans are not psychosexually neutral at birth
      but are, in keeping with their mammalian heritage,
      predisposed and biased to interact with the environment,
      familial and social forces, in a male or female mode. This
      "classic" case demonstrates this dramatically. And the fact
      that this was particularly expressed at puberty&mdash;a
      critical period&mdash;is logical and has been predicted.
      <sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>, <sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although this report is of the classic case
      of sex reassignment so often cited in the literature,
      follow-ups to other related cases are available. Reilly and
      Woodhouse 57 , described 20 patients with micropenis reared
      as boys and none having any doubt as to the correctness of
      assignment as males. And many reports exist where, despite
      the absence of a normal penis,<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>,
      <sup><a href="#n58">58-62</a></sup> males were originally
      reassigned as girls, that switched back, and successfully
      lived as males. Several of these cases offer the same sorts
      of findings presented by us; with great similarity at the
      ages at which various milestones were passed, feelings
      developed and their reassignment challenged<sup><a
      href="#n59">59, 60</a></sup> A most recent case illustrates
      this.</p>

      <p class="text2">Reiner<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup>
      reported on an adolescent Hmong immigrant who precipitously
      dropped out of school at 14 years of age. Upon subsequent
      interview she declared, although having been unequivocally
      raised as a girl from birth "I am not a girl, I am a boy".
      Indeed, physical examination revealed a 46 chromosome, XY
      male with mixed gonadal dysgenesis with a female appearing
      pelvis with clitoral hypertrophy. All her school-age friends
      had been boys. She enjoyed rough and tumble play, avoided
      dolls and girls activities and would dress in a
      gender-neutral or boys way. Her feelings of being
      different&mdash;being a boy&mdash;developed from about the
      age of 8 and came to a head at 14 years. Treatment involved
      surgery and endocrine therapy. This individual, after a
      period of some depression, progressively developed into a
      gynecophilic sexually active male.</p>

      <p class="text2">These cases of successful gender change, as
      well as the present one, also challenge the belief that such
      a switch after the age of 2 years will be devastating.
      Indeed, in these cases it was salutary.</p>

      <p class="text2">It must be acknowledged that cases of males
      accepting life as females after the descruction of their
      penises has been reported 64 These reports, however, do not
      detail the individuals' sexual or personal lives.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Considering this case follow-up, and as far
      as an extensive literature review can attest, there is no
      known case where a 46 chromosome, XY male, unequivocally so
      at birth, has ever easily and fully accepted an imposed life
      as an androphilic female regardless of the physical and
      medical intervention. True, surgical reconstruction of
      traumatized male or ambiguous genitalia to that of a female,
      and attendant sex reassignment of males is mechanically
      easier than constructing a penis but there might be an
      unacceptable psychic price to pay. Concomitantly there is no
      support for the postulates that individuals are
      psychosexually neutral at birth or that healthy psychosexual
      development is dependent upon the appearance of the genitals.
      Certainly long term follow up on other cases is needed.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the interim, however, new guidelines are
      offered. We believe that any 46-chromosome, XY individual
      born with a normal nervous system, in keeping with the
      psychosexual bias thus prenataly imposed, should be raised up
      as a male. Surgery to repair any genital problem, while
      difficult, should be conducted in keeping with this paradigm.
      This decision is not simple<sup><a href="#n7">7</a>, <a
      href="#n13">13</a>, <a href="#n18">18</a>, <a
      href="#n63">63</a>, <a href="#n65">65-67</a></sup> and
      analysis should continue.</p>

      <p class="text2">As parents will still want their children to
      be and look normal as soon after birth as possible,
      physicians will have to provide the best advice and care,
      consistent with present knowledge. We suggest this means
      referring the parents and child to appropriate and periodic
      long term counseling rather than immediate surgery and sex
      reassignment just because that seems a simpler immediate
      solution to a complicated problem. With this management, a
      male's predisposition to act as a boy and his actual
      behaviors will be reinforced in daily interactions on all
      sexual levels and his fertility preserved. Social
      difficulties may reveal themselves as puberty is experienced,
      however, there is no evidence that with proper counseling and
      surgical repair when best indicated, an adjustment will not
      be managed as teen-agers manage other severe handicaps.
      Future reports will determine if we are correct.</p>
