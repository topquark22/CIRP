      <div class="abstract">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><u>Objective:</u> Clinical
        reports suggest that many adults who engage in self-
        destructive behavior have childhood histories of trauma and
        disrupted parental care. This study explored the relations
        between childhood trauma, disrupted attachment, and
        self-destruction, using both historical and prospective
        data. <u>Method:</u> Seventy-four subjects with personality
        disorders or bipolar II disorder were followed for an
        average of 4 years and monitored for self-destructive
        behavior such as suicide attempts, self-injury, and eating
        disorders. These behaviors were then correlated with
        independently obtained self-reports of childhood trauma,
        disruptions of parental care, and dissociative phenomena.
        <u>Results:</u> Histories of childhood sexual and physical
        abuse were highly significant predictors of self-cutting
        and suicide attempts. During follow-up, the subjects with
        the most severe histories of separation and neglect and
        those with past sexual abuse continued being
        self-destructive. The nature of the trauma and the
        subjects' age at the time of the trauma affected the
        character and the severity of the self-destructive
        behavior. Cutting was also specifically related to
        dissociation. <u>Conclusions:</u> Childhood trauma
        contributes to the initiation of self-destructive behavior,
        but lack of secure attachments helps maintain it. Patients
        who repetitively attempt suicide or engage in chronic
        self-cutting are prone to react to current stresses as a
        return of childhood trauma, neglect, and abandonment.
        Experiences related to interpersonal safety, anger, and
        emotional needs may precipitate dissociative episodes and
        self-destructive behavior.</i><br />
