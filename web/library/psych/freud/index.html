      <h2 align="center">THE ROLE OF BODILY ILLNESS IN<br />
       THE MENTAL LIFE OF CHILDREN</h2>

      <p align="center">By <a
      href="http://annafreudcentre.org/scan.htm">ANNA FREUD</a>,
      LL. D. (London)</p>

      <p align="center">I. I<font size="1">NTRODUCTION</font></p>

      <p class="text2">When trying to evaluate the role of bodily
      illness in the mental life of children, we find ourselves
      hampered by the lack of integration of material at our
      disposal. With the present-day division between professional
      teaching, nursing, child guidance work, child analysis and
      pediatrics, there is little or no opportunity for the trained
      worker in one of these fields to function, even in the role
      of observer, in one of the other services for children.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> Nursery
      workers, school teachers and child analysts see nothing of
      the children under their care when they are ill; while
      pediatricians and sick-nurses lose contact with their young
      patients when they are healthy. It is only the mothers who
      have the opportunity to see their children in health,
      illness, convalescence, deviating from the norm bodily and
      mentally and returning to it. On the other hand, during
      severe bodily illness the mother's own emotional upset and
      her inevitable concentration on bodily matters act as
      distorting factors and leave little room for objective
      observation of the child's psychological reactions.</p>

      <p class="text2">In recent years a number of analytic authors
      have made attempts to deal with the effects of
      hospitalization on young children, a series of studies which
      culminated in a documentary film.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> But in the case of these
      studies the interest of the investigators was directed toward
      the misery and anxiety which arise invariably when young
      children are removed from their parents, placed in unfamiliar
      surroundings and handled and care for by strangers;
      hospitalization mere serving as a prototype of a first, short
      term separation from home. Instructive as these
      investigations are as a demonstration of separation anxiety
      and its consequences, they did not produce - nor were they
      meant to - additional knowledge concerning reactions to
      illness and pain in infantile life.</p>

      <p class="text2">Data are less scarce where the after effects
      of illness are concerned. When describing the neurotic
      disorders of their children, parents date back the onset of
      the trouble frequently to some bodily illness, after which
      the child appeared to be "different". Mood swings, changes in
      the relationship to parents and siblings, loss of self
      confidence, temper tantrums often appear for the first time
      during convalescence after a severe illness. Symptoms such as
      bed wetting, soiling, feeding and sleeping troubles, school
      phobias, which had existed and been overcome earlier in life
      may reappear. Some children who had been considered brilliant
      in their intellectual performance before the illness,
      reappear afterward in school comparatively dull and
      apathetic; others surprise their parents and teachers by
      emerging from the same experience curiously ripened and
      matured. It is true that changes of this kind may happen
      after a period of hospitalization. But it is equally true
      that they happen as well where hospitalization does not take
      place, i.e. in children who have remained under the care of
      their mothers during illness and been nursed at home. When
      considering the effects of bodily illness on the life of the
      child, it is important to note that hospitalization is no
      more than one factor among several other potentially harmful
      and upsetting influences.</p>

      <p align="center">II. T<font size="1">HE</font> E<font
      size="1">FFECTS OF</font> N<font size="1">URSING</font>,
      M<font size="1">EDICAL AND</font> S<font
      size="1">URGICAL</font> P<font size="1">ROCEDURES</font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before we can arrive at a correct assessment
      of this potentially traumatic experience of illness we have
      to work our way through the action of a large number of
      factors which, though they are mere by-products of the
      situation, are for the child's mind inexplicably intermixed
      with it. The child is unable to distinguish between feelings
      of suffering caused by the disease inside the body and
      suffering imposed on him from outside for the sake of curing
      the disease. He has to submit uncomprehendingly, helplessly
      and passively to both sets of experiences. In certain
      instances factors of the latter kind, with their high
      emotional significance, may even be decisive ones in causing
      a child's psychological breakdown during illnesses, or in
      determining the aftereffects.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(i)
      Change of emotional climate during illness.</i> - There are
      few parents who do not, imperceptibly or grossly, change
      their own attitude to the ill child. There are some parents
      with ascetic leanings, who are afraid of over-indulging and
      thereby "spoiling" the child at such times, and consequently
      leave him severely alone, to "sleep out" his indisposition
      with the minimum of fussing. The majority of parents adopt an
      opposite attitude. The ill child may find himself more loved
      and fondled than at any other time of life; for a child of a
      large family an infectious disease, with consequent isolation
      from siblings, may be the one occasion when he is in sole
      possession of his mother's time and care. The mother owing to
      her anxiety for the child's health, may suspend all
      considerations of discipline and good behavior and indulge
      the child's wishes to the extreme. Or, on the contrary, in
      her preoccupation with the child's safety, she may forget the
      most elementary principles of psychological handling which
      she had applied in times of health: Shocks, forcible feeding,
      evacuation of the bowels, sudden separations (for
      hospitalization), deceptions (before operations) count for
      nothing with her so long as they ensure the child recovers.
      The child on the other hand, reacts to such unexpected
      handling as to traumatic experiences, feels bewildered by the
      upsetting of formerly unmovable emotional and moral standards
      or finds himself unable to renounce the incidental emotional
      gains after recovery.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(ii) The experience of being nursed.</i>
      - The child's reaction to the experience of being nursed is
      understood best in terms of comparison with the better known
      and frequently described reactions of adults to the
      corresponding situation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> A normal adult who is nursed
      though a severe illness cannot help feeling at the same time
      that he is exposed to a series of indignities. He has to
      renounce ownership of his own body and permit it to be
      handled passively. He is dressed and undressed, fed, cleaned,
      washed, helped with urination and defecation, turned from one
      side to the other, his nakedness exposed to nurse and doctor,
      regardless of sex, of decencies and conventional
      restrictions. He is, as it were, under orders, subjected to a
      hygienic routine which implies a major disregard for his
      personal attitudes and preferences. Characteristically enough
      many adults sum this experience up as being "treated as a
      baby," or as a "complete return to the conditions of
      childhood."</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand it would be a mistake to
      conclude from such statements that the situation of being
      nursed, by virtue of its similarity to infantile experiences,
      is less upsetting to the child than the adult. Observation,
      as well as theoretical considerations show that the opposite
      may well be the case. The gradual mastering of various bodily
      functions, such as independent eating, independent bowel and
      bladder evacuation, the ability to wash, dress, undress,
      etc., mark for the child highly significant stages in ego
      development as well as advances in detaching his own body
      from that of the mother and possessing it at least in part. A
      loss of these abilities, when occasioned by the nursing
      procedures (or by the weakened bodily condition itself),
      means an equivalent loss in ego control, a pull back toward
      the earlier and more passive levels of infantile development.
      Some children who have built up strong defenses against
      passive leanings oppose this enforced regression to the
      utmost, thereby becoming difficult, intractable patients;
      others lapse back without much opposition into the state of
      helpless infancy from which they had so recently emerged.
      Newly acquired and, for that reason, precariously anchored
      ego achievements are lost most frequently under those
      conditions. Many mothers report that after a brief spell of
      illness their young infants have to be retrained as far as
      their toilet habits are concerned, weaned once more from
      spoon feeding, from clinging to the constant company of their
      mother, etc.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(iii) Restrictions of movement, diet,
      etc.</i> - In contrast to the comparative ease with which ego
      skills and abilities are renounced under the impact of being
      "nursed", children defend their freedom of movement in the
      same situation to the utmost wherever they are not defeated
      by the type or intensity of the illness itself. It is well
      known that, at least under the conditions of home nursing,
      children with minor indispositions cannot be kept in bed
      consistently, or at least not lying down in bed. Young
      toddlers who have only recently learned to walk, are known to
      stand up stubbornly in their beds from the whole course even
      of severe illnesses (for instance measles) until exhaustion
      forces them to adopt the lying position.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font>. Recently some
      enlightened pediatricians have accepted this state of affairs
      and treat their child patients whenever possible, without
      enforcing bed rest.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The psychological significance of the
      children's negative attitude in this respect become apparent
      in those extreme circumstances when child patients have to be
      immobilized after surgery or in the course of orthopedic
      treatment. Several analytic authors have observed and
      discussed the consequences of such extreme restraint of
      movement of limbs and have pointed out the possible
      connection with the emergence of stereotyped, tic-like
      movements elsewhere in the body (David Levy, 1928, 1944), the
      difference of this mechanically enforced from psychologically
      enforced restraint (Mahler, Luke, Daltroff,1945), their
      bearing on the blocking of aggression discharge as well as on
      the discharge of stimulation in general with consequent
      overerotization of the whole body (Greenacre, 1944). Thesi
      Bergmann (1945), in an observational study carried out during
      three years work in an orthopedic ward, gives a vivid
      description of the defense mechanisms which enable the
      immobilized children to bear the restraint and even to
      increase the docility when the restraining measures have to
      be increased. On the other hand she describes the rages and
      temper tantrums which appear when the restraint is partially,
      not wholly lifted or when chance deprivations, outside the
      expected medical procedure, are added to it unexpectedly. She
      emphasizes, further, a two fold relationship between the
      immobilized limbs and other parts of the body. According to
      her experience, on the one hand the restraint of one limb may
      spread in the form of inhibitions to other, non-affected
      parts; an the other hand certain ego skills, speech, etc. may
      undergo an accelerated development to compensate for motor
      restriction of one limb. The same processes as they occur in
      children with pulmonary tuberculosis are presented in a
      highly interesting study by Sara Dubo (1950).</p>

      <p class="text2">These authors' observations are confirmed by
      much non-recorded experience of parents and teachers. The
      heightening of aggression during and after motor restraint
      (in plaster casts, etc.) is especially well known to the
      general public. The most usual ways in which this dammed-up
      aggression appears are restlessness, heightened irritability,
      the use of bad language, etc.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">In comparison with this massive blocking of
      a whole system of discharge, the food restrictions imposed on
      children during illness are of minor importance. Normally, in
      acute illnesses, the physiological lessening of the child's
      appetite prepares the way for the acceptance of a reduced
      diet; it is only the children with strong oral fixations, for
      whom food and deprivation of food have heightened libidinal
      significance, who react to the situation with fantasies of
      being badly treated, unloved, rejected. In chronic illnesses
      (such as diabetes, kidney trouble, colitis, allergies) where
      dietary restrictions have to be maintained for long periods
      of time, children are known to feel "different," singled out,
      discriminated against, or, in defense against being passively
      deprived, to develop ascetic self-denying tendencies.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the whole, considerably less harm is done
      by the necessity of withholding desired foods by an anxious
      mother, urging or even forcing unwelcome food on an ill
      child. It is these latter situations which turn ever minor,
      short illnesses into starting points for serious and
      prolonged eating difficulties, usually by reviving feeding
      battles which have raged between mother and child in the
      nursing period.</p>

      <p class="text2">For some children the taking of medicines
      presents a major difficulty. Though the bad taste or smell of
      the drug is in the foreground so far as the child's conscious
      reasons are concerned, analytic investigation discloses
      invariably behind these rationalizations the existence of
      repressed ideas of being attached by the mother through the
      symbol of the drug (Melanie Klein), of being poisoned,
      impregnated, by her. Laxatives which may force the bowels to
      move, though the child intends otherwise, may form the
      connecting link between the reality and these unconscious
      fantasies.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this connection it is interesting to
      remember that the punitive character of these restrictive
      measures has always been known to parents and has been
      exploited by them. To send a child to bed, confine him to his
      room, deprive him of favorite dishes have been used as
      punishments over the ages. In certain societies over the
      forcible administration of laxatives is used for the same
      purpose.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(iv) Operations.</i> - <span
      class="yellow">Ever since the discovery of the castration
      complex analysts have had ample opportunity in their
      therapeutic work to study the impact of surgical operations.
      on normal and abnormal development. By now it is common
      knowledge that surgical interference with the child's body
      may serve as the focal point for the activation,
      reactivation, grouping and rationalization of ideas of being
      attacked, overwhelmed and (or) castrated. The surgeon's
      action, from minor surgery to major operations, is
      interpreted by the child in terms of his level of instinct
      development, or in regressive terms. What the experience
      means in his life, therefore does not depend on the type or
      seriousness of the operation but on the type and depth of the
      fantasies aroused by it. If, for example, the child's
      fantasies are concerned with his aggression against the
      mother projected on to her person, the operation is
      experienced as a retaliatory attack made by the mother on the
      inside of the child's body (Melanie Klein); or the operation
      may be used to represent the child's sadistic conception of
      what takes place between the parents in intercourse, with the
      child in the role of the passive sexual partner; or the
      operation is experienced as a mutilation, i. e., as
      punishment for exhibitionistic desires, for aggressive penis
      envy, above all for masturbatory practices and oedipal
      jealousies. If the operation is actually carried out on the
      penis (circumcision, if not carried out shortly after birth),
      castration fears are aroused whatever the state of libidinal
      development. In the phallic stage, on the other hand,
      whatever part of the body is operated on will take over by
      displacement the role of an injured genital part.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> The actual
      experience of the operation lends a feeling of reality to the
      repressed fantasies, thereby multiplying the anxieties
      connected with them. Apart from the threatening situation in
      the outer world, this increase in anxiety presents an
      internal danger which the child's ego has to face. Where the
      defense mechanisms available at the time are strong enough to
      master these anxieties, all is well; where they have to be
      overstrained to integrate the experience, the child reacts to
      the operation with neurotic outbreaks; where the ego is
      unable to cope with the anxiety released, the operation
      becomes a trauma for the child.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">In a recent symposium on the Emotional
      Reactions of Children to Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy, a
      representative group of analysts, psychiatrists,
      pediatricians, and psychologists discussed the subject in the
      light of these ideas with a view to lessening the traumatic
      possibilities of the three main factors involved in the
      situation: reaction to anesthesia, to hospitalization, and to
      the operative procedure itself. Finding the optimal time for
      carrying out an operation (Hendrick, Escalona, Sylvester);
      careful preparation before the event (Fries, 1946); avoidance
      of separation anxiety (Jackson, 1942), Putnam, Butler;
      psychiatric support (Rank), feelings for expression of
      feeling (Spock) were brought forward as the most important
      precautionary measures (<a href="/library/psych/levy1/">Levy,
      1945</a>; Pearson, 1941).</p>

      <p class="text2">When studying the aftereffects of childhood
      operations in the analysis of adult patients we find that is
      not the castration fear but the feminine castration wish in a
      male child which is most frequently responsible for serious
      postoperative breakdowns or permanent postoperative character
      changes. In these instances the surgical attack on the
      patient's body acts like a seduction to passivity to which
      the child either submits with disastrous results for this
      masculinity, or against which he has to build up permanently
      strong defenses.</p>

      <p align="center">III. P<font size="1">AIN AND</font>A<font
      size="1">NXIETY</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(i) The mental interpretation of
      pain.</i> - The manner in which the child invests bodily
      events with libidinal and aggressive cathexis and
      significance creates a phenomenon which has baffled many
      observers. Parents and others who deal with young children
      comment frequently on the remarkable individual differences
      in children's sensitivity to bodily pain; what is agonizing
      for one child may be negligible to another. The analytic
      study of such behavior reveals as different not the actual
      bodily experience of pain but the degree to which the pain is
      charged with psychic meaning. Children are apt to ascribe to
      outside or internalized agencies whatever painful process
      occurs inside the body (accidental hurts, fall, knocks, cuts,
      abrasions, surgical interference as discussed above, etc.)
      Thus, so far as his own interpretation is concerned, the
      child is pain is a child maltreated, harmed, punished,
      threatened by annihilation. The "tough" child "does not mind
      pain," not because he feels less or is more courageous in the
      real sense of the word, but because in his case latent
      unconscious fantasies are less dominant and therefore less
      likely to be connected to the pain. Where anxiety derived
      from fantasy plays a minor or no part, even severe pain is
      borne well and forgotten quickly. Pain augmented by anxiety
      on the other hand, even if slight in itself, represents a
      major event in the child's life and is remembered a long time
      afterward, the memory being frequently accompanied by phobic
      defenses against its possible return.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to the child's interpretation of
      the event, young children react to pain not only with anxiety
      but with other affects appropriate the the content of the
      unconscious fantasies, i. e., on the one hand with anger rage
      and revenge feelings, on the other hand with masochistic
      submission, guilt or depression.</p>

      <p class="text2">The correctness of these assumptions is
      borne out by the fact that after analytic therapy formerly
      oversensitive children become more impervious to the effect
      of pain.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(ii) Pain and anxiety in infants.</i> -
      Where the direct observation of infants in the first year of
      life is concerned, the relative proportion of physiological
      and psychological elements in the experience of pain is an
      open question. At this stage, any tension, need or
      frustration is probably felt as "pain," no real distinction
      being made yet between the diffuse experience of discomfort
      and the sharper and more circumscribed one of real pain
      arising from specific sources. In the first months of life
      the threshold of resistance against stimulation is low and
      painful sensations assume quickly the dignity of traumatic
      events. The actual response of the infant, whether it occurs
      instantaneously, or after a time lag of varying length, or
      remains invisible altogether, is no reliable guide to the
      assessment of the shock caused by the pain.</p>

      <p class="text2">From what age onward the bodily event is
      supposed to carry psychic meaning for the infant will depend
      altogether on the analytic observer's theoretical assumptions
      concerning the date when unconscious fantasies begin to
      exist.</p>

      <p class="text2">For the observer of children under the
      condition of medical treatment it is interesting to note that
      older infants (two or three years) may react with almost
      identical distress to the experience of injections or
      inoculations and to the experience of sunlight treatment,
      although the former involves pain (plus anxiety) the latter
      is merely anxiety-raising without any pain involved.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(iii) Passive devotion to the doctor.</i>
      - It is the psychological meaning of pain which explains why
      many doctors, and other inflictors of pain, are not merely
      feared but in many cases highly regarded and loved by the
      child. The infliction of pain calls forth passive masochistic
      responses which hold an important place in the child's love
      life. Frequently the devotion of the child to doctor or nurse
      becomes very marked on the days after the distress caused by
      a painful medical procedure has been experienced.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(iv) Reaction to pain as a diagnostic
      factor.</i> - With young boys in the oedipal stage, their
      reaction to bodily pain provides a useful key to the
      differential diagnosis between genuine phallic masculinity
      and the misleading manifestations of reactive overstressed
      phallic behavior designed to ward off passive feminine
      castration ideas. The masculine boy is contemptuous of bodily
      pain which means little to him. The boy who has to defend
      himself against passive leanings cannot tolerate even slight
      amounts of pain without major distress.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(i) Changes in libido distribution</i>. -
      The casual observer, while following with his attention the
      loud, manifest reactions to anxiety and pain, nursing
      procedures and restrictions, is in danger of disregarding
      another process which, silent and under the surface, is
      responsible for most important alterations during illness: i.
      e., the heightened demand of the ill body for libidinal
      cathexis. Some observant mothers know the mental signs
      heralding his state and are able to diagnose from them the
      onset of disease even before any significant bodily symptoms
      have appeared.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are two ways for the patient to react
      to this demand from the side of the body. Many children who,
      when healthy, are in good contact with their surroundings,
      full of interest in their toys and occupations, are in the
      happenings of everyday life, begin their sicknesses by
      withdrawing from their environment, lying down on the floor
      or curling up in a corner, listless and bored.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> At the height
      of the illness they lie in bed without moving, their faces
      turned to the wall, refusing toys, food as well as any
      affectionate advances made to them. Though these reactions
      occur in certain children regularly, even with harmless sore
      throats, stomach upsets, raised temperatures, and the most
      common infectious children's diseases, the impression given
      by such a child in a state of withdrawal is that of a
      seriously ill person. Anxious mothers are terrified by this
      complete reversal in their child's behavior and feel him to
      be in grave danger. In reality the manifestation is not a
      physiological one but a psychological one and not
      commensurate with the severity of the illness. It is a change
      in libido distribution during which cathexis is withdrawn
      from the object world and concentrated on the body and its
      needs. Despite its frightening suggestion of malignancy this
      process is a beneficial one, serving the purpose of
      recovery.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are other children who, for some
      unknown reason rooted in their individual libido economy, use
      a different manner to achieve the same result. Unable to give
      their own ill body the additional narcissistic cathexis which
      it demands from them, they claim this surplus of love and
      attention from their mothers who nurse them through the
      illness, i. e. they become demanding, exacting, clinging far
      beyond their years. In doing so they make use of a natural
      process dating back to the first year of life, when the
      mother's libidinal cathexis of the infant's body is the main
      influence in protecting it from harm, destruction and
      self-injury. (Hoffer, 1950). For the surface observer
      children are extremely "fussy" when ill, those of the former
      type are undemanding.</p>

      <p class="text2">In both cases the gradual return to health
      is accompanied by a gradual regularization of these movements
      of libido, though not without difficulties and reversals
      during which the child appears "cranky." Occasionally the
      abnormal distribution of libido proves irreversible for a
      certain length of time and produce some of the puzzling
      personality changes after illness which have been pointed out
      above.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>(ii) The child's body as the mother's
      property. Hypochondria.</i> - Some mothers find it difficult
      to resign themselves to the fact that their children, even
      after the toddler stage, cannot really be trusted to take
      care of their own bodies and to observe the rules serving
      health and hygiene. Whenever a mother reports with pride that
      her child washes hands before eating without being told to do
      so, analytic exploration will reveal that the child in
      question is a severe obsessional and his apparently sensible
      cleanliness a compulsive and magical defense against
      imaginary, dangerous contacts. Children who protect
      themselves against colds and drafts ward off fears of death;
      those who choose their foods carefully do so on the basis of
      fears of being poisoned; those who refrain from eating too
      much or too many nourishing foods are obsessed by anxieties
      concerning pregnancy. The average, normal child will observe
      none of these precautionary measures; he will eat with dirty
      hands, stuff himself, brave wet and cold weather, eat green
      apples and other unripe fruits unless forced, urged or
      prevented by his mother. In illness he will at best
      co-operate with her; at worst he will fight the care taken of
      him and proceed to use his own body as he pleases. So far as
      health, hygiene and nursing care are concerned, the mother's
      ownership of the child's body extends from earliest infancy,
      when the mother-child unity is an important factor in the
      libido economy of both, through all of the phases of
      childhood into adolescence. At this last stage, before
      independence is finally reached, recklessness in matters of
      health provide one of the most familiar battlegrounds for
      bitter struggles between the adolescent and the mother.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is interesting to observe that this state
      of affairs is reversed more or less completely when
      motherless, orphaned and institutional children are
      concerned, even in those cases where competent professional
      nursing care is provided. Far from enjoying the freedom from
      anxious motherly supervision (as the observer might expect
      from the mothered child's revolt against her care) motherless
      children proceed to care for their bodies in an unexpected
      manner. In an institution known to the author it was
      difficult sometimes to prevail upon the child to shed his
      sweater or overcoat in hot weather; his answer was that he
      "might catch cold." Rubber boots and galoshes were asked for
      and conscientiously worn by others so as"not to get their
      feet wet." Some children watched the length of their sleep
      anxiously, others the adequacy of their food. The impression
      gained was that all the bogeys concerning the child's health
      which had troubled their mother's minds in the past had been
      taken over by the young children themselves after separation
      or bereavement, and activated their behavior. In
      identification with the temporarily or permanently lost
      mother, they substituted themselves for her by perpetuating
      the bodily care received from her.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">When watching the behavior of such children
      toward their bodies we are struck by with the similarity of
      their attitudes to that of the adult hypochondriac, to which
      it perhaps provides a clue. The child actually deprived of
      the mother's care, adopts the mother's role in health
      matters, thus playing "mother and child" with his own body.
      The adult hypochondriac who withdraws cathexis from the
      object world and places it on his body is in a similar
      position. It is the overcharging of certain body areas with
      libido (loving care) which makes the ego of the individual
      hypersensitive to any changes which occur in them. With
      children analytic study seems to make it clear that in the
      staging of the mother-child relationship, they themselves
      identify with the lost mother, while the body represents the
      child (more exactly the infant in the mother's care). It
      would be worth investigating whether the hypochondriacal
      phase which precedes many psychotic disorders corresponds
      similarly to a regression to and re-establishment of his
      earliest stage of the mother-child relationship.</p>

      <p align="center">V. S<font size="1">UMMARY</font></p>

      <p class="text2">In carrying further the author's and other
      writers' studies of separation anxiety (hospitalization) this
      paper surveys the other factors which play a part in the
      child's reaction to bodily illness. The effects of the
      various nursing medical and surgical procedures which are
      open to modification are distinguished from those elements
      which are inherent in the process of illness itself, such as
      the effects of pain and the inevitable changes of libido
      distribution. Lastly, a comparison is drawn between the state
      of deprived children who care for their bodies in
      identification with their lost mothers and the adult
      hypochondriac who overcathects his body with libido after it
      has been withdrawn from the object world.</p>

      <p class="text2">In summarizing these factors which play an
      important role in very normal development the author wishes
      once more to stress how serious a measure hospitalization is,
      separating the the child from the rightful owner of his body
      when his body is threatened by dangers from inside as well as
      from the environment.<br />

      formerly physician at the Babies Hospital, Newcastle on Tyne,
      impressed on the members of the Cassel Hospital Summer School
      for Ward Sisters (1949) that in children's wards there should
      be "no rigidity about the child being kept in bed"; Dr.
      Josefine Stross, pediatrician, when teaching students of the
      Hampstead Nurseries (1940-1945) and the Hampstead Child
      Therapy Course, emphasized repeatedly that even where
      children have to be kept off the floor, movement inside the
      crib should not be restricted.</font></p>

      knowledge of a girl who was immobilized during her latency
      period for orthopedic reasons. She used to pay her friends
      out of her pocket money for every new swear word which they
      brought home from school. The use of "bad language" was the
      only outlet left for her otherwise paralyzed
      aggression.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
      id="n7" name="n7"></a> 7. By deciding on the length of
      preparation time before an operation, two factors have to be
      taken into account. A preparation period which is too lengthy
      leaves too much room for the spreading out of id fantasies;
      where the interval between knowledge and performance of
      operation is too short, the ego has insufficient time for
      preparing its defenses.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
      id="n8" name="n8"></a> 8. This refers to a case where such
      listlessness cannot be accounted for on physiological
      grounds.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
      id="n9" name="n9"></a> 9. A most instructive example of this
      behavior is the instance of a motherless boy of six years who
      in a long drawn out nightly attack of vomiting and diarrhea
      was heard to say to himself: "I, my darling." When asked what
      he meant, he answered: "That I love myself. It is good to
      love oneself, isn't it?"</font></p>
