      <p>BACKGROUND</p>

      <p align="justify">The recognition that trauma is
      qualitatively different from stress and results in lasting
      biological change goes back to the dawn of contemporary
      psychiatry. A century ago, <a
      href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Janet/murchison.htm"
      target="_blank">Pierre Janet</a> (1889) taught that
      overwhelming experiences are accompanied by "vehement
      emotions" which interfere with proper information processing
      and appropriate action. He thought that this hyperarousal
      caused the characteristic memory disturbances that accompany
      traumatization, by interfering with information processing on
      a verbal, symbolic level. Hyperarousal causes memories to be
      split off from consciousness and to be stored as visual
      images or bodily sensations. Fragments of these "visceral"
      memories return later as physiological reactions, emotional
      states, nightmares, flashbacks, or behavioral reenactments
      (van der Kolk &amp; van der Hart, 1989).</p>

      <p class="text2">Janet thought that the original excessive
      physiological response to trauma accounted for the continued
      emergency responses to subsequent stresses. He claimed that
      fear needs to be tamed for proper cognitive appraisal and for
      appropriate action: experiences which overwhelmed people's
      coping mechanisms set the stage (or to use Pavlov's later
      concept "condition" them) to react automatically with
      excessive emotional reactions to current experiences rooted
      in the past.</p>

      <p class="text2">Freud adopted these views from Janet and
      also suggested that the fixation on the trauma is
      biologically based: "After severe shock . . . the dream life
      continually takes the patient back to the situation of his
      disaster from which he awakens with renewed terror . . . the
      patient has undergone a physical fixation to the trauma"
      (Freud, 1919, 1954, p. 207). The feature of hyperactivity to
      external stimuli was described by Freud in the clearest
      neuropsychiatric terms that he knew: "I think that one may
      venture . . . the traumatic neurosis as the result of an
      extensive rupture in the barrier against stimuli . . . we
      seek to understand the effect of the shock by considering the
      breaking through of the barrier with which the psychic organ
      is provided (p. 207).</p>

      <p class="text2">Pavlov's investigations continued the
      tradition of explaining the trauma response as the result of
      lasting physiological alterations (Pavlov, 1926). He, and
      others employing his paradigm, coined the term "defensive
      reaction" for a cluster of innate reflexive responses to
      environmental threat. Many studies have shown how the
      response to potent environmental stimuli (unconditional
      stimuli-US) becomes a conditioned reaction. After repeated
      aversive stimulation, intrinsically non-threatening cues
      associated with the trauma (conditional stimuli-US) becomes a
      conditioned reaction. After repeated aversive stimulation,
      intrinsically non-threatening cues associated with trauma
      (conditional stimuli-CS) become capable of eliciting the
      defensive reaction by themselves (conditional response-CR). A
      rape victim may respond to conditioned stimuli, such as the
      approach by an unknown man as if she were about to be raped
      again, and experience panic. Pavlov also pointed out that
      "constitutional factors", i.e. individual differences in
      temperament, accounted for the variability in the human
      approach to traumatic stimuli.</p>

      <p class="text2">Abraham Kardiner (1941) who first
      systematically defined post-traumatic stress for American
      audiences, noted that sufferers from PTSD continue to live in
      the emotional environment of the traumatic event, with
      enduring vigilance for and sensitivity to environmental
      threat. He described the five principal features of PTSD as
      (1) persistance of startle response and irritability, (2)
      proclivity to explosive outbursts of aggression, (3) fixation
      on the trauma, (4) constriction of the general level of
      personality functioning, nad (5) atypical dream life. He
      suggested that the startle reaction probably was a
      conditioned reflex and considered it the central element of
      the post-traumatic stress reaction, relating it to the
      development of irritability and psychosomatic symptoms in
      these patients.</p>

      <p class="text2">In War Stress and Neurotic Illness, Kardiner
      and Spiegal (1945) stated that a traumatic neurosis is a
      physical one, and that the physical sensation endures: "the
      nucleus of the neurosis is a physioneurosis. This is present
      on the battlefield and during the entire process of
      organization; it outlives every intermediary accommodative
      device, and persists in the chronic forms. The traumatic
      syndrome is ever present and unchanged" (p. 38).</p>

      <p class="text2">In Men under Stress, Grinker and Spiegel
      (1945) describe physical symptoms in the acute post-traumatic
      state that seem to reflect neurochemical changes of the
      catecholamine system: they describe flexor changes in
      posture, hyperkinesis, "violently propulsive gait", tremor at
      rest, masklike faces, absence of associated movement while
      walking, cogwheel rigidity, gastric distress, urinary
      incontinence, mutism, and a violent startle reflex. Grinker
      and Spiegal noted the similarity of many of these symptoms
      and those of diseases of the extrapyramidal motor system.
      They seem to depict an extraordinary stimulation of
      biological systems, implicating ascending amine projections
      in particular. Contemporary studies, generally unaware of
      this earlier research, have continued to scientifically test
      these conceptions and they confirm that the stress hormones
      of people with PTSD continue to react in minor stimuli as
      emergencies.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY OF PTSD</p>

      <p align="justify">The phasic post-traumatic symptoms of
      hyperalertness, hyper-reactivity to stimuli and traumatic
      reexperiencing have been documented in a vast literature on
      combat trauma, crimes, such as rape (e.g., Burgess &amp;
      Holstrom, 1974; Kilpatrick, Veronen, &amp; Best, 1985),
      kidnapping (Terr, 1983), natural disasters (e.g., Shore,
      Tatum &amp; Vollmer, 1986), accidents (e.g., Wilkinson, 1983)
      and imprisonment (Krystal, 1978). The human response to
      trauma is so constant across traumatic stimuli that it is
      safe to say that the central nervous system (CNS) seems to
      react to any overwhelming, threatening and uncontrollable
      experience in quite a consistent pattern. Regardless of these
      circumstances, traumatized people are prone to have intrusive
      memories of element of the trauma, to have a poor tolerance
      for arousal, to respond to stress in an all-or-nothing way,
      and to feel emotionally numb. All of these psychological
      phenonema must have a basis in biological functioning, some
      of these relationships between biological states are now
      ready to be explored. PTSD as defined in the <a
      href="/library/psych/ptsd/">DSM-III-R</a>, highlights those
      post-traumatic symptoms that are most clearly biologically
      based (for reviews see van der Kolk, 1987; Krystal et al.,
      1989); the secondary post-traumatic changes in identity and
      interpersonal relations are slated to be classified in the
      separate category of Disorders of Extreme Stress Not
      Otherwise Specified (DESNOS) in the DSM IV. Since there are
      good reasons to assume that the current PTSD hyperarousal
      are, biologically speaking, intimately related, we will
      discuss them jointly throughout this paper.</p>

      <p><i>Autonomic Hyperactivity and Intrusive
      Reexperiencing</i></p>

      <p align="justify">Kardiner (1941) coined the term
      "physioneurosis" to describe post-traumatic stress. He
      pointed out that while people with PTSD tend to deal with
      their environment by emotional constriction, their bodies
      continue to react to certain physical and emotional stimuli
      as if there were a continuing threat of annihilation.
      Starting with studies by Dobbs and Wilson (1960), conditioned
      autonomic arousal to combat stimuli has repeatedly been
      documented in veterans with PTDS. Using a variety of
      different techniques, Mallow, Fairbank, and Keane (1983) Kolb
      and Multipassi (1982), Blanchard, Kolb, Geradi, Ryan, and
      Pallmyer (1986) and Pitman, Orr, Forque, deJong, and Claiborn
      (1987), all have found significant conditioned reactions in
      response to stimuli reminscent of the original trauma, as
      measured by heartrate, bloodpressure and electromyogram. More
      recent studies have shown that both traumatized children
      (Ornitz, &amp; Pynoos, 1989) and adults (Shalev et al.,
      submitted) lack habituation to acoustic startle.</p>

      <p class="text2">A relationship between autonomic arousal and
      intrusive recollections has long been postulated, and in
      recent years has started to be confirmed by the work of such
      investigators as Rainey and Southwick. Rainey et al. (1987)
      showed that the administration of lactate, which stimulates
      the physiological arousal system, elicited PTSD-like
      flashbacks in 7/7 subjects and panic attacks in 6 in 7
      patients with PTSD, 6 of whom also met panic disorder
      criteria. Southwick and his colleagues demonstrated that
      yohimbine injections (which stimulate NE release from Locus
      Coeruleus) were able to induce somatosensory flashbacks in
      people with PTSD (Southwick et al., submitted). These studies
      further suggest common biological underpinnings of flashbacks
      and panic attacks in PTSD.</p>

      <p class="text2">The reliability and specificity of the
      studies of physiological reactions to traumatic stimuli are
      beginning to raise the possibility that in the future a
      psychophysiologically based diagnostic test for PTSD will be
      available to help make the diagnosis. However, it is still
      unclear how specific the hyperarousal is as a conditioned
      response to traumatic stimuli alone. Clinical experience
      suggests that the increased autonomic arousal can be rather
      non-specific, and may occur in response to a variety of
      stimuli. In fact, some research suggests that habituation may
      follow repeated exposure to the traumatic stimulus itself,
      but associated events continue to illicit hyperactivity
      (Strian &amp; Klicpera, 1978). These findings can be used
      therapeutically in implosion therapy (Keane, Fairbanks, &amp;
      Caddell 1989).</p>

      <p class="text2">The loss of neuromodulation that is at the
      core of PTSD leads to intensification of emotional reactivity
      in general: traumatized people go immediately from stimulus
      to response without being able to make the intervening
      psychological assessment of the cause of their arousal, which
      causes them to overreact and intimidate others. Non-specific
      noises played into the rooms of sleeping people with
      post-traumatic stress may precipitate nightmares in which old
      traumatic occurrences are recreated in exact detail (Kramer,
      Schoen, &amp; Kinney, 1984). Hyperorousal also interferes
      with psychotherapy, in preventing remembering and working
      through painful memories.</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Numbing of Responsiveness</i> Numbing
      of responsiveness, which may be registered as depression, as
      anhedonia and amotivational states, as psychosomatic
      reactions, or in dissociative states, is tonic and part of
      the patients' baseline functioning. It interferes with the
      ability to explore, remember and symbolize which are
      essential to finding good meaning. Throughout the literature
      numbing is all too unquestioningly described as a
      psychological defense against remembering painful affects.
      Below, we will argue that numbing is a core, biologically
      based, symptom of PTSD.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>DEVELOPMENTAL LEVEL AFFECTS THE PSYCHOBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
      OF TRAUMA</p>

      <p align="justify">While most studies on PTSD have been done
      on adults, particularly on war veterans, in recent years, a
      small prospective literature has emerged which calls
      attention to the differential effects of trauma at various
      age levels. Anxiety disorders, chronic hyperarousal, and
      reenactments have now been described with some regularity in
      acutely traumatized children (Bowlby, 1969; Eth &amp; Pynoos,
      1985, Stoddard, 1989; Terr; 1988). In addition to the
      reactions to discrete, one time, traumatic incidents
      documented in these studies, intrafamilial abuse must
      certainly be included among the most severe traumas
      encountered by human beings. This recognition opens up the
      boundaries between the current concept of PTSD and the what
      we have called "the trauma spectrum" (van der Kolk, 1988):
      other post-traumatic disorders ranging from those that result
      from brief traumatic exposure at an early age, such as
      phobias and panic, to Borderline Personality Disorder and
      Multiple Personality Disorder which are usually associated
      with chronic intrafamilial abuse (Herman, Perry, and van der
      Kolk, 1989). Specific neurobiological abnormalities are
      beginning to be identified along this spectrum: prospective
      studies by Putnam are showing neuroendrocrine disturbances in
      sexually abused girls compared with normals, while others (G.
      Gillette, personal communication, 1989) have demonstrated
      abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-throid axis in
      adult female psychiatric patients with childhood histories of
      incest. Non-brain damaged adult patients who mutilate
      themselves invariably seem to have a history of severe
      childhood trauma, and their behavior has been associated with
      abnormalities of the endogenous opioid and catecholamine
      systems (Bach-y-Rita, 1974), van der Kolk, Greenberg, Orr,
      &amp; Pitman, 1989). Research in the last decade has shown
      that many children who have been victims of intrafamilial
      abuse have chronic problems with hyperarousal, and aggression
      against others and themselves (Green, 1980; Cicchetti &amp;
      Rosen, 1984; van der Kolk, Perry &amp; Herman, 1991).</p>

      <p class="text2">The biological effects of developmental
      trauma has best been studied in young non-human primates, who
      in many ways resemble young human beings. Forty years of
      primate research has firmly established that early disruption
      of the social attachment bond reduces the long term capacity
      to cope with subsequent social disruptions and to modulate
      physiological arousal. These studies have demonstrated that
      trauma early in the life cycle has long term effects on the
      neurochemical response to stress, including the magnitude of
      the catecholamine response, the duration and extent of the
      cortisol response, as well as a number of other biological
      systems, such as the serotonin and endogenous opioid systems
      (Kraemer et al., 1984, Reite &amp; Field, 1987, van der Kolk,
      1987).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>TRAUMA AND THE LIMBIC SYSTEM</p>

      <p align="justify">The limbic system plays an important role
      in guiding the emotions that stimulate the behavior necessary
      for self-preservation and survival of the species. It is
      responsible for such complex behaviors as feeding, fighting,
      fleeing and reproduction, and it also assigns free-floating
      feeling of significance, truth and meaning to experience
      (MacLean, 1985). Destruction of parts of the limbic system
      abolishes social behavior, including play, cooperation,
      mating, and care of the young. The apparent similarities
      between some aspects of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), PTSD
      and some long term sequelae of childhood trauma continues to
      challenge us to further explore the effects of trauma on the
      limbic system. During this past decade, the relationships
      between environmental trauma and the organization and
      function of the limbic system are slowly beginning to be
      understood, in part because of the work on non-human
      primates, which has conclusively shown that disruption of
      early attachment directly affects the maturation of the
      limbic system (Kling &amp; Steklis, 1976). The limbic system
      also is the primary area of the CNS where memories are
      processed, and the most likely place to find an explanation
      for the memory disturbances which follow trauma. The
      hippocampus, which records in memory the spatial and temporal
      dimensions of experiences, dose not fully mature until the
      third or fourth year of life. However, the system that
      subserves memories related to the quality (feel and sound) of
      experience (which is located in the amygdala) matures much
      earlier (O'Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978; Jacobs &amp; Nadel,
      1985). Thus, in the first few years of life only the quality
      of events, but not their context can be remembered. Even
      after that, the hippocampal localization system remains
      vulnerable to disruption: severe or prolonged stress can
      disrupt hippocampal functioning, creating context-free
      fearful associations which are hard to locate in space and
      time. This results in amnesia for the specifics of traumatic
      experiences, but not the feelings associated with them.
      (Sapolsky, Krey, &amp; McEwen, 1984). These experiences then
      may be encoded on a sensorimotor level without proper
      localization in space or time. They therefore cannot be
      easily tranlated into the symbolic language necessary for
      linguistic retrieval.</p>

      <p class="text2">A third trauma related function of the
      limbic system involves the issue of kindling. Intermittent
      stimulation of the limbic system with an electrical current
      that was initially too small to produce overt behavioral
      effects can eventually sensitize limbic neuronal circuits and
      lower neuronal firing thresholds: repeated stimulation of the
      amygdala causes long-term alterations in neuronal
      excitability (for a review, see van der Kolk, 1987). It is
      possible that similar kindling phenomena occur when people
      are repeatedly traumatized, or when one traumatic event is
      followed by intrusive reexperiences. Thus, trauma may lead to
      lasting neurobiological and behavioral (characterological)
      changes mediated by alterations in the temporal lobe.
      Kindling may also account for the frequent finding of soft
      neurological signs in trauma victims, especially in child
      victims of physical or sexual abuse (van der Kolk, 1987).
      Open studies claim that carbamezapine is an effective
      treatment for the intrusive symptoms of PTSD (Lipper et al.,
      1986) which lends some support for a role of the limbic
      system in codifying post traumatic reactions.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>THE NEUROMODULATION OF AROUSAL NORADRENERGIC VERSUS
      SEROTONERGIC PATHWAYS.</p>

      <p align="justify">The Locus Coeruleus (LC) is at the
      anatomical core of the physiological arousal mechanism in the
      Central Nervous System (CNS). It is the principal source of
      noradrenaline (NE) in the CNS, the neurotransmitted
      responsible for delivering messages to the rest of the brain
      about the need to prepare for emergencies. These
      noradrenergic connections prepare the hypothalamic mechanisms
      which control defensive reactions to be ready for action.
      Another noradrenergic bundle connects the LC with the
      septo-campal system, the part of the limbic system involved
      in the evaluation of the incoming stimuli. This noradrenergic
      bundle does not carry specific information, only the general
      message: this in important (Gray, 1982). Impulses reaching
      the septo-hippocampal system influence the interpretation of
      incoming information. Several naturally occurring or
      exogenous biochemical agents influence noradrenergic
      activity: endogenous opiates inhibit the firing of the LC
      (Bird &amp; Kuhar, 1977), while such pharmacological agents
      as clonidine and the beta adrenergic blockers produce the
      same effect by: reducing noradrenergic activity in the the LC
      neurons. Antianxiety drung interferer with LC activity by
      increasing GABA-ergic inhibition on the cell bodies of the
      LC.</p>

      <p class="text2">The function of the septo-hippocampal system
      is to evaluate the rough meaning of incoming stimuli, and
      whether they are associated with reward, punishment, novelty,
      or non-reward. The hippocampus thus is thought to be the
      evaluation center involved in behavioral inhibition,
      obsessional thinking, exploratory behavior, scanning and
      construction of a spatial map (O'Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978). It
      fulfills the crucial function of storing and categorizing
      information. When categorization is complete, the hippocampus
      disengages from active control of behavior. External stress
      increases corticosterone production which decreases the
      firing rate of the hippocampuse (Pfaff, Silva, &amp; Weiss,
      1971). Lesions of the hippocampus lead to motor paralysis
      because of excessive interference from competing
      responses.</p>

      <p class="text2">The signal that punishment is imminent
      activates two related mechanisms, one of which inhibits
      ongoing behavior, while the other increases the level of
      arousal. The behavioral facilitating system (BFS) (which is
      mediated by NE fibers emanating from the LC) activates the
      CNS structures necessary for emergency responses. The BFS is
      activated when specific goal-oriented aggressive attack
      patterns require motivated motor support (Dupre &amp; Spoont,
      1989). The opposing system, that of behavioral inhibition
      (BIS) is mediated by the septo-hippocampal system, primed by
      ascending serotonergic and cholingergic mechanisms. The
      crucial role of the septo hippocampal system is to activate a
      descending inhibatory pathway which prevents initiation of
      emergency responses until it is clear that they are needed.
      Numerous studies have shown that serotonergic antagonists
      also cause increased aggression in response to stress, and
      hyper-reactivity to stimuli. (Sheard &amp; Davis, 1976). The
      suppression of behavior by punishment is reversed by
      serotonin receptor blockers (e.g., Cook &amp; Sepinwall,
      1975). The ascending serotonergic pathways are thought to
      signal the septo-hippocampus to distinguish punishment from
      reward. The introduction of the serotonin reuptake blockers
      fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and gepirone demonstrated how these
      agents reversed the continued emergency responses and
      repetitive behaviors following stress in animals, allowing a
      better understanding about the degree to which decreased
      serotonin seems to play a role in these behaviors. Current
      clinical trials of these drugs in people with PTSD suggest
      that they are by far the most effective biological treatments
      of PTSD currently available. This makes us believe that in
      traumatized individuals decreased serotonin decreases the
      influence of the Behavioral Inhibition System, thereby
      disposing the septo-hippocampal system to interpret ordinary
      stressors as recurrents of traumatic experiences. Thus we
      postulate that lowered serotonin activity in PTSD is
      responsible for the continuation of emergency responses to
      minor stresses long after the actual trauma has ceased.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>THE STRESS RESPONSE AND THE PSYCHOBIOLOGY OF PTSD</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Arousal</i> The body responds to
      increased physical or psychological demands by releasing
      norepinephrine from the Locus Coerulus and
      adrenorcorticotrophin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. The
      precise interactions between the various stress hormones is
      extremely complex, and still is poorly understood, but both
      norepinephrine and epinephrine play a role in stimulating the
      release of CRF (Axelrod &amp; Neisine, 1984). The
      Hypothalamus regulates ACTH release by the secretion of
      corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). The hypothalamus also
      secretes throxin releasing hormone (TRH) which activates the
      secretion of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) from the
      pituitary. CRF, as well as vasopressin, activates the release
      of ACTH and beta endorphin and stimulate adenylate cyclase
      activity and the formation of cyclic AMP. Peripherally, the
      body's stress response consists of the secretion of
      norepinephrine by the sympathetic nerves and of epinephine by
      the adrenal medulla, while, stimulated by ACTH, the adrenal
      cortex secretes glucocorticoids. These hormones help the body
      mobilize the energy necessary to deal with stressors, ranging
      from increased glucose release to enhanced immune function.
      In a well functioning organism stress produces rapid and
      pronounced hormonal responses. However persistent stress
      blunts this effective stress response and induces
      desensitization: after prolonged stress, CRF secretion
      produces less cylic AMP formation and ACTH release because of
      down regulation of CRF receptors (Axelrod &amp; Neisine,
      1984).</p>

      <p class="text2">It therefore is not surprising that, in a
      study of the psychobiology of PTSD, stress hormones have
      figured most prominently, and that abnormalities of these
      systems are often found in patients with PTSD. Kosten, Mason,
      Giller, Ostroff, and Harkness (1987) found increased 24 hour
      norepinephrine and epinephrine secretions in veterans with
      PTSD compared with patients other psychiatric diagnoses.
      Mason, Giller &amp; Kosten (1988) found low 24 hour urinary
      cortisol levels in Vietnam veterans with PTSD. In a different
      study, PTSD subjects showed blunted ACTH response to CRH
      stimulation: Smith et al. (1989) found that the severity of
      PTSD was directly related to baseline cortisol level. This
      supports the notion that there is chronically increased
      levels of cortisol in patients with PTSD. However, Smith et
      al. also suggested the alternative explanation of decreased
      pituitary function secondary to persistent elevations of
      endogenous CRH due to chronic HYPAC axis activity at the
      level of the hypothalamus.</p>

      <p class="text2">Changes in receptor activity have been found
      in PTSD which are consistent with down regulation secondary
      to chronic exposure to elevated levels of circulating
      catecholamines: Perry and associates (Perry, Giller, &amp;
      Southwick, 1987) have demonstrated a 40% decrease in the
      muber of platelet alpha2 adrenergic receptors in 25 patients
      with PTSD. Lerer, Ebstein, Shestatsky, Shemesh, and Greenberg
      (1987) recently reported evidence of desensitization of
      adenylate cyclase coupled adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes
      and platelets with PTSD.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, persistent activation of stress
      response is not only a function of the stress hormones
      themselves, but also of the capacity of the organism to
      modulate arousal. We discussed before how serotonergic input
      into the septal-hippocamus decreases the relative strength of
      the noradrenergic input, allowing modulation of the emergency
      responses. The serotonin reuptake blockers fluvoxamine,
      fluextine and gepirone seem to have a dramatic beneficial
      effect on the capacity to modulate arousal and decrease
      Post-traumatic repetitions of images, behaviors, or somatic
      states. The clinical trials with these drugs suggest that
      they are by far the most effective biological treatments of
      PTSD currently available.</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Numbing</i> While the numbing in
      responsiveness in PTSD has generally been conceptualized only
      in psychological terms, as a defense against reliving
      memories of the trauma, our recent research may shed some
      light on the biological components of this aspect of PTSD.
      Stress induced analgesia (SIA) has been described in
      experimental animals following a variety of inescapable
      stressors as electric shock, fighting, starvation and cold
      water swim. (Kelly, 1982; for a review see van der Kolk,
      1987). In these severely stressed animals, opiate withdrawal
      symptoms can be produced equally by termination of the
      stressful stimulus or by naxolone injections. Thus, severe,
      chronic stress in animals results in a physiological state
      which resembles dependence on high levels of exogenous
      opioids (Terman, Shavit, Lewis, Cannon, &amp; Liebeskind,
      1984; Maier &amp; Seligman, 1976).</p>

      <p class="text2">Stimulated by the finding that fear
      activates the secretion of endogenous opioid peptides and
      that SIA can be become conditioned to subsequent stressors,
      and to previously neutral events associated with the noxious
      stimuli, we tested the hypothesis that in people with PTSD,
      re-exposure to a stimulus resembling the original trauma will
      cause an endogenous opioid response that can be indirectly
      measured as naxolone reversible anesthesia (van der Kolk et
      al., 1989; Pitman, van der Kolk, Orr, &amp; Greensburg,
      1990). We found that two decades after the original trauma,
      people with PTSD developed opioid-mediated analgesia in
      response to a stimulus resembling the traumatic stressor,
      which we correlated with a secretion of endogenous opioids
      equivalent to 8 mg. of morphine. This change in pain response
      was the most significant factor differentiating the PTSD from
      the control groups' response to a traumatic stimulus.
      Self-reports of emotional responses to the combat videotape
      in the placebo condition indicated a relative blunting of
      emotional response to the traumatic stimulus and we
      interpreted this finding to indicate that opioid-mediated SIA
      may be involved in psychic numbing. Survivors of severee
      trauma have repeated described a triad of physical analgesia,
      psychic numbing and depersonalization. Our finding of SIA in
      PTSD may also be relevant to the phenomenon of
      self-mutilation. Patients who engage is such self-destructive
      behavior or neglect invariably have a history of severe
      childhood trauma and, in response to even relatively minor
      emotional stressors, they may experience physical analgesia,
      dissociative reactions and emotional numbing, which can be
      abolished b (1) an act of self-mutilation or (2) the
      administration of naloxone (Richardson &amp; Zaleski, 1983;
      Sandman, Barron, Crinella, &amp; Donnelly, 1987) Whether the
      analgesia, dissociative reactions, and emotional numbing
      reported in these patients are all functions of a conditioned
      endogenous opioid response to a traumatic stressor remains a
      subject for further investigation.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Memory disturbances in PTSD.</i> One of
      the hallmarks of PTSD is the intrusive reexperiencing of
      elements of the trauma in nightmares, flashbacks, or somatic
      reactions. These traumatic memories seem to be triggered by
      autonomic arousal (Rainey et al., 1987) and are thought to be
      due to the hyperpotentiation of memory pathways and mediated
      by noradrenergic pathways originating the locus coeruleus
      (LC) (van der Kolk, Greenberg, Boyd, &amp; Krystal, 1985).
      The innervation of the structures of the brain subserving
      memory functions originate in the LC from which noradrenergic
      projections go to the limbic system, cerebral cortex, and to
      a lesser degree the hypothalamus (Grant &amp; Redmond, 1981).
      The LC also facilitates memory retrieval by means of the
      noradrenergic tracts in the hippocampus and amygdala
      (Delaney, Tussi, &amp; Gold, 1983). We (van der Kolk et al.,
      1985) and Pitman (1989) have hypothesized that a long term
      augmentation of the LC pathways following trauma underlies
      the repetitive intrusive relieving of the trauma,
      particularly after renewed stress. Since autonomic arousal is
      mediated by the LC it is plausible that not only flashbacks,
      but also traumatic nightmares accur following autonomic
      nervous system activation, mediated by the potentiated
      pathways from the LC to the hippocampus and amygdala. This
      also could account for the eidectic (picure-like), rather
      than oneiric (dream-like) quality of traumatic nightmares
      (van der Kolk et al., 1984) Further evidence for the
      existence of such long-term potentiation of memory in
      patients with PTSD comes from the recent experimental work by
      Southwick et al. (submitted).</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Sleep studies.</i> Patients with PTSD
      have been found to have chronically disturbed sleep which
      appears to be related to chronic hypearousal. Both Kaminer
      and Lavie (1988) and van Kammen, Christiansen,, van Kammen,
      and Reynolds (1990) found increased sleep latency, more
      awakening, less total sleep time and less REM time. Several
      researchers have found PTSD patients to be exquisitely
      sensitive to non-specific auditory stimuli during sleep; the
      resulting autonomic arousal seems to precipitate nightmares
      about traumatic experiences, a finding that appears to
      analogous to that of Soutwick et al. We (van der Kolk et al.,
      1984) found that post-traumatic nightmares occur during any
      stage of the sleep cycle; that most tend to occur during 2
      and 3 a.m. during Stage II or III sleep, possibly during a
      transition to REM sleep. When they occur during Stage II or
      III, patient report exact living experiences of traumatic
      material, while, during REM, they are more likely anxiety
      dreams.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Psychosomatic reactions.</i> Numerous
      studies for the past one hundred years have established a
      causal relation between the inhibition of expression of
      traumatic experience and psychophysiological impairment.
      These studies have demonstrated a marked increase in symptoms
      of the respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular and endocrine
      systems in people with PTSD (Janet, 1989; Krystal, 1978).
      Recent studies have indicated that learning to express the
      memories and feelings related to the traumatic event can
      restore some of the psychophysiological and immunological
      competence to people with trauma histories (Pennebaker &amp;
      Susman, 1988).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF
      PTSD</p>

      <p align="justify">While giving voice to both the traumatic
      events and the affects related to them is generally
      considered the most effective treatment of PTSD, verbal
      therapies cannot proceed as long as the patient is unable to
      tolerate the feelings associated with the trauma and
      continues to experience subsequent emotionally stimulating
      event as an unmodified recurrence of the trauma. It often is
      necessary to supplement psychotherapy with medications which
      decrease autonomic arousal, or increase neuromodulation.
      Clinical studies of war veterans have show that the autonomic
      nervous system is centrally involved in many of the symptoms
      of PTSD, including startle reactions, irritability,
      nightmares and flashbacks ad explosive outbursts of
      aggression. It is therefore predictable that those
      medications which affect autonomic arousal would prove
      helpful in relieving the symptoms of PTSD. Autonomic arousal
      can be reduced at different levels in the central nervous
      system: although inhibition of noradrenergic activity,
      (clonidine and the beta adrenergic blockers), by increasing
      the inhibitory effect of the gaba-ergic system with
      gaba-ergic agonists (the benzodiazepines) and through
      enhancing the serotonergic inhibition system with agents such
      as Lithium and the serotonin uptake blockers, monomine
      oxidase inhibitors (Hogben &amp; Cornfield, 1981; Frank,
      Kosken, Giller, &amp; Dan, 1988), lithium carbonate (van der
      Kolk, 1983), beta adrenergic blockers and clonidine (Kolb,
      Burris, &amp; Griffiths, 1984), carbamezapine (Lipper et al.,
      1986) and antipsychotic agents. However, no carefully
      controlled studies documenting the differential effects of
      various psychotropic medications on the symptoms of PTSD
      exist at this time. The only psychotropic medications whose
      efficacy in PTSD sympomatology have been evaluated in double
      blind studies are tricyclic antidepressants and MAO
      inhibitors Bleich, Siegel, Garb, Kettler, &amp; Lerer, 1987;
      Davidson, Kudler, Smith, Mahorney, &amp; Lipper, in press;
      Frank et al., 1988). These studies indicate that tricyclic
      antidepressants are effective in treating affective disorders
      in patients with PTSD, but do no little for core PTSD
      symptomatology, including psychological numbing. Tricyclic
      antidepressants generally thought to be most effective in
      treating nightmares, depression, sleep disorders and startle
      reactions, but were less able to relieve numbing. Hogben and
      Cornfield (1981) found MAO inhibitors effective in the
      treatment in PTSD, but that anecdotal study has not
      consisently held up to subsequent investigation (e.g.,
      Shetaksy, Greenberg, &amp; Lerer, 1989). Current studies in
      our laboratory indicate that the serotonin reuptake blocker
      fluoxetine is markedly effective in treating both the
      intrusive and the numbing symptoms seen in patients with
      PTSD.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>

      <p align="justify">A rapidly expanding knowledge of the
      effects of traumatization on the functioning of the Central
      Nervous System, the dawning awareness that memory functions
      are central in understanding the nature of PTSD, combined
      with the availability of animal models for PTSD, makes the
      psychobiology of trauma one of the most promising areas in
      psychiatry. As long as the most effective therapy of PTSD has
      not been firmly established, a greater understanding of the
      biochemical and physiological correlates of traumatization
      should provide important clues about appropriate
      intervention. A variety of psychopharmacological agents that
      affect the physiological arousal system, including clonidine,
      benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tricylic
      antidepressants decrease the long term effects of inescapable
      shock in animals, and seem to have varying degrees of use in
      the pharmacotherapy of PTSD. The recent discovery that
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to act by quite a
      different mechanism and may be extremely effective in
      reducing both the intrusive and the numbing effects of PTSD
      needs to be carefully documented and understood. Further
      exploration during the coming decades of how trauma affects
      neuroendocrine emergency systems, neuromodulation, and memory
      should provide us with a much greater understanding about the
      interplay between soma and psyche in coping with potentially
      overwhelming experiences.</p>
