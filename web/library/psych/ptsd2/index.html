      <p><font size="+2"><b><i>Diagnostic
      Features</i></b></font></p>

      <p>The essential features of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is
      the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure
      to an extreme traumatic stressor involving direct personal
      experience of an event that involves actual or threatened
      death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical
      integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death,
      injury, or a threat to another person; or learning about
      unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death
      or injury experienced by a family member or other close
      associate (Criterion A1). The person's response to the event
      must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror (or in
      children, the response must involve disorganized or agitated
      behavior) (Criterion A2). The characteristic symptoms
      resulting from the exposure to the extreme trauma include
      persistent reexperiencing of the traumatic event (Criterion
      B), persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the
      trauma and numbing of general responsiveness (Criterion C),
      and persistent symptoms of increased arousal (Criterion D).
      The full symptom picture must be present for more than 1
      month (Criterion E), and the disturbance must cause
      clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
      occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
      (Criterion F).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traumatic events that
      are experienced directly include, but are not limited to,
      military combat, violent personal assault (sexual assault,
      physical attack, robbery, mugging), being kidnapped, being
      taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a
      prisoner of war or in a concentration camp, natural or
      manmade disasters, severe automobile accidents, or being
      diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. For children,
      sexually traumatic events may include developmentally
      inappropriate sexual experiences without threatened violence
      or assault. Witnessed events include, but are not limited to,
      observing the serious injury or unnatural death of another
      person due to violent assault, accident, war, or disaster or
      unexpectedly witnessing a dead body or body parts. Events
      experienced by others that are learned about include, but are
      not limited to violent personal assault, serious accident, or
      serious injury experienced by a family member or a close
      friend; learning about the sudden unexpected death of a
      family member or a close friend; or learning that one's child
      has a life-threatening disease. The disorder may be
      especially severe or long lasting when the stressor is of
      human design (e.g. tortune, rape). The likelihood of
      developing the disorder may increase as the intensity of and
      physical proximity to the stressor increase.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The traumatic events
      can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly the person has
      recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion
      B1) or recurrent distressing dreams during which the event is
      replayed. (Criterion B2). In rare instances, the person
      experiences dissociative states that last from a few seconds
      to several hours, or even days, during which components of
      the event are relived and the person behaves as though
      experiencing the event at the moment (Criterion B3). Intense
      psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological
      reactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the person is
      exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an
      aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., anniversaries of the
      traumatic event; cold, snowy weather or uniformed guards for
      survivors of death camps in cold climates; hot, humid weather
      for combat veterans of the South Pacific; entering any
      elevator for a woman who was raped in an elevator).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stimuli associated
      with the trauma are persistently avoided. The person commonly
      makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or
      conversations about the traumatic event (Criterion C1) and to
      avoid activities, situations, or people who arouse
      recollections of it (Criterion C2). This avoidance of
      reminders may include amnesia for an important aspect of the
      traumatic event (Criterion C3). Diminished responsiveness to
      the external world, referred to as &ldquo;psychic
      numbing&rdquo; or &ldquo;emotional anesthesia&rdquo; usually
      begins soon after the traumatic event. The individual may
      complain of having markedly diminished interest in previously
      enjoyed activities (Criterion C4), of feeling detached or
      estranged from other people (Criterion C5), or of having a
      markedly reduced ability to feel emotions (especially those
      associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality)
      (Criterion C6). The individual may have a sense of a
      foreshortened future (e.g., not expecting to have a career,
      marriage, children, or a normal life span) (Criterion
      C7).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The individual has
      persistent symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal that were
      not present before the trauma. These symptoms may include
      difficulty falling or staying asleep that may be due to
      recurrent nightmares during which the traumatic event is
      relived (Criterion D1), hypervigilance (Criterion D4), and
      exaggerated startle response or difficulty concentrating or
      completing tasks (Criterion D3).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+2"><b><i>Specifiers</i></b></font></p>

      <p>The following may be used to specify onset and duration of
      the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder:<br />
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>Acute.</b> This specifier should be used when the
        duration of the symptoms is less than 3 months.<br />
         <b>Chronic.</b> This specifier should be used when the
        symptoms last three months or longer.<br />
         <b>With Delayed Onset.</b> This specifier indicates that
        at least 6 months have passed between the traumatic event
        and the onset of symptoms.
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+2"><b><i>Associated Features and
      Disorders</i></b></font></p>

      <p><b>Associated descriptive features and mental
      disorders.</b> Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      may describe painful guilt feelings about surviving when
      others did not survive or about the things they had to do to
      survive. Phobic avoidance of situations or activities that
      resemble or symbolize the original trauma may interfere with
      interpersonal relationships and lead to marital conflict,
      divorce, or loss of job. The following associated
      constellation of symptoms may occur and are more commonly
      seen in association with an interpersonal stressor (e.g.,
      childhood sexual or physical abuse), domestic battering,
      being taken hostage, incarceration as a prisoner of war or in
      a concentration camp, torture): impaired affect modulation;
      self-destructive and impulsive behavior; dissociative
      symptoms; somatic complaints; feelings of ineffectiveness,
      shame, despair, or hopelessness; feeling permanently damaged;
      a loss of previously sustained beliefs; hostility; social
      withdrawal; feeling constantly threatened; impaired
      relationships with others; or a change from the individual's
      previous personality characteristics.</p>

      <p>There may be increased risk of Panic Disorder,
      Agoraphobia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Social Phobia,
      Specific Phobia, Major Depressive Disorder, Somatization
      Disorder, and Substance-Related Disorders. It is not known to
      what extent these disorders precede or follow the onset of
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.</p>

      <p><b>Associated laboratory findings.</b> Increased arousal
      may be measured through studies of autonomic functioning
      (e.g., heart rate, electromyography, sweat gland
      activity).</p>

      <p><b>Associated physical examination findings and general
      medical conditions.</b> General medical conditions may occur
      as a consequence of the trauma (e.g. head injury, burns).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <font size="+2"><b><i>Specific Culture and Age
      Features</i></b></font> 

      <p>Individuals who have recently emigrated for areas of
      considerable social unrest and civil conflict may have
      elevated rates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Such
      individuals may be especially reluctant to divulge
      experiences of torture and trauma due to their vulnerable
      political status. Specific assessments of traumatic
      experiences are needed for such individuals.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In younger children,
      distressing dreams of the event may, within several weeks,
      change into generalized nightmares of monsters, of rescuing
      others, or of threats to self or others. Young children
      usually do not have the sense that they are reliving the
      past; rather, the reliving of the trauma may occur through
      repetitive play (e.g.), a child who was involved in a serious
      automobile accident repeatedly reenacts car crashes with toy
      cars). Because it may be difficult for children to report
      diminished interest in significant activities and
      constriction of affect, these symptoms should be carefully
      evaluated with reports from parents, teachers, and other
      observers. In children, the sense of a foreshortened future
      may be evidenced by the belief that life will be too short to
      include becoming an adult. There may be &ldquo;omen
      formation&rdquo;-that is, belief in an ability to foresee
      future untoward events. Children may also exhibit various
      physical symptoms, such as stomachaches and headaches.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+2"><b><i>Prevalence</i></b></font></p>

      <p>Community-based studies reveal a lifetime prevalence for
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ranging from 1% to 14%, with
      the variability related to methods of ascertainment and the
      population sampled. Studies of at-risk individuals (e.g.,
      combat veterans, victims of volcanic eruptions or criminal
      violence) have yielded prevalence rates ranging from 3% to
      58%.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+2"><b><i>Course</i></b></font></p>

      <p>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder can occur at any age,
      including childhood. Symptoms usually begin within the first
      three months after the trauma, although there may be a delay
      of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. Frequently
      the disturbance initially meets criteria for Acute Stress
      Disorder (see p. 429) in the immediate aftermath of the
      trauma. The symptoms of the disorder and the relative
      predominance of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal
      symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms varies,
      with complete recovery occurring within three months in
      approximately half of cases, with many others having
      persisting symptoms for longer than 12 months after the
      trauma.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The severity,
      duration, and proximity of an individual's exposure to the
      traumatic event are the most important factors affecting the
      likelihood of developing this disorder. There is some
      evidence that social supports, family history, childhood
      experiences, personality variables, and preexisting mental
      disorders may influence the development of Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder. This disorder can develop in individuals
      without any predisposing conditions, particularly if the
      stressor is especially extreme.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+2"><b><i>Differential
      Diagnosis</i></b></font></p>

      <p>In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, the stressor must be of
      extreme (i.e., life-threatening) nature. In contrast, in
      <b>Adjustment Disorder</b>, the stressor can be of any
      severity. The diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder is appropriate
      both for situations in which the stressor does not meet the
      criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (or another
      specific mental disorder) and for situations in which the
      symptom pattern of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder occurs in
      response to a stressor that is not extreme (e.g., spouse
      leaving, being fired).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all
      psychopathology that occurs in individuals exposed to an
      extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. <b>Symptoms of avoidance,
      numbing, and increased arousal that are present before
      exposure to the stressor</b> do not meet criteria for the
      diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and require
      consideration of other diagnoses (e.g., a Mood Disorder or
      another Anxiety Disorder). Moreover, if the symptom response
      to pattern to the extreme stressor meets criteria for
      <b>another mental disorder</b> (e.g., Brief Psychotic
      Disorder, Conversion Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder),
      these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addition
      to, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Acute Stress
      Disorder</b> is distinguished from Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder because the symptom pattern in Acute Stress Disorder
      must occur within 4 weeks of the traumatic event and resolve
      within that 4-week period. If the symptoms persist for more
      than 1-months and meet criteria for Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder, the diagnosis is changed from Acute Stress Disorder
      to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      <b>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,</b> there are recurrent
      intrusive thoughts, but these are experienced as
      inappropriate and are not related to an experienced traumatic
      event. Flashbacks in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder must be
      distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other
      perceptual disturbances that may occur in <b>Schizophrenia,
      other Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorder with Psychotic
      Features, a delirium, Substance-Induced Disorders, and
      Psychotic Disorders Due to a General Medical
      Condition.</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Malingering</b>
      should be ruled out in those situations in which financial
      remuneration, benefit eligibility, and forensic
      determinations play a role.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b><i>Diagnostic criteria for 309.81 Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder</i></b></p>
<pre>
A.  The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the
      following were present:

      (1)   the person experienced witnessed, or was confronted with an
            event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious
            injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of others
      (2)   the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror.
            <b>Note:</b> In children, this may be expressed instead by disorganized
            or agitated behavior. 

B.  The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one (or more) of
      the following ways:

      (1)   recurrent and distressing recollections of the event, in-
            cluding images, thoughts, or perceptions. <b>Note:</b> In young chil-
            dren, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the
            trauma are expressed.
      (2)   Recurrent distressing dreams of the event. <b>Note:</b> in children, there
            may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.
      (3)   acting or feeling if the traumatic event were recurring (includes
            a sense of reliving the experience, illusions, hallucinations, and
            dissociative flashback episodes, including those that occur on
            awakening or when intoxicated). <b>Note:</b> In young children,
            trauma-specific reenactment may occur.
      (4)   Intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external
            cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event
      (5)   Physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues
            that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event.

C.  Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing
      of general responsiveness (not present before the trauma), as indicated
      by three or more of the following:
      (1)   efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with
            the trauma
      (2)   efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections
            of the trauma
      (3)   inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma
      (4)   markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities
      (5)   feeling of detachment or estrangement from others
      (6)   restricted range of affect. (e.g., unable to have loving feelings)
      (7)   Sense of a foreshortened future (e.g., does not expect to have a
            career, marriage, children, or a normal life span)

D.  Persistent symptoms of increased arousal (not present before the
      trauma), as indicated by two (or more) of the following:
      (1)   difficulty falling or staying asleep
      (2)   irritability or outbursts of anger
      (3)   difficulty concentrating 
      (4)   hypervigilance
      (5)   exaggerated startle response

E.  Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criteria B, C, and D) is more
      than one month.
F.  The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
      social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

<i>Specify</i> if:
    <b>Acute:</b>  if duration of symptoms is less than three months.
    <b>Chronic:</b> if duration of symptoms is three months or more

<i>Specify</i> if:
    <b>With Delayed Onset:</b>  if onset of symptoms is at least 6 months after the
        stressor
