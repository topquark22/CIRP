            <p class="t1"><font size="2">The debate about the
            advisability of circumcision in English-speaking
            countries has typically focused on the potential health
            factors. The position statements of committees from
            national medical organizations are expected to be
            evidence-based; however, the contentiousness of the
            ongoing debate suggests that other factors are
            involved. Various potential factors related to
            psychology, sociology, religion and culture may also
            underlie policy decisions. These factors could affect
            the values and attitudes of medical committee members,
            the process of evaluating the medical literature and
            the medical literature itself. Although medical
            professionals highly value rationality, it can be
            difficult to conduct a rational and objective
            evaluation of an emotional and controversial topic such
            as circumcision. A negotiated compromise between
            polarized committee factions could introduce additional
            psychosocial factors. These possibilities are
            speculative, not conclusive. It is recommended that an
            open discussion of psychosocial factors take place and
            that the potential biases of committee members be
            recognized.</font></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="init">T</span>he debate about
      the advisability of non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision in
      English-speaking countries typically has focused on potential
      health factors (e.g., prevention of infection and disease).
      The conflicting opinions and conclusions in the medical
      literature on circumcision, together with the tenacity with
      which advocates and critics of circumcision hold on to their
      viewpoints suggest that deep unrecognized or implicit
      psychosocial factors are involved (<a href="#n1">1</a>). The
      existence of these factors may influence decision-making on
      national circumcision policies. The present article contends
      that by taking these factors into account, the policy making
      process and the policies produced can be improved.</p>

      <p class="text2">This discussion focuses primarily on
      American circumcision policy, with pertinent discussion of
      other countries, because the United States has the highest
      nonreligious circumcision rate, the most contentious
      circumcision debate, the most detailed circumcision policy
      statement, and the most international influence. Circumcision
      practice in other countries has been introduced by contacts
      with Americans (<a href="#n2">2</a>), and American
      circumcision advocates promote circumcision to other
      countries (<a href="#n3">3</a>). In Canada, the circumcision
      policy statement is based on references that are about 75%
      American (<a href="#n4">4</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Policy makers do not change policies unless
      the pressure to change is greater than the pressure to
      maintain the status quo (<a href="#n5">5</a>). These
      pressures can include policy makers&rsquo; personal attitudes
      and opinions (internal emotional factors) and responses from
      the social environment (external social-political factors).
      Obviously, psychosocial factors cannot be examined to the
      degree that empirical data can be. Therefore, the present
      article explores only plausible options for identifying these
      factors, with support from psychosocial and medical
      literature, and statements by members of the American Academy
      of Pediatrics (AAP) Task Force on Circumcision.</p>

      <p class="section">INTERNAL EMOTIONAL FACTORS</p>

      <p class="text2">The AAP, similar to other English-speaking
      medical organisations, does not recommend circumcision but
      accepts it as a parental option (<a href="#n4">4</a>, <a
      href="#n6">6-10</a>). Circumcision advocates believe that
      &lsquo;substantial medical evidence&rsquo; favours their view
      and, because they haven't received the endorsement of
      circumcision they want from the AAP, they accuse that body of
      &lsquo;anticircumcision bias&rsquo; (<a href="#n11">11</a>).
      Circumcision advocates have never explained why policy-makers
      would have an &lsquo;anticircumcision bias.&rsquo;
      Circumcision advocates also have not addressed the fact that
      there are people who would be expected to have personal,
      religious, and professional reasons for supporting
      circumcision who are against the practice (e.g., some
      circumcised men, Jews, and doctors who stopped performing
      nontherapeutic neonatal circumcisions).</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, there are various factors
      that may contribute to or suggest a bias in favour of
      circumcision. A survey of randomly selected primary care
      physicians showed that circumcision was more often supported
      by doctors who were older, male, and circumcised (<a
      href="#n12">12</a>). Minimising evidence of harm and using
      medical claims to defend circumcision when that evidence is
      conflicting at best, could be some of the unconscious ways
      for some male physicians to avoid the emotional discomfort of
      questioning their own circumcision (<a href="#n13">13</a>).
      (Of note, the AAP Task Force on Circumcision was composed of
      five men and two women.)</p>

      <p class="text2">Studies also indicate that protecting
      self-esteem sometimes takes priority over being accurate or
      correct, and potentially threatening information may be
      reinterpreted or dismissed, sometimes unconsciously, as a
      result (<a href="#n14">14</a>, <a href="#n15">15</a>). Other
      research has demonstrated that people will continue an
      endeavour once they have invested time and effort (<a
      href="#n16">16</a>). To avoid inconsistency between beliefs
      and experience (i.e., cognitive dissonance), beliefs about
      circumcision tend to be aligned with the experience of
      performing circumcisions (<a href="#n17">17</a>). For
      physicians who have performed hundreds or thousands of
      circumcisions (or have chosen circumcision for their own
      son), the possible use of such psychological defence
      mechanisms to deny some of the evidence against circumcision
      could serve, in part, to protect their self-esteem, which
      could be adversely affected by the conscious recognition that
      circumcision may harm infants. A few members of the AAP Task
      Force on Circumcision have routinely performed circumcisions,
      and, consistent with the above psychosocial research, those
      members also tended to be the ones who advocated circumcision
      (<a href="#n18">18</a>). This relationship suggests that the
      attitudes about circumcision of at least some committee
      members were already set at the start of the policy review,
      and their attitudes may have been unaffected by what they
      found in the literature.</p>

      <p class="section">EXTERNAL SOCIAL-POLITICAL FACTORS</p>

      <p class="text2">Social influence can alter scientific
      inquiry. For example, if circumcision were introduced today,
      proponents would have the burden of proving that it is safe
      and effective. Although policy committees agree that this
      burden has not been satisfied, circumcision is evaluated as a
      long-standing practice and, as such, it is viewed differently
      than a new practice. Due to social and professional
      entrenchment, the burden of proof has shifted to the
      shoulders of critics.</p>

      <p class="text2">The ubiquity of circumcision in America may
      influence which questions are researched and which are
      ignored in American medical circumcision literature. Most
      American studies that assess the advisability of circumcision
      focus on the search for a benefit. Accordingly, one AAP Task
      Force on Circumcision member stated that the committee was
      formed &ldquo;to determine if there was scientific evidence
      to justify circumcision&rdquo; (<a href="#n18">18</a>). The
      answer is limited by the assumption inherent in the statement
      of the problem. Although claims of benefits generally do not
      withstand the scrutiny of policy committees, their continued
      publication over the years has led to medical myths believed
      by professionals and the public (<a href="#n19">19</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Policy statements from medical organisations
      in other English-speaking countries are generally more
      critical of circumcision, but they still tolerate it. Given
      the lack of proven safety and effectiveness, the principle of
      &lsquo;first, do no harm,&rsquo; and the priority of the
      patient&rsquo;s welfare over parental requests, why have
      these organizations not published stronger statements
      opposing circumcision? The answer may be related to the fact
      that in public discussions about circumcision in Canada and
      Britain, religious groups were the only ones to defend the
      practice (<a href="#n20">20-22</a>). Some Europeans believe
      that the reluctance to criticize circumcision is due to fear
      of being accused of religious intolerance (<a
      href="#n23">23</a>). This type of concern may have been
      involved when an investigation of circumcision by Australian
      authorities was halted after Jewish protest (<a
      href="#n24">24</a>). Furthermore, in response to an inquiry
      about discouraging nontherapeutic circumcision, a
      representative of the United States Department of Health and
      Human Services stated that &ldquo;it is not proper for our
      Government to adopt a policy that is directly or indirectly
      critical of a religious practice&rdquo; (L. Mahoney, personal
      communication, March 8, 1994).</p>

      <p class="text2">Social factors may also be present and
      operating within the AAP Task Force on Circumcision itself.
      In a deposition related to a circumcision lawsuit, a member
      of the AAP Task Force on Circumcision admitted that the task
      force was divided on the question of the advisability of
      circumcision (<a href="#n18">18</a>). There are also
      indications of conflict from previous task forces. In the
      year following the publication of the 1989 position statement
      (<a href="#n25">25</a>), one of the dissenting members of
      that task force published a review article with a different
      conclusion (<a href="#n26">26</a>). In an unusual disclosure,
      the chair of the 1975 task force revealed that the
      &ldquo;committee was sharply divided in its opinions, and the
      resulting statement was a compromise&rdquo; (<a
      href="#n27">27</a>). This documentation is the most direct
      evidence that AAP circumcision policy statements have
      required negotiation and compromise, introducing additional
      psychosocial factors and making the circumcision policy less
      evidence-based.</p>

      <p class="text2">The AAP Task Force on Circumcision&rsquo;s
      attitude toward recently published reports on different
      aspects of circumcision is not known because these reports
      were published after the AAP policy was published (<a
      href="#n28">28-43</a>). However, subsequent position
      statements by several other medical organizations omitted
      discussion of some or all of this literature. Specifically,
      the American Medical Association (<a href="#n7">7</a>) and
      the Canadian Paediatric Society (<a href="#n4">4</a>) did not
      mention the sexual, psychological, human rights, and legal
      aspects of circumcision. The Royal Australasian College of
      Physicians&rsquo; policy briefly mentions psychological
      trauma and human rights, and discusses legal issues with no
      mention of sexual issues (<a href="#n8">8</a>). The British
      Medical Association&rsquo;s policy briefly mentions sexual
      and psychological issues, and discusses legal and human
      rights issues (<a href="#n9">9</a>).</p>

      <p class="section">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</p>

      <p class="text2">Although medical committee members highly
      value rationality, a rational and objective evaluation of an
      emotional and controversial topic like circumcision can be
      difficult. It is suggested that the potential psychological
      and social factors surrounding the practice of circumcision
      could affect the values and attitudes of circumcision policy
      committee members, the attitude toward evaluating the
      circumcision literature, and the publishing of circumcision
      literature itself. If the members are polarized, the process
      of negotiating to arrive at a consensus statement could
      introduce additional psychosocial factors that could affect
      the final policy. These possibilities are speculative, not
      conclusive.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are examples of authorities in
      English-speaking countries who appear to allow religious
      circumcision practice to inhibit them from taking a more
      progressive position on this issue. This tendency seems to
      result in a policy stance that is less evidence-based.
      Sensitivity to confronting the religious issue is
      understandable, but it may undermine the core values (e.g.,
      the health of the patient is paramount) and ethics (e.g.,
      first, do no harm) that drive medical decision-making. Policy
      makers could respond to accusations of religious intolerance
      rationally and compassionately rather than allow the fear of
      such accusations to hinder policy development (<a
      href="#n44">44</a>). Other recommendations for improving
      circumcision policy-making include acknowledging any
      conflicts, paying focused attention to psychosocial factors,
      and expanding professional and public discussion.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dealing with psychosocial factors can start
      with recognizing the potential bias of committee members.
      Conflict of interest is not just financial. Perhaps future
      candidates for membership in circumcision policy committees
      should disclose their circumcision status (previously
      suggested [<a href="#n45">45</a>]), number of circumcisions
      performed, circumcision status of any male children, and
      religious or ethnic background. Disclosure of this
      information would help in the assessment of the credibility
      of the committee and its work. Members of such committees
      should be held to at least the same standard as peer
      reviewers. As stated by the International Committee of
      Medical Journal Editors, &ldquo;any conflicts of interest
      that could bias their opinions&rdquo; should be disclosed,
      and reviewers &ldquo;should disqualify themselves from
      reviewing specific manuscripts if they believe it to be
      appropriate&rdquo; (<a href="#n46">46</a>). Similarly, those
      responsible for selecting members of circumcision policy
      committees should be aware of potential members' conflicts of
      interest to determine if a member should be disqualified.
      Including more women, to minimize the influence of internal
      emotional factors, and a member with psychosocial training
      and background could also help deliberations. Policy
      statements from other fields, such as psychology, sociology,
      anthropology, and ethics could expand perspectives and
      understanding.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the meantime, medical organizations
      should be aware of the potential legal implications
      associated with a flawed policy. A law journal article (<a
      href="#n47">47</a>) claimed that the failure to act in a
      scientifically responsible manner could make a medical
      society liable for trade association misconduct connected
      with publishing negligent recommendations on
      circumcision.</p>
