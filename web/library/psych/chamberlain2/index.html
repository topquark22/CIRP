  <P align="justify"><I><B>David B. Chamberlain</B> is a California psychologist born in 
  Connecticut in 1928, educated at <A HREF="http://www.rmc.edu/">Randolph-Macon College</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu/">Washington State University</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</A>. His curiosity about the capacity of 
  prenates and newborns was stimulated by clients having vivid early recall

  effort leading to publication of over thirty professional papers and the 
  popular book, Babies Remember Birth, first published in 1988, then paperback 
  in 1990, currently available in six languages. David assisted in organizing 
  the First International Congress on Pre- and Perinatal Psychology, held in

  <P><B>Introduction</B> 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babies are a source of knowledge about ourselves, a revelation of human 
  nature, and babies can be "bellwethers." Bellwether is a term used by 
  shepherds to designate the lead sheep, the one who wears a bell. I ask you to 
  think about how babies can lead us and what they can teach us. This reverses 
  the usual idea that they should follow and learn from us. But think about it: 
  Would this violent world be better off if we tried to be more like them or if 
  they tried to be more like us? 
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do well to watch babies closely. They are like a mirror we can hold up 
  to discover ourselves as fully sentient, fully conscious beings. Babies can 
  also serve (if we let them) as an "Early Warning System" for humankind. This 
  is hazardous duty for babies, teaching us, warning us of danger. In this 
  respect, they are like the beautiful, singing canaries that coal miners once 
  took into the bowels of the earth to warn them of deadly gasses. Babies have 
  several important things to teach us. 
  <P><B>1. Babies are teaching us the origins of violence</B> 
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, the prevailing scientific habit has been to treat the 
  earliest period of human development--from conception to birth--as an 
  insensitive, unconscious, period of physical growth. Babies are teaching us 
  quite the opposite: they are highly sensitive, reactive, and impressionable 
  participants throughout gestation and birth. However, this is still the 
  minority view in both medicine and psychology. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belief which has blocked understanding for a hundred years is the idea that no intelligence is possible and no learning or memory can occur until 
  after birth, when the construction of the brain is more advanced. If this were 
  true, it would follow that babies cannot care about anything, know anything, 
  or learn anything--certainly nothing about love and violence. The false idea 
  that prenates cannot learn is still given credence in academic circles, 
  permeates the fundamental assumptions of developmental psychology, obstetrics 
  and neonatology, still casts a shadow over nursing, midwifery, and childbirth 
  education, and still confuses each new generation of pregnant parents. The 
  mistaken belief that babies are not sentient is the main reason why scholars 
  rarely look for the roots of violence in the earliest human experiences. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potentially, babies have a lot to tell us and they are busy communicating with the psychologists, obstetricians, neonatologists, nurses, midwives, 
  childbirth educators, and parents who will listen to them. Babies have been 
  demonstrating awareness, vulnerability to influence, and intelligence (e.g., 
  Verny &amp; Kelly, 1986, Klaus &amp; Klaus, 1985, Chamberlain, 1987, 1990, 
  1992, 1994). For two decades we have had proof that full-term newborns, 
  prematurely born babies, and even babies in utero are capable of classical 
  conditioning and habituation (e.g., Rovee-Collier &amp; Lipsitt, 1982, Leader 
  et al, 1982). More recently, with refinements in both learning theory and 
  experimental methodology, newborns have demonstrated tactile, auditory, and 
  olfactory learning, imitation learning, and verbal learning (e.g., Van de 
  Carr, 1992, Busnel et al, 1992, Meltzoff &amp; Moore, 1977, Ungerer et al, 
  1978, and Balogh &amp; Porter, 1986). Recognition learning of musical 
  passages, stories, voices, native language sounds and even children's rhymes 
  have been shown at birth and during intra-uterine life (DeCasper &amp; Fifer, 
  1980, Moon, Cooper, &amp; Fifer, 1993). You may not be familiar with the 
  latest in the series of important experiments by Anthony DeCasper and 
  colleagues, where French mothers repeated a child's rhyme three times a day 
  from week 33 to 37 gestational age. After four weeks of daily rhymes, babies 
  recognized the rhyme they had heard but showed no recognition of a different 
  rhyme (DeCasper et al, 1994). 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the evidence for learning in utero and at birth is now overwhelming, 
  we can assert that babies are capable of learning violence both before and 
  during birth. 
  <P><B>2. Babies are teaching us they are no strangers to violence in the 
  womb</B> 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pause a moment to clarify definitions of violence and trauma. The 
  dictionary says simply that trauma is a body injury produced by violence. In 
  the psychiatric domain, trauma is a shocking experience which has a lasting 
  effect on mental life. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babies are exquisitely sensitive to their surroundings in the womb. Between   10 and 15 weeks, their mothers' cough or laugh will get most fetuses moving 
  within seconds (Tajani and Ianniruberto, 1990). Babies do not live in a 
  fortress but in a mother. If she is assaulted, babies will learn about 
  violence; if she is generously loved, babies will learn about love. A fetus 
  whose mother received an electric shock while she was ironing sat bolt upright 
  and immobile in the womb for two days--long after the mother had recovered. 
  Inez Correia (1994) has measured the effect on the fetus of a mother viewing 
  brief portions of a violent movie. Fetuses were upset along with the mother. 
  They share the world of emotion. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will perhaps recall that Sontag and Wallace back in 1934, using a   primitive apparatus to measure heart and respiratory activity in the mother 
  and fetus, discovered that when a pregnant patient was persued by a psychotic 
  husband, the baby was alarmed right along with the mother. Recently, a news 
  story in California brought to public attention the background of Robert 
  Harris who was executed in the gas chamber by the State of California. Harris 
  was born three months early after his mother was kicked brutally in the 
  abdomen by her angry husband and began hemorrhaging. This was only the first 
  of many violent experiences this murderer-in-the-making suffered at the hands 
  of his mother and father, a violence he later turned on innocent animals and 
  people. At age 25, he shot two teenagers point blank, laughed at them after he 
  pulled the trigger, and calmly ate the hamburgers they had just bought for 
  lunch. We could not find a more dramatic example of a life that began and 
  ended in violence. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that amniocentesis is common, babies in the womb frequently confront a needle entering their private territory. Studies show they react fearfully, 
  defensively, and sometimes aggressively (Ianniruberto and Tajani, 1981). This 
  was brought to my attention again when an acquaintance told us of her 
  experience during amniocentesis. Her husband, the doctor, and the ultrasound 
  technician all saw little Claire bat the side of the needle! The technician 
  said, "Take it out!" When the doctor reinserted the needle, the fetus again 
  attacked it , forcing the doctor to remove the needle. The husband and doctor 
  were in a nervous sweat. The doctor said he had never before seen a baby bat a 
  needle. The parents had an instant lesson in prenatal psychology: they had no 
  idea that a baby this age could sense the intrusion of a needle (and with 
  eyelids fused), have such strong feelings and take such effective action. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultrasound is revealing the hidden life of twins in utero. These pictures 
  demolish the old theory that social relationships begin after birth. By 20 
  weeks, twins manifest a range of behaviors from affectionate to aggressive. 
  Several observers have reported twins hitting each other. At 24 weeks g.a., 
  monoamniotic twins were filmed having a boxing match with repeated rounds of a 
  few minutes each. Rest periods separated rounds when one would strike with his 
  hand and the other would strike back. (Ianniruberto &amp; Tajani, 1981). They 
  also filmed twins who were in different amniotic sacs. These brothers hit each 
  other by pushing the dividing membrane. Obviously, we must enlarge our 
  understanding of the roots of violence. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the violence which takes place in utero is the silent, invisible  type: the injuries cannot be discovered until much later. Babies are trying to 
  alert us to this damage but we are slow in learning. Included in this category 
  are (1) psychic damages conveyed through attitude, and (2) brain damage 
  inflicted through neglect. Bustan and Coker (1994) have uncovered the lethal 
  consequences of rejection. In a cohort of 8,000 pregnant women, divided into 
  those who wanted and those who did not want the pregnancy, the unwanted were 
  2.4 times more likely to die within the first month of life. In a 
  cross-cultural study of planned and unplanned babies in the U.S. and Greece, 
  the planned (and welcomed) babies were already showing higher levels of 
  cognitive processing and greater attachment to their mothers at three months 
  of age than the unplanned babies (Row &amp; Drivas, 1993). This is especially 
  significant considering that roughly half of the pregnancies in the U.S. are 
  unplanned. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies of violent criminals have revealed they often have poorly functioning brains. These poorly-built brains were constructed under adverse 
  conditions during pregnancy. Research psychologist Adrian Raine finds enough 
  evidence to justify labeling criminal behavior a clinical disorder resulting 
  from structural and metabolic problems in the prefrontal area, as well as from 
  other brain injuries and dysfunctions (Raine, 1993; Raine et al, 1994). 
  Psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis has studied juveniles on death row and found a 
  pattern of neurological impairment, paranoid misperception, hypervigilence, 
  and low IQ's among these children (Lewis et al, 1988). Doctors Raine and Lewis 
  fully appreciate that a combination of factors ultimately determines violent 
  criminal behavior, but we must take note that brain-based origins of violence 
  begin in the prenatal period. Having a suboptimal brain means that life is 
  more difficult, frustration is never ending, and self-control is marginal. 
  This can lead to misery, crime, and even death--all from prenatal causes. 
  Recent news from Children's Hospital, Boston adds to our understanding of 
  SIDS. Using positron emission tomography brain scanning, researchers 
  discovered that SIDS babies have a deficit in the "CO<font size="2"><SUB>2</SUB></font> detection system." A 
  fully functioning brain wakes a baby when the CO<font size="2"><SUB>2</SUB></font> gets too high. If this 
  proves true, we are looking at another violent consequence of impaired brain 
  growth in utero. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A likely cause of abnormal brain growth is the ingestion of drugs and chemicals, legitimate or illegitimate. These substances can cause silent, 
  invisible damage. Dangers of exposure to alcohol in utero is well known. The 
  list of destructive effects now includes evidence for slowed cognitive 
  activity in infancy (S. Jacobson et al, 1993). Prenatal exposure to the 
  invisible environmental toxin PCB also compromises cognition: tests show less 
  efficient visual discrimination and poorer short-term memory (J. Jacobson et 
  al, 1992). Epidemiologists now think that breast cancer may originate in utero 
  from excessive exposure to estrogen (Trichopoulos, 1990; Ekbom et al, 1992). 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another impediment to normal growth may be the frequent use of ultrasound. 
  In a randomized controlled trial involving 1400 women in Western Australia, 
  women who had ultrasound five times during pregnancy gave birth to babies with 
  lower birth weight than women who had ultrasound only once (Newnham et al, 
  1993). Low birth weight reflects suboptimal brain growth, which brings us back 
  to our starting point: having a poorly constructed brain may lead to problems 
  of cognition and self-control which increases the likelihood of violence and 
  crime. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety of obstetrical anesthetics has been a concern over several decades. Psychologist Yvonne Brackbill began reviewing the literature in 1979 
  showing the effects of maternal anesthetics on infants (Brackbill, 1979; 
  Brackbill, McManus, &amp; Woodward, 1985). A seven-year study of over 3,000 
  babies showed long-lasting effects on their behavior and muscular functions. 
  Many children born to mothers given drugs were slow to start sitting, 
  standing, and walking. By age seven, some of these children were lagging in 
  language learning skills of perception, memory, and judgement. In Sweden, 
  Bertil Jacobson and colleagues studied the birth experiences of adult addicts 
  and found a connection between obstetric pain medication and eventual 
  amphetamine addiction (Jacobson et al, 1988). Opiate addiction was linked with 
  the use of opiates, barbiturates, and nitrous oxide at birth (Jacobson et al, 
  1990). More recently, a study of epidural anesthesia via continuous infusion 
  of bupivacaine and fantanyl was found to upset newborn visual habituation as 
  well as immediate novelty preference (Brumitt, 1994). 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirmiran and Swaab (1992), of the Netherlands Institute for Brain Research point to damage to the developing brain from pharmaceuticals given to mothers 
  in the third trimester. They report that 80% of pregnant and lactating women 
  are given drugs and warn that the type of brain damage which comes of this is 
  not "grossly evident," but causes permanent microscopic and biochemical 
  alterations in the formation of neurones, their migration, formation of 
  neurites, synapses, transmitters, receptors, and behavioral states. They say 
  what appears to be a structurally "normal" brain is functionally handicapped. 
  <P><B>3. Babies tell us that even "normal" birth is violent</B> 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babies communicate this with their strong voices, their anguished facial expressions, and by vigorous movements of arms and legs. Are they not famous 
  for crying fiercely at birth? Both parents and professionals expect this, 
  smile nervously, and call it "healthy." Birth cries are not yet taken 
  seriously, although most of them are clearly a reaction to violence. Screaming 
  babies tell us that something is wrong. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own attention was drawn to birth trauma by clients remembering birth in hypnosis (Chamberlain, 1990). The great majority (but not all) were actively 
  protesting inappropriate conditions or actions at the time of birth. With 
  ringing clarity they identified what was wrong: the pressure of forceps on 
  their heads, cold rooms, bright lights, needle injections, repeated heel jabs 
  for blood, stinging or blurring eye medicine, being suspended by their feet, 
  hasty cutting of the umbilical cord, separating them from their mother, and 
  isolating them in nurseries. Their cries were cries of pain and protest. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many birth professionals have changed their attitude about infant 
  cries, the prevailing practice is to tolerate crying and to continue painful 
  routines regardless of crying. There is no goal of preventing crying. As might 
  be expected, the crying continues. A psychological approach would ask why a 
  baby is crying, and, would work to eliminate the possible causes. French 
  obstetrician Frederick Leboyer in Birth Without Violence (1975) led us in that 
  direction by comparing anguished baby faces with blissful faces. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When neonates cry intensely and are impossible to console, pediatricians often become resigned and counsel parents to accept colic as a difficult 
  developmental phase. A psychological approach, such as that of William Emerson 
  and Raymond Castellino, is to identify what past trauma the baby is expressing 
  and work to resolve it. In this form of therapy, body language and cry 
  language is respected as genuine and helpful communication. Psychologist 
  Aletha Solter (1984, 1995) sees colicky crying as meaningful and potentially 
  therapeutic and teaches parents how to facilitate this. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most violent routines associated with hospital birth in the 20th Century is the practice of male <B>circumcision</B>, a surgical alteration of the 
  penis, in the past always performed without anesthetic, and at the present 
  frequently performed without anesthetics. In my view, this physical and 
  psychic trauma cannot possibly be justified for any of the "medical" reasons 
  which have been proposed over the last hundred years. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving that circumcision is, in fact, a trauma with serious consequences should not be that difficult. First of all, a boy is permanently deprived of a 
  functional part of his sexual anatomy. Is this not a serious long-term 
  consequence? In my experience with clients, circumcision has sometimes been 
  the origin of deep distrust between mother and son, or has left the victim 
  with an unconscious impression there is something wrong with his penis. Harder 
  to prove, but a hypothesis we must consider in this violent age, is that this 
  sexual trauma contributes to sexual violence. Note well: prior to the 
  operation, the penis is swabbed--often by a nurse--with disinfectant, creating 
  an erection; then the penis is cut! Marilyn Milos states the problem 
  concisely: "Circumcision is where sex and violence meet for the first time." 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New research by doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has documented that circumcised boys have a more extreme response to routine 
  injections of vaccine at 4 or 6 months of age than do boys who are intact 
  (<A HREF="/library/pain/taddio/">Taddio et al</A>, 1995). The babies who were circumcised showed more signs of 
  pain and cried longer than intact boys, suggesting a long-term effect. These 
  pediatricians recommend anesthesia for circumcision. However, a survey of 
  primary physicians in that area, who performed circumcisions, revealed that 
  only half used any form of anesthesia. Twelve percent still believed babies do 
  not feel pain, and 35% believed babies do not remember it (<A HREF="/library/pain/wellington/">Wellington &amp; 
  Rieder</A>, 1993). In the U.S., 60% of male newborns are still being circed, 
  usually with no concern about their pain. Is this not a seedbed for violence 
  in our society? 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research based on over 4,200 consecutive births in Copenhagen found that birth complications like use of forceps, breech delivery, cord prolapse, 
  pre-eclampsia and long labor, when combined with maternal rejection and 
  extended separations in the first year, predispose the victims toward violent 
  crime (Raine, Brennan and Mednick, 1994). Although only 4.5% of the sample had 
  both risk factors, this small group accounted for 18% of all the violent 
  crimes perpetrated by these 4200 people. Earlier studies also found links 
  between obstetric complications and behavior disorders in children 
  (Pasamanick, 1956), perinatal trauma and juvenile delinquency (Lewis et al, 
  1979), and perinatal complications and criminality (Litt, 1971). More 
  recently, Kandel and Mednick (1991) found a significant correlation between 
  delivery complications (e.g., eclampsia, forceps, ruptured uterus and cord 
  prolapse) and adolescent and adult violent offending. The association was 
  particularly strong for a small group of violent recidivists. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, this alarming evidence suggests that babies born in the era 
  of hospital obstetrics from 1939 to present were born in violence, baptised by 
  violence. Neither medicine nor psychology understood the formative influence 
  of early pain. 
  <P><B>4. Babies tell us the premature nursery is a theatre of violence</B> 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babies arriving too early find themselves in a surreal environment of needles, lights, incubators, and monitors designed for physical life support, 
  but not for emotional life support. When these special nurseries were designed 
  in 1967, babies were not expected to have thoughts, feelings, or perception of 
  pain. Virtually everything done to children in NICU's is painful: breathing 
  tubes, suction tubes, feeding tubes going down the throat, monitor electrodes 
  fastened to the skin, intravenous punctures, heel lancing, and endless 
  interruptions and alarms. Over the last 25 years, the number of premature 
  births has risen to over 10%. Obstetrician David Cheek calls it "the tragedy 
  of premature birth" (Cheek, 1994). 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this theatre of violence, babies learn many lessons. Edward Harrison, who entered the NICU at 29 weeks g.a., learned to fear the sound and sight of 
  adhesive tape and bandages. At age 15, he was still carrying in his 
  unconscious mind the experience of having large patches of skin accidently 
  ripped from his abdomen and chest when monitor pads and tape were removed. He 
  was also phobic about doctors, medical procedures, and hospitals. He would 
  become sick at the sight of the hospital, and could not go for necessary 
  medical care without sedation. Edward was shunted for hydrocephalus, while 
  paralyzed with curare. Although he could not move, cry, or react in any way, 
  he could see, hear, and feel as large incisions were cut in his scalp, neck, 
  and abdomen, as a hole was drilled in his skull, as a tube was inserted into 
  the center of his brain, then pushed down under the skin of his neck, chest, 
  and abdomen and implanted deep in his abdominal cavity. At fifteen, he still 
  will not allow anyone to touch his head, his neck, or his abdomen. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward's experience was not unique. Numerous painful surgeries were routinely done on premature babies without benefit of pain-killing anesthetic, 
  including the most common surgery, PDA, thorocotomy for ligation of patent 
  arteriosus. Necessary for 50% of infants born under 33 weeks g.a. or weighing 
  less than 1500 g., this major operation involves cutting holes in both sides 
  of the neck, another in the right side of the chest, an incision from the 
  breastbone around to the backbone, prying the ribs apart, and tying off an 
  extra artery near the heart. In addition, the left lung must be retracted, and 
  a hole must be cut for a chest tube. All this took an hour and a half, during 
  which time the baby was left completely conscious of pain, and flooded with 
  terror. As impossible as it seems, this was standard practice in neonatal 
  medicine from the discovery of ether in 1846 until about 1986. For 140 years, 
  ether anesthesia was reserved for certain classes of children and adults, but 
  not for babies (Pernick, 1985). 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could the babies tell us about this experience? Being paralyzed, they could not use body language in the usual way. Doctors were convinced the mind 
  was not working and the experience could mean nothing. In reaction to surgery 
  without anesthesia, some babies went into a trance or fell unconscious during 
  or after their ordeals. Doctors said they fell asleep and were fine. However, 
  many babies died, not immediately, but from shock following surgery. Death was 
  their message, like the message of the canaries brought into the mines. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1986, many doctors have changed their minds about infant surgery without anesthesia, and medical societies have generally made new committments 
  to give babies the same consideration in regard to pain control as they do 
  other patients. If this new path is followed, the total number of 
  pain-traumatized babies could diminish each year. Meanwhile, no one really 
  knows what the consequences to society will be for inflicting so much pain on 
  so many premature babies. Massive pain makes us desperate and irrational, 
  willing to fight and take extreme risks. Pain feeds rage. 
  <P align="justify">NICU alumni are growing up: the very first graduates are now approaching 
  age 30. Their ranks are constantly swelling as those from about 700 nurseries 
  join them. If the percentage of premature babies holds around 10%, it means we 
  are adding about 400,000 per year. We should carefully assess the long-term 
  consequences of such a vast social experiment. Yet, I am not aware of any 
  studies specifically focused on NICU trauma, violent behavior, and crime in 
  this group. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing acceptance of newborn pain perception, the debate now shifts to whether the fetus can perceive pain. That they do is shown by a team 
  of London neonatologists who found that during intrauterine needling, the 
  fetus mounts a full plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin stress response 
  indicative of pain (Giannakoupoulos et al, 1994). Their study of 46 fetuses 
  during intrauterine blood transfusions revealed an increase of 590% of 
  b-endorphin and 183% increase of cortisol after ten minutes of the invasive 
  fetal surgery. Even the youngest premies showed a strong response. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In special care nurseries, pain and suffering are being reduced by several promising trends: a new acceptance of the baby's intelligence and capacity 
  (e.g., Thoman and Ingersoll, 1989); introduction of pleasurable tactile 
  interactions (Field, 1990; Adamson-Macedo and Attree, 1994); a new treatment 
  approach called "individualized developmental care" which involves intensive 
  listening and involvement with individual babies (Als, et al, 1994); and by 
  new cribs and equipment designed to mimic the sound and movement of the 
  uterine environment (Gatts, Winchester, and Fiske 1992). If neonatology 
  continues to incorporate this kind of psychology, the current violence of the 
  special care nursery may diminish--and with it some portion of societal 
  violence which we have hardly begun to measure. Whatever happens in future 
  nurseries, we must understand that the experience of prematurity is formative 
  in its impact. For example, Stiefel and colleagues (1987) found that preterm 
  babies studied at 12 and 18 months of age show greater sensitivity to even low 
  levels of stress and show less ability to modulate distress once aroused. They 
  do not relate to toys in the same way as full-term (fully-built) babies do. 
  Their way of reacting to life carries a greater potential for emotional 
  imbalance and loss of control--because they were prematurely born. 
  <P><B>5. Babies know the destructive impact of rejection and separation</B> 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the pace-setting work of pediatricians Klaus and Kennell on maternal-infant bonding in 1976, attention has been repeatedly drawn to the 
  destructive effects of untimely separations. In animal studies, the profound 
  effects of separation in the post-partum period have been documented by Harlow 
  (1958) and by Prescott (1971; Prescott, 1995). Separation is both a physical 
  and emotional experience for a baby and can begin anytime in the womb or after 
  birth. Whenever it occurs, it is a stroke of violence. Few things can compare 
  with the oneness between mother and baby during gestation. The connections are 
  total and holistic, embracing mind, emotion, and sensation. In this intimate 
  world, babies know when they are not wanted, and if rejection persists, the 
  harm worsens. This was thoroughly documented by the landmark study that 
  followed several cohorts of unwanted babies in Finland, Sweden, and the former 
  Czeckoslovakia over a period of thirty years (David et al, 1988). The mothers, 
  repeatedly denied abortions, were forced to bear and raise children they did 
  not want. As their children's lives unfolded (in comparison with matched 
  control subjects) they proved to be at greater risk for social and psychiatric 
  problems, and were more often delinquent. In the Prague cohort, unwanted 
  children had almost three times the risk of showing up in the Criminal 
  Register. This finding underscores the data of Raine, Brennan, and Mednick 
  (1994) that rejection and post-partum separation paves the road to criminal 
  violence. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evidence is also coherent with the thesis of Ken Magid (1987) that children with no conscience are those who never had a close relationship with 
  anyone. He typically finds in the family histories of psychopathic killers 
  that they never had an affectionate, supportive relationship with anyone at 
  the beginning of their lives. They started life unattached and grew up unable 
  to follow rules or form lasting relationships. Without guilt, empathy or 
  trust, their actions are callous and cruel; they kill without caring. We say 
  they are suffering from "antisocial personality disorder." 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some clinical data indicate how early the vulnerability to rejection can be felt, though not necessarily on a conscious level. Psychologist Andrew Feldmar 
  (1974) encountered four adolescents who were repeatedly attempting suicide at 
  the same time each year. When he had put all the facts together, he learned 
  from their mothers that their suicidal compulsion was occuring each year 
  around the time their mothers had tried to abort them--something the 
  adolescent children had never consciously known. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same fetal sensitivity shown by these self-destructive youth is put to positive use in programs of prenatal stimulation. In every program which has 
  been empirically tested, the efforts of parents to communicate love and 
  welcome to their babies in the womb has been crowned with success. A prominent 
  benefit has been the creation of strong mutual parent-child relationships (Van 
  de Carr and Lehrer, 1988; Manrique, 1993, 1994; Panthuraamphorn, 1993). In the 
  prenatal/perinatal era, anger and violence are natural products of rejection 
  and separation; security and peace are the natural products of communication 
  and love. 
  <P><B>6. Babies born smiling teach us something we do not understand</B> 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A client told me about his experience in the delivery room when his son was born. He and his wife had prepared well for this great event, and the birth 
  was smooth. The baby made not one cry and seemed perfectly content. To this 
  father's surprise, however, the obstetrician proceded to circumcise the baby, 
  whereupon the baby let out screams of anguish! Not one cry from the birth, but 
  a howling protest about circumcision. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early psychological research on birth left us with the impression that birth was always violent and painful for babies. Certainly, birth can be 
  painful, but what about those contented babies? What are they telling us? 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obstetrician Frederick Leboyer (1975) was one of the first to look 
  seriously at newborn faces and recognize what they were saying. He got the 
  message and started to rearrange obstetrical practices to suit the babies. 
  This was a stroke of genius. Why hadn't anyone thought of this before? You are 
  familiar with how he dimmed the lights, moved the baby more slowly and gently, 
  created a hushed atmosphere, left the cord intact, put baby on the mother, and 
  waited while the baby settled down. Then he provided bath water near womb 
  temperature, and voila! Faces changed from tortured and irritated to something 
  more composed and--occasionally--smiles! This was a major achievement, 
  although no one could claim that every baby treated in this manner was born in 
  bliss. Birth without violence became a new thoughtform. Unfortunately, 
  Leboyer's good influence has declined, due in part to a randomized clinical 
  trial in Canada which declared the "Leboyer approach had no advantage" over 
  conventional delivery (Nelson, et al, 1980). I believe the obstetrical 
  measures used in this study failed to appreciate the importance of 
  psychologica factors and their long-term implications for mothers and babies. 
  <P align="justify">Reacting to the faces in Leboyer's book, noted Swedish obstetrician John 
  Lind was surprised to see so much anguish. Lind had done thousands of 
  deliveries in Stockholm, but he decided to take a series of photos of newborn 
  faces there. After collecting 130, he announced that instead of anxiety or 
  pain, baby faces expressed great curiosity and often, great expectations 
  (Lind, 1978). These are rare and important data, speaking volumes about the 
  positive atmosphere for birthing in Sweden. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world record for happy newborns probably belongs to Thailand, where smiling is more a tradition than a surprise. In Thailand the obstetrician who 
  holds the record for the greatest number of smiling babies is Chairat 
  Panthuraamphorn. With inspiration from obstetrician and prenatal bonding 
  pioneer Rene Van de Carr, Panthuraamphorn designed an experimental program of 
  prenatal stimulation for parents in his hospital in Bankok (Panthuraamphorn, 
  1993). From about 20 weeks gestational age, mothers were encouraged to take 
  time each day for a bath, to sit in a rocking chair, relax, look at a 
  beautiful picture and listen to classical Thai music. Panthuraamphorn 
  recommended abdominal massage three times a week, along with breathing 
  exercises, visualization of birth and bonding, and engaged experimental 
  subjects in a multi-sensory program of speaking and singing to the child, 
  playing a game with a bell, and other pleasant interactions. When the babies 
  were measured after birth, the experimental group proved to be significantly 
  more advanced in a variety of measures--including smiling and laughing. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all of the experimental babies in Thailand smiled responsively during the first five days following birth, something not expected for about 
  six more weeks. Half also smiled spontaneously during the first five days 
  following birth. The control infants were not as joyful: two out of 12 smiled 
  responsively in the first five days, and three smiled spontaneously in the 
  same period. What are these babies teaching us? 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water babies are coming in smiling, too. Statistics for them may be hard to assemble, but both stories and pictures document the fact that some water 
  babies have emerged from the womb smiling, starting underwater! One photo 
  shows a baby on her mother's tummy, hand on the nipple, and smiling ear to ear 
  seconds after birth. These babies seem to know their mothers have had an 
  ecstatic experience; they express "total peace," and wear a "Thank-you!" on 
  their faces. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an age of violence, we do well to watch baby faces carefully and to believe what they are telling us. In the past, we have neither watched nor 
  believed. The scientific response to baby faces and sounds has usually been to 
  deny real emotion at birth--and most certainly before birth--so these 
  expressions have not been of value. Baby faces have not determined the 
  direction of obstetrical practice, in spite of Leboyer's efforts. We should 
  see all pained, angry faces at birth in the context of the smiling faces. In 
  the past, did we not mistakenly assume gruesome faces and screaming voices 
  were normal? This myth befits a violent society. 
  <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling newborns have been trying to teach us a higher standard for birth: birth without violence as a foundation for life without violence. Can we make 
  this a national goal, a "standard of practice" in obstetrics rewarded with 
  financial bonuses, and a basis for mother awards? It would make a difference, 
  I believe, in our society. Almost three thousand years ago, the Hebrew prophet 
  Isaiah poetically described his vision of a world of safety and peace, a world 
  without harm and destruction, where "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and 
  the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and 
  the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them." (Isaiah 11:6) 
  <P>Babies leading us? Can we let them? I sincerely hope we can.
