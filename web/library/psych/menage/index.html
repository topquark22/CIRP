      <small><b>Abstract:</b> 500 women volunteers took part in a
      study about the psychological stress associated with
      obstetric and gynecological procedures. The sample was
      recruited by advertisements in local and national newspapers
      and in women's magazines and newsletters. Women completed a
      preliminary questionnaire on their experiences of obstetric
      and gynecological procedures, their biographical data, and
      their feelings associated with the procedures both at the
      time and now. Out of the 500 subjects, over 100 women gave an
      history of an obstetric and/or gynaecological which was 'very
      distressing' or 'terrifying', which was 'out of the ordinary'
      and which occurred 'more than one month previously'. These
      women were sent follow-up PTSD-I questionnaires and 30 of
      them fulfilled the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/ptsd/">DSM-III-R</a>
      criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Significant differences between the 30 women with
      PTSD, and 30 respondents who rated their experiences from
      'very good' to 'slightly distressing', were found on a range
      of findings, including feelings of powerlessness during the
      procedures, lack of information given to the patient, the
      experience of physical pain, a perceived unsympathetic
      attitude on the part of the examiner, and a lack of
      clearly-understood consent by the patient for the procedure.
      The results are discussed in relation to the literature on
      women's emotional reactions to the childbirth process and
      also to sexual violence and other causes of PTSD. The present
      findings suggest a cause of PTSD not previously described and
      challenge current medical working practices in the area of
      obstetrics and gynaecology.</small>
