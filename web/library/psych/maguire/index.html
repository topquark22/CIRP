      <h2>Coping With Loss: Surgery and Loss of Body Parts</h2>

      <h3>Peter Maguire, Colin Murray Parkes</h3>

      <p><small>This is the fourth in a series of 10 articles
      dealing with the different types of loss that doctors will
      meet in their practice</small></p>

      <p><small>The articles in this series are adapted from Coping
      with Loss, edited by Colin Murray Parkes and Andrew Markus,
      which will be published in July.</small></p>

      <blockquote>
        The loss of body parts can have distinct but overlapping
        psychological consequences. These can be bodily changes -
        alterations in the way patients, their families, and others
        perceive their bodies - or changes of function -
        alterations in the activities and roles that they are able
        to carry out. Some types of surgery affect one more than
        the other. Thus a unilateral mastectomy may have little
        influence on a woman's functional ability, but the effect
        on her body image will usually be profound. Most types of
        surgery, however, affect both form and function. Losing a
        limb is a clear example of this.
      </blockquote>

      <h3 align="center">Summary points</h3>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The loss of body parts
      can give rise to grief for loss of body image or function, or
      both.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Anxiety, depression, and sexual problems are
      related to the magnitude and type of loss as well as the
      personal vulnerability of the patient.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both avoidance of and obsessive
      preoccupation with the loss can be problematic.</p>

      <p class="text2">Members of the caring professions can help
      to prepare people for the losses that are to come; reassure
      them of the normality of fear, grief, and their physiological
      consequences; introduce them to support groups; recognise and
      monitor any problems that may arise; and ensure that
      specialist help is given when needed.</p>

      <h3>Amputation of a limb</h3>

      <p class="text2">The similarity between grief at loss of body
      part and grief caused by the death of a loved person has been
      clearly shown in comparative studies of the reaction to
      amputation of a limb and of widowhood.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> People with either of these losses
      were preoccupied with feelings of loss: bereaved people were
      missing the lost person and the amputees were missing the
      loss of physical attractiveness (loss of body image) or the
      occupational and other physical functions that could no
      longer be carried out (loss of function), or both of
      these.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Both groups said that
      they had difficulty in believing in the fact of the loss and
      tended to avoid reminders.</span> Both groups reported having
      clear visual memories of the lost person or part, and many
      had a strong sense of their persisting presence. This was
      most pronounced in the amputees as the "phantom limb." As
      time passed, both the phantom limb and the phantom spouse
      tended to dwindle in significance. In the case of the
      amputee, the phantom limb seemed to merge with the
      prosthesis. In both groups, returning to work was associated
      with improvement in emotional symptoms, but only a third of
      amputees were able to work full time, often because of
      persisting arterial disease in the unamputated limb.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both before and after amputation, impairment
      of mobility often gave rise to depression, which in turn
      delayed rehabilitation. Like the widows, those amputees who
      had a longstanding tendency to anxiety or depression
      (described as "sensitisers" by Horowitz<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> coped less well and suffered more than
      others. So, paradoxically, did a group of amputees, mostly
      men, who showed little evidence of distress at the time of
      the amputation. Rigid and compulsively self reliant people,
      they seemed to be coping well at first, but 13 months later
      they were significantly more likely to have persistent pain
      in their phantom limb than other amputees.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> These compare with the "identification
      symptoms" reported by some bereaved people who show little
      grief at the time of a loss (Horowitz's "avoiders") but
      subsequently develop pains and other symptoms that often
      resemble those of the person who died. This suggests that the
      persistence of pain in a phantom limb may sometimes result
      from the repression or avoidance of grief at the loss.</p>

      <h3>Cancer and cancer surgery</h3>

      <p class="text2">Cancer commonly causes loss of bodily
      functions, damage to the body image, and threat to life
      itself. Fear and grief are likely consequences, and the
      surgical and medical treatments for cancer are often drastic
      and may give rise to further losses. In a psychological sense
      cancer invades families, for many lives are likely to be
      affected by this illness.</p>

      <p class="text2">People vary greatly in the degree of
      confidence and flexibility with which they cope with
      threatening situations. Several studies show that the
      intensity of distress following the onset of cancer is
      determined by such factors and by the degree to which people
      feel that the losses caused by the illness have made them
      different from others. This, in turn, can give rise to
      depression, problems of sexual adjustment, and other
      psychological difficulties.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4-6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One indicator of adjustment, sexual
      functioning, gives an idea of the magnitude of the problem.
      Comparative studies are few, but the effect on sexuality is
      surprisingly similar in cancers as varied as Hodgkin's
      disease and cancers of the testis<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and those of lung and prostate.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> In both of these studies, between a
      quarter and a third of respondents in each diagnostic group
      felt that they had become lastingly less attractive to their
      partners, and a similar proportion found that their sex drive
      was diminished.</p>

      <p class="text2">Similar difficulties have been reported in
      women after mastectomy.<sup><a href="#n9">9-11</a></sup> Many
      women are dissatisfied with any prosthesis that they are
      offered, and they may attempt to avoid facing the painful
      reality of their loss by refusing to look at their chest wall
      or allowing their partners to do so. Some go to the lengths
      of covering mirrors, dressing and undressing in the dark, and
      minimising the time that they spend bathing. These activities
      reflect an avoidant style of coping. It is hardly surprising
      that these women tend to have lasting depression and loss of
      interest in sexuality.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the psychological consequences of
      surgical mutilation can be severe, they need to be set
      against the anxiety that patients may feel if they fear that
      their cancer has not been completely removed. Lumpectomy has
      often been advocated on the grounds that it is less
      psychologically traumatic than mastectomy, yet in one study
      it was associated with a slightly higher incidence of anxiety
      states and depression than mastectomy.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Similarly, surgical treatment for
      carcinoma of the cervix has been shown to give rise to rather
      less reduction in sexual enjoyment and activity than
      treatment with radiotherapy.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      On the other hand, between a quarter and a third of men who
      undergo surgical castration for cancer of the testis think
      that the operation has made them less attractive and less
      able to achieve sexual satisfaction,<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> whereas chemical castration for
      carcinoma of the prostate is associated with substantial
      improvement in psychological state.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Whether or not patients with cancer have
      surgical treatment, they will usually have chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy, with loss of hair and other physical
      consequences. These are a further cause for loss of self
      esteem, grief, and depression.</p>

      <h3>Cardiac surgery</h3>

      <p class="text2">Since cardiac surgery has little effect on
      the body image and most patients are likely to experience
      restoration of function rather than impairment, we might
      think that the psychological impact would be relatively
      slight and might be positive rather than negative. Yet in one
      study as many as 51% of elderly patients who underwent
      cardiac surgery had an adjustment disorder.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Why should this be?</p>

      <p class="text2">The answer seems to lie in the special
      significance of the heart as the symbol and source of life,
      an internal clock that ticks our life away until it stops,
      dead. Cardiac surgery brings home to patients the seriousness
      of their illness and causes fear. The incidence of
      preoperative distress correlates with the incidence after
      operation. In addition, open heart surgery may cause
      cognitive impairment, particularly in elderly people, making
      it harder for patients to cope with the emotional demands of
      the operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is no surprise, therefore, to find that
      many cardiac patients remain fearful of exerting themselves
      and are apprehensive even when good cardiac function has been
      restored by surgery. This is most obvious in the sexual area
      and explains the occurrence of erectile dysfunction and loss
      of desire in these patients.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Preventing problems</h3>

      <p class="text2">Counselling, in the form of information and
      advice given before surgery, emotional support, and the
      opportunity to discuss problems that are anticipated, reduces
      the prevalence of psychological problems after
      mastectomy<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> and cardiac
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">If an operation is planned the patient will
      need to be prepared for both the operation and its short term
      and long term consequences. Those about to undergo an
      amputation should be warned that a phantom limb, which may be
      painful, might persist for a while, and they should be
      invited to share any doubts or fears they have. This enables
      the carer to reassure them when fears are needless and to
      support them in grieving for the losses that are inevitable.
      It also increases the probability that the patient will agree
      to undergo the surgery. Such support has been shown to
      increase the probability that the patient will cope
      effectively with the loss.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Recognising problems after surgery</h3>

      <p class="text2">Despite the prevalence of sexual and other
      problems, they are detected and treated in only a small
      minority of patients. In one study of women undergoing
      mastectomy, not one had been asked a direct question about
      how she felt about the impact of surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Any person who has undergone surgery or
      other treatment that has led to the loss of a body part or
      function should be asked how they feel about the loss ("How
      have you felt about losing your breast?"). Patients should be
      asked about the effects on mood, day to day life,
      relationships, and sexuality ("Can you look at the scar?";
      "Is it having any effect on your physical relationship?"). If
      there is evidence of mood disturbance it is important to
      establish whether this amounts to an affective disorder.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is also important to discover how well
      the family is coping ("How does your partner feel about the
      effects of your operation?"; "Can you talk to your family
      about their feelings?"). A man who has lost a testis or a
      woman who has lost a breast needs to know that their partner
      still finds them attractive. When surgery is carried out in
      childhood it is particularly important to involve parents in
      the support system since overprotective behaviour can
      undermine rehabilitation.</p>

      <h3>Management of problems</h3>

      <p class="text2">Despite some research which throws doubt on
      the lasting benefits of routine use of professional
      counsellors for stoma patients,<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> the kind of emotional support and
      information that can be given by a doctor or nurse is
      undoubtedly valuable to patients about to undergo major
      surgery. Other members of the patient's family, particularly
      spouses, will also need support.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">"Avoiders" may need
      opportunities to talk through the implications of their loss
      and reassurance of the normality of grief and of its physical
      and emotional consequences.</span> "Sensitisers" are more
      likely to benefit from meeting other patients who have
      undergone similar surgery and can help to reassure them that
      it is possible to live with disabilities.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anything that increases mobility and
      enhances the patient's confidence and self esteem will
      facilitate the necessary physical and psychological
      transitions.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Well conducted
      postoperative exercise programmes will restore patients'
      confidence in their bodies; this is particularly important
      after cardiac surgery when spouses, and even doctors and
      nurses, commonly aggravate patients' fears by treating them
      as if they were extremely fragile.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> Organisations such as Cancer Link
      and Ostomy Clubs (for people with stomas) give neophytes
      opportunities to learn from veterans how to live with their
      disabilities.</p>

      <p class="text2">People with damaged bodies may have longed
      for the day when they will again feel strong and safe. They
      approach surgery with a mixture of hope and dread. All too
      often their fear creates the very situation they dread. The
      physical manifestations of fear (which include the effects of
      both hyperventilation and autonomic disturbance) are easily
      misinterpreted as symptoms of bodily damage. It is important
      for medical attendants to provide positive reassurance and
      explanation for all such symptoms and to avoid unnecessary
      investigations (which only serve to convince patients that
      their doctors are as worried as they are). Anxiety management
      includes techniques for muscular relaxation and imaging
      (envisaging relaxing scenes and situations). Anxious patients
      may also benefit from anxiolytic drugs at times of particular
      stress.</p>

      <p>The fact that someone who is clinically depressed has lost
      a limb or a breast does not mean that they will not respond
      to antidepressant medication, and there is no evidence that
      these drugs interfere with the process of grieving. When
      there are clinical indications for their use they should be
      given in full dosage and for at least four months.</p>

      <p class="text2">Clinical psychologists have much to offer.
      Cognitive behaviour therapies challenge patients'
      misperceptions of themselves and can be helpful when body
      image problems persist. They are of particular value for
      disturbance of mood and sexuality associated with problems of
      body image.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Surgical
      correction of disfigurement can also have a positive
      influence on body image, and operations such as breast
      reconstruction and the re-siting or modification of stomas
      can have profound benefits. Patients should have realistic
      expectations and be properly prepared.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although many sexual problems respond to
      appropriate education, reassurance, and support, those that
      do not may be helped by conjoint sexual therapy for both
      patient and partner. Sometimes a recent loss may uncover
      sexual and other problems that go back a long way. In all of
      these situations the general practitioner, who is likely to
      be the only person in a position to give long term support,
      is a key figure.</p>
