        <h2>THE `SCREENING' FUNCTION OF TRAUMATIC MEMORIES</h2>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Commenting recently on the technical aspect
      of screen-memories, I had occasion to point out that actual
      memories of traumatic events happening in childhood should be
      carefully scrutinized, on the ground that they are well
      adapted to the defensive purpose of covering repressed
      material. The ordinary screen-memory can scarcely avoid
      arousing analytical suspicion because the nature of the
      memory image does not account for its persistence over a
      number of years or for its frequent repetition during the
      earlier stages of analysis. When, however, the memory image
      is in itself of a sufficiently traumatic nature there is some
      possibility that its credentials may be too easily accepted
      at their face value. The following example illustrates with
      some precision this screening function of infantile traumatic
      memories.</p>

      <p class="text2">The case was one of severe and protracted
      impotence. The early stages of analysis were characterized by
      profound amnesia covering the events of early childhood and
      extending well into the latency period. As is to be expected,
      the great majority of memories which had persisted from these
      periods were typical screen memories: they referred to
      seemingly insignificant events and unimportant places, but it
      was possible in most instances to uncover a more elaborate
      and emotional substratum. A few emotionally tinged events
      were recalled, mainly scenes of domestic conflict and
      correction, e.g. quarrels with a sister, correction by his
      mother, etc., but they were very few and far between. Some
      details of illnesses in boyhood were remembered, but there
      was no special affect during their recital. One of these
      seemed to be a little more significant from the analytic
      point of view in that it had occurred in earlier childhood.
      It was a memory of having his hand burned on a domestic
      stove.</p>

      <p class="text2">At the time, however, the patient paid no
      special attention to this `burn' memory, and his analysis
      continued its ordinary course. It was marked by phases of
      intense resistance. He gave a somewhat grudging intellectual
      assent to any explanation of the infantile nature and
      exciting cause of these resistances and his progress was
      extremely slow. Gradually some infantile phobias were
      uncovered and his led inevitably to the interpretation of his
      castration-anxiety. <span class="yellow">Several months had
      passed before it transpired that he had been circumcised in
      childhood.</span> Some comment was made on the importance of
      this historical fact, together with the significance of its
      omission from his historical material. This elicited the
      reply that, so far as he knew, the circumcision had been
      performed in early infancy, in all probability within a few
      months of birth. It had not occurred to him to mention the
      fact because it did not appear to be of any consequence; it
      was a natural hygienic operation, etc. etc. <span
      class="yellow">His system of rationalization was
      watertight.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Within a few days the situation had altered
      considerably. Stimulated, no doubt, by this earlier passage,
      the patient had of his own accord instituted some inquiries
      and learned indirectly from his mother that <span
      class="yellow">the circumcision had actually taken place when
      he was between the ages of three and a half four
      years.</span> The immediate result was to induce an altered
      attitude to the subject of infantile amnesia. The patient was
      startled into dragging his infantile years for further
      recoveries, but, as is not surprising, with little result. In
      particular he was unable to recall anything at all about the
      circumcision, in spite of the fact that he could remember
      quite clearly some events which took place prior to the
      alleged date of the operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Again the analysis resumed its course, the
      resistances against castration images being, if any thing
      more pronounced. The second discovery was made a month or so
      later, when the patient had an opportunity of going into the
      matter with his mother in person. The facts elicited ware as
      follows. During his infancy his mother was from time to time
      advised on matters of child hygiene by a medical practitioner
      who was a close relative of her own. <span class="yellow">He
      seems to have had a mania for performing the operation of
      circumcision, and very few children who came within his ken
      escaped this fate.</span> His own children were circumcised.
      In spite of the fact that our patient's prepuce and glans
      were normal in every respect, this surgeon never failed to
      impress on the patient's mother the inestimable advantages to
      be obtained from circumcision. There were evidently good
      psychological reasons for this vicarious sacrifice on his
      part, but, except in so far as these contributed to a
      somewhat intimidating personality and thereby increased the
      child's apprehensions concerning this father substitute, they
      need not concern us. He seems to have been a man of sombre
      disposition, with a heavy, overbearing manner, and the
      patient as a child was not slow to accept the uneasy
      valuation of his possibilities current among his holiday
      playmates, the doctor's own children. On the occasion of a
      particular holiday visit the mother's scruples were finally
      overcome, and she consented to have the circumcision
      performed on her child. The final step in gaining her consent
      took the form of visiting the nursery. The patient was
      awakened out of his sleep by having his bedclothes abruptly
      pulled away: He woke up to find the sinister figure of the
      doctor leaning over the bed. His penis was unceremoniously
      seized by the surgeon's left hand, with the right the motion
      of cutting was imitated and the mother, who stood on the
      opposite side of the bed, was asked to note how simple a
      matter it was to cut off the foreskin, or words to that
      effect. She was rather concerned at the whole performance,
      and observed that he son showed signs of panic, but she did
      not interfere with the demonstration. The technique must have
      been rather crude, because the process of healing was
      delayed. The wound had to be dressed daily, and each dressing
      aroused agonized anticipations and was followed by wailing
      protestation. On protestation in particular took the form of
      a reproach directed at his mother. The day after the
      operation he is said to have cried out to his mother, <span
      class="yellow">`Why did you let him cut it off?'</span> After
      a week's dressings the wound began to heal by granulation,
      and there is no exact record of its subsequent course. There
      was, however, no doubt in the mother's mind that the
      experience was an agonizing one for the child, and she
      regretted her decision for a long time afterwards.</p>

      <p class="text2">Shorn of a certain amount of elaboration,
      the main facts were as given above, but, in spite of the most
      circumstantial detail, the patient was still unable to
      remember one iota of the whole affair. He added the following
      important comment: `It surprises me very much that I cannot
      remember at all about my circumcision, because I can remember
      very well something that happened at the very same visit; it
      was during that visit that I burned my hand upon the stove. I
      remember the whole thing perfectly, and that I had to have my
      hand dressed for some days'. He was certain that there could
      be no mistake. They had only once visited that particular
      house, a fact which the mother confirmed.</p>

      <p class="text2">The possibility had still to be considered
      that the whole burn story was a substitution, and on this
      point it was hard to obtain absolutely convincing evidence.
      The patient could not remember whether the burn took place
      before or after the circumcision, although, judging from the
      duration of stay and the period of circumcision dressing, it
      seems likely that it occurred before the operation. The
      mother's testimony was not very satisfactory, because in the
      first instance she could not remember the burn and was mainly
      concerned with the circumcision. On the other hand, the
      patient was able to recall many incidents relating to the
      same visit, including games and conversations with the sons
      of the house: his recollection of the circumstances of the
      burned hand, the occasion of the accident, its cause, the
      stove, the dressings, and of many other confirmatory details
      were unshakable. The amnesia for the circumcision, however,
      remained for the time being complete.</p>
