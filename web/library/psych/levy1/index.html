      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This 1945 article by David Levy
      is a landmark article in child psychology. The article is a
      lengthy one with tables and many case reports. This file
      contains the summary and conclusions. Persons desiring the
      full text of the article should be able to find it in the
      archive of most medical libraries. The term "combat neurosis"
      is an early name for the disorder that is now known as
      <i>posttraumatic stress disorder</i> (PTSD).]</p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="section">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>

      <p class="text2">A review of the records of 124 children
      referred for behavior problems who had undergone an operative
      procedure (tonsillectomy in most instances) revealed that in
      25 there were manifest emotional sequelae. The largest
      percentage of sequelae occurred in the group under the age of
      3 years (50 per cent) ; the proportion in those above 3 years
      averaged about 10 per cent. A study of the percentages
      obtained in proportion to the number of years that had
      elapsed between the child&rsquo;s operative procedure and the
      date on which the history was derived from the mother
      revealed that these percentages were reduced as the interval
      of time increased. Hence the derived percentages were
      considered to be lower than the actual percentages, and the
      number of emotional sequelae larger than the number
      recorded.</p>

      <p class="text2">In 13 of the 25 children who suffered
      psychologically from the operation there were no histories of
      emotional difficulties preceding that event. The increased
      emotional hazard of the operation for the 1 and 2 year old
      children was related to their keener response to pain, poorer
      comprehension of the experience, greater dependence on the
      mother, less experience in social contacts outside the home
      and less facility in handling anxiety.</p>

      <p class="text2">Prolonged night terrors were characteristic
      responses of the 1 and 2 year old children ; negativistic
      responses, of those aged 4 years and older. Fears other than
      night terrors occurred at every age up to 8 years. Dependency
      reactions, though necessarily arising whenever fears are
      present, were especially noteworthy in 3 children. Regressive
      reactions, such as a return to enuresis, feeding problems and
      the like, were rarely present.</p>

      <p class="text2">Manifestations of simple anxiety, consistent
      with dependency and helplessness, occurred in the youngest
      age group ; manifestations of hostility, consistent with
      increased aggressiveness, occurred in the oldest age
      group.</p>

      <p class="text2">The most frequent fears were of the dark, of
      physicians and nurses and of strange men. The &ldquo;total
      fear reaction&rdquo; was to strange people, strange places
      and hurtful objects. There were various modifications of
      total specific fears. When prolonged, the general fears left,
      and a specific fear relating to the operative procedure
      remained. Otherwise, fears of the dark outlasted all
      others.</p>

      <p class="text2">When considered in accordance with general
      psychiatric nosology the emotional sequelae were classified
      as follows:</p>

      <p class="sequelae">1. Conditioned fear.<br />
       2. Dependency fears and regressions.<br />
       3. Latent fear.<br />
       4. Phobias.<br />
       5. Anxiety states.<br />
       6. Hostility reactions.<br />
       7. Obsessions.<br />
       8. Hysteria.</p>

      <p class="text2">The prevention of postoperative fears is
      thought to consist of the following steps :</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Postponement of the operation, if possible to at least
        the age of 3 years, especially if evidence of anxiety or
        undue dependency on the mother is evident.</li>

        <li>An explanation to the child of what is to take place,
        to overcome reactions to the strange or surprising
        event.</li>

        <li>Contact with the mother before and after the
        operation.</li>

        <li>Preparatory sedative and anesthetic in the bedroom, to
        spare the child the experiences of seeing instruments and
        the operating room and riding through the corridors.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text2">The child has his own method of overcoming
      anxiety through play of his own devising. In the 2 instances
      in which suicidal attempts or near attempts were made, the
      anxiety was unusually severe and was regarded as beyond the
      child&rsquo; &ldquo;absorptive capacity.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">The child&rsquo;s postoperative emotional
      sequelae are analogous to combat neurosis, since the symptoms
      are of the same type and the principles of prevention the
      same.</p>
