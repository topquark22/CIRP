        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his
      writings on sexual development, Freud postulated that around
      the fourth or fifth year of life, the genital concentration
      of all sexual excitement is achieved and the boy's interest
      in the genitals attains a dominant significance. At this
      phase of infantile genital organization, the <i>phallic
      stage</i>, the sexual organs gain a great narcissistic value.
      The fear that something might happen to this prized organ is
      called <i>castration anxiety</i>.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castration anxiety gains
      significance in the child's life also when related to the
      nature of relations characterizing the phallic stage.
      According to Freud, at this stage of development, the boys
      experiences strong genital strivings for his mother and death
      wishes for his father, conceptualized as the Oedipus complex.
      The discovery of sexual differences between boys and girls
      raises the expectations of castration for himself, as a
      retaliation for the forbidden sexual desires toward his
      mother (Freud, S.,1920, 1953).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical observations by
      psychoanalysts, evidence from anthropology, religious and
      folk myths, artistic creations and various other sources
      suggest that the narcissistic fear over the loss of the
      genital organ leads to the renunciation of the Oedipal
      attachments. This resolution ushers in a new developmental
      stage - the latency period.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      now generally accepted that under the impact of Oedipal
      strivings and castration anxiety, children at the phallic
      stage are disposed to experience fantastic fears of bodily
      damage. Masturbation, medical treatment, traumas, accidents
      have been shown by many to create disturbances in the psychic
      life of the child (Coleman 1950; Deutsch 1942; Jessner <i>et
      al</i>. 1952; Miller, 1951). Anna Freud has indicated that
      '...any surgical interference with the child's body may serve
      as a focal point for the activation, reactivation, grouping,
      and rationalization of the ideas of being attacked,
      overwhelmed and (or) castrated....The actual experience of
      the operation lends a feeling of reality to the repressed
      fantasies, thereby multiplying the anxieties connected with
      it. Apart from the threatening situation in the outer world,
      this increase of anxiety presents an internal danger which
      the child's ego has to face. Where the defence mechanisms
      available at the time are strong enough to master these
      anxieties, all is well; where they have overstrained to
      integrate the experience, the child reacts to the operation
      with neurotic outbreaks; where the ego is unable to cope with
      the anxiety released, the operation becomes a trauma for the
      child' (<a href="/library/psych/freud/">Freud, A.,
      1952</a>)</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      noted in the psychoanalytic literature that operations
      actually performed on the penis, such as circumcision, arouse
      castration fears whatever the level of libidinal development
      and facilitate the development of homosexual trends in boys.
      (Fenichel, 1945). Nunberg, in a most interesting article on
      circumcision and the problems of bisexuality, points out that
      injury to the penis may intimidate the boy and impair his
      development to full virility. However he also proposes that
      circumcision may stimulate the masculine strivings of the
      child by encouraging identification with the father.
      (Nunberg,1947).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision as a
      religious custom, has been and is being performed in various
      parts of the world, in primitive and modern societies. It is
      a general custom among the Turkish people, finding its
      justification mainly in religion. Among the educated, it is
      practised for hygienic purposes. Children are circumcised in
      Turkey between the ages of 2 and 10 but very often before
      starting school, i.e. around 5-7. Very little or misleading
      information is given to the child about the nature of the
      operation.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      practice of circumcision among the Turks around the phallic
      stage raises some interesting questions as to its effects on
      the psychology of the child. Although it is common knowledge
      in psychoanalytic circles that an operational procedure on
      the child's sexual organs at the phallic stage will augment
      his anxieties about castration, no research exists in the
      literature investigating the specific effects of circumcision
      practised around these ages. From the formulations of the
      psychoanalytically oriented writers, we can hypothesize that
      circumcision will be perceived by the child as an attack,
      will have detrimental effects on the ego, loosening the fears
      of castration and rendering a reality to them, thus
      establishing the feelings of 'I am now castrated'. According
      to Freud's hypothesis, we can also postulate that
      circumcision around the phallic stage, by establishing the
      feelings of being already castrated, will initiate in the
      child a confusion about sexual identity and dispose him
      toward femininity. This study was carried out to investigate
      the validity of these hypotheses.</p>

      <h3 align="center">PROCEDURE</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve
      children between the ages of 4 and 7 were used in the study,
      six came from families of low and six from average economic
      and social level. Except two cases, none was given explicit
      information about circumcision. Apart from two, none had yet
      begun schooling. Their physical condition during testing was
      normal. Prior to the study, only one had witnessed a physical
      trauma, specifically a head injury which had occurred 2-3
      years ago. The other children had the usual sicknesses
      without any major complications or hospitalizations.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      children were seen about a month before the operation. A
      questionaire was given to the mother, which sought
      information concerning the child's living conditions,
      development, social, emotional, intellectual adaptation, his
      and the families reaction to circumcision. Following this,
      Goodenough Draw-a-man test, Rorshasch, CAT and a set of
      stories were admininistered to the child.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three
      to seven days after the operation, the child was seen again
      and the same tests were readministered, except parallel form
      of stories. A second questionaire was given to the mother,
      this time investigating the child's physical and
      psychological reactions to the operation. By the time of the
      second testing most of the children had overcome the physical
      discomforts of the operation.</p>

      <h3 align="center">RESULTS</h3>

      <p align="center"><i>Questionaire</i></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the results
      obtained from the two questionaires are not directly related
      to the subject of this study, they furnish material about the
      child's living conditions which might be of interest to
      psychologists abroad.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
      three of the subjects had separate bedrooms, two shared it
      with a close relative, but five with their parents. One child
      slept in the same bed with this brother and one with his
      sister.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      children from low income families lived under very strong
      psychological and physical deprivation. Most were threatened
      by a realistic fear of hunger and quite justified fears of
      destruction, resulting from continuous mal- treatment. The
      children from average income level faced the typical problems
      of an American child of the same social class.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      mothers showed considerable resistance against observing
      signs of mental disturbance in their children and, apart from
      two, described their children as 'emotionally, socially and
      intellectually healthy'. The observations made during testing
      sessions and the innocent remarks of the mothers revealed
      that all of the children had certain psychological problems,
      such as bed-wetting, phobias, temper tantrums. Two subjects
      were severely disturbed. However, the mothers considered
      these symptoms as normal manifestations of childhood and
      seemed totally unaware of their psychopathological
      character.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
      two mothers had given some information to their children
      about circumcision. The rest had refrained, due to various
      rationalizations. Often 'a small lie' was told to the child,
      such as 'you'll receive lots of gifts and have great fun'.
      However, the mothers reported that the child actually knew
      what would happen. Most children had collected some kind of
      information from friends or relatives. The mothers
      rationalized their reluctance to give information by stating
      that the child would be fearful if told the truth and refuse
      to cooperate. They preferred the child be fooled and should
      he manifest signs of alarm or disturbance after circumcision,
      this, they believed would be overcome by time or 'fate'.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      mothers were also resistant toward observing the
      psychological reactions of the children following the
      operation. In the second questionaire, they described the
      children's behaviour to the operation as 'healthy and
      mature'. They explained the temper tantrums the child
      manifested, a typical reaction, as the result of being
      'spoiled by the attention and the gifts given to him'.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
      the interviews with the mother, it seemed in general, that
      they had little understanding into the child's psychological
      state, regardless of circumcision. Particularly in the
      families with low income and little education, the child's
      needs and anxieties were rarely recognized and little or
      nothing was done to protect him from dispair. The child was
      left alone to struggle with and solve his fears, curiosities
      or strivings. The fathers, having left the care of the child
      to the mother, seemed to be even more distant
      emotionally.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Goodenough Draw-a-man-Test</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      revised form of Goodenough Draw-a-man Test, as applied in
      most U.S.A. clinics, was used. The child was first asked to
      draw 'a person' instead of 'a man'. He was then asked a set
      of questions about the picture he was drawn.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      records showed some interesting changes following
      circumcision, both in respect of the quality of the drawing
      and of the responses to the questions.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following circumcision,
      there was a remarkable decrease in the I. Q. obtained by this
      test and in the size of the drawing itself (Table 1). From
      the decrease in I. Q. we can assume that circumcision hampers
      smooth, spontaneous and efficient functioning by the child;
      however, it would be quite misleading to assert that it
      decreases the I. Q. <i>per se</i>, since it is now generally
      accepted amongst psychologists that the DAM test is not a
      very reliable measure of intelligence.</p>

      <br />
       
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      decrease in the size of the drawings is of greater value in
      explaining the implicatios of circumcision for the child. In
      comparison to their previous perception, following the
      operation, the children feel 'smaller'. The body image shows
      a tendency to shrink, most probably this results from the
      feeling of 'being cut'. By depicting a smaller image of
      himself, the child may also be expressing his feeling of
      insecurity, inadequacy, inferiority under the impact of the
      outside world's attack on him (Levy, 1950; Machover,
      1951).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain interesting
      changes are also observed in the quality of the responses to
      the questions asked after the drawing was completed. We can
      summarize these changes under two headings.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Disturbance in sexual
      indentification.</i> Following circumcision, all of the
      children showend some disturbance in sexual identification on
      the DAM test; however each in a manner peculiar to himself.
      An interesting disturbance was noted in the sex attributed to
      the picture drawn before and after the operation. Out of
      twelve children, five showed definite change in identifying
      the sex of the figure, five seemed undisturbed in this
      respect, and two subjects were confused prior to this
      operation and continued to be so following it.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
      the responses of the seemingly undisturbed five subjects are
      studied, it is seen that these children also manifested
      confusion over sexual identity. One subject responded to the
      question in the trunk item by 'he wore a pretty skirt and
      blouse, ribbon in her hair and high heeled shoes. Two
      children described the drawing as male, but drew a skirt
      instead of trousers. Another expressed his confusion in a
      different way. Although in his preoperative drawing he had
      not faced a difficulty in joinng his legs to the trunk, in
      his second drawing he took considerable time to accomplish it
      and was unable to correct a marked distortion he had made in
      joining the legs. Another interesting change was the omission
      of a significant part of the body, such as an arm or a leg.
      Some children omitted to draw the phallic objects, e. g. a
      gun, which they had previously included.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Regressive trends.</i>
      Tendency to regress toward more infantile and primitive modes
      of expression was observed following circumcision. Half the
      children attributed a younger age to their drawing after the
      operation, which may be indicative of a wish to be a 'baby'
      or to live in an earlier stage when life was less
      threatening.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting
      regressive trait was noted in the responses to the 'three
      wishes' of the figure drawn. Following circumcision, two
      stated no wishes, one due to extreme withdrawal and the other
      from primitively expressed anger. Five subjects who had
      previously expressed more mature wishes, acceptable for their
      age level, openly manifested oral passive needs. A good
      example is the child whose preoperative respones was 'a ball,
      a whistle and toys'. Following circumcision, this child
      wished to eat 'plenty of food, cookies, custard and rice
      custard', the last being a mixture of milk and rice fed to
      infants. One very disturbed child expressed blatant oral
      aggressive drives. His preoperative response was 'find
      clothes, and a human being each day and talk to him. (Q:
      Why?) So that he can learn the best ideas and apply them in
      life.' In the post operative testing, this child wished
      'Treasure, a very large pot, and to catch people so he can
      cook them in the pot and devour them.' The same child also
      linked the costumes in the 'trunk' item with extreme oral
      aggressive wishes, followinnng the circumcision. He dressed
      his hero in 'terrible clothes' and sent him off 'to eat
      little children up'. Two other little children used the
      costumes for aggressive purposes. Whereas some children
      showed definite narcissistic trends, they wished to possess
      articles which would make them look nicer, cleaner, and
      prettier, objects which were not previously wished.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Stories</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      test was two sets of incomplete projective stories focusing
      on a projecting body organ, such as a tail, nose or finger,
      or animals or human beings. The child had to give an answer
      at the end of each story to a question such as: 'What
      happened to the little puppy?' A similar technique to the one
      used in this study was first suggested by Duss (1940), and
      later Friedman (1952) devised his own fables for an empirical
      study of castration anxiety and Oedipus complex. In this
      research, Friedman's stories were slightly changed to suit
      the Turkish culture and three parallel stories were devised
      to be applied following circumcision.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      responses to the two sets of stories were compared in order
      to evaluate the intensity of aggressive drives. The scoring
      system was adopted from Pine's (1960) method for evaluating
      TAT protocols.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blatant and highly
      aggressive damage to the object of the stary was scored level
      I, e. g. mutilation, breakage, death. An aggressive damage
      such as sickness, was scored level II, Responses which only
      implied aggressin and a slight change in object were scored
      level II, e. g. change of colour.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table
      2 shows the results obtained from the evaluation of the
      intensity of aggressive drives and the content of the
      responses. We note that following circumcision level I shows
      a significant increase, indicating to the fact that the
      operation is experienced by the child as an aggressive
      attack, with deadening implications. Although before the
      operation, too, the subjects were somehow anxious of an
      impending danger, they could more easily control their fear
      and were capable of expressing it in more subtle, symobolic
      ways. If prior to circumcision, they experienced anxiety over
      castration, this anxiety was more of a probability than
      reality an their ego was strong enough to keep it under
      control.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempting to apply the
      concepts of psychoanalytic ego psychology to the dynamics
      underlying TAT stories, Pine (1960) prepared a scoring manual
      which enables the evaluation of ego strength. He suggests
      that (1) the integration of drive expression, and (2) the
      level of drive expression in the TAT stories can be used as a
      measure of ego control.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      integration of drive expression is analysed as follows:</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
      The effectiveness with which the drive expression in the TAT
      stories are integrated into the theme of the story is
      considered an index of ego control and is scored
      <i>thematic</i>.<br />
       (2) The appearance of drive material in disruptive and
      inappropriate expressions implies a weakness of ego control
      and is scored <i>non-appropriate</i>.<br />
       (3) Sometimes drives are used incidentally in the TAT
      stories, so that the subject can hardly relate these
      experiences to the theme of the story or used it deliberately
      to give a dramatic effect. Such uses of drive are scored
      <i>incidental</i>.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      second measure of ego control, the level of drive expression,
      implies 'the moderation of drive intensity and socialization
      of its aim' (Pine, 1960). For this rating, Pine proposes
      three levels: level I--Direct unsocialized drive expression.
      Level II--Direct socialized drive expression. Level
      III--Disguised, indirect or weak drive expression. 'Although
      a heavy preponderance of direct socialized drive expression
      may have no pathognomic implications, a preponderance of
      direct-unsocialized and or of direct and disguised drive
      content suggests an imbalance between ego control and impulse
      expression, (Pine, 1960).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      order to evaluate the strength of the ego following
      circumcision, Pine's method of analysis was used to score the
      CAT protocols. The stories were scored according to the
      integration of drive expression. Since there was a striking
      preponderance of aggressive expressions, and practically no
      implications to libidinal impulses, the direction of the
      aggressive drives, i. e. their object, was also evaluated.
      The results of these three types of analyses are summarized
      in Table 3.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
      note that following circumcision, a definite increase occurs
      in the incidental and non-appropriate use of instinctual
      energy, indicating a lack of integration of drives and
      impulses. We note also a striking increase in Level I, i.e.
      in direct-unsocialized drive expression. These two findings
      indicate that following circumcision there is a marked
      weakening in the control of the ego over the primitive
      discharges, in inability to make appropriate use of
      instinctual energy, impulses breaking through in ego-alien
      and maladaptive forms. Due to the traumatic effects of
      circumcision, and resulting weakening of ego strength,
      instincts find direct expression, overwhelm the ego and lose
      their socialized character.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following circumcision
      changes are also noted in the direction of the drive, i.e.
      its object. Aggression directed to the self was taken as an
      index of castration. In both testings, subjects spontaneously
      expressed hostile and destructive wishes towards the hero of
      the story with whom they identified themselves. However, such
      remarks strikingly increased following the operation (Table
      3), pointing to the fact that circumcision was perceived by
      the child as an aggressive attack, i.e. castration.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concomitant with the
      increase in the amount of expression directed to the self,
      there was an increase in affressive remarks directed toward
      the mother figures. Only a slight change, which is not
      significant, occurred in the hostile impulses directed to
      father figures. According to these results, the females were
      held responsible for the damage; they were perceived as the
      castrators, and aggressive wishes were aimed at them.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
      objects, besides father and mother figures, were used by
      children as targets or sources of aggression, e.g. siblings,
      animals, society or lifeless objects. Some children
      manifested diffuse hostile impulses with no specific defined
      objects or sources (objectless aggression). None of these
      showed a significant change following circumcision.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Rorschach</i></p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Rorschach
      protocols also show some changes after the operation, these
      do not seem to be as dramatic as the changes oberved in the
      other psychological tests. Quantitative analysis by Klopfer
      <i>et al.</i> (1954) of the two sets of protocols reveal that
      <i>d%, F%</i> and the number of reject responses
      significantly increase, whereas total <i>R, C</i> and
      <i>M</i> decrease following circumcision. The rest of the
      determinants were given by the subjects inconsistently, such
      that it was not possible to evaluate the change in each
      category separately. This all other determinants were grouped
      uder the heading 'Qualitative wealth of the record'. A
      significant decrease occurred in this category as well. There
      was only a slight tendency to derease in <i>H</i>%, and in
      the average and chromatic reaction times. None were
      statistically significant. (see Table 4)</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      changes noted in the occurrence of various determinants
      indicate to a generalized constriction inability to respond
      affectively to the emotional demands of the external world,
      and withdrawal from human relationships. When prior to
      circumcision the child seemed more spontaneous in the
      expression of feelings or needs, following the operation,
      they are reluctant to reveal their inner world and are apt to
      isolate and/or insulate themselves from the people around
      them.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      general constriction and isolation may be a defensive
      protection of the self from the retaliations of the adults.
      Having been attacked and mutilated, the children may now be
      seeking safety in total withdrawal from interpersonal
      relationships and are thus protecting themselves from
      aggressive interferences.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      fact, the qualitative analysis of the Rorschach responses
      indicate that the children perceive the operation as
      castration (Table 4). References to broken, damaged,
      disfigured objects and figures occur with greater frequency.
      There is also a striking decrease in those responses
      containing phallic element or symbolism (Schafer, 1954). What
      was previously perceived as 'two bears', following
      circumcision is interpreted by the child as 'rabbits with
      heads cut off'. The 'sun' becames 'burning flames', 'head of
      a rabbit' is seen as 'scissors or clippers'.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
      consistent evidence is obtained from the Rorschach with
      regard to a change in sexual identification. Almost half of
      the subjects manifested confusion in this area prior to the
      operation; two had established feminine identification.
      Although the content of the responses last their phallic
      element following the circumcision, this, we believe, cannot
      be taken as in index of feminine identification.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the generalized
      constriction observed in all subjects, each child in the
      Rorschach showed a reaction peculiar to himself. When one
      child reacted to the operation with an aggressive rebellion
      from within, the other regressed to a state of passive
      submission. When one became interest in sexual organs, the
      other seemed concerned over oral deprivation. Such
      idiosyncratic reactions were not amenable to statistical
      evaluation.</p>

      <p align="center">Discussion</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      results obtained for the different psychological tests
      indicate that circumcision is perceived by the child as an
      aggressive attack on his body, which damaged, mutilated and
      in some cases totally destroyed him. The feeling of 'I am now
      castrated' seems to prevail in the psychic world of the
      child. As a result, he feels inadequate, helpless, and
      functions less efficiently.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following circumcision,
      the ego weakens under the impact of the experience, is unable
      to cope efficiently and adaptively to the trauma and the
      instinctual drives, as well as the anxieties initiated. The
      psychoanalytic hypothesis that circumcision will be perceived
      as castration, and specifically Anna Freud's hypothesis that
      operations in childhood render a feeling of reality to those
      anxieties are confirmed through this study.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      main reaction to the operation is an increase in aggressive
      drives. Not only does the child feel attacked, but also, as a
      reaction strives to attack those who have mutilated him. The
      quality of the aggressive feelings is as archaic as the
      perception of the operation.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      order to protect himself from the threats of the outside
      world and of the instinctual drives loosened by the operation
      the child's ego seems to find safety in withdrawal. As a
      defensive measure, the ego insulates itself from all stimuli
      and this is protected from external and internal dangers.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the
      psychoanalytic formulations are in general confirmed, some
      questions arise from the data. One interesting finding is the
      perception of the females as the castrators. Freud postulates
      that because of his Oedipal attachments to the mother, the
      boys expect retaliation from the <i>father</i>, and asserts
      that it is fear of castration which makes the boy give up his
      love object. Contrary to this formulation, we note in our
      results, that children perceive the females as the mutilators
      and aggressive impulses are directed at them with greater
      intensity and frequency. This contradictory finding may arise
      for a cultural and experimental factor.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
      cultural factors may have influenced the results of the study
      as follows: The Turkish child is closely bound to the mother
      and is so much under her control that immediate punishment
      and rewards of all kinds are expected from her; whereas the
      father is distant and detached member of the family and is
      systematically over-idealized by cultural codes and customs.
      It is most probable that the overidealization of the father
      and the close supervision of the mother initiate a deep
      repression of the hostile feelings nursed against him, allows
      freedom for the safe expression of the hostile feelings
      nursed against mother figures. The deeply repressed drives
      are apt to find expression in highly symbolic forms. In order
      not to create unreliability, such highly symbolic material
      was not evaluated in this study.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      second factor which might dispose the child to perceive the
      female as castrators, might be the facet that the
      investigator was a female.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      interviews with the mother, the visits to the home of the
      child before and after the operation, could have created in
      the child's mind, an association between circumcision and the
      female investigator.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no explanation
      was given to the child concerning the aim of psychological
      testing, it is most probable that the mothers explained to
      their children this unusual procedure in terms of
      circumcision. We suggest that the child help the investigator
      and the cooperating mother responsible for the mutilation and
      this displaced all his fury to the female figures. This
      issue, however, requires clarification by further
      research.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      second psychoanalytic hypothesis for which no definite
      evidence can be offered by this study is the one concerning
      the tendency towards femininity initated in the boy following
      circumcision. Only the results of the Goodenough DAM test
      reveal that most subjects experience some sort of confusion
      around their sexual identity following circumcision. But
      these results cannot as yet be accepted as proof of the
      tendency toward femininity. The Goodenough EAM test is not
      yet accepted as a reliable measure of such psychological
      trends.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAT,
      Stories, and the Rorschach offer little evidence on this
      subject. The first two tests are so heavily loaded with
      aggressive material that reference to libidinal impulses are
      non-existent. Although in both pre- and post-operative
      Rorschach protocols confusion over sexual identity is noted
      in some subjects, the degree and quantity of the confusion
      does not show any significant change after the operation. One
      fruitful evidence may be the decrease in phallic symbolism.
      However, neither this evidence nor the feeling of 'I am now
      castrated' can allow us to assert that circumcision disposes
      the child to femininity. Tendency to identify with the female
      is only one way of coping with castration anxiety; other
      measures such as reaction formation, denial, etc., can be
      used by the ego to cope with this feeling. Therefore we
      suggest that after the initial experience of defensive
      withdrawal disappears, during which time the ego will gain
      its strength over the instinctual drives and outside threats,
      it will integrate and synthesize the trauma and the resulting
      feelings from it into the structure of the personality. This
      synthesis is apt to be brought up in a different way in each
      child according to his history and experience (Nunberg,
      1931). Until this synthesis is achieved no definite
      assertions can be made concerning the course of the sexual
      tendencies in the circumcised child. To clarify the role of
      circumcision in the male homosexual, a longitudinal study
      needs to be arranged, which may also clarify the course of
      the sexual instincts and the synthetic function of the ego
      after a traumatic experience such as this.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      problem gains further significance when Nunberg's
      formulations of circumcision are taken into consideration.
      Nunberg postulates that circumcision may not only intimidate
      the boy's sexual impulses but may also stimulate this
      masculine strivings (Nunberg, 1947). How these two
      contradictory aims are achieved under the impact of
      circumcision deserves a great deal of attention. The Turkish
      male, with his strivings toward, on the one hand, bravery,
      courage and endurance to pain, and on the other hand total
      submission to authority, might offer a good example of the
      resolution of the conflict between masculinity and
      homosexuality. The relationship between cultural patterns and
      the synthesis achieved by the ego, following circumcision, in
      determining the course of the sexual instincts, is definitely
      a fruitful area for psychoanalytic investigation
      (Erikson,1950).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the broad
      theoretical issue, other areas of investigation are offered
      by this exploratory study.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no specific
      analysis was made on the relationship between the child's
      psychological state prior to circumcision and the intensity
      of reaction to it, in general, it seems that children with
      more severe emotional problems tend to display greater
      disturbance after the operation. In line with Anna Freud's
      formulations, the child with neurotic conflicts and poor
      defence mechanisms seemed to find it much harder to cope with
      the experience, and 'where the ego' was unable 'to cope with
      the anxiety released, the operation, became 'a trauma for the
      child' (<a href="/library/psych/freud/">Freud, A.,1952</a>).
      It is most probable that, in a longitudinal study, children
      with weaker ego strength will face greater difficulty in
      integrating the experience than those with reasonably good
      control.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      relationship was observed in the amount of information given
      to the child and his reaction to the operation. Those
      children who had received misleading information seemed to
      show greater disturbance than the two subjects whose mothers
      had enlightened and assured them. A study investigating the
      relation between the amount of information given to the child
      and the degree of reaction shown would be of value in
      clarifying this issue.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      study also raises a question concerning the socioeconomic
      level of the child and his ability to cope with traumatic
      experiences. Six children came from very deprived families
      and two were threatened by a realistic fear of starvation.
      One of these children were so fearful of total destruction
      that a mutilation, such as castration, was a relief to him.
      The other children with poor back- grounds also tended to
      take the experience more bravely than those with higher
      socio-economic standing and no physical deprivation.
      Clarification of this impression might be of value to those
      psychologists interested in the relationship between
      socio-economic level and endurance to psychological
      stress.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      order to evaluate the psychological effects of circumcision,
      a small study was arranged in which twelve children, from
      average and low socio-economic level, were given Goodenough
      and DAM test, CAT, Rorschach and two sets of stories, prior
      to the operation and following it. The results of the tests
      showed that circumcision, performed around the phallic stage
      is perceived by the child as an act of aggression and
      castration. It has detrimental effects on the child's
      functioning and adaptation, particularly on his ego strength.
      By weakening the controlling and defensive mechanisms of the
      ego, and initiating regression, it loosens the previously
      hidden fears, anxieties, and instinctual impulses, and
      renders a feeling of reality to them. <span
      class="yellow">What is expressed following the operation is
      primitive, archaic and unsocialized in character. As a
      defensive control and protection against the surge of the
      instinctual forces coming from within and the threats coming
      from outside, the ego of the child seeks safety in total
      withdrawal, this isolates and insulates itself from
      disturbing stimuli.</span></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      results of the study raised some questions concerning certain
      psychoanalytic formulations, for which further research was
      suggested. Possibilities for future research were also
      discussed.</p>
