Recovered Memories:
<P>
The report of the Working Party of the British Psychological Society
<P>
Executive Summary
<P>
The working party was charged with reporting on the scientific evidence
relevant to the current debate concerning Recovered Memories of Trauma and
with commenting on the issues surrounding this topic. We have reviewed the
scientific literature, carried out a survey of relevant members of the British
Psychological Society, and scrutinised the records of the British False Memory
Society. On this basis we came to the following conclusions:
<P>
Complete or partial memory loss is a frequently reported consequence of
experiencing certain kinds of psychological traumas including childhood sexual
abuse. These memories are sometimes fully or partially recovered after a gap
of many years.
<P>
Memories may be recovered within or independent of therapy. Memory recovery is
reported by highly experienced and well qualified therapists who are well
aware of the dangers of inappropriate suggestion and interpretation.
<P>
In general, the clarity and detail of event memories depends on a number of
factors, including the age at which the event occurred. Although clear
memories are likely to be broadly accurate, they may contain significant
errors. It seems likely that recovered memories have the same properties.
<P>
Sustained pressure or persuasion by an authority figure could lead to the
retrieval or elaboration of memories of events that never actually happened. 
The possibility of therapists creating in their clients false memories of
having been sexually abused in childhood warrants careful consideration, and
guidelines for therapists are suggested here to minimize the risk of this
happening. There is no reliable evidence at present that this is a widespread
phenomenon in the UK.
<P>
In a recent review of the literature on recovered memories, Lindsay and Read
commented that "the ground for debate has shifted from the question of the
possibility of therapy-induced false beliefs to the question of the prevalence
of therapy-induced false beliefs". We agree with this comment but add to it
that the ground for debate has also shifted from the question of the
possibility of recovery of memory from total amnesia to the question of the
prevalence of recovery of memory from total amnesia.
<P>
1.0 Introduction
<P>
This report sets out to investigate the scientific evidence surrounding the
phenomenon of recovered memories...
-----------------------------------
<P>
      footnote: the term recovered memories should not be taken to imply that
      the content necessarily refers to actual events, as would be required by
      usages of the term memory whereby, as a matter of definition, one cannot
      'remember' what never occurred. Our options are to place 'memory',
      'remember' and other terms in scare quotes or to use some extended
      phrase such as "reported recovered memories". We have preferred to use
      memory unadorned in an unrestrictive sense.
<P>
---------------------------------

<BR>..where adults come to report memories of childhood events, having previously
been in a state of total amnesia for those events. The members of the Working
Party started their deliberations from a variety of standpoints. In the
process of writing the report, we achieved consensus.
<P>
The cases which have evoked most public interest are those where the memories
are recovered by clients in therapy, and those memories are of extended,
traumatic sexual abuse. The amnesia could take the form that at the start of
therapy, when the clients were giving their life history, they would not be
aware of having been abused as a child. The client would report not having had
such a memory for some period of time previously, usually several years. One
claim is that such memories bear a reasonable approximation to the historical
truth. The counter claim is that amnesia and memory recovery of this kind are
impossible and that the memories are manufactured in therapy.
<P>
Our first aim is to consider the scientific information that is relevant to
the question of recovered memories of child sexual abuse. Our second aim is
that of providing guidelines for clinical practice in the light of such
information.
<P>
We do not question the existence of child sexual abuse (CSA) as a serious
social and individual problem with long lasting effects. Very large numbers of
children, boys and girls, have been and are being sexually abused, many of
them by their parents. Estimates of frequency in the adult population vary
with the sample and the definition of abuse. The minimum rate for women,
reported in representative community samples, is 6% for Child Sexual Abuse
involving physical contact, but some estimates are several times larger. We
are not directly concerned here with children who come forward to tell, or
with adults who have known about abuse all their lives and only recently felt
able to tell.
<P>
In some cases of public interest, the memories are reported in the course of
therapy which employs memory recovery techniques...
<P>
------------------------------------
<P>
      footnote: memory recovery techniques include: hypnosis, especially
      hypnotic regression, in which the hypnotised client is asked to imagine
      themself as a child; journalling, where the client keeps a journal to
      prompt and record recollections of the past; guided imagery; guided
      meditation; use of so-called truth drugs.
<P>
---------------------------------

<BR>..and the accused parents have denied the accusations. In the USA, an
organisation called the False Memory Syndrome Foundation was formed in 1992 as
a parents' support group. In the UK, an equivalent organisation, Adult
Children Accusing Parents (ACAP), was formed in 1993; this was renamed the
British False Memory Society. The position of the parents' associations is
that the recovered memories have been implanted by therapists who believe that
a wide variety of psychological problems - depression, eating disorders,
sexual dysfunction, low self esteem or difficulty maintaining a relationship,
suicidal or self-destructive thoughts - invariably indicate sexual abuse in
childhood.
<P>
In the USA, one problem is that a therapist is legally required to report any
allegation of sexual abuse, however long ago, however tentative, whether they
believe the allegation or not. Professionals not reporting such information
are liable to criminal prosecution. This leads to the early involvement of the
criminal justice system.
<P>
As a consequence, the structure of the public debate, particularly in the USA,
has led to people taking extreme positions. One such extreme position is to
argue that recovered memories are in principle impossible, and that therefore
those of the particular accuser must be impossible. Equally, attacks on the
principle of repression, adduced by some to be the major mechanism in amnesia
prior to recovered memories, are carried out to invalidate the explanation and
turn all recovered memories into false ones. A further extreme argument is to
say that if some recovered memories are unbelievable, then all must be.
Examples given include that of focusing on clear recovered memories of being
transported to past lives or to alien space ships or recovering memories of
having been abused in the first year of life or even in the womb. Next,
quotations are taken from one side of the debate and treated as though they
were typical of all statements from that side. Thus the following quotation
from a leading survivors' text, which most people would see as illogical and
inflammatory is used against the whole survivors' movement.
<P>
"If you think you were abused and your life shows the symptoms, then you were"
(Bass & Davies, 1988, p.22). On the other hand, some therapists and many
members of the survivors' movement believe that the discovery that some
recovered memories can be substantiated means that all recovered memories
could be substantiated. Further, the claims that a proportion of known
survivors of CSA suffer from particular ailments (e.g.  depression, eating
disorders) has led to the claim that all people suffering from these disorders
must have suffered CSA, whether they remember it or not. The allegation that
the FMS Foundation or the British FM Society could possibly function as a
refuge for perpetrators who joined the society for protection (possibilities
readily admitted by the founders of the respective societies) is argued to
weaken the position of these societies. All of these extreme positions are
clearly untenable from a logical, a scientific or a forensic point of view.
<P>
In the course of the debate raging in the United States, a number of claims
have been made concerning the properties of human memory. We intend to review
the available evidence. The issues which we address from the scientific
literature are as follows:
<P>
 How accurate is our memory under normal circumstances?  To what extent can we
be sure of the source of our memories? What special properties do early
memories have? What can we say about repression and other mechanisms of
forgetting? Is it possible to have false beliefs about the past? What are the
effects on memory of hypnotic techniques? Is there a relationship between
false confessions and false memories?
<P>
In following our enquiries, we have examined the records of the British False
Memory Society to get some idea of the characteristics of accusers and the
nature of their accusations. In addition we have carried out a survey of
relevant members of the British Psychological Society to investigate the
extent of recovered memories in clinical practice and to get some preliminary
indication of prevailing views about their validity.
<P>
In terms of therapy, we will not aim at any evaluation (e.g. did the process
have the desired effects on the condition?) but, rather, concentrate on the
propriety and reliability of particular memory recovery techniques. From this
basis we can then look at the application to recovered memories.
<P>
Note that we cannot, in any case, pass any judgement on any particular
instances of recovered memory. These are forensic matters rather than
scientific, and, as such, are beyond the scope of our enquiry.
<P>
1.1 A Framework for Memory
<P>
One view of human memory is that it is like a video-tape machine that
faithfully records, as if on film, every perception experienced by the
witness, permanently stores such recorded perceptions in the brain at  a
subconscious level and the brain accurately 'replays' them in their  original
form.  We will see that this picture is greatly mistaken.
<P>
To facilitate the task of understanding what follows, we present one kind of
simplified framework for the operation of our autobiographical memory system.
<P>
The framework represents the most important operations that take place during
registering and retrieval of memories. First we consider the setting up of the
original memory, as represented schematically in figure 1. When an event takes
place, information from the senses is captured and the resulting
representation is interpreted in the light of our previous experience. It is
this interpretation that we are aware of. Some aspects of the representation
and the interpretation are stored in memory. Figure 2 represents an idealised
view of the processes of remembering. Retrieval itself can be consciously
driven or unconscious and automatic. In the latter case you might be reminded
of some event involuntarily, or knowledge may be sought in order to help to
interpret the current scene. In either case the retrieval process would start
with an appropriate retrieval cue which is used to locate a particular memory
record. The retrieved information will undergo some processing prior to
awareness. This could include the incorporation of general knowledge or
material from another record. When we are aware of our memory we might produce
a narrative concerning it. Following the remembering, information will be
stored again, as a record of the remembering. Thus, next time you go round the
cycle and recall the event, you might be recalling the original, or you might
be recalling the previous time you recalled. This framework is rather
idealised and simplified. We will see the picture complicate in the following
sections.
<P>
2.0 Evidence for Claims
<P>
2.1 How accurate is our memory under normal circumstances?
<P>
Not every detail of our experience of an event is stored in memory. When the
record of an event is retrieved, then, it will be incomplete and might need
elaborating before it is intelligible to our consciousness. This would carried
out through the non-conscious processes referred to in Figure 2. What we are
conscious of is a mixture of reproduction and reconstruction. Reconstructive
memory is characterized by the conflation of different events, the filling out
of detail and importation of information, an extreme example being when entire
events are confabulated.
<P>
Factors that influence the degree of reconstruction include: 
<P>
      -the personal significance of the event
      -its emotive content
      -the amount of time elapsed between the event occurring and it being
      remembered,
      -the reasons why the person is remembering the event
      -the circumstances of recall.
<P>
Events that are personally highly significant evoke deep beliefs, attitudes
and emotional reactions and may lead to a narrowing of attention. As a
consequence, memories for peripheral details of such events may be more
vulnerable to reconstructive error. Central details are likely to be
remembered better but may still be in error. Research in autobiographical
memory has demonstrated that people can sometimes dramatically misremember
aspects of highly significant events, with these fictions being regarded as
"fact". Importantly, this can occur without any conscious awareness on the
part of the person. On the other hand, even minor details from highly
significant events can be reproduced with little distortion. An analysis of
the statements of 27 of the survivors of the Marchioness disaster produced 86
minor factual claims (such as who was where at different phases of the
incident) which were in principle verifiable. Of these, 74 were verified in
other statements. There was only one anomalous pair of claims.
<P>
Repeated events lead to a schematic, generalised representation which is used
as a framework for recall of these events. As a result, individual events are
liable to become confused. Thus, John Dean, Nixon's aide at the time of
Watergate, claimed that he had a verbatim memory. His testimony, when compared
with the tapes that Nixon made of White House conversations, showed that he
generally got the gist correct, but often moved specific conversations from
one time to another or combined two or more
incidents into a new imagined one.
<P>
summary... Normal event memory is largely accurate but may contain distortions
and elaborations.
<P>
2.2 To what extent can we be sure of the source of our memories?
<P>
One of the strongest criteria for being certain an event has happened to us is
that we are able to anchor it in time and place. Being able to do this enables
us to link the event with our personal history. If an imagined event easily
fits the mental record of our daily lives, then it would be difficult to
distinguish from a real event.
<P>
Experimental research suggests that under most circumstances people can
successfully distinguish events that happened from events that were imagined.
However, if there is extensive rehearsal of an imagined event, the person can
begin to believe that the event actually happened. The memory can become
highly detailed and "vivid" to the person. Additionally, erroneous information
given to the person after an event has been experienced can come to alter the
memory for the event. The research demonstrating such breakdowns in reality
monitoring has been primarily conducted with adults.
<P>
There are many experiments showing that recall for an event can be altered in
matters of detail by suggestion or leading questions. The evidence suggests
that such change often reflects factors such as compliance with the
researcher's expectations, rather than genuine alterations in memory.
Accordingly, people's suggestibility can be significantly reduced if they can
be persuaded to pay more attention to locating the source of their memories.
<P>
summary... With certain exceptions, such as where there has been extensive
rehearsal of an imagined event, the source of our memories is generally
perceived accurately.
<P>
2.3 How Reliable is Recall of Early Events?
<P>
It is sometimes claimed that there are circumstances where recall of an early
event is exact. Such claims cannot be upheld.
<P>
A recent experiment on recall of events that are known to have taken place
early in life is by Usher and Neisser (1993). They targeted university
students known to have experienced the birth of a sibling, hospitalisation,
the death of a family member or moving house when they were between the ages
of 1 to 5. Birth of a sibling was best remembered, though three quarters of
the subjects who had experienced this between one and two years old remembered
nothing of the event, the other quarter answering about half the questions
they were asked about times, places, visits to the hospital and so on. Mothers
largely confirmed details of the memories. No-one could recall anything at all
of a house move that took place during the second year of life.
<P>
From this study we may conclude that for some people, some events occurring
in the second year could be registered in memory in a form that is partially
recoverable in adulthood. However, it is also possible that these successfully
corroborated memories were not the original memories laid down at the time of
the events but, rather, at least partially manufactured through family stories
with the aid of photos or other memorabilia concerning the event. Other
studies, obtaining similar results, are less open to this objection, however.
<P>
In Usher and Neisser's experiment, memory performance increased steadily with
age at occurrence for all events. For events occurring at 5 years, an average
of about half the questions were being answered. The decrease in memory as the
events become earlier represents the phenomenon of infantile amnesia which
Freud had noted and accounted for by the concept of repression (e.g. Freud,
1933/1973, pp.58-59). However, a number of recent accounts of infantile
amnesia do not require the concept of repression. Rather they rely on normal
cognitive or social mechanisms and imply that memory is in some way organised
differently during the first four years of life from the way it is organised
later. The consequence of this is that early memories either cannot be
accessed or do not exist in an accessible form. Infantile amnesia becomes a
natural consequence of the development of the memory system. 
<P>
Within this framework, then, we can see how abuse which takes place before the
age of 4 or thereabouts and does not continue beyond that age might not be
retrievable in adulthood in a narrative form. Even if a memory which had been
created in the first few years were retrievable, there is an additional
problem that it would not be in a form that the individual could fully make
sense of. An example of this is given by Terr (1991):
<P>
"Three and a half years after experiencing a series of traumatic events, a 5-
year-old child was discovered (through pornographic photographs confiscated by
U.S. Customs agents) to have been sexually misused in a day-care home between
the ages of 15 and 18 months. The girl's parents did not dare to speak to her
about what they had learned from the investigators.  They, in retrospect,
realized that she had been sketching hundreds of nude adults beginning from
the time when she had first begun to draw.
<P>
"While playing in my office, this child told me that a baby she had just drawn
was "all naked" and "a bad girl." Unknowingly, she had just depicted herself.
Despite the fact that the little girl's only verbal memory of the events was
"I think there was grave danger at a lady - MaryBeth's - house," her volumes
of drawings represented strongly visualized elements that she had retained and
had needed to recreate from these very early, nonverbal experiences." (Terr,
1991, p.12).
<P>
We have no reason to suppose that a very early memory, previously not recalled
and intentionally recovered by an adult would be any more intelligible. It
would remain fragmentary. This is not to say that, as an adult, we could not
interpret these fragments. What might happen is that the adult would create a
frame of reference within which the fragments could be fitted, and a new
memory would be created with all the imported material from the story frame.
The existence of the fragments, including affect and imagery, could make the
newly created narrative seem real, even though the actual source of the
fragments remained undiscovered.
<P>
There is no doubt that children can learn and remember from the earliest
months of life, but such 'memories' are implicit rather than explicit: they
are reflected in behaviour but remain beyond awareness and so cannot be
expressed verbally. Thus, Myers, Clifton and Clarkson (1987) traced a group of
children now aged around 3 who had taken part in research on their hearing
when aged between 6-40 weeks. These children were re-tested in the same room
using the same equipment as previously and their behaviour compared to
controls who had not taken part in the earlier experiments. Results showed
that the experienced children played more, and looked longer at the sound
sources like the rattle and drum, than did the controls. However, only one
child showed any awareness of having been in the room before.
<P>
summary... Nothing can be recalled accurately from before the first birthday
and little from before the second. Poor memory from before the 4th birthday is
normal.
<P>
2.4 What can we say about repression and other mechanisms of forgetting?
<P>
The literature is highly inconsistent in the use of the term "repressed
memory". Most discussions of repression focus on the hypothesized active
inhibition of previously clear conscious memories for events, whether as a
result of a conscious or an unconscious process.  In our framework, this is
equivalent to a blockage between retrieval and awareness. This mechanism has
been used as an explanatory principle for recovered memories and the reality
of such a mechanism has been the focus of attack by proponents of false
memories. However, there are a number of alternative mechanisms for not
remembering, which correspond to interruptions at different points in the
processing in Figures 1 and 2:  The memory has never been consciously
available because of "blacking out" at the time. The existence of "blacking
out" in the course of some types of trauma is relatively well documented,
although this has not generally been suggested in the case of childhood abuse
and in any case memories from the period of "blacking out" are not thought to
be ever recovered. The memory is not part of a person's habitual belief about
themselves, i.e. the person does not routinely think "I am a person who has
experienced X".  The memory would not be retrieved or would be excluded at the
point of non-conscious processing in Figure 2. The memory has come to mind in
whole or in part (flashbacks, fragments etc.) but was labelled or interpreted
as something different.  The memory has not come to mind because the person
has never encountered the relevant retrieval cues.  Event memory has been
compartmentalised ("dissociated" is a term often used) so that certain events
are only recalled when the individual is in a particular state of mind. The
individual's state of mind would determine the nature of the retrieval cues
which were formed and hence influence the success or failure of the retrieval
attempt. In extreme instances, this condition may have the label multiple
personality disorder or dissociative identity disorder (see DSM IV, p. 484)
where different "personalities" are amnesic to each other's experiences..
<P>
Trauma has a variety of effects. Sargant (1967) reports that during World War
II there were many cases of what he called acute hysterical losses of memory.
After Dunkirk, a hundred and fifty of the first thousand admissions to his
care were diagnosed that way. The treatment was to inject sodium amytal which
brought the memory back, often accompanied by overwhelming emotional release
and a reliving of the forgotten experiences. It has recently been argued that
repeated or extended severe trauma or abuse is more likely to lead to extreme
amnesia than single episodes. This would account for the discrepancy between
Sargant's data and the data from the Marchioness survivors already referred
to.
<P>
In common with victims of some other forms of trauma, survivors of childhood
abuse may sometimes experience periods when trauma-related memories intrude
into consciousness and they routinely report attempts to avoid or block out
these memories.
There is also experimental evidence with normal subjects in support of active
inhibitory processes in memory. Work on "directed forgetting" indicates that
prior instructions to forget certain items renders those items more difficult
to recall, although not to recognise. What is not clear is whether this
deliberate process of blocking out specific memories can lead to a more
general memory loss. The majority of the evidence cited in favour of this type
of repressive process comes from clinical case studies. In a number of
studies, surveys of sexual abuse survivors report between one third and two
thirds having periods of time when they totally or partially forgot the abuse.
Only one study made explicit the distinction between total and partial
forgetting, reporting a rate of 19 percent total amnesia. Two studies
addressed the issue of the corroboration of the abuse but neither looked
separately at cases where complete amnesia had been reported. This issue and
the issue of the process of recovery of memories are in need of further
enquiry.
<P>
summary... Forgetting of certain kinds of trauma is often reported, although
the nature of the mechanism or mechanisms involved remains unclear.
<P>
2.5 Is it possible to have false beliefs about the past?
<P>
First of all we wish to make a distinction between false memories (where the
event never happened) and incorrect memories (where the event happened but the
details are wrong). Since event memories are often fragmentary, there will
always be a tendency to pad them out in order to make them coherent. The
extent of this is not readily detectible by the individual since there is an
unstable relationship between confidence and accuracy. An entirely false
memory is quite a different matter.
<P>
The morning after the Challenger space shuttle disaster, Neisser & Harsch
(1993) had freshman students write down what they had been doing at the time
they heard the news. Three years later the students were asked again to recall
the circumstances, particularly where they had been, what they had been doing
and who told them. It is not surprising that 11 out of the 44 subjects got
zero correct - they incorrectly remembered how they heard the news, where they
had been, who they had been with and what they had been doing at the time; it
is surprising that three of them rated themselves as absolutely certain of
every aspect of their recall. When they were shown what they had written three
years previously some subjects argued that they must have been wrong
previously (24 hours after the event) because they were so certain that they
were correct now! One thing that all the subjects had in common is that they
recalled an event which was characterised as hearing about the disaster. None
of them denied the fact that they had heard about the event nor did any claim
complete forgetting of all detail.
<P>
More serious would be remembering an event that had not taken place. This
would be an instance of a false memory. There are one or two preliminary,
research-based examples of where adults have been persuaded that particular
things have happened to them. For example, Loftus reports that certain adults
and adolescents can be made to believe that they had been lost when young in a
particular shopping mall, and they proceed to invent details of the fictitious
event. We can think of this in terms of a memory record being created from
material in the interview in such a way that the contents appear to be from a
real event. Some people appear to be more susceptible than others to
suggestion and people under hypnosis are particularly vulnerable to suggestion
both that false things did happen and that real things did not happen.
Authority figures would be more likely to influence memory. Much of the attack
from the False Memory organisations is on therapists who strongly suggest to
their clients that they have suffered CSA. However, it is also the case that
people traumatised as children are more suggestible as well as susceptible to
hypnosis. There are a number of reports of individual cases of apparent false
beliefs being created, often after extended directed therapy. These issues are
complex and are more forensic than scientific matters. However, overall, we
agree with Lindsay and Read (1994) in a recent comprehensive review:
<P>
"There is little reason to fear that a few suggestive questions will lead
psychotherapy clients to conjure up vivid and compelling illusory memories of
childhood sexual abuse. " p.294
<P>
summary... While there is a great deal of evidence for incorrect memories,
there is currently much less evidence on the creation of false memories.
<P>
2.6 What are the effects on memory of hypnotic techniques?
<P>
It is popularly believed that hypnosis can be used to help people to recall
events or other material which had hitherto eluded them. In particular, the
use of hypnosis has been common in criminal cases. It has sometimes been used
in conjunction with age regression in cases where it has been claimed that
memories have been recovered.
<P>
Hypnotic memory enhancement is based on the belief that human memory
faithfully records every perception, permanently stores such recorded
perceptions and accurately 'replays' them in their original form when the
witness is placed under hypnosis and asked to remember them. None of these
suppositions are correct, and experimental attempts to demonstrate
improvements in memory as a result of hypnosis have failed even on highly
susceptible subjects. Most studies also conclude that hypnosis increases the
suggestibility of subjects to information suggested by the hypnotist.
<P>
There are one or two quite spectacular examples of the successful use of
hypnosis in criminal cases. The problem is that there are innumerable
failures. The successes, then, could be due not directly to the hypnosis, but
indirectly to a factor such as increased relaxation. Where the possibility of
objective verification has been present, it has been shown that recall under
hypnosis is very insecure. In effect, under hypnosis, the individual's ability
to track the source of individual bits of information is greatly impaired=2E
<P>
Hypnotic Age Regression is often used with the objective of encouraging
individuals to relive past events which are unavailable for recall. The
problem is that the relived episodes incorporate incorrect information. This
was demonstrated in an experimental investigation of age regression conducted
by O'Connell, Shor and Orne (1970). Subjects were required to try to recall
names of their school classmates. They recalled more under hypnosis but they
also tended to confabulate more. In checking the descriptions produced by the
subjects, the experimenters discovered that some of the individuals described
had not been members of the subject's class. Nash (1987) carried out a survey
of 60 years of empirical study on investigations of whether there is
reinstatement of childhood psychological or physiological faculties during
hypnotic age regression. Of those studies that met minimum standards for
experimental control, none showed any reliable memory effects.
<P>
There are legal cautions against the use of evidence obtained through
hypnosis. In the 1980s a number of American states ruled that evidence
acquired from a witness who has undergone hypnosis could not be admitted in
court. In a recent UK criminal case, R v Browning, an appeal was allowed where
a key witness had undergone hypnosis prior to giving testimony. Reputable
organisations such as the British Society of Experimental and Clinical
Hypnosis have firm guidelines on the use of hypnosis, which warn against using
it as a means of memory retrieval.
<P>
It is known that hypnosis can be used to induce amnesia. Routinely, hypnotised
subjects are given posthypnotic suggestions ("when the bell rings you will
scratch your ear") and are told to forget the suggestion itself. Under certain
circumstances they will recall the suggestion when back under hypnosis. This
state resembles the clinical condition of dissociation. People working with
known child sexual offenders report that some abusers describe using
techniques similar to hypnotic control during abuse. It would seem possible,
then, that some abused children, at least, could be described as having
posthypnotic amnesia.
<P>
summary... Hypnosis makes memory more confident and less reliable.  It can
also be used to create amnesia for events.
<P>
2.7 Are False Memories like False Confessions?
<P>
There are numerous documented examples of innocent persons confessing to
crimes they could not have conceivably committed, sometimes accompanied by
otherwise convincing detail. Is there a parallel here with "false memories"?
The answer seems to be if there is any parallel, it is a very imperfect one.
<P>
First, according to Gudjonsson (1992), many confessions are coerced, that is
the individual is encouraged to make confession through threats or inducements
offered by the interrogator; they make a confession in order to try to escape
from the situation they find themselves in. There is no suggestion that they
actually believe themselves guilty of the crime to which they confess. Perhaps
a closer parallel is the voluntary confession: suspects on occasion will come
to believe that they must have committed a crime despite their initial
denials. Such voluntary confessions are frequently the result of a long period
of interrogation when accusations are repeatedly put to the suspect that they
are guilty. Such individuals may confess under the belief that they must have
been responsible, even though they were unaware of the event.
<P>
----------------------------------
<P>
      footnote: An example, of this was Carole Richardson's 'confession' of
      involvement in the Guildford bombings where she eventually concluded she
      must have been present but so far under the influence of drink and drugs
      as not to recollect the event clearly.
----------------------------------
<P>
However, even with voluntary confessions the analogy with "false memory" is
very inexact. Both groups will show belief in their stories and display often
quite convincing details. Both may arise from prolonged interviewing in which
certain themes are repeated over and over again. However, apparent memories of
abusive incidents from childhood can occur quite spontaneously, usually
triggered by some outside event or agency quite independent of any ongoing
therapy. Moreover, false confessions are quickly abandoned in the face of
contradictory evidence - Carole Richardson rapidly came to the conclusion that
the events she had described could not have happened - whereas "false
memories" are persistent and survive repeated denials by others of the reality
of the events victims describe.
<P>
summary... There are a number of significant differences between false
confessions and false (recovered) memories which preclude generalising from
one to the other.
<P>
3 Our own enquiries
<P>
Public debate has focused on issues imported from the American experience:
Recovered memories occur during extended therapy The therapists concerned have
strong a priori beliefs concerning CSA. Memories are recovered from impossibly
early ages  Accusers always recover memories from total amnesia. We have
carried out some preliminary enquiries to test the likely extension of these
issues to the UK.
<P>
3.1 The BPS RM Survey
<P>
One of the issues in the national and international debate concerns incidence
of recovered memories and related phenomena among well trained practitioners.
We decided to obtain some preliminary answers by circulating BPS accredited
practitioners with a one page survey. This study will be reported in detail
elsewhere and the results presented here should be regarded as preliminary. We
had answers from 810 Chartered Psychologists who see nonpsychotic adult
clients.
<P>
---------------------------------
<P>
      footnote: This was defined as follows "we are interested in are adult
      clients (over 18) with non-psychotic disorders - i.e. excluding
      schizophrenic, manic-depressive or organic disorders. These clients
      could be using or attending mental health services or being seen for
      mental health reasons in primary care or private practice."
<P>
---------------------------------
<P>
Over ninety percent have seen clients in the last year who report CSA (child
sexual abuse). We asked particularly about clients who reported recovering
memories from complete amnesia. About a third of our respondents said that
they had had clients recovering such memories before they had any therapy=2E
More than one in five have at least one client in the last year who recovered
a memory of CSA and nearly a third (a total of 225) have clients recovering
memories of a traumatic experience other than CSA. Over half the responders
have had at some time clients recovering memories of some kind.
<P>
Recovered memories are seen as sometimes or usually "essentially accurate" by
nine out of ten of our group. A negligible number of our sample believed that
recovered memories were always accurate. Two thirds of our respondents thought
that false memories were possible, and more than one in seven believed that
their own clients had experienced false memories.
<P>
summary... There are high levels of belief in the essential accuracy of
recovered memories of child sexual abuse among qualified psychologists. These
beliefs appear to be fuelled by the high levels of experience of recovered
memories both for CSA and for non-CSA traumatic events. The non-doctrinaire
nature of these beliefs is indicated by the high level of acceptance of the
possibility of false memories.
<P>
3.2 Summary of Investigation of the Records of the British False Memory
Society
<P>
Considering the nature of the claims concerning children accusing parents in
the USA, we wished to determine whether a similar state of affairs existed in
Britain. The British False Memory Society had 250 enquiries at the beginning
according to its director. A record had been completed for 200 of these cases.
The rest involved individuals who had given no information about themselves,
but had requested information about the society. In the time available to us,
over two visits during November 1993, we managed to examine all but 19 of the
200 cases (n=3D181). The information in the case records was inconsistent and
varied. About half of those we examined were very brief sketchy
unsystematically recorded notes from telephone enquiries revealing very little
of the actual circumstances. The remaining 54% (97/181) contained sufficient
information to enable us to extract some crude statistics and it is estimated
that around a third of the records contained other supporting material, most
usually in the form of letters from the accuser.
<P>
In contrast to the British FMS, the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in the
USA, founded in March 1992, had received several thousand enquiries by January
1994 according to its newsletter. At the time of writing there had been no
report of any external or internal examination of FMS Foundation records, and
it is not known what proportion of the contacts are genuine, or pertain
specifically to accusations of sexual abuse involving recovered memories.
However, 487 callers were mailed questionnaires in 1992 asking for details of
family background and the adult life of the accusing child. There were 284
respondents. A report of the FMS Foundation's survey was produced in summer
1993 by the director of the FMS foundation. Findings from the British records
are compared here with the results of this survey, where ever the same
information is available from the two sources. It should be borne in mind,
however, that both open and closed questions were asked of the accused in the
FMSF survey, whereas the data we had available came from unsolicited
information provided by the accused (67%) or someone closely related to the
accused (33%), with supporting material from accusers in approximately one
third of the records.

One major difference in the information collected concerns the recovery of
repressed memories. Close examination of the 97 British FMS records with
sufficient information revealed that in only just under half was there
explicit mention of memory recovery from total amnesia. If all the records we
examined are considered this proportion is reduced to a quarter (47/181). The
FMS Foundation state in the report of their survey that all accusations 'are
based on recovered "repressed" memories'. They give no information about how
this has been documented, or the nature of recovery, i.e. from total or
partial amnesia, although 18% of the accused could not say how many years
(within a 10 year range) the accuser's memory had been repressed.
<P>
summary... There is not a lot of evidence that accusers fit a single profile.
=46rom the British records, at least, there is no good evidence that accusers
have invariably recovered memories from total amnesia. Further documentation
of the phenomenon is needed by the False Memory societies in order to obtain a
more reliable picture. It appears that only in a small minority of instances
do the accusations concern abuse that ended before the age of 5.
<P>
4.0 Clinical Issues
<P>
4.1 Characteristics of Verified Abuse in Adulthood.
<P>
Among the claims of the FMS Foundation are that the adult children who are now
making accusations of abuse had happy and problem-free childhoods. No evidence
has been offered by them in support of this claim, and it is contradicted by
the Foundation's own data, which indicate a high rate of alcohol and drug
problems in the families. It should perhaps be noted that, in general, parents
consistently rate their children as happier and better adjusted than the
children rate themselves, and rate the quality of family relationships as
higher than they are rated by the children. Certainly it would be surprising
if independent assessment of a group of sexually abused children did not
reveal more dysfunction than in a control group. The kinds of dysfunction
empirically associated with CSA in children are sexualised behaviour,
behaviour and learning problems at school, depression and suicidal ideation,
low self-esteem, sleep disturbance, withdrawal, anxiety, and running away=2E
With the exception of sexualised behaviour, however, all these symptoms occur
in dysfunctional families and are not specific to CSA. It is possible that CSA
may also lead to sexually inhibited behaviour and to delay in forming sexual
relationships with peers. Recently, a number of studies have examined the
additional contribution made by CSA over and above general family problems.
The general conclusion is that while CSA is embedded in general family
problems, it makes an additional contribution to mental health outcome.
<P>
4.2 Long-Term Effects of Childhood Trauma
<P>
Most of the research in this area has focused on sexual abuse in childhood
(CSA) with a limited literature on childhood physical abuse (CPA). The age at
which childhood ends is usually defined as between 15 and 17.
<P>
Greater long-term harm is associated with more severe abuse, particularly
abuse involving a father or stepfather, penetration, use of force or violence.
Considering only evidence from representative community studies, with one
exception, all studies investigating depression in adult life as an outcome
for CSA have demonstrated significant results. In addition, about half the
above studies have shown anxiety to be more common in CSA survivors. By way of
illustration, in one study of over 1500 women (Stein et al, 1988) lifetime
prevalence of anxiety disorders was 37% in CSA survivors compared with 14%
with no CSA. Rates for lifetime depression were 22% and 6% respectively.
<P>
Eating Disorders have also been investigated in relation to childhood trauma,
but with conflicting results. Most of the work has been carried out on
clinical populations. In the main, it appears that bulimic behaviour may be
more highly associated with a history of CSA than anorexia. More
representative studies are needed, although those that exist show CSA to be a
risk factor for eating disorders. Andrews, Valentine and Valentine (in press)
show a cohort effect: older women with CSA or CPA are more likely to be
chronically or recurrently depressed, while younger women with such a history
are more likely to have bulimic symptoms.
<P>
Studies of clinical populations show raised rates of trauma of between 90% and
50% of patients reporting a major physical or sexual assault at some time in
their lives. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that patients with
such histories have more severe symptoms, borderline diagnoses and more
suicidal symptoms than other patients. Three clinical studies of Multiple
Personality Disordered patients in particular have shown rates of between 75%
and 90% for CSA and 50% and 82% for CPA.
<P>
In conclusion, the examples we give indicate that CSA substantially increases
the risk of a variety of mental health problems in later life, but it does not
invariably lead to such problems. Factors such as severity of the abuse,
quality of early and later support and biological vulnerability may all
influence outcome. Similarly, CSA cannot explain all psychopathology and is
not the only traumatic experience related to increased risk of disorders such
as depression, anxiety and bulimia. Physical and emotional abuse, and other
abusive and stressful experiences throughout the life course have been shown
to be independent risk factors for these disorders (e.g. Mullen et al, 1993;
Andrews, in press).
<P>
4.3 Issues in Clinical Practice
<P>
Although experimental evidence for repression and other forms of not knowing
about trauma is scant, many clinicians report that forgetting of childhood
trauma is common amongst clients with mental health problems. In our own
survey (see 3.1 above) nine out of ten of the respondents had clients who had
at some time recovered memories of CSA. In the last 10 years or so, the
recognition of childhood trauma of sexual abuse has become common place
amongst mental health professionals. Many clients with severe mental health
problems appear to have experienced disturbed and abusive childhoods. One
problem with respect to recovered memories is assessing the likelihood of
abuse given a presenting symptom.
<P>
We are agreed that it is important for both clinical and ethical reasons to
avoid distorting the client's view of their background, particularly through
suggestion; this would be a false solution for the client and could lead to
considerable distress within the client's family. Moreover it is important not
to form premature conclusions about the truth status of a recovered memory.
The therapist should be genuinely neutral about this, helping the client to
think about what his/her experiences might have been but without imposing the
therapist's own conclusions. This involves considerable tolerance of
uncertainty and reflects a very difficult discipline required on the part of
the therapist. The therapist should help the client to consider a range of
possibilities - that the material may be literally true, may be metaphorically
true, may derive from fantasy or dream imagery. Illustrations of metaphorical
truth might be, for example, imagery of rape which represents experiences with
a father whose behaviour was intrusive but not literally sexual. Imagery of
the murder of a baby could represent a memory which is literally true or might
metaphorically represent a baby part of the self having been "murdered". The
therapist him/herself cannot know the truth.
<P>
4.4 Guidelines for therapists
<P>
The following guidelines are intended to apply to a range of psychological
therapies.
<P>
1. It may be necessary clinically for the therapist to be open to the
emergence of memories of trauma which are not immediately available to the
client's consciousness.
<P>
2. It is important for the therapist to be alert to the dangers of suggestion.
<P>
3. While it is important always to take the client seriously, the therapist
should avoid drawing premature conclusions about the truth of a recovered
memory.
<P>
4. The therapist needs to tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the
client's early experience.
<P>
5. Whilst it may be part of the therapists' work to help their clients to
think about their early experiences, they should avoid imposing their own
conclusions about what took place in childhood.
<P>
6. The therapist should be alert to a range of possibilities, for example that
a recovered memory may be literally true, metaphorically true or may derive
from fantasy or dream material.
<P>
7. If the role of the professional is to obtain evidence that is reliable in
forensic terms, they need to restrict themselves to procedures that enhance
reliability (e.g. use of the Cognitive Interview and avoidance of hypnosis or
suggestion and leading questions).
<P>
8. CSA should not be diagnosed on the basis of presenting symptoms such as
eating disorder alone. There is a high probability of false positives, as
there are other possible explanations for psychological problems.

6.0          Overall Conclusions
<P>
 Normal event memory is largely accurate but may contain distortions and
elaborations.
<P>
 With certain exceptions, such as where there has been extensive rehearsal of
an imagined event, the source of our memories is generally perceived
accurately.
<P>
 Nothing can be recalled accurately from before the first birthday and little
from before the second. Poor memory from before the 4th birthday is normal.
<P>
 Forgetting of certain kinds of trauma is often reported, although the nature
of the mechanism or mechanisms involved remains unclear.
<P>
 While there is a great deal of evidence for incorrect memories, there is
currently much less evidence on the creation of false memories.
<P>
 Hypnosis makes memory more confident and less reliable. It can also be used
to create amnesia for events.
<P>
 There are a number of significant differences between false confessions and
false (recovered) memories which preclude generalising from one to the other.
<P>
 There are high levels of belief in the essential accuracy of recovered
memories of child sexual abuse among qualified psychologists. These beliefs
appear to be fuelled by the high levels of experience of recovered memories
both for CSA and for non-CSA traumatic events. The non-doctrinaire nature of
these beliefs is indicated by the high level of acceptance of the possibility
of false memories.
<P>
 There is not a lot of evidence that accusers fit a single profile.  From the
British records, at least, there is no good evidence that accusers have
invariably recovered memories from total amnesia. Further documentation of the
phenomenon is needed by the False Memory societies in order to obtain a more
reliable picture. It appears that only in a small minority of instances do the
accusations concern abuse that ended before the age of 5.
<P>
  Guidelines can be laid down for good practice in therapy.
<P>
7.0 Recommendations
<P>
1. We recommend that the Society use all means available to ensure that
Chartered Psychologists who carry out therapy do so in accordance with our
guidelines.
<P>
2. We recommend that BPS approved training courses in psychological therapies
should include appropriate information concerning the properties of human
memory.
<P>
3. We recommend that the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists, Nursing and General
Practice, and the psychotherapy training organisations affiliated to the
United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy and the British Confederation of
Psychotherapists should initiate equivalent action.
<P>
4. We recommend that the Department of Health, MRC and ESRC give increased
priority to research in the areas covered in the report, particularly those
which integrate cognitive and clinical approaches. Examples include
naturalistic studies of recovered memory, basic research on inhibitory
processes of memory and beliefs and practices in psychotherapy.
<P>
5. We recommend that the Department of Health take our findings into
consideration in their review of NHS psychotherapy services, in relation to
the quality of psychotherapy services and training.
<P>
6. We recommend that the Society and the Department of Health bring
appropriate parts of our report to the attention of the general public to
enable therapy clients to evaluate the conceptual and scientific basis of
alternative therapies.
