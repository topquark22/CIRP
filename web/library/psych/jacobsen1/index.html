      <h2>Perinatal origin of adult self-destructive behavior.</h2>

      <h4>Bertil Jacobson, Eklund G, Hamberger L, Linnarsson D,
      Sedvall G, Valverius M</h4>

      <p>Department of Medical Engineering,<br />
       State Institute of Forensic Medicine in Stockholm,<br />
       Solna, Sweden.</p>

      <p>The study was undertaken to test whether obstetric
      procedures are of importance for eventual adult behavior of
      the newborn, as ecological data from the United States seem
      to indicate. Birth record data were gathered for 412 forensic
      victims comprising suicides, alcoholics and drug addicts born
      in Stockholm after 1940, and who died there in 1978-1984. The
      births of the victims were unevenly distributed among six
      hospitals. Comparison with 2,901 controls, and mutual
      comparison of categories, showed that suicides involving
      asphyxiation were closely associated with asphyxia at birth,
      suicides by violent mechanical means were associated with
      mechanical birth trauma and drug addiction was associated
      with opiate and/or barbiturate administration to mothers
      during labor. Irrespective of the mechanism transferring the
      birth trauma to adulthood---which might be analogous to
      imprinting---the results show that obstetric procedures
      should be carefully evaluated and possibly modified to
      prevent eventual self-destructive behavior.</p>
