        <p>[CIRP Note: This paper is interesting in that it
        illustrates the cultural blindness of some authors that is
        often seen in circumcising cultures. The authors of this
        case report were unable to see that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The patient's original neonatal circumcision was a
          genital mutilation;</li>

          <li>The patient's actions obviously were a crude attempt
          to reverse the damage caused by his circumcision;</li>

          <li>Plastic surgeons' unwillingness to reverse his
          circumcision may have contributed to this patient's
          mental state.]</li>

          <li>Australia formerly was a almost completely
          circumcised nation. The medical doctors who authored this
          paper were almost certainly circumcised. Had the authors
          had intact foreskins, this paper may not have been
          written, or if it had been written, then it most likely
          would have had very different content.]</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p align="justify">Circumcision has been viewed in the
      analytic literature as a symbolic form of castration (Freud,
      1913) and also, opposingly, as an affirmation of masculinity
      (Nunberg, 1947). The proponents of either view could not have
      wished for more fertile ground on which to argue the salience
      of these constructs.</p>

      <h3>Case report</h3>

          <td align="center"><b>Fig. 1.</b> The patient's genitalia

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      33-year-old circumcised boat-repairer presented to an
      emergency department after unsuccessfully attempting to
      refashion a foreskin for himself. He had allegedly acquired
      surgical equipment from an undisclosed `doctor friend'. The
      patient had become familiar with a staged reconstructive
      procedure through reading surgical texts and his membership
      of an organization which lobbies against circumcision. The
      patient had discontinued the first stage of the procedure
      when he was unable to control local bleeding. By then he had.
      in turn, `ring-barked' the base of his penis, dragged forward
      the scrotal skin and sutured this skin over his penis (Fig.
      1).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      surgery had been carried out in a clear sensorium. The
      patient denied using anaesthetics, analgesics, or
      psychoactive compounds. There were no psychotic features and
      the patient derived no erotic gratification from the
      procedure.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      patient had been circumcised in infancy. He had been
      pre-occupied with his absent foreskin from the age of ten
      when he first learned about normal male anatomy at school. He
      had subsequently felt deformed and `incomplete'. Since his
      early 20s the patient had consulted a number of plastic
      surgeons to have a foreskin refashioned but was allegedly
      rejected by them. In his late 20s the patient had joined an
      American organization which campaigns against circumcision.
      He had received from the a variety of brochures detailing
      surgical and non-surgical reconstructive techniques. The
      patient had tried a non-invasive, stretching method to
      restore his foreskin, but this had not proved successful.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
      had been one previous dysmorphophobic symptom which related
      to an asymptomatic congenital hernia of the left leg.
      Although the defect was trivial, the outcome of elective
      repair at age 23 was catastrophic. The development of
      post-operative infection necessitated extensive grafts of
      skin, tendon, and nerve tissue. The patient was admitted for
      many months and had a residual foot drop.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
      was no previous formal psychiatric history. One of the
      patient's brothers was thought to have had anorexia nervosa,
      for which he had no treatment. There was no other family
      history of major psychiatric illness.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      patient recounted an emotionally deprived childhood. He was
      the eldest of three brothers. The patient's father, a museum
      curator, was remembered as punitive and distant. The
      patient's mother was more available but was perceived as
      having been affectionless. She had been preoccupied with
      trying to adopt a daughter throughout the patient's childhood
      and adolescence. She openly expressed her disappointment in
      having had sons and frequently criticised them. They were
      chided, for instance, for not having girlfriends when they
      first developed pubic hair. The patient described several
      brief heterosexual relationships from the age of 15 to 23.
      Some of these had been consummated. The patient would
      terminate these relationships when he began to feel
      `smothered', and had avoided them altogether since his leg
      surgery, channeling all his energies into rehabilitation. The
      patient considered that his core gender identity, gender role
      behaviour, and sexual orientation were male heterosexual. He
      denied deviant sexual activity or fantasy.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      patient described pre-morbid obsessional and narcissistic
      traits, He was hypochondriacal in his pursuit of health and
      bodily perfection. He regularly attended a gymnasium and was
      fastidious in his diet.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
      admission he was a handsome, small-framed man who walked with
      a slight limp. He was remarkably calm and composed, and not
      at all distressed. There was no formal thought disorder. The
      patient spoke eloquently. The themes of his speech concerned
      his parents violating his rights by having hirn circumcised
      and his wanting to feel `complete'. On invitation, he
      generalized these views to the regrettable practice of
      routine circumcision in infancy. There were no delusions, no
      hallucinations, and no passivity phenomena. The patient was
      orientated in time, place, and person. Clinical cognitive
      testing revealed no other abnormality.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No
      further physical or psychological investigations were
      performed. Thc patient's self-inflicted wound was repaired
      shortly after admission and he was discharged after four
      days. As arranged, he presented for review on two further
      occasions over the next month. His mental state was
      unchanged. He remained keen to have a foreskin
      reconstructed.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      nature and dramatic culmination of the patient's
      dysmorphophobic symptoms may be understood in terms of a
      childhood during which he was demoralised, emasculated, and
      deprived of recognition. This experience resulted in a
      damaged self-image and fragile personality structure,
      characterised by a preoccupation with health and physical
      appearance. The patient's decisions to correct perceived
      deformity may be interpreted as endeavours to repair his
      damaged self-image and restore his self-worth.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      literature suggests that many patients with dysmorphophobia
      do not have a major psychiatric illness (Birtchnell, 1988).
      These individuals are often found to be sensitive and/or
      insecure (Hay, 1970), and to possess schizoid, narcissistic,
      and obsessional traits (Thomas, 1984), without attracting the
      diagnosis of personality disorder. The patient in this report
      demonstrated all of these characteristics. However. the case
      is unusual from the following perspectives.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two
      groups of circumcised males who seek surgical reconstruction
      of their foreskins have been previously identified. The first
      group consists of Jews who have wished to disguise their
      identities during times of political crisis (e.g. Levin,
      1976). The second group comprises homosexuals who associate
      their circumcised status with a sense of incompleteness,
      unwanted masculinity, and anger over having no choice in
      their circumcision (Mohl et al, 1981). Our patient was
      neither Jewish nor apparently homosexual. Moreover, he not
      only sought foreskin restoration but planned and proceeded to
      attempt the surgery himself.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      case is also unusual because most genital self-mutilation is
      associated with psychosis (Greilsheimer &amp; Groves, 1979).
      The authors recognise that some patients with dysmorphophobia
      who are not psychotic on first presentation may become
      psychotic subsequently (Hay, 1983). Nevertheless. several
      reports of non-psychotic genital self-mutilation have been
      documented in the literature. There have been accounts (e.g.
      Haberman &amp; Michael, 1979) of non-psychotic transsexuals
      who have castrated themselves, descriptions of genital
      self-mutilation as part of tribal ritual (Cawte <i>et al</i>,
      1966) and, more recently. reports of individuals who mutilate
      their genitals for erotic purposes (e.g. Wan <i>et al</i>,
      1985). There have also been other accounts (Thompson &amp;
      Abraham, l983) of non-psychotic genital self-mutilation which
      do not fit into any of these categories. The present case and
      the above examples suggest that non-psychotic genital
      self-mutilation, while uncommon, may not be as rare as is
      generally stated.</p>
