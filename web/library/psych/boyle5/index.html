      <h2>ADVERSE SEXUAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS<br />
       OF MALE INFANT CIRCUMCISION</h2>

      <p>GREGORY J. BOYLE AND GILLIAN A. BENSLEY</p>
      <i>Bond University</i>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="1"><i>Summary</i>.--A survey of the 35 female and
      42 gay sexual partners of circumcised and genitally intact
      men, and a separate survey of 53 circumcised and genitally
      intact men, and a separate survey of 30 genitally intact men
      themselves indicated that circumcised men experienced
      significantly reduced sexual sensation along with associated
      long-lasting negative emotional consequences.</p>

      <p class="2">Many circumcised men subjected to involuntary
      genital cutting as infants or children have expressed strong
      negative feelings about the violation of bodily integrity
      that forced circumcision entails and their belief that
      circumcision has hindered their sexual enjoyment as adults
      (3, 4, 6, 7, Boyle, Svoboda, Price &amp; Turner, 2000,
      Circumcision of Healthy Boys: Criminal Assault? <i>Journal of
      Law and Medicine</i>, 7; 301-310. [on-line] Available at: <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/">http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/</a>).
      Loss of body parts, including partial penile amputation, may
      trigger grief resulting from altered body image or function,
      anxiety, depression, sexual problems, dissociation, or
      obsessive preoccupation with the loss. (3, 4, 8). Many men
      are so unhappy with being circumcised that they have even
      resorted to foreskin restoration methods in order to restore
      at least some of the sexual sensitivity lost to circumcision
      and as a mechanism to promote psychological healing (2, 5,
      O'Hara &amp; O'Hara, 2001, <i>Sex as nature intended it</i>.
      Hudson, MA: Turning Point. [On-line] Available at: <a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.SexAsNatureIntendedIt.com/">http://www.SexAsNatureIntendedIt.com/</a>).</p>

      <p class="4">M<span>ETHOD</span></p>

      <p class="2">Women (<i>n</i> = 35) and gay men (<i>n</i> =
      42) who had experienced sexual relations with <i>both</i>
      genitally intact men and men circumcised as infants,
      completed sexual awareness surveys, each comprising 32 items
      in a 2-point force choice response. Format (1). Women's ages
      ranged from 18 to 69 years (<i>M</i> = 33, <i>SD</i> =10.8);
      and gay men from 19 to 71 years (<i>M</i> = 36.3, <i>SD</i> =
      12.5). A separate sample of 53 circumcised and 30 genitally
      intact men aged from 20 to 71 years (<i>M</i> = 36.2,
      <i>SD</i> = 11.8) was also surveyed.</p>

      <p class="4">R<span>ESULTS</span></p>

      <p class="2">The combined sample (<i>n</i> = 77) reported
      that circumcised male partners were unhappy with their
      circumcisions significantly more often than were genitally
      intact sexual partners (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Also, their
      circumcised partners experienced significant progressive
      decline in glans sensitivity (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), and had to
      use significantly different techniques when masturbating (p
      &lt; .001). Circumcised partners more often resorted to
      unsafe sexual practices; they were significantly more likely
      to engage in anal intercourse (<i>p</i> &lt; .05), and
      significantly more reluctant to use condoms (<i>p</i> &lt;
      .05). Respondents reported significantly higher mean
      discontent among their circumcised partners than among their
      genitally intact partners (<i>p</i> &lt; .05).</p>

      <p class="2">As compared with genitally intact men,
      circumcised men reported significantly greater
      dissatisfaction with their orgasms. (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) and a
      wide range of negative emotions associated with being
      circumcised (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Previous research indicates
      women enjoy intercourse better with genitally intact men (9,
      O'Hara &amp; O'Hara, 2001, see above). In view of the present
      findings based on self-selected participants, the possible
      negative effects on adults' sexual function and psychological
      well-being need to be discussed in obtaining informed consent
      for circumcision (sexual reduction surgery) imposed on
      unconsenting male minors. Much larger representative samples
      are desirable.</p>
