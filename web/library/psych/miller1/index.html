        <h1>The Untouched Key</h1>

        <h4>By Alice Miller</h4>
        Translated from the German by Hildegarde and Hunter Hannum
      </div>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP presents a small excerpt from <i>The
      Untouched Key</i> by Alice Miller. Alice Miller is a Swiss
      psychoanalyst. Her books include <i>The Drama of the Gifted
      Child: The Search for the True Self</i>, <i>Thou Shalt Not Be
      Aware: Society's Betrayal of the Child</i>, <i>Banished
      Knowledge: Facing Childhood Injuries</i>, and <i>For Your Own
      Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-rearing and Roots of
      Violence</i>.]</p>

      <p align="center">APPENDIX</p>

      <h2><i>The Newly Recognized, Shattering Effects of Child
      Abuse</i></h2>

      <p>For some years now there has been proof that the
      devastating effects of the traumatization of children take
      their inevitable toll on society. This knowledge concerns
      every single one of us, and--if disseminated widely
      enough--should lead to fundamental changes in society, above
      all to a halt in the blind escalation of violence. The
      following points are intended to amplify my meaning:</p>

      <p>1. All children are born to grow, to develop, to live, to
      love, and to articulate their needs and feelings for their
      self-protection.</p>

      <p>2. For their development children need the respect and
      protection of adults who take them seriously, love them, and
      honestly help them to become oriented in the world.</p>

      <p>3. When these vital needs are frustrated and children are
      instead abused for the sake of adults' needs by being
      exploited, beaten, punished, take advantage of, manipulated,
      neglected, or deceived without the intervention of any
      witness, then their integrity will be lastingly impaired.</p>

      <p>4. The normal reactions to such injury should be anger and
      pain; since children in this hurtful kind of environment,
      however, are forbidden to express their anger and since it
      would be unbearable to experience their pain all alone, they
      are compelled to suppress their feelings, repress all memory
      of the trauma, and idealize those guilty of the abuse. Later
      they will have <i>no memory of what was done to them.</i></p>

      <p>5. Disassociated from the original cause, their feelings
      of anger, helplessness, despair, longing, anxiety, and pain
      will find expression in destructive acts against others
      (criminal behavior, mass murder) or against themselves (drug
      addiction, alcoholism, prostitution, psychic disorders,
      suicide).</p>

      <p>6. If those people become parents, they will then often
      direct acts of revenge for their mistreatment in childhood
      against their own children, whom they use as scapegoats.
      Child abuse is still sanctioned--indeed, held in high
      regard--in our society as long as it is defined as
      child-rearing. It is a tragic fact that parents beat their
      children in order to escape from emotions stemming from how
      they were treated by their own parents.</p>

      <p>7. If mistreated children are not to become criminals or
      mentally ill, it is essential that <i>at least once in their
      life</i> they come in contact with a person who knows without
      any doubt that the environment, not the helpless battered
      child is at fault. In this regard, knowledge or ignorance. on
      the part of society can be instrumental in either saving or
      destroying a life. Here lies the great opportunity for
      relatives, social workers, therapists, teachers, doctors,
      psychiatrists, officials, and nurses <i>to support the child
      and to believe her or him</i>.</p>

      <p>8. Till now, society has protected the adult and blamed
      the victim. It has been abetted in its blindness by theories,
      still in keeping with the pedagogical principles of our
      great-grandparents, according to which children are viewed as
      crafty creatures, dominated by wicked drives, who invent
      stories and attack their innocent parents or desire them
      sexually. In reality, children tend to blame themselves for
      their parents' cruelty and to absolve the parents, whom they
      invariably love, of all responsibility.</p>

      <p>9. For some years now, it has been possible to prove,
      thanks to the use of new therapeutic methods, that repressed
      traumatic experiences in childhood are stored up in the body
      and, although remaining unconscious, exert their influence
      even in adulthood. In addition, electronic testing of the
      fetus has revealed a fact previously unknown to most adults:
      <i>a child responds to and learns both tenderness and cruelty
      from the very beginning</i>.</p>

      <p>10. In the light of this new knowledge, even the most
      absurd behavior reveals its formerly hidden logic once the
      traumatic experiences of childhood no longer must remain
      shrouded in darkness.</p>

      <p>11. Our sensitization to the cruelty with which children
      are treated, until now commonly denied, and to the
      consequences of such treatment will as a matter of course
      bring to an end the perpetuation of violence from generation
      to generation.</p>

      <p>12. People whose integrity has not been damaged in
      childhood, who were protected, respected, and treated with
      honesty by their parents, will be--both in their youth and
      adulthood--intelligent, responsive, empathetic, and highly
      sensitive. They will take pleasure in life and will not feel
      any need to hurt otherss or themselves. They will use their
      power to defend themselves but not to attack others. They
      will not be able to do otherwiss than to respect and protect
      those weaker than themselves, including their children,
      because this is what they have learned from their own
      experience and because it is <i>this</i> knowledge (and not
      the experience of cruelty) that has been stored up inside
      them from the beginning. Such people will be incapable of
      understanding why earlier generations had to build up a
      gigantic war industry in order to feel at ease and safe in
      this world. Since it will not have to be their unconscious
      life-task to ward off intimidation experienced at a very
      early age, they will be able to deal with attempts at
      intimidation in their adult life more rationally and more
      creatively.</p>
