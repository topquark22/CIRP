      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><b>ABSTRACT.- Babies have been crying at
        birth for centuries but we have been reluctant to accept
        their cries as valid expressions of pain which will
        register in memory. Despite mounting evidence, the
        characteristic reaction of psychologists and medical
        practitioners to infant pain has been one of denial. Key
        myths about the brain have provided the rationale for
        painful procedures. Against this background, studies of the
        infant cry prove that crying is meaningful communication.
        Examples of prenatal and perinatal cries are examined.
        Evidence for the pain of circumcision is found in personal
        memories and research findings. A final section focuses on
        pain in the NICU, the delivery room, and the nursery and
        concludes with an appeal that all painful procedures
        imposed on newborns be reconsidered.</b></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
      granddaughter Bevin, at age 2, while talking about her birth
      experience, asked her parents, "Why did they poke me with a
      thing?" Her mother asked, "What thing?" "Like a pencil," she
      said. "They hurted me." She was probably referring to the
      heel stick, the routine way to take a blood sample from
      newborns in hospital birth. Bevin remembered the pain of it.
      Brenda, hypnotized at age 29, had this memory of pain in the
      delivery room:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">Now she's scooping me up from the
          doctor and laying me on this cold, cold, horribly hard,
          metal scales. It's so straight and so hard against my
          back. And I'm screaming because it is so painful! It
          hurts so much to be on this hard thing ... I am screaming
          and screaming and no one is coming. Someone put something
          in my eyes! It's so cold; it stings, it burns ... I'm
          still screaming ... That was as hard as I could cry! It
          hurt ...</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
      personal reports of pain at birth are new. Dare we believe
      them? Babies have been crying at birth for centuries but we
      have had a hard time treating their cries as meaningful. A
      lusty cry in the delivery room is a relief to both parents
      and professionals, the occasion for smiles and laughter. This
      is understandable but not entirely appropriate. Instead of
      responding to cries as authentic communication, birth
      professionals have proceeded to cause pain with the
      conviction that pain is merely reflexive and that owing to
      the immaturity of the infant brain, the pain could not really
      matter. From the perspective of present knowledge, these key
      19th Century beliefs are only myths, but tragically, they are
      mega myths still influencing mainstream psychology and
      obstetrics today.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>DENIAL OF PAIN</b></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      thousands of years, ignorance has separated us from a factual
      understanding of babies, an information gap that has been
      filled only in the last two decades. Long-standing prejudices
      toward babies are still visible in our attitude toward their
      age or size. They will become real persons when they are
      older or can speak our language. Overlooking the evidence to
      the contrary, we persist in believing that their senses are
      not developed and their brain unable to record memory or
      organize experience into meaning. Thus, newborn pain is not
      like our pain (Maurer &amp; Maurer, 1988, pp 33-36, 218) -a
      claim used in the not-too-distant past to discount the pain
      of minorities and slaves. In modern India the cruel practice
      of branding infant tummies with hot irons continues in rural
      areas under the influence of witchdoctors. The pain is
      thought to be good for them (Chandra, 1988), an idea
      sometimes advanced in the United States in regard to birth
      trauma (Lagercrantz &amp; Slotkin, 1986). Trauma is "good"
      because it activates endorphins and prepares the baby for
      real life. How can endorphins justify trauma? Experiments
      with rats show that when you shock their feet, their
      production of endorphins will shoot up as much as 600%, but
      is this any reason to shock them in the foot? Pain is not
      good for rats or babies.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">It was only in the last three years that
      American parents discovered the longstanding practice of
      surgeons to operate on infants without the use of
      painkillers</span> (<i>Birth,</i> June 1986, Letters,
      124-125). Adding horror to this discovery, parents uncovered
      the fact that major surgery on premature infants and children
      up to 15 months of age was typically done with the aid of
      curare (Pavulon) which paralyzes them but does not relieve
      pain. Thus, while experiencing the surgery fully, it was not
      possible for them to move or to utter a cry of alarm!</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgeons acted in this
      way because of certain assumptions which have turned out, in
      retrospect, to be false. The principal assumption was the
      classic one that the infant brain was not working but in
      addition, they believed the anesthesia might be more damaging
      than the ordeal of the surgery itself, a belief that has
      turned out to be false (<a href="/library/pain/anand/">Anand
      &amp; Hickey</a>, 1987, p. 1324).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      reality of pain memory (and birth memory) is confirmed by a
      mother whose premature baby was shunted for hydrocephalus
      without painkillers and while paralyzed with curare. Large
      incisions were cut in his scalp, neck, and abdomen and a hole
      drilled in his skull. She writes that ten years after the
      operation her son will still not allow anyone to touch his
      head, neck, and abdomen in the areas touched during surgery.
      The mere sight of the hospital provokes in this child violent
      trembling, profuse sweating, screaming, struggling, and
      vomiting.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public
      outrage over these practices has since forced official
      associations of surgeons, anesthesiologists and pediatricians
      to commit themselves to more humane policies but many doctors
      remain unconvinced (<i>Birth</i>, March 1988, Roundtable,
      36-41). They believe what they learned in anatomy, that the
      brain is only a fraction of its final weight and mass at
      birth and could not be working efficiently. As I have stated
      at greater length elsewhere (Chamberlain, 1988, pp. 9-13) the
      brain and nervous system can only be understood when they are
      connected to the endocrine system and the immune system;
      together they form one fluid intelligence system which begins
      to function early in gestation (Pert, Ruff, Weber, Herkenham,
      1985).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further misunderstanding
      was created by the belief that "lower" and earlier brain
      structures were incapable of complex activity and could not
      work properly until the "higher" and later brain structures
      were fully developed. These beliefs also turn out, in
      retrospect, to be false (Prechtl, 1981).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors began finding out
      how babies reacted to pain by applying pinpricks and small
      electric shocks to the cheeks and legs of newborns, proving
      that they were indeed sensitive (Sherman &amp; Sherman,
      1925). A third of the babies in this study raised the
      opposite hand, protectively, to the place where pain had been
      inflicted. Numerous experiments were performed between 1925
      and 1968 indicating sensitivity to pricks and scratches of
      the arms, legs, toes, calves, and even the face
      (investigators pronounced that the face was consistently more
      sensitive than the leg). An ambitious study of babies over a
      period of years at Columbia University by Myrtle McGraw
      (1941) concluded that newborns react to pinpricks with
      "diffuse" body movements indicating a lack of sensitivity.
      This interpretation was misleading because the babies did cry
      and withdraw their limbs; nevertheless the idea was widely
      embraced and had great influence.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skepticism about infant
      pain may be put to rest by a recent comprehensive review of
      pain and its effects on the prenate and newborn by <a
      href="/library/pain/anand/">Anand and Hickey</a> (1987) of
      Harvard Medical School. From 200 citations in the literature,
      these doctors specify the anatomical pathways and mechanisms
      for pain perception from the seventh week after conception
      onward. They point to the early origins of the neurochemical
      systems associated with pain, especially substance P, which
      appears in the brain and spinal column at 12 to 16 weeks.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endorphins, the body's
      opiates for stress, are present in the fetal pituitary before
      15 weeks. (A study by Facchinetti et al. in 1987, found these
      substances starting in the seventh week of pregnancy.) For
      those who believe that these opiates are sufficient for pain
      at birth, these anesthesiologists emphasize that for
      effective anesthesia it would take thousands of times more
      endorphin volume than the highest levels ever found in
      newborns.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anand
      and Hickey complete their review by noting the consistent and
      predictable effect of pain on the cardiorespiratory system,
      on hormonal and metabolic changes, motor responses, facial
      expressions, crying and other complex behaviors including
      longterm memory.</p>

      <center>
        <p><b>CRYING IS COMMUNICATION</b></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
      twenty-five years of investigation with acoustic technology,
      nothing is left of the old theory that baby cries are simple,
      random, undifferentiated sound. Lester and Boukydis (1985)
      review the many findings about the infant cry. Cries contain
      unexpected but eloquent information about illness,
      malnutrition, malformations, and other growth problems. Cries
      reveal hearing deficiencies, cries prove that a fetus has
      heard and learned some of its mother's speech characteristics
      about half way through gestation (Truby, 1965, 1975), and
      cries trumpet feelings in a measurable range from minimum to
      maximum distress (Papousek, Papousek, &amp; Koesterer
      1986).</p>

      <p><b><i>Prenatal Crying</i></b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly
      enough, audible crying begins long before birth at 40 weeks,
      the earliest recorded cries from aborted fetuses dating from
      21, 22, and 23 weeks (Humphrey, 1978). This means that a baby
      is capable of crying about half the time it is in the womb.
      Cries have been heard coming from inside the womb. This
      condition, vagitus uterinus (literally, "squalling in the
      womb"), is rare but well-authenticated. Stories about such
      squalling have been passed down from ancient Egypt, Greece,
      and Rome.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      1923, an American physician, George Ryder, heard the sound of
      a baby crying after he had applied traction with forceps.
      Listening via stethoscope his assistant and nurses said the
      sounds were "high and squealing, much like the mew of a
      kitten." This moving event led to a world literature search
      and discovery of reports in many languages: 131 cases between
      1546 and 1941, reported by 114 authors. Analysis of these
      records showed that crying was almost always associated with
      obstetrical procedures. About 20% of the crying prenates had
      died-indicating the urgent nature of the cries (Ryder,
      1943).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight
      additional reports, published since 1941, leave no doubt
      about the pain being expressed and who or what was causing
      it: a hand entering the uterus to bring down a leg,
      applications of forceps, injections of analgesia, inserting a
      catheter, or rupturing the amniotic sac. In one account, a
      mother, two doctors, and three midwives heard a baby cry five
      different times over a twelve hour period <i>before</i> labor
      began (Blair, 1965); they described it as "a startling and
      awesome event."</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      three cases reported by a Belgian group (Thiery et al.,
      1973), one baby started crying after membranes were ruptured
      and the head was being displaced to drain fluid. Crying
      recurred six times at intervals of up to 20 seconds. She was
      delivered after a difficult vacuum extraction. The other two
      babies, presenting in breech position, began crying after
      rupture of membranes and when electrodes were being clipped
      to their bottoms. They continued to cry about six times
      during labor. Two of the three had initial Apgar scores of 3
      and 6. (Strangely, these obstetricians concluded that crying
      is not a sign of fetal distress and has no adverse effect on
      the fetus.)</p>

      <p><i><b>Perinatal Complaints</b></i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babies
      are famous for their cries at birth. Is crying normal? Some
      babies make no cry and instead gaze at their parents with
      total concentration. Have they no complaints?</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babies
      cry when arriving in a delivery room twenty degrees colder
      than what they are used to in the womb. They cry being wiped
      and washed or being stretched out and measured. They complain
      when given injections (vitamin K) and eye drops
      (antibacterial). They react to skin puncture. Crying rates
      and heart rates shoot up as heels are lanced for blood
      samples (Owens &amp; Todt, 1984). My client, Josh, apparently
      developed his phobia of hypodermic needles in the nursery.
      This is how he remembered it in hypnosis:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">I'm bothered by the nurse. She keeps
          coming in, taking my temperature, taking blood. I wish
          she would just leave me alone. The other thing that was
          annoying was the shot. That was more pain ... I see the
          nurse leaning over me. She has a shot with something in
          it. She took the cap off it and checked it for air
          bubbles. She rubbed my left arm with alcohol and gave me
          a shot. It hurt! And I wasn't prepared for it. Then I
          became very tense and screamed. It really bothered me and
          I cried a long time after that.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      different dimension of pain, the pain of separation and
      isolation, also provokes crying and is a common theme in
      birth memories. Studies tell us that newborns recognize their
      own recorded cry, showing self-awareness. Other studies show
      how perceptive they are of other cries. Babies cry
      <i>with</i> and apparently <i>for</i> one another (Sagi &amp;
      Hoffman, 1976). They also discriminate between cries of
      babies their own age and cries of older babies, animal
      babies, and computer-simulated cries. They are more likely to
      join the chorus of those their own age (Simner, 1971). Babies
      have different cries when bored or hungry. They cry after
      heel lancing (Grunau &amp; Craig, 1987). Boston pediatrician
      Peter Wolff, noted for his continuous observations of
      newborns in their home environment, identified a "pain" cry
      and a "mad" cry (Wolff, 1969). In each home he conducted an
      experiment playing recordings of these cries and noting the
      mother's response time and attitude. He found a dramatic
      difference. To the pain cry mothers came in a rush, looking
      quite worried. To the mad cry, they came to check up but were
      not alarmed; they expressed tolerant amusement at this
      precocious expression of rage.</p>

      <p><i><b>Circumcision Pain</b></i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      thousands of years, pain has been inflicted on certain male
      newborns by circumcision rituals. The practice of removing
      the foreskin of the penis around the time of birth is more
      common in the West than in the East. Hindus do not do it,
      Moslems do. Jews must, Christians needn't. It has always been
      rare in China and Japan. In England the operation has now
      become rare. Worldwide, perhaps 15% of males are circumcised.
      In the United States the rate is about 60%. Australia, which
      once had a rate as high as the United States, now circumcises
      less than 25%, thanks to an aggressive educational campaign
      by physicians (Davenport &amp; Romberg, 1984).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western parents think
      little of circumcision unless they have actually seen it. A
      woman recently confided to me, "I couldn't look." Another
      said her boy began crying after circumcision and cried
      chronically for a whole year. But all infants are not alike;
      some seem far less disturbed than others.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
      men carry conscious memories of circumcision. A medical
      professor wrote to me about his "confident recollection" of
      infant circumcision. He said he was aware of having a very
      sore penis with a collarlike fringe (probably from clamping)
      which was being cut off by his physician father at home. He
      recalls lying on his back on some green furniture, feeling no
      pain from the cutting but objecting strenuously! He was
      desperately wriggling body and limbs against constraint. He
      felt encroached upon and endangered though awed that
      something obviously belonging to him could be cut without the
      cutting itself hurting. He felt helpless and "squalled
      bitterly."</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      other infants circumcision is more upsetting than birth
      itself. A father told me his great surprise when the doctor
      proceeded to circumcise his baby at delivery. Quiet through
      the entire birth, this baby cried loudly during circumcision.
      A Jewish father, reflecting on his boy's circumcision on the
      eighth day, said it was one of the saddest occurrences of his
      babyhood and that he cried more that afternoon than anytime
      in his first year.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      circumcision in hospitals, babies are strapped onto
      circumcision boards where they wait cold and frightened, the
      penis protruding hrough a hole in a sterile towel. Surgery
      with a clamping device begins by inserting a probe between
      the foreskin and glans. The probe is moved all around the
      glans to cut and loosen adhesions, a process called lysis.
      This is the maximum point of pain and crying. The foreskin
      does not naturally retract at birth and must be torn and cut
      back, leaving raw areas subject to urine burns and infection.
      After lysis, the skin is slit and the clamp applied, the skin
      pulled through and the excess cut away.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generations of
      obstetricians have done this operation, asking themselves if
      babies can really feel pain. French obstetrician Michel Odent
      omments that only <i>men</i> could originate such a cruel
      custom. Mothers to themselves would be very unlikely to do
      such a thing to their baby boys (Odent, 1986, p. 141). My
      client, Stewart, remembered is circumcision this way:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">There's a sensation I've never
          experienced before. It's in my back, being drawn up,
          pulled in. I don't know where I am but I feel like my
          shoulder blades are not resting comfortably and my
          shoulders are pushing down. I can't bend them. I'm on
          something hard and cold! I feel myself arching. It's
          cold! I feel my whole body arching now. I don't know
          what's going on. I hear babies crying and I'm crying too,
          I don't know why. Oh! They are pulling on my penis and
          I'm feeling some pain. It hurts there; I'm not sure why.
          There's a white robe; it's a doctor. They are holding my
          legs down, and my back is arched. <i>They are cutting my
          penis and it hurts. It hurts! I feel my penis being
          pulled. I feel sharp points there. I'm hurting and my
          back is tight. Someone picks me up and holds me. I can't
          relax. I am stiff. My penis hurts; it burns. It hurts and
          I can't relax. Even when I'm bundled up I can't relax. It
          takes a long time to relax ... I'm tired now. I cried
          hard. I'm all cried out. I'm trying to go to
          sleep.</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
      last two decades, a dozen studies have reported infant
      reactions to circumcision. All reveal stress, manifest in the
      tripling and quadrupling of normal cortisol levels in the
      bloodstream, changes in heart rate, the oxygen content of
      tissues, frequency of crying, disturbances of sleep, and
      inability of babies to calm themselves after being
      assaulted.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a definitive study
      of the types and degrees of crying during circumcision,
      psychologists and physicians at Washington University in St.
      Louis measured cries in exhaustive detail (<a
      href="/library/pain/porter/">Porter, Miller, &amp; Marshall,
      1986</a>). They discovered that crying correlated with the
      invasiveness of the surgery. For the thirty babies in the
      study the frequency of cries shot up from 224 in the ten
      minutes before restraint, to 1,817 cries during the three
      minutes of lysis. There were almost as many cries in the
      following two minutes of clamping, pulling, and cutting.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed sound portraits
      (spectrograms) of cries at different stages of the operation
      were easily sorted into separate piles by strangers who did
      not know what they were looking at. The variation and urgency
      of cries was obvious to adult judges who were listening. The
      degree of urgency matched the stages of wsurgical
      invasiveness and unmistakably represented degrees of infant
      pain.</p>

      <p align="justify">Doctors still quarrel about the use of
      local anesthetic for circumcision, though research showing
      its safety and advantages has been available for a decade (<a
      href="/library/pain/kirya1/">Kirya &amp; Werthmann</a>, 1978;
      Dixon, Snyder, Hove, &amp; Bromberger, 1984). Doctors at the
      University of Iowa compared the stress level of thirty
      newborns with and without local anesthetic (<a
      href="/library/pain/williamson/">Williamson &amp; Williamson,
      1983</a>). Those done without anesthetic cried continually,
      nearly doubled their heart rates, and showed low oxygen
      tissue levels during the ten minute operation. In contrast,
      those given a few drops of anesthetic injected under the skin
      before cutting, reacted only briefly, and generally cooed,
      gurgled, and dozed through the procedure. One of the doctors,
      Marvel Williamson said, "The myth that newborns don't feel
      pain because their nerve pathways aren't yet developed just
      isn't true. They feel it and react to the pain."</p>

        <p><b>DOES BIRTH HAVE TO BE PAINFUL?</b></p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
      psychologists think that all birth is a painful ordeal. They
      attribute pain to a "failing" placenta which becomes less
      effective as term approaches, crushing pressure on the head
      as it moves through the birth canal, and the finality of
      detachment from mother (Wasdell, 1987). Indeed, expressions
      of birth pain do arise with distressing regularity in various
      forms of deep experiential psychotherapy (Grof, 1988; Janov,
      1970). This primal pain, said to be repressed and
      unconscious, is not easy to reconcile with the peaceful
      expressions worn on some newborn faces.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick Leboyer, the
      famous French obstetrician, was one of the first of his
      profession to believe that babies were, in fact, in as much
      pain as they appeared to be. Tight-shut eyes, twitching
      eyebrows, howling and squirming, kicking, clenched fists, and
      quivering flesh were to Leboyer signs of agonizing distress
      (Leboyer, 1975). Influenced in these observations by his own
      recollections of birth pain, he proceeded to modify the birth
      environment. As he developed his method of birth without
      violence he watched the look of terror and stress
      disappear.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
      evidence that birth need not be painful was gathered by
      obstetrics professor John Lind in Stockholm (Lind, 1978). He
      had seen thousands of births and could not believe that all
      babies were painfully born. To confirm this, he took photos
      of 130 normal full term babies and found in them few signs of
      pain or fear. Instead, many faces suggested curiosity and
      great expectation. Since then, reports of babies smiling
      after water birth have added to the impression that birth can
      be pleasurable. But this is not the usual birth.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      an irony that the medicalization of birth has made it more
      painful for babies. From labor onward, the (well developed)
      senses of a newborn are violated left and right. In
      hospitals, natural birth seldom survives the cascade of
      well-intentioned interference. Deliberate rupture of
      membranes will eliminate the hydraulic covering which
      protects the head; birth in the lithotomy position will
      nullify the effect of gravity and make progress difficult. As
      a consequence of interference, complications may be assessed
      with electrodes implanted in the scalp and blood samples
      taken by making a scalp wound. If chemicals have upset the
      normal processes of labor, the baby may have to be turned
      forcefully and removed by forceps.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      these pains are missed, emergence into an air conditioned
      delivery room under bright light will be the first in a
      series of painful encounters: being roughly handled, wiped,
      measured and weighed; the sting of eye medication, the hurt
      of a vitamin injection and heel lance. Even a baby born quiet
      and contented must be provoked to cry in order to obtain a
      proper Apgar rating. Delivery room pains are usually followed
      by the pains of isolation and separation from parents. This
      exile may last for hours. If hungry, babies will have to
      wait; if they want to move or turn they cannot; if they want
      to hear or see their parents, it is impossible. Babes are
      taken from their parents in the name of health, to receive
      "the best of care." But the real risks of going to the
      nursery involve more than tears, as summarized by Brackbill,
      Rice, and Young, 1985 (Table 1.1, pp. 36-38).</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premature and sick
      babies, the most vulnerable of all, are destined to endure
      the most pain. In a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) they
      will face the many perils of trying to complete gestation in
      a man-made womb (Kellman, 1980; Lawson, Turkewitz, Platt,
      &amp; McCarton, 1985; Coolman, et al., 1985; Perlman &amp;
      Volpe, 1983). A comprehensive review of the environmental
      stresses in neonatal intensive care has been made by
      Gottfried &amp; Gaiter, 1985. Painful stimuli include
      incessant high levels of light and noise which may prove
      damaging in themselves (Glass, Avery, Subramanian, Keys,
      Sostek, &amp; Friendly, 1985; Douek, Bannister, Dodson,
      Ashcroft &amp; Humphries, 1976; Long, Lucey, &amp; Phillip,
      1980). Although these babies would naturally spend most of
      their time sleeping, rest is impossible here because infants
      may be disturbed as many as 132 times a day. Being turned
      over can be wrenching. Even lying on a mattress flattens the
      head.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain
      is a way of life for infants in intensive care. Umbilical
      artery catheters and vein catheters are routinely installed
      to provide permanent access for blood samples, pressure
      monitoring, and infusion of medications. Other catheters are
      installed for feeding. Tubes and machines facilitate
      breathing. All such procedures are subject to a host of
      complications with painful consequences. Even isopropyl
      alcohol used as a skin disinfectant prior to venipuncture or
      invasive procedures can cause 3rd degree burns in very
      immature infants (Peabody &amp; Lewis, 1985).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infant pain is
      emotional and mental as well as physical. Harder to measure
      than exposure to light and cold, these pains show up commonly
      in birth memories of adults obtained in hypnosis. Impressed
      at a deep and unconscious level they manifest as depression,
      phobias, mistrust, and guilt feelings requiring psychotherapy
      years later (Cheek, 1975; Janov, 1983). Rejection of newborns
      for their facial features or sex, hostility toward them for
      causing pain and financial hardship, fears planted about
      their safety and well being can create their own kind of
      pain.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
      verbal remarks delivered with emotional intensity may
      im-print deeply and cause repeated suffering (Chamberlain,
      1988, chapter 10). An example is the mother who said to her
      doctor, "Why didn't you just wrap the umbilical cord around
      her neck and strangle her?" The daughter said she "hated her
      mother from Day One." Although it is difficult to explain
      infant comprehension of language, the painful effect of such
      remarks does frequently appear in hypnotic recollections of
      birth. The pathogenic consequences on the personality of the
      infant suggests the need for a new and higher level of
      antisepsis than the hand-washing which began with Phillip
      Semmelweis a century and a half ago. Judging from birth
      memories, both parents and professionals need to clean up
      their act.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
      can we do about newborn pain and suffering? Some pain may be
      part of a natural process that is beyond our control. If it
      is truly so, we should be alert to its coming and provide
      what comfort we can. Doing this will require letting go of
      the myth that babies do not feel pain. Some pain <i>seems</i>
      inevitable but is not. This is often revealed by women whose
      birth is "physiologic" or "natural": birth in a familiar
      environment, with constant support, freedom to move about,
      take whatever positions feel right, and make whatever sounds
      she wants. These freedoms seem to lower pain in both mother
      and infant. Family-centered birth in or out of hospital,
      including options for laboring in warm water and delivering
      in water further reduces both mother and infant trauma. We
      can read this on baby faces. We must not accept that baby
      pain at birth is inevitable.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
      especially heavy burden rests on professionals who make birth
      painful for newborns. Here we confront, not the pain of
      nature, but the pain created by science, obstetrics, and
      psychology. We are still enthralled by popular myths that
      babies don't feel, don't think, don't remember, and have no
      sense of self. The truth about newborn abilities, gleaned
      from scientific discovery in the last two decades, leaves us
      ripe for scandal-insisting on painful rituals that are
      inhumane and unnecessary. Here we confront the "cultural lag"
      between what we know and what we do.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
      painful procedures at birth should be reconsidered and
      peaceful alternatives pursued.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many more years of
      needless pain will newborns have to endure? The answer may
      depend on <i>who</i> takes the lead. Will obstetricians as a
      group conscientiously reinvent their approach to babies?
      Individual practitioners have already done so, but creating
      new standards for professional practice will take dedicated
      effort. That approach would affect the training of
      obstetricians as well as the practice of obstetricians,
      meaning improvements happening in many places at once.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents themselves may be
      the ones to lead us into a new age of birth by setting new
      standards for how babies are treated. After all, whose babies
      are they? Parents always have the advantage of making the
      first move-as consumer they decide where to have their babies
      and what practitioners to employ. The current situation is a
      test of whether parents or professionals can react more
      quickly to new information.</p>
