      size="+1"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">From a global perspective, most of the world
      does not practise circumcision; over 80% of the world's males
      are intact (not circumcised) [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. Most
      circumcised men are Muslim or Jewish; the USA is the only
      country in the world that circumcises most (60%) of its male
      infants for non-religious reasons. Other countries that
      circumcised a significant minority of male infants for
      non-religious reasons include Canada and Australia. This
      article refers mostly to the American practice, because the
      USA has the highest rate of non-religious circumcision and
      the most contentious debate about circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">Discussion about the advisability of
      circumcision in English-speaking countries that practise
      circumcision typically has focused on long-held beliefs about
      the health benefits of circumcision. The conflicting
      conclusions, beliefs and opinions surrounding circumcision,
      together with the tenacity with which advocates and opponents
      of circumcision maintain their viewpoints, suggest that deep
      psychological factors are involved. The strong motivation to
      circumcise male infants is shown by the fact that the
      practice continues even though no national medical
      organization in the world recommends it.</p>

      <p class="text1">Questions concerning the psychological
      motivation to circumcise and the longstanding psychological
      effects of male circumcision have rarely been studied; this
      lack of studies on the long term effects was noted in the
      medical literature about 20 years ago [<a
      href="#n2">2,3</a>], and little has changed since then.</p>

      <p><a id="pain" name="pain"></a><font size="+1"><b>Infant
      pain and behavioral response to circumcision.</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">To understand the long-term effects of
      circumcision, it is necessary to review the effects on the
      infant. The question of infant pain is often raised in
      debates about circumcision. Some physicians believe early
      work claiming that the newborn nervous system is not
      sufficiently developed to register or transmit pain impulses
      [<a href="#n4">4,5</a>]. According to more recent work, this
      belief is 'the major myth' of physicians regarding infant
      pain [<a href="#n6">6</a>]. That babies cannot physically
      resist and stop the circumcision procedure also makes it
      easier to dismiss their pain [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. Some
      doctors minimize circumcision pain by calling it "discomfort"
      or comparing it to the pain of an injection, although these
      studies have been refuted by empirical studies [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Anatomical, neurochemical, physiological and
      behavioural studies confirm that newborn responses to pain
      are 'similar to but greater than those in adult subjects' [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>]. Infants circumcised with no anaesthesia
      (reflecting common practice) experience not only great pain,
      but also an increased risk of choking and difficulty in
      breathing [<a href="#n9">9</a>]. Increases in heart rate of
      55 bpm have been recorded, i.e. 1.5 times the baseline rate
      [<a href="#n10">10</a>]. After circumcision, the level of
      blood cortisol increased by a factor of 3-4 times the level
      before circumcision [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. As a surgical
      procedure, circumcision has been described as 'among the most
      painful performed in neonatal medicine' [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>]. Investigators reported, 'This level of
      pain would not be tolerated by older patients' [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>]. Using a pacifier during circumcision
      reduced crying but did not affect the hormonal pain response
      [<a href="#n14">14</a>]. An infant may also go into a state
      of shock to escape the overwhelming pain [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>]. Therefore, while crying may be absent,
      other body signals show that severe pain is always present
      during circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">There is disagreement among physicians about
      using anaesthesia during circumcision. Before the mid-1980s,
      anaesthesia was not used because infant pain was denied by
      the medical community. That belief has changed among many
      physicians, but an anaesthetic (local injection, the best
      option tested) still is not typically administered, because
      of a lack of familiarity with its use, as well as the belief
      that it introduces additional risk [<a href="#n12">12</a>].
      Although there is an indication that the risk is minimal,
      most physicians who perform circumcisions do not use
      anaesthetics. When an anaesthetic is used, it relieves only
      some but not all of the pain, and its effect wanes before the
      post operative pain does [<a href="#n16">16</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Behavioral changes in infants resulting from
      circumcision are very common, and can interfere with
      parent-infant bonding and feeding. [<a href="#n3">3,8</a>].
      The American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision
      notes increased irritability, varying sleep patterns and
      changes in infant-maternal interaction after circumcision [<a
      href="#n17">17</a>]. <a
      href="/library/pain/taddio2/">Canadian investigators report
      that during vaccinations at age 4-6 months, circumcised boys
      had an increased behavioral pain response and cried for
      significantly longer periods than did intact boys</a>. The
      authors believe that 'circumcision may produce long-lasting
      changes in infant pain behaviour' [<a href="#n18">18</a>].
      That study suggests that circumcision may permanently alter
      the structure and function of developing neural pathways [<a
      href="#n19">19</a>].</p>

      <p><a id="parents" name="parents"><font size="+1"><b>The
      parents' responses</b></font></a></p>

      <p class="text1">The severe pain of circumcision and the
      changes to infant-maternal interaction observed after
      circumcision raise the question of the effects on the mother.
      The typical hospital circumcision is performed out of view of
      the parents, in a separate room. However, a few are observed
      by parents, and many Jewish ritual circumcisions are carried
      out in the homes of the parents. There are no studies of how
      these parents respond to observing their son's circumcision.
      Personal accounts vary and may include strong emotions. Some
      parents regret their son's circumcision and report that they
      wish they had known more about circumcision before they
      consented to it. Margaret Viola submitted the following
      comments in her letter to a magazine:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text1"><i>'My tiny son and I sobbed our hearts
          out. After everything I'd worked for, carrying and
          nurturing Joseph in the womb, having him at home against
          no small odds, keeping him by my side constantly since
          birth, nursing him whenever he needed closeness and
          nourishment--the circumcision was a horrible violation of
          all I felt we had shared. I cried for days afterward'</i>
          [<a href="#n20">20</a>].</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Melissa Morrison was having a difficult time 7 months
      after she had watched the circumcision of her son:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text1"><i>'I'm finding myself obsessing more
          and more about it. It's absolutely horrible. I didn't
          know how horrific it was going to be. It was the most
          gruesome thing I have ever done in my life. I told the
          doctor as soon as he was done, if I had a gun, I would
          have killed him. I swear I would be in jail today if I
          did have a gun'</i> [<a href="#n21">21</a>]</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Other mothers have reported to the author's
      institution that watching their son's circumcision was the
      'the worst day of my life'. Some mothers clearly remember
      their son's circumcision after many years; Pollack reported
      15 years after the event. 'The screams of my baby remain
      embedded in my bones and haunt my mind.' She added, 'His cry
      sounded like he was being butchered. I lost my milk' [<a
      href="#n22">22</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Parents may not express strong adverse
      reactions to a son's circumcision for two possible reasons.
      First, because the feelings engendered by circumcision are so
      painful and are not generally supported by the community,
      they may be suppressed [<a href="#n15">15</a>]. Second, as
      described earlier, if the infant goes into traumatic shock,
      he does not cry, and parents tend to interpret lack of crying
      as a sign that circumcision is not painful.</p>

      <p><a id="trauma" name="trauma"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>Circumcision as trauma</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">Studies investigating circumcisional pain
      have referred to circumcision as traumatic [<a
      href="#n9">9,18</a>]. The <i>Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders (<a
      href="http:/library/psych/ptsd2/">DSM-IV</a>)</i> published
      by the American Psychiatric Association [<a
      href="#n23">23</a>] is helpful in discussing the question of
      trauma as it relates to circumcision. Its description of a
      traumatic event includes an event that is beyond human
      experience, such as assault (sexual or physical), torture,
      and a threat to one's physical integrity. An assault is a
      physical attack; torture is severe pain or anguish. It does
      not necessarily take account of intent or purpose, but
      focuses on the act itself and the experience of the
      victim.</p>

      <p class="text1">From the perspective of the infant, all the
      elements in the DSM-IV description of traumatic events apply
      to circumcision; the procedure involves being forcibly
      restrained, having part of the penis cut off, and
      experiencing extreme pain. Based on the nature of the
      experience and considering the extreme physiological and
      behavioural responses, circumcision traumatizes the
      infant.</p>

      <p class="text1">The question of an infant's capacity to
      experience trauma needs to be emphasized. Wilson, an author
      with a national reputation for trauma research, supports the
      idea that trauma can occur 'at any point in the life cycle,
      from infancy to the waning years of life' [<a
      href="#n24">24</a>]. In addition, the DSM-IV states that
      traumatic effects 'can occur at any age' [<a
      href="#n23">23</a>]. Clinicians have documented that children
      are particularly vulnerable to trauma [<a
      href="#n25">25,26</a>]. Psychic trauma seems to have a
      permanent effect on children, no matter how young they are
      when they are traumatized. Furthermore, psychopathology
      increases as the age of the child at the time of the trauma
      decreases [<a href="#n27">27</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Trauma results in dissociation, a separation
      of the traumatic experience and associated emotional pain
      from awareness [<a href="#n28">28</a>]. Dissociation is a
      psychological survival response. To preserve a semblance of
      attachment to the mother, a child who has suffered trauma
      alters reality and 'forgets' that the trauma ever happened.
      [<a href="#n29">29</a>]. In altering reality, the child is
      also altered. Based on neurological research, painful
      experience and trauma in childhood can result in long-term
      physiological changes in the central nervous system and
      neurochemical changes [<a href="#n30">30-33</a>]. Two
      brain-imaging studies of adults with histories of child
      sexual abuse reported a reduced size of the hippocampus, a
      part of the brain associated with memory, and in a test of
      verbal short-term memory, adults who had been abused had
      lower scores [<a href="#n34">34-36</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">The possibility of circumcision resulting in
      traumatic effects on older children can be better explored
      because of the easier access to memory and the child's
      ability to talk. Two reports have studied the ritual as
      practiced without anaesthesia on children in Turkey. In the
      <a href="/library/psych/cansever/">first report</a>, testing
      subjects 4-7 years old shortly before and after the ritual
      yielded this result: 'Circumcision is perceived by the child
      as an aggressive attack on his body, which damaged,
      humiliated and, in some cases totally destroyed him' [<a
      href="#n37">37</a>]. According to this study, circumcision
      resulted in increased aggressiveness and weakened the ego,
      causing withdrawal, and reduced functioning and adaptation.
      Withdrawal is a defensive response that individuals use to
      protect themselves against further attack.</p>

      <p class="text1">In the second study, children were observed
      to be 'terribly frightened' during the procedure, and 'each
      child looked at his penis immediately after the circumcision
      as if to make sure that all was not cut off' [<a
      href="#n38">38</a>]. One 8-year-old boy fell 'unconscious'
      during the cutting and subsequently developed a stuttering
      problem. A few weeks later, parents being interviewed
      reported that their children exhibited increased aggressive
      behaviour and experienced nightmares. In the same report,
      adults who were interviewed and recalled castration anxiety
      and other serious fears connected with their childhood
      circumcision, particularly if they had been deceived or
      forced by parents to undergo the procedure. Freud, who had a
      strongly critical view of circumcision, believed that it was
      a 'substitute for castration' [<a href="#n39">39</a>].
      Castration anxiety resulting from circumcision may be related
      to the finding that symptoms from personal injury trauma
      often include fear of repetition of the trauma [<a
      href="#n40">40</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">The traumatic impact of surgery on children
      is well-established. For example, the psychiatric literature
      documents serious long-term effects resulting from childhood
      tonsillectomy [<a href="#n41">41,42</a>]. Psychiatrist David
      Levy reviewed the case histories of 124 children who
      developed psychological problems after a surgical procedure.
      He observed that the younger the child, the greater the
      chance of adverse reaction to surgery. The most severe
      anxiety reactions were observed in two boys, each of whom had
      surgery on his penis. One boy had a meatotomy at age 4 and
      the other had a circumcision at age 6 years; both exhibited
      destructive behaviour and suicidal impulses [<a
      href="#n43">43</a>].</p>

      <p><a id="long-term" name="long-term"><font
      size="+1"><b>Long-term psychological
      effects</b></font></a></p>

      <p class="text1">Without published studies, current knowledge
      of men's feelings about their circumcision is generally based
      on reports from self-selected men who have contacted the <a
      href="http://www.circumcision.org/">Circumcision Resource
      Center</a> (CRC) and other circumcision information
      organizations [<a href="#n44">44</a>]. The feelings reported
      generally include anger, sense of loss, shame, sense of
      having been victimized and violated, fear, distrust, grief,
      and jealousy of intact men.</p>

      <p class="text1">The overwhelming majority of these men were
      circumcised as newborn infants. The memory of this event is
      not in their conscious awareness. Consequently, the
      connection between present feelings and circumcision may not
      be clear. However, some men attribute many negative feelings
      to their circumcision. Based on the responses of men who
      contacted the CRC, the origin of this attribution is in the
      impact of discovering one's circumcision as a child. If a
      child grows in a community that has children who are not
      circumcised, it is probable that someday the circumcised boy
      will notice the difference. Under certain circumstances the
      realization that part of the penis was cut off can have
      trauma-like consequences, such as recurrent unwelcome
      thoughts and images.</p>

      <p class="text1">One man told me of an indelible scene when
      he was 4 years old; he was with an intact boy who showed him
      his penis and explained circumcision to him. He was shocked
      and ashamed at what had been done to him. He said that as an
      adult he thinks about it 'every time I take a shower or
      urinate'.</p>

      <p>The following reasons explain why circumcised men report
      little about how they truly feel:</p>

      <ol type="i">
        <li>Accepting beliefs and cultural assumptions about
        circumcision prevents men from recognizing and feeling
        their dissatisfaction; e.g. being told when young that it
        was necessary for health reasons and not questioning
        that.</li>

        <li>The emotions connected with circumcision that may
        surface are very painful; repressing them protects men from
        this pain. If the feelings become conscious, they can still
        be suppressed.</li>

        <li>Those who have feelings about their circumcision are
        generally afraid to express them because their feelings may
        be dismissed or ridiculed.</li>

        <li>Verbal expression of feelings requires conscious
        awareness. Because early traumas are generally unconscious,
        associated feelings are expressed non-verbally through
        behavioural, emotional, and physiological forms [<a
        href="#n45">45,46</a>]</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text1">Attitudes about people, life and the future,
      may also be affected; e.g. a common attitude resulting from
      childhood trauma is a lack of trust and as sense of
      defencelessness. [<a href="#n47">47</a>]. Lack of awareness
      and understanding of circumcision, emotional repression, fear
      of disclosure, and non-verbal expression help keep
      circumcision feelings a secret.</p>

      <p class="text1">Although men may be unaware of the effects
      of circumcision, the fear that their penis is somehow
      deficient is reported to be widespread in American culture
      [<a href="#n48">48</a>]. Commercial interests have responded
      to this fear by advertising various methods of penile
      enlargement in men's magazines. Male preoccupation with the
      penis is also reflected in a survey of what men think women
      find attractive in men. The data showed that men greatly
      exaggerated the importance of penis size as a physical
      attribute that attracts women [<a href="#n49">49</a>]. The
      effect of circumcision on this result is not known.</p>

      <p class="text1">Negative feelings about the penis are
      related to the idea of body image; this includes value
      judgements about how the body is thought to appear to others,
      and can have a great impact on how men live their lives are
      conducted <i>[sic]</i> [<a href="#n48">48</a>]. In addition,
      the concepts of self and body image are interconnected and
      affect personal psychology. A diminished body image can
      diminish a person's social and sexual life. Those who have a
      bodily loss fear the judgement of others and the weakening of
      personal relationships. For example, psychological sexual and
      social effects have been reported in women after a
      mastectomy. They felt less attractive, less desirable and had
      less sexual satisfaction after their surgery [<a
      href="#n50">50,51</a>]. Poor body image can also affect
      motivation and reduce feelings of competence, status and
      power. In addition, depression and suicidal attitudes have
      been noted [<a href="#n52">52,53</a>]. Although there are
      differences between the circumstances and age at the time of
      loss, the feeling that an important part of the body is
      missing is common to mastectomy and circumcision (for some
      men). The feeling of 'not being a whole man' can be
      especially distressing.</p>

      <p class="text1">An aspect of self can be identified with a
      particular body part, as masculinity is typically identified
      with the penis. When that part is wounded there is often a
      corresponding psychological wound to the self and a loss of
      self-esteem. How much of a connection there might be between
      low male self-esteem is uncertain. Low self-esteem often
      induces feelings of shame and these are projected by
      attacking the self-esteem of others; shame isolates us from
      others and from ourselves. A physical loss, like
      circumcision, can be a source of shame. Such feelings are
      often mentioned in letters from circumcised men. Because
      shame remains a secret most circumcised men are unlikely to
      report their feelings.</p>

      <p class="text1">Psychopathology is not always detectable by
      trained clinicians. The effects of circumcision trauma can be
      chronic and so deeply embedded that it is very difficult to
      distinguish them from personality traits or effects resulting
      from other causes. Furthermore, where circumcision is common,
      its effects are common and may be interpreted as normal. As
      with other traumas, the psychopathological outcome may vary,
      but preliminary reports appear to be consistent with the
      symptom pattern of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<a
      href="#n21">21.</a>]</p>

      <p class="text1">Examples of PTSD symptoms include recurrent
      thoughts and dreams about, and avoidance of the topic of
      circumcision. Emotional numbing and inappropriate anger are
      potential common long-term effects of circumcision that
      warrant investigation. Reduced capacity for emotional
      expression or 'numbing' response is a more likely PTSD
      symptom with increasing time after the traumatic event [<a
      href="#n54">54</a>]. Those who have been violated generally
      have a problem with anger and direct it either inward or
      outward toward others [<a href="#n46">46</a>]. Adult symptoms
      could be considered delayed or chronic psychological effects
      of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">The link between adult circumcision, loss of
      sensitivity and impotence has been noted in the medical
      literature [<a href="#n55">55</a>]. Since infant circumcision
      also decreases sexual sensitivity [<a href="#n54">54</a>], it
      is likely than circumcision is an unrecognized factor in the
      high rates of impotence in American men and by association,
      is also detrimental to male psychological health. According
      to a randomized study of 1290 men aged 40-70 years, 52%
      reported some degree of impotence, ranging from minimal to
      complete. This rate varied from ~40% at age 40 to 67% at age
      70. (A literature search yielded no comparable European
      study.) Higher rates of impotence were associated with
      increased levels of anger and depression. Self-esteem was
      also lower in impotent men [<a href="#n57">57,58</a>]. The
      psychological response to impotence would compound any
      pre-existing psychological symptoms that have already been
      discussed.</p>

      <p><a id="motivation" name="motivation"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>The motivation to circumcise</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">Although research shows harmful effects of
      circumcision, and there is much that is not known about the
      long-term sequelae, it is difficult for advocates of
      circumcision to change because of powerful psychological
      factors. The behavioural re-enactment of the trauma is a
      compulsion for some trauma victims. [<a href="#n46">46</a>].
      Circumcision of infants may be regarded as an example of
      re-enacting the trauma of one's own circumcision. A survey of
      randomly selected primary care physicians showed that
      circumcision was more often supported by doctors who were
      older, male and circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text1">People want coherence and consistency in
      their beliefs and experience. If inconsistency occurs, called
      cognitive dissonance, beliefs tend to be aligned to fit
      experience [<a href="#n60">60</a>]. Choosing to circumcise is
      a serious choice. After such a choice is made, people tend to
      appreciate the chosen alternative and depreciate the rejected
      alternative [<a href="#n61">61</a>]. As a result, beliefs are
      adopted to conform with experience and support the decision
      to circumcise. An example of these beliefs, as mentioned
      earlier is that newborn infants do not feel pain. Another
      common mistaken belief is that the prepuce has not useful
      purpose; one advocate of circumcision stated, 'I believe that
      the prepuce is a mistake of nature' [<a
      href="#n62">62</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Inconsistency can be reconciled by denial,
      limiting experience; i.e. only information that fits the
      beliefs is perceived and accepted. If they strongly support
      circumcision, some physicians simply dismiss new information
      that conflicts with their view [<a href="#n63">63</a>].
      Although many studies show the extreme pain of circumcision,
      physicians who circumcise may ignore this information. The
      tendency to avoid new information increases when the
      discrepancy between beliefs and experience increases [<a
      href="#n64">64</a>]. (Even after learning something new,
      people remember better the information that supports
      established beliefs rather than conflicting information [<a
      href="#n65">65</a>].) Avoidance may lead to rigidity of
      thinking and dependence on dogma to counteract and subdue
      doubt.</p>

      <p class="text1">Parents are solicited by hospital personnel
      to make a decision about circumcision, implying that it is an
      approved practice. Circumcision is the only surgery that is
      decided by lay people. Those parents who agree to
      circumcision for their newborn son are typically unaware of
      important information and may not understand what
      circumcision is. They fail to appreciate that circumcision is
      surgery. In one study, half of the mothers questioned did not
      know if the father of their child was circumcised [<a
      href="#n66">66</a>]. In another study, 34% of men incorrectly
      identified their own circumcision status [<a
      href="#n67">67</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Physicians say they circumcise because
      parents request it; parents choose it because doctors do it.
      [<a href="#n63">63</a>]. Communication between the physician
      and parents about circumcision is often insufficient for
      informed consent, largely because of emotional discomfort
      with the subject. Almost half the time there is no discussion
      between the physician and the mother about the medical
      aspects of circumcision [<a href="#n68">68</a>]. If there is
      a discussion it may include incorrect tacit assumptions by
      physician and parent about what the other really wants or
      means [<a href="#n63">63</a>]. These assumptions tend to lean
      toward the decision to circumcise. The parents' lack of
      expertise leads them to defer to the physician's supposed
      knowledge, thus contributing to communication deficiencies
      and a decision to circumcise. Although physicians do not
      require that parents choose circumcision, and parents believe
      that they are freely making their choice, physicians exercise
      control over the parents' decision by controlling in
      formation and sometimes making a recommendation. [<a
      href="#n63">63,69</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">A national study of 400 American
      paediatricians and obstetricians indicated that two-thirds of
      physicians took a neutral position on circumcision when
      advising parents [<a href="#n70">70</a>]. A so-called neutral
      or balanced presentation of circumcision to parents is
      preferred by physicians and childbirth educators so that they
      will not be accused of 'bias' , but it does not provide
      accurate and complete information to those who are asked to
      make the decision [<a href="#n21">21</a>]. It appears that
      few involved in the decision to circumcise are aware that the
      pain is severe and that circumcision may have a long-term
      effect on sexual experience and functioning. Furthermore
      myths about social acceptance die hard.</p>

      <p class="text1">The importance of conformity in the decision
      to circumcise is illustrated by a survey of parents of 124
      newborn males born at an American hospital. The results
      showed that for parents making the decision, social concerns
      outweighed medical concerns. Parents' reasons for
      circumcising were based mainly on an interest that the baby
      'look like' his father, brothers and friends. (Because of the
      large variation in appearance in circumcised boys,
      circumcision should be discouraged for cosmetic reasons [<a
      href="#n71">71</a>].) Only 23% of the intact fathers had
      circumcised sons. In contrast, 90% of the circumcised fathers
      had circumcised sons. The authors concluded that the decision
      to circumcise 'is more an emotional decision than a rational
      decision' and has a strong base in social and cultural issues
      [<a href="#n72">72</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Social concerns were also a major
      consideration among parents making the decision about
      circumcision in a study an another American hospital. A group
      of parents were given special information about circumcision,
      based on the 1975 report of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision which concluded
      that circumcision is not medically necessary [<a
      href="#n73">73</a>]. (there was no information on significant
      harm caused by circumcision). A control group in the study
      was given no information on circumcision. The circumcision
      rates of the two groups were not statistically different.
      Parents found social reasons alone sufficient to choose
      circumcision. The researchers concluded, 'Circumcision is a
      custom in our society; to change the attitude toward it is
      not an easy task' [<a href="#n74">74</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">The assumption, mostly on the part of
      circumcised men, that a boy would want to be circumcised if
      his father is circumcised, is not supported by any published
      evidence. This idea may be part of a psychological defence
      mechanism called projection, the process of attributing
      feelings to others that belong to oneself. It is the
      circumcised father who may have some psychological issues if
      he looks different from his son. The fear of confronting
      these issues in themselves could motivate circumcised men to
      cling to the myth that intact sons will have such issues.
      Furthermore, when the first generation of American boys was
      circumcised, they looked different from their intact fathers.
      This myth was not prevalent then because intact men generally
      had no repressed feelings about how their penis looked.</p>

      <p class="text1">Pertinent information leads to the following
      inferences regarding the decision to circumcise for social or
      'matching' reasons:</p>

      <ol type="i">
        <li>A circumcised boy who matches others may nevertheless
        have negative feelings about being circumcised. These
        feelings can last for a lifetime [<a
        href="#n21">21</a>].</li>

        <li>It is not possible to predict before circumcision how a
        boy will feel about it later.</li>

        <li>Even though intact men are in the minority in the USA,
        there is no evidence that many of them are dissatisfied
        with being intact.</li>

        <li>An intact male who is unhappy about it can choose to be
        circumcised, but this is rarely done. The estimated rate of
        adult circumcision in the USA is 3 in 1000 [<a
        href="#n75">75</a>].</li>

        <li>An intact male who is unhappy about his status may feel
        different after learning more about circumcision and the
        important functions of the foreskin.</li>

        <li>The social factor is much less of an issue for boys
        born in the USA today because of the lower circumcision
        rate (60% nationally, under 40% in some states [<a
        href="#n76">76</a>])</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text1">Because it commonly affects behaviour,
      social science researchers have extensively investigated the
      issue of conformity and have verified what is suspected here;
      group pressure can lead people to abandon their judgement and
      conform. In a well known study, 80% of subjects conformed to
      the false consensus of a group, even though that consensus
      was contradicted by visual evidence [<a href="#n77">77</a>].
      Conforming to group practice has also been shown to be more
      likely when the group is large [<a href="#n78">78</a>].
      Furthermore, when the situation is ambiguous, people are
      especially influenced by the group, and the greater the
      ambiguity, the greater the influence of the groups on the
      judgement of individual members [<a href="#n79">79-81</a>].
      The need for social approval drives our tendency to conform.
      Until the environment of conflicting information and general
      support for the practice changes, conformity will continue to
      be a strong factor in circumcision decisions by parents.</p>

      <p><a id="religious" name="religious"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>Religious circumcision</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">There are no empirical studies on the
      psychological aspects of religious circumcision. The
      following information is based on communications to the CRC
      and limited related literature. Jewish circumcision is
      associated with the Torah account (Gen. 17:6-14) where God
      commanded Abraham and his male descendants to be circumcised.
      Because the Jewish practice precedes its documentation in the
      Torah by over a thousand years [<a href="#n82">82,83</a>],
      the divine commandment for circumcision may have been a way
      to relieve the parents of any sense of responsibility or
      guilt. The real origin of Jewish circumcision is a matter of
      speculation. Muslim circumcision is not mentioned in the
      Koran, and Muslim scholars debate its religious basis [<a
      href="#n84">84</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Since many Muslims and Jews either do not
      know or do not necessarily accept religious beliefs
      associated with circumcision (e.g. only 13% of American Jews
      believe the Torah is the actual word of God [<a
      href="#n85">85</a>]), cultural beliefs have been adopted to
      replace religious beliefs associated with circumcision and
      defend the practice. For example, Muslims and Jews reinforce
      circumcision by believing that all members of the group
      practice it. With this belief, Jews and Muslims put
      themselves under pressure to comply with social expectations
      to circumcise. Having an ally helps people to resist
      conformity [<a href="#n86">86</a>], but those in religious
      groups who question circumcision believe that they are alone
      and have no choice. A conspiracy of silence serves to
      suppress questioning. (An editorial in a Jewish newspaper
      claimed that circumcision 'is not subject to debate' [<a
      href="#n87">87</a>].) In effect, religious circumcision is
      not necessarily chosen out of religious belief, but is often
      done out of fear of rejection if it is not performed. (The
      fear of rejection may be more of a threat than a reality.
      Jewish parents of intact sons who have contacted the CRC
      report that it has not been a problem for them or their
      sons.)</p>

      <p class="text1">Another cultural belief related to Jewish
      circumcision is that it ensures the survival of the Jewish
      people. This contention is especially compelling and may be
      used because of the Jews' long history of having to fight to
      survive. In fact the biggest threat to Jewish survival today
      is assimilation, and there is no evidence that circumcision
      prevents or slows it. According to a survey of American Jews,
      more than half of all Jews who marry choose a non-Jewish
      spouse [<a href="#n85">85</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Associated with the desire for survival is
      the idea of identity. Many Jews believe that males must be
      circumcised to be Jewish; this is not correct. As stated in
      the <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>, 'Any child born of a Jewish
      mother is a Jew, whether circumcised or not' [<a
      href="#n88">88</a>]. Because a rational explanation is often
      sought for behaviour, Jews and Muslims may also use claims of
      medical benefits to provide reassurance about the
      advisability of circumcision [<a href="#n15">15,84</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Religious groups have virtually no awareness
      of the harm caused by circumcision. Rabbi and mohel (ritual
      circumciser) Ronald Weiss comments on the degree of pain:
      'It's essentially as painless as you going to the barbershop
      to get your hair cut' [<a href="#n89">89</a>]. Expert mohel
      Romi Cohn, who has carried out thousands of circumcisions
      over 17 years, agrees that the procedure is 'absolutely
      painless, for Jewish law is careful not to cause trauma to
      the child' [<a href="#n90">90</a>]. Muslim children may
      remember the pain of circumcision if it is performed later in
      childhood, but there is a strong taboo against one
      complaining about it. Muslim and Jewish writing on
      circumcision has defended the practice by claiming that the
      resulting reduced sexual sensitivity is a benefit. [<a
      href="#n84">84,92,92</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">Progress is being made among Jews; articles
      questioning circumcision have been published in the Jewish
      press, and more Jews are choosing not to circumcise their
      sons [<a href="#n93">93-95</a>]. The CRC has records of
      hundreds of Jews in the USA, Europe, South America and Israel
      who either have not circumcised or would not circumcise a
      son. In Israel there is an organization that publicly opposes
      circumcision [<a href="#n96">96</a>].</p>

      <p><font size="+1"><a id="doctors"
      name="doctors"></a><b>Cultural values and
      science</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">Among physicians, support for circumcision
      has been based on supposed 'rational' factors, but as
      psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich wrote, 'Intellectual activity has
      often a structure and direction that it impresses one as an
      extremely clever apparatus precisely for the avoidance of
      facts, as an activity which distracts from reality' [<a
      href="#n97">97</a>]. This appears to have been the case in
      those advocating circumcision. Science has been adopted as
      the great arbiter between fact and fiction. This systematic
      approach to evaluating experience is of value, especially as
      research has shown that a surprising number of adults do not
      reason logically [<a href="#n98">98</a>]. The scientific
      method is designed to help protect the scientific community
      and the public against flawed reasoning, but it is the flawed
      reasoning of supposedly reputable scientific studies that has
      contributed to the confusion on the circumcision issue.</p>

      <p class="text1">One reason that flawed studies are published
      is that science is affected by cultural values. A principal
      method of preserving cultural values is to disguise them as
      truths that are based on scientific research. This 'research'
      can then be used to support questionable and harmful cultural
      values such as circumcision. This explains the claimed
      medical 'benefits' of circumcision.</p>

      <p><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion"></a><font
      size="+1"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">There is strong evidence that circumcision
      is overwhelmingly painful and traumatic. <a
      href="/library/pain/taddio2/">Behavioural changes in
      circumcised infants have been observed 6 months after the
      circumcision</a>. The physical and sexual loss resulting from
      circumcision is gaining recognition, and some men have strong
      feelings of dissatisfaction about being circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text1">The potential negative impact of
      circumcision on the mother-child relationship is evident from
      some mothers' distressed responses and from the infants'
      behavioural changes. The disrupted mother-infant bond has
      far-reaching developmental implications [<a
      href="#n99">99-104</a>] and may be one of the most adverse
      impacts of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">Long-term psychological effects associated
      with circumcision can be difficult to establish because the
      consequences of early trauma are only rarely, and under
      special circumstances, recognizable to the person who
      experienced the trauma. However, lack of awareness does not
      necessarily mean that there has been no impact on thinking,
      feeling, attitude, behaviour and functioning, which are often
      closely connected. In this way, an early trauma can alter a
      whole life, whether or not the trauma is consciously
      remembered.</p>

      <p class="text1">Defending circumcision requires minimizing
      or dismissing the harm and producing overstated medical
      claims about protection from future harm. The ongoing denial
      requires the acceptance of false beliefs and
      misunderstandings of facts. These psychological factors
      affect professionals, members of religious groups and parents
      involved in the practice. Cultural conformity is a major
      force perpetuating non-religious circumcision, and to a
      greater degree, religious circumcision. The avoidance of
      guilt and the reluctance to acknowledge the mistake and all
      that that implies help to explain the tenacity with which the
      practice is defended.</p>
      <a id="social" name="social"></a> 

      <p class="text1">Whatever affects us psychologically also
      affects us socially. If a trauma is acted out on the next
      generation, it can alter countless generations until it is
      recognized and stopped. The potential social consequences of
      circumcision are profound [<a href="#n21">21</a>]. There has
      been no study of these issues perhaps because they are too
      disturbing to those in societies that do circumcise and of
      little interest in societies that do not. Close psychological
      and social examination could threaten personal, cultural and
      religious beliefs of circumcising societies. Consequently,
      circumcision has become a political issue in which the
      feelings of infants are unappreciated and secondary to the
      feelings of adults, who are emotionally invested in the
      practice.</p>

      <p class="text1">Awareness about circumcision is changing,
      and investigation of the psychological and social effects of
      circumcision opens a valuable new area of inquiry.
      Researchers are encouraged to include circumcision status as
      part of the data to be collected for other studies and to
      explore a range of potential research topics [<a
      href="#n21">21</a>]. Examples of unexplored areas include
      testing male infants, older children and adults for changes
      in feelings attitudes and behaviours (especially antisocial
      behaviour); physiological, neurological and neurochemical
      differences; and sexual and emotional functioning.</p>
