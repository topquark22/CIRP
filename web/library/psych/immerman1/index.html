      <p align="justify"><font size="-1">ABSTRACT. Humans are
      intensely biocultural beings. The linkages and causal
      feedback loops among their symbolic world, their cultural
      world, and their physical bodies can be exquisitely complex
      and subtle. It is suggested in this article that one cultural
      event--circumcision--exemplifies that subtlety and
      complexity. It is hypothesized that circumcision reorganizes
      the male's sensory somato-cortex to raise the threshold of
      sexual excitability/distraction. This threshold shift thereby
      allows the young men of a social group (a) to be slightly
      more tractable in exectuting corporate activities beneficial
      to the community and (b) to be slightly more restrained
      sexually and more cooperative in the pair bond. The practice
      is accepted because the procedure is deeply ingrained in the
      ritual and symbolic life of the social group and is
      applicable to all young males. Suggestions are made on how to
      test this hypothesis empirically.</font></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The Circumcision Reference
      Library chooses articles based on merit. The authors of this
      article argue that 1) the foreskin is sensory tissue, and 2)
      removal of the foreskin by circumcision causes sensory
      deprivation to the brain, and 3) that sensory deprivation to
      the brain produces brain damage/reorganization, and 4) that
      sexual excitability is reduced, and 5) there is a net benefit
      to society. The Circumcision Reference Library believes that
      the first three arguments are meritorious and this article is
      included in the Circumcision Reference Library on that basis.
      The Circumcision Reference Library believes that arguments
      four and five lack merit.]</p>

      <p align="justify">ALTHOUGH THE NATURE-NURTURE PROBLEM has
      had an uneven history, there is consensus on one element
      within the overall argument: behavior, including motivation,
      is mediated through the central nervous system. Hence,
      changes in the central nervous system are aligned with
      changes in behavior. The correspondence is, of course, not
      necessarily a one-to-one relationship. Nevertheless, it is
      clear that nontrivial reorganization or lesions to the
      central nervous system affect behavioral outputs. Depending
      on the locus of the neural shifts, the change can be in
      sensory perceptions, internal analysis, or motor outputs.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also
      clear that cultural inputs that surround and immerse the
      individual are analyzed by his or her central nervous system,
      and culturally appropriate behaviors are typically emitted.
      Distinct cultures have their own distinct inputs, implemented
      via cultural traditions, and individuals will typically
      behave with the appropriate, culturally sanctioned
      behaviors.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this
      article, we offer an attempt to link a cultural ritual -
      circumcision - with behavioral changes. The act of
      circumcision itself is deeply enmeshed in a culture's
      symboling system. The behavioral changes are purposed to be
      mediated by neural changes.</p>

      <p><i>Circumcision: Cultural Rituals</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision
      involves the permanent removal of the foreskin of the male -
      invariably a young male and often an infant. Diverse
      religions and cultures have included circumcision in their
      ritual and religious worlds: Judaism, Islam, tribes in
      sub-Saharan Africa, tribes of Australian aborigines (Murdock,
      1957; for a history and geography of circumcision, see Bryk,
      1934). Each group has developed an elaborate set of images,
      metaphors, symbols, and rationales for circumcision. (For
      Moslem examples, see Pierce, 1964; Bowen &amp; Early, 1993;
      cf. Abu-Sahlieh, 1994; for sub-Saharan African examples, see
      Turnbull, 1962; Winter, 1959; for an Australian aboriginal
      example, see Tonkinson, 1978. For a biocultural overview, see
      <a href="/library/psych/immerman2/">Immerman &amp;
      Mackey</a>, in press. For a map of the distribution of levels
      of circumcision in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, see
      Caldwell &amp; Caldwell, 1996. For a Freudian interpretation,
      see Young, 1962. For the history in the United States of the
      ongoing medical debate on the value of circumcision, see <a
      href="/library/history/gollaher/">Gollaher, 1994</a>. For the
      various positions of the current medical debate on the
      benefits and costs of circumcision, see <a

      1996.)</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Circumcision from the Jewish
      perspective.</i> The written history of Jewish circumcision
      is both long and rich and illustrates well the ornate
      cultural context that surrounds the physical procedure
      itself. The Encyclopaedia Judaica (1972, pp. 568-576) gives
      the following perspective on circumcision in Judaism. It
      originated, according to the Biblical account, from a divine
      behest. From Genesis 17: 11-12 comes the prescription: "Every
      male among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall be
      circumcised in the flesh of our foreskin, and it shall be a
      token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. And he that is eight
      days old shall be circumcised among you, every male
      throughout your generations." The covenant involved a promise
      that Abraham's lineage would be multitudinous and that these
      multitudes would inherit the land of Canaan if Abraham and
      his descendants would practice circumcision. Abraham
      circumcised himself, his son Ishmael, all the males of his
      household, and his slaves. In the following year, Abraham's
      second son, Isaac, was born and was circumcised at eight days
      old. Circumcision was considered so important that the rabbis
      taught that were it not for the blood of the covenant
      (circumcision), heaven and earth would not exist. The ritual
      of circumcision was and is viewed as a sign of faith. Any
      perceived medical overlay of the practice occurred only
      recently.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing any
      religious-symbolic function, the biological question remains:
      "What consequences occur by the removal of the human
      foreskin?"</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Biological and Cultural Consequences of
      Circumcision</b></p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Biological consequences.</i> The
      relevant but sparse literature that deals with the human
      foreskin tends to tacitly refer to it as a mere flap of skin.
      Anatomically, however, this reference is not accurate. <span
      class="yellow">The intact human foreskin is richly innervated
      and contains holocrine glands (e.g., Tyson's glands)</span>.
      (For reviews of the development of sensory nerve endings in
      the human penis, see Dail &amp; Evan, 1974; <a
      href="/library/anatomy/halata/">Halata &amp; Munger,
      1986</a>; Sommerova, 1976.) In terms of surface area, the
      human foreskin represents approximately 36% - more than one
      third - of the intact penis's skin (Ritter, 1992; also see <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor, Lockwood, &amp;
      Taylor, 1996</a>). As a facet of the man's reproductive
      apparatus, <span class="yellow">the foreskin seems
      nontrivial.</span></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensation is
      localized within the brain. <span class="yellow">If
      circumcision affects the sensory pathways of the brain, then
      the implication should be strong that subsequent sexual
      sensations will also be affected.</span> Studies on the
      triangulation of the foreskin, the central nervous system,
      and circumcision have yet to be conducted or, at least, are
      not easily located. Nonetheless, inferential evidence is
      available.</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Lesions and cortical
      reorganization.</i> Researchers have demonstrated that if an
      animal's digit is removed or de-afferentated, the somato -
      sensory area that serves that digit is both structurally and
      functionally reorganized, sometimes extensively (e.g.,
      Doetsch, Johnston, &amp; Hannan, 1990; Doetsch, Standage,
      Johnston, &amp; Lin, 1988; Kelahen &amp; Doetsch, 1984;
      Kelahen, Ray, Carson, Massey, &amp; Doetsch, 1981; Welker
      &amp; Seidenstein, 1959). The effects of the digit removal
      are greater if the trauma occurs early in the organism's
      development (cf. Florence et al., 1996; Garraghty &amp; Kaas,
      1991). The reorganization of the cortex is generally not
      orderly. Cortical cells that serve the areas adjacent to the
      removed/de-afferentated digit expand their influence into the
      region of the cortex that would have served the affected
      digit. The expansion seems stochastic rather than pre-ordered
      or patterned.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,
      as was shown in monkeys, when the affected, damaged area or
      areas adjacent to the damaged area are stimulated, the
      threshold for activating the relevant cortical cells is often
      higher (Wall, Huerta, &amp; Kaas, 1992). Subcortical areas
      (e.g., the thalamus; Florence &amp; Kaas, 1995; Garraghty
      &amp; Kaas, 1991) that project to the somato- sensory cortex
      are also reorganized. Given that the thalamus is a primary
      sensory "switchboard" for the brain, any reorganization at
      this subcortical level would be expected to influence both
      cortical and subcortical functioning.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When nerves
      that innervated the hands of monkeys were severed, the
      cortical-sensory areas serving those hands did not recover
      responsiveness to cutaneous stimuli (Huerta &amp; Wall, 1987;
      Wall &amp; Kaas, 1986; also see Pons et al., 1991; cf.
      Jackson &amp; Diamond, 1981). After de-afferenting digits of
      the squirrel monkey, Garraghty, Hanes, Florence, and Kaas
      (1994) noted that much of the sensory cortex normally
      activated by the removed digit remained unresponsive to
      cutaneous stimulation. Garraghty et al. concluded that there
      is a limit to the scope of new receptive fields that cortical
      neurons can acquire. (For a similar discussion on the owl
      monkey, see Wall; Kaas, Sur, et al., 1986.) Wall and Kaas
      (1986) and Wall, Huerta, and Kaas (1992) offered
      corroborating evidence and interpretation.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florence,
      Wall, Garraghty, and Kaas (1988) noted that nerve
      regeneration is often incomplete and disorderly and that the
      remaining area of the somato-cortex becomes reorganized.
      Large zones of such "silent" cortex persist over time.
      Similar reorganization of the somato-sensory cortex (after
      amputation of a digit or after severing nerves) has been
      reported for cats (Kalaska &amp; Pomeranz, 1982; Metzler
      &amp; Marks, 1979) and rats (Cusick, 1996; Cusick, Wall,
      Whiting, &amp; Wiley, 1990; Rhoades, Wall, Chiala,
      Bennett-Clarke, &amp; Killackey, 1993; Wall &amp; Cusick,
      1984).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">It appears that any sensory deprivation of a
      system can also lead to cortical changes.</span> For example,
      Kandel (1991) noted in his work with ocular dominance
      that</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="-1">If one eye is closed
          during a critical period, the columns [of neurons in the
          visual cortex] devoted to that eye <i>shrink</i> while
          those devoted to the open eye <i>expand</i>. This
          modifiability of the ocular dominance columns is
          restricted to a relatively short period just after birth
          (p. 1024; emphasis added)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">(See Jessell, 1991, for an overview of
      neuronal reactions to injury.) It is also useful to note that
      the phantom limb phenomenon (Melzack, 1992) has not been
      reported or found regarding the circumcised foreskin.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a review
      of the literature on the plasticity or malleability of
      sensory maps, Kaas (1991) offered the following summary:</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Reorganization
      of sensory maps in the brain follows changes in neural
      activity patterns induced by the relative inactivation of
      feed forward pathways produced by lesions or by the removal
      of the (i) sensory surfaces, (ii) peripheral nerves, or (iii)
      more central structures.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Sensory maps in the brain, both
      early and late in processing hierarchies, are mutable, but
      such changes are more dramatic in higher stations. The
      increased level of change in these higher areas, closer to
      the cortex, may be because of the accumulation of serial
      changes and/or the greater potential plasticity.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Sensory maps in the
      somato-sensory visual and auditory systems in the brain are
      all capable of change.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Sensory maps within the brain
      have been shown to change in a wide range of mammalian
      species (e.g., raccoons, monkeys, rats, cats et al.). The
      clear implication is that adult plasticity is a feature of
      all mammalian brains. And, as a large reservoir of data
      demonstrates, the younger the individual is, the greater is
      the plasticity in the development of the nervous system. See
      Kandel, Schwartz, &amp; Jessell (1991) for examples.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) There is presently little
      evidence related to the behavioral consequences of the
      reorganization of maps in the brain. Nevertheless, partial
      recoveries of lost abilities which follow central damage
      include the possibilities of alterations and improvements in
      sensory skills.</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Synopsis.</i> Framed a little
      differently within the context of circumcision, the removal
      of the foreskin would be expected to reorganize the somato-
      sensory cortex of the brain of the affected individual.
      Because sexual stimuli normally travel to the cerebral cortex
      via the thalamus and then to those subcortical areas that are
      aligned with emotion - for example, the septum (Rivard, 1982)
      - any reorganization of the cerebral cortex would be expected
      to affect the overall sexual behavior of that individual (for
      supporting evidence, see <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann, Masi, &amp;
      Zuckerman, 1997</a>; cf. Masters &amp; Johnson, 1966). <span
      class="yellow">The earlier in the male's life the
      circumcision occurs, the more impact the ablation would be
      expected to have on his nervous system and, hence, his
      behavioral tendencies.</span></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, <span
      class="yellow">we argue here that removal of an individual's
      foreskin has consequences in that person's brain.</span> The
      removal of the foreskin - part of the male's reproductive
      apparatus - is hypothesized to affect sexual excitability.
      The most intuitive direction of any change would be to lower
      excitability or raise the threshold for sexual arousal.</p>

      <p align="justify"><i>Circumcision and skin texture.</i> A
      result of circumcision is the keratinization and
      desensitization of the surface epithelium of the glans penis.
      In other words, if the moistening, protective covering of the
      glans penis were removed, then the skin on the surface of the
      glans penis would dry out and become toughened and callused.
      Again, the end result is a desensitization of the man's
      reproductive tissues. Excitability would be lowered, and the
      threshold for sexual arousal would be raised.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><i>Benefits to the Community From Circumcision</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultures,
      not unlike stars and species of flora and fauna, seem to have
      a life cycle. They are born. They flourish. They die. Large
      numbers of cultures from antiquity, such as the Aztecs, the
      Incas, the Maya, Pharaoh's Egypt, Socrates' Greece, Caesar's
      Rome, the Vikings, and Babylon, are no more. Some North
      American Indian tribes are gone. Extant South American Indian
      tribes are currently destined for eradication. To remain
      viable and competitive, intact cultural units must solve
      various communal problems: secure food (especially proteins);
      secure potable water; maintain internal cohesion and minimize
      internal disruption (especially caused by young, energetic
      males); and maintain defenses against marauding young,
      energetic males from competing groups (see Harris 1974a,
      1974b, 1977, for examples of problems met and solutions found
      for various facets by a myriad of cultural groups).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suggest
      that circumcision originated as a mechanism to lower, even if
      only slightly, sexual excitability/sexual distractions of
      young men. Because historical records will probably never be
      found and validated (circumcision was practiced in Pharaoh's
      Egypt and is thereby at least that ancient), the suggestion
      is not amenable to proof. Nonetheless, the argument is as
      follows.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy
      and aggressiveness of young men are valued assets in a
      society. Dangers from the young men of other groups need to
      be prevented, or, if not preventable, then thwarted. Internal
      tasks, such as communal hunts, require the young men's
      coordinated activities. If distractions from these tasks are
      minimized - not eliminated, just minimized - then the
      efficiency of the coordinated task is improved.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual
      interest of young men in young women is a very real event.
      Sexual distraction and excitability for the individual man
      can certainly compete for his attention and focus.
      Circumcision could raise the threshold for sexual
      excitability and distraction. That is, circumcision would not
      eliminate the sex drive, it would just raise the threshold.
      (For the importance of "sensory" input to the brain from the
      man's genitalia for his effective sexual behavior, see
      Bemelmans et al., 1991; Gerstenberg, Nordling, Hald, &amp;
      Wagner, 1989; Rowland, Leentvaar, Blom, &amp; Slob, 1991;
      Xinet al., 1996.) That is, sexual behavior (of males) is not
      simply motor/reflex driven.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the
      argument here is that circumcision is low-grade neurological
      castration. As a consequence of circumcision, the young men
      would be expected to be a ply more tractable and a ply less
      distractible. Fertility is not impaired. Aggressiveness is
      not impaired. The threshold for sexual excitability is simply
      raised.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: CIRP believes that the authors
      exhibit a fundamental mis-understanding of human sexuality.
      It is more likely that the removal of the erogenous tissue of
      the foreskin does nothing to lessen sexual excitability, but
      does lessen the ability of the circumcised male to achieve
      sexual satisfaction and gratification for himself and his
      mate, and may, consequently, tend to maintain the individual
      in a sustained heightened state of sexual excitement, perhaps
      with a heightened aggressive tendency. The effect of
      circumcision would, therefore, be more likely to be the
      opposite to that hypothesized by these authors.]</p>

      <p><i>Benefits to the Pair Bond From Circumcision</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as we
      hypothesized, circumcision results in raising the threshold
      for sexual excitability, then a putative benefit would accrue
      to the institution of marriage. Men's sexual impulsiveness
      would be lessened a ply. Again, men's sex drive is not
      removed, just abated. Consequently, the men's sexual
      behaviors, which are traditionally viewed as quicker and more
      direct, would be shifted in the direction of the women's
      sexual behaviors, which are traditionally viewed as slower
      and less direct. In addition, extramarital sexual activity
      would be similarly expected to be reduced.<a href="#n1"><font
      size="2"><sup>1</sup></font></a> Enhanced sexual
      compatibility within a marriage generally enhances the
      durability and coordination within that marriage.
      Consequently, strengthened marriages would be a positive
      vector within any society.</p>

      <p><i>The Trade-Offs Between the Man and His Society</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The societal
      calculus and trade-offs are as follows: The individual male
      is denied some additional or more intense sexual feelings.
      The community gains some additional compliance, and women
      gain some additional satisfaction within the pair bond. If
      all males are so affected within the group, no one male or
      cohort of males is at a courting or amorous disadvantage. The
      problem, of course, is how to convince parents that their
      sons' genitalia need to be mutilated. The next section
      addresses that legitimate query.</p>

      <p><i>The Juggernaut of Cultural Inertia</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      socialization process in humans begins at birth and is
      pervasive. Early learning - the systemization of the rules
      and worldview of a culture - is very resistant to
      re-systemization. That is, a process similar to imprinting is
      in evidence. (For classical discussion on imprinting, see
      Hess, 1973; Lorenz, 1958, 1965; Tinbergen, 1951, 1965; for
      current discussions, see Bolhuis &amp; Horn, 1992; Bornstein,
      1989; Bower, 1993; Cook, 1993; Leland, 1994; for specific
      discussions on human mating strategies, see Freedman &amp;
      Gorman, 1993; Rossi &amp; Rossi, 1990.) Once a child is
      enveloped in the cultural matrix, wherein each major
      institution reinforces every other major institution, the
      mind-set of the child is crystallized. As the child grows to
      maturity, cultural givens are not questioned, they simply
      "are" and are about as visible as the wind.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child,
      grown to adulthood and parenthood, will pass on his learned
      givens to the next generation. The culture of a child is
      presented to that child in ways and by means a child can
      understand. For example, were the young Western child to ask,
      "Why is the sky blue?" or "Why cannot a brother marry his
      sister?" or "Why is dishonesty not the best policy?" the most
      effective answers adults can give are "because it is, because
      he can't, because it isn't...now go outside and play."
      Complex feedback loops of
      economic-political-social-psychological forces are well
      beyond the ken of all children to understand and most adults
      to convey. However, <a
      href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">Rabbi Moses
      Maimonides</a> (cited in Ritter, 1992), who was also a
      physician of note, clearly articulated our thesis in the 13th
      century, when he wrote about the Jewish version of
      circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="-1">The bodily injury
          caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it
          does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it
          destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply
          counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that
          circumcision weakens the power of sexual
          excitement.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is
      understood by young children is the concept of authority
      (Piaget, 1954, 1977). Children universally obey parents and
      elders. Once so inculcated, children are then predisposed to
      obey the supernatural, deceased ancestors, and omnipotent
      deities. If the unseen, powerful forces mandate circumcision,
      then circumcision it will be. Again, if all sons by all
      parents are affected, then the cultural rule will have less
      difficulty getting started and less difficulty in being
      maintained. There is no exception toward which parents can
      maneuver. If someone is a member of our group and is a young
      male, then ipso facto, that boy will be circumcised.</p>

      <p><i>The Lack of Universality</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      legitimate question can be raised, "If the procedure is
      beneficial to the competitiveness of a society, then why is
      the procedure not universal?" Part of the answer must lie in
      the variability of both humans and human culture.
      Circumcision is not found in cultures indigenous to northern
      climates. Arguably, a harsh winter, over time, selects for
      characteristics that obviate the need for added young male
      tractability (for theoretical discussions, see Calvin, 1990;
      Freedman, 1974, 1979). Similarly, cultural rules that
      systematically inhibit informal interaction between the sexes
      would preclude the need for an additional factor in tamping
      down young men's ardor. In short, there could well be
      alternative strategies that successfully cope with male
      sexual assertiveness.</p>

      <p><i>A Hypothesis to Be Tested</i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument
      presented here has a number of assumptions and conclusions,
      some untested, some validated. The key untested conclusion is
      that a circumcised man's brain is reorganized and changed,
      compared with an uncircumcised man's brain. One of Popper's
      (1959, 1962) contributions to the philosophy of science is
      the recognition of the need for falsifiability. A good
      discipline generates falsifiable hypotheses; a poor
      discipline does not. With current technology, living tissue
      (e.g., the brain) can be studied in living individuals. <span
      class="yellow">The argument put forward by this thesis is
      that imaging of the brain via positron emission tomography
      (PET) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect
      differences in the somato-sensory cortex when it receives
      stimuli from the genitalia of circumcised men compared with
      similar cortical areas of uncircumcised men. These
      differences ought to be structural as well as
      functional.</span> Furthermore, additional differences may be
      detected in other areas of the brain that are involved in
      sexual functioning.</p>

      <p align="justify">Were such a hypothesis to be unsupported,
      then Huxley's definition of a tragedy, "a beautiful theory
      killed by an ugly fact," would be fulfilled. On the other
      hand, were such a hypothesis to be supported, then the
      Gordian knot that interlinks human symboling, human behavior,
      and human neurophysiology can be unraveled one notch.</p>

      An additional advantage to the community of reduced
      extramarital sexual relations - i.e., reduced numbers of
      sexual partners - is the concomitant reduction in sexually
      transmitted diseases. (See Immerman &amp; Mackey, 1997, for a
      discussion on the threats to the commonweal's reproductive
      capabilities resulting from endemic sexually transmitted
      diseases.)
