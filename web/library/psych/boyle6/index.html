      <h3>Abstract</h3>

      <p>Infant male circumcision continues despite growing
      questions about its medical justification. As usually
      performed without analgesia or anaesthetic, circumcision is
      observably painful. It is likely that genital cutting has
      physical, sexual and psychological consequences too. Some
      studies link involuntary male circumcision with a range of
      negative emotions and even post-traumatic stress disorder (<a
      href="/library/psych/ptsd2/">PTSD</a>). Some circumcised men
      have described their current feelings in the language of
      violation, torture, mutilation and sexual assault. In view of
      the acute as well as long-term risks from circumcision and
      the legal liabilities that might arise, it is timely for
      health professionals and scientists to re-examine the
      evidence on this issue and participate in the debate about
      the advisability of this surgical procedure on unconsenting
      minors.</p>

      dysfunction, trauma</i></p>

      <h3>Background to circumcision</h3>

      <p>"To circumcise (from the Latin, "to cut around") means to
      cut off part or all of the foreskin of a penis, permanently
      exposing the normally covered glans..." (Boyd, 1998, p. 13).
      Circumcision involves the amputation of both layers of the
      foreskin, and is often performed on baby boys a few days
      after birth (Ritter &amp; Denniston, 1996). The inner layer
      of the foreskin comprises thousands of erogenous nerve
      endings (Taylor, Lockwood, &amp; Taylor, 1996; Cold &amp;
      Taylor, 1999; Cold &amp; McGrath, 1999).</p>

      <p class="1">Moses Maim&oacute;nides (1135-1204), known as
      the "Rambam," was a medieval Jewish rabbi, physician and
      philosopher who stated unequivocally that the real purpose of
      circumcision was to reduce sexual gratification. According to
      Maim&oacute;nides (see 1963 translation, p. 609),</p>

      <p class="2">Similarly with regard to circumcision, one of
      the reasons for it is, in my opinion, the wish to bring about
      a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ
      in question, so that this activity be diminished and the
      organ be in as quiet a state as possible... In fact this
      commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting
      what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is
      defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is
      the real purpose of circumcision. None of the activities
      necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed
      thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible, but violent
      concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are
      diminished. The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of
      sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the
      pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has been
      made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from it, it
      must indubitably be weakened.</p>

      <p>In the English speaking world, circumcision was introduced
      as a medical procedure in the late-nineteenth century
      (Hodges, 1997). Victorian notions about the "ills of
      masturbation" influenced some physicians to endorse
      amputation of the erotogenic foreskin as "preventative
      therapy" since circumcised boys could not use their foreskins
      for masturbation (Moscucci, 1996). Circumcision subsequently
      was accepted as a panacea for many conditions, including
      epilepsy, paralysis, malnutrition, "derangement of the
      digestive organs," chorea, convulsions, hysteria, and other
      nervous disorders (Gollaher, 2000). In the ensuing decades,
      as each claimed benefit of circumcision was disputed, another
      would come to take its place (Hodges, 1997).</p>

      <p class="1">Various national medical associations have
      evaluated studies on therapeutic rationales for infant
      circumcision under standard surgical conditions and
      management (see Denniston, Hodges, &amp; Milos, 1999, for
      example). However, no national medical association anywhere
      in the world that has studied the issue recommends routine
      circumcision (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1999;
      Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons, 1996;
      Australian College of Paediatrics, 1996; British Medical
      Association, 1996; Canadian Paediatric Society, 1996).
      Recently, the American Medical Association (2000) has gone
      even further, confirming that infant circumcision is
      <i>non-therapeutic</i>. It is now generally acknowledged that
      any potential medical benefits of routine circumcision are
      outweighed by its risks and drawbacks (AAP, 1999).</p>

      <p class="1">Although approximately 80-85% of the world's
      adult males remain genitally intact (Lang, 1986; Wallerstein,
      1985; Williams &amp; Kapila, 1993), an estimated 650 million
      males alive today nevertheless have been circumcised
      (Hammond, 1999). In the United States alone, each year 1.2
      million males are circumcised shortly after birth (National
      Center for Health Statistics, 1998). In addition, the social
      anthropological literature on ritual circumcision in
      non-western cultures (see Gollaher, 2000) indicates that
      circumcision of boys during late childhood also is
      commonplace.</p>

      <p class="1">Objections to circumcision have been articulated
      for a while (e.g., Wallerstein, 1980) with increasing
      concerns coming from the professional mental health community
      (e.g., Boyle, 2000; Goldman, 1997, 1998, 1999). There is also
      mounting anxiety about issues of legal liability (see Boyle,
      Svoboda, Price, &amp; Turner, 2000; Richards, 1996; Smith,
      1998; Somerville, 2000; Svoboda, Van Howe, &amp; Dwyer, 2000;
      Van Howe, Svoboda, Dwyer, &amp; Price, 1999). Moreover,
      Giannetti (2000) has pointed to psychosexual sequelae that
      appear to go well beyond those acknowledged in the recent
      American Academy of Pediatrics (1999) circumcision policy
      statement. The present paper recounts many of these concerns.
      Evidence for both short- and long-term manifestations of
      circumcision are reviewed. Among the sequelae considered are
      pain, problems in sexual functioning, and emotional distress
      or trauma--all factors that impact on men's psychosexual
      health and well-being.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Circumcision pain</h3>

      <p>One of the fundamental issues that divides opinion on the
      practice of circumcision regards the presence or degree of
      pain. To address this issue, we turn to the concept of pain
      and the evidence for pain sensitivity in infants. As defined
      by scientists, pain is an unpleasant sensory experience
      associated with tissue damage (IASP, 1986). There is no doubt
      that circumcision entails observable pain and identifiable
      tissue damage (see joint statement of American Academy of
      Pediatrics and American Pain Society (American Academy of
      Pediatrics, 2001). The only matter of some interpretation is
      the infant's behaviour during circumcision. As with adults,
      pain in infants is expressed in stereotypic ways involving
      vocalisation, facial expression, body movements, and
      autonomic activity. Analysing the vocalisations of 30 newborn
      males during circumcisions of varying levels of invasiveness,
      Porter, Miller, and Marshall (1986) found that the
      invasiveness of the procedure was positively correlated with
      duration of crying, more pronounced peak fundamental
      frequencies, reduced harmonics, and greater variability of
      the fundamental. Crying extended to a day after circumcision
      and was interrupted by greater periods of quiet when
      anaesthesia was provided (Dixon, Snyder, Holve, &amp;
      Bromberger, 1984). It is also notable that adult listeners
      agreed on the urgency of these cries as a function of the
      intensity of the pain-producing stimulus. Levine and Gordon
      (1982) reviewed literature on the spectrographic analysis of
      pain-induced vocalisations (PIV) in infants and found
      remarkable similarity with the basic features of PIV in
      animals.</p>

      <p class="1">Despite the obvious unavailability of
      self-report, further evidence of pain has been demonstrated
      through observation of the facial expressions of infants
      undergoing circumcision. Regarded as the most definitive
      behavioural evidence of pain in the infant, it consists of a
      lowered brow, eyes squeezed shut, deepened nasolabial furrow,
      opened mouth, and a taut cupped tongue (Grunau, Johnston,
      &amp; Craig, 1990). This expression closely resembles the
      adult facial expression of pain, but it occurs with even
      greater consistency in infants undergoing painful procedures
      such as circumcision.</p>

      <p class="1">Infants also evidence considerable autonomic
      arousal during noxious stimulation. Of course, this
      generalises to other situations such as fear and frustration
      too. However, in combination with the facial and vocal
      evidence, such arousal is highly informative about the pain
      the infant is undergoing. For example, Porter, Porges, and
      Marshall (1988) observed that vagal tone significantly
      declined during circumcision, a result which was paralleled
      by significant increases in pitch of the infant's cries. The
      further discovery that vagal tone prior to circumcision
      predicted physiological reactivity to subsequent stress
      leaves little doubt that circumcision is highly noxious to
      the infant.</p>

      <p class="1">With regard to motor behaviour, infants tend to
      be a bit more limited than adults in responding to noxious
      stimuli (Tyler, 1988). This has occasionally been mistaken as
      an indication that infants experience less pain than adults.
      However, the infant's overall rigidity of the torso and limbs
      are indicative of pain (Johnston &amp; Strada, 1986). With
      increasing age and postnatal maturation of the somatosensory
      system, there is greater motor responsiveness to
      pain-producing stimuli like circumcision.</p>

      <p class="1">Pain pathways are well-developed late in
      gestation and neurochemical systems associated with pain
      transmission are functional (Anand &amp; Hickey, 1987). Many
      scientists (e.g., Field, 1995; Fitzgerald, 1987) have stated
      that we should now safely assume that all viable newborns
      feel pain. What is more critical is how pain is modulated in
      infancy. Andrews and Fitzgerald (1997) have reviewed the
      neurobiological evidence suggesting that the relative
      immaturity of the infant's nervous system may raise
      excitability in the spinal cord. Thus, the system for
      modulation of pain signals appears to be less developed in
      infants and this may render them highly susceptible to pain
      during procedures such as circumcision (Fitzgerald, 1998).
      Moreover, cognitive coping strategies (Fernandez, 1986;
      Fernandez &amp; Turk, 1989; Maiz &amp; Fernandez, 2000) and
      other descending cortical influences postulated as part of
      the gate control theory of pain (Melzack &amp; Wall, 1965)
      evidently are far less developed in infancy than later in
      life.</p>

      <p class="1">The pain that is apparent in circumcised infants
      and is intensified by their lack of coping resources can have
      further ramifications. Prescott (1989) referred to the stress
      hormones triggered by intense pain and the adverse effects
      they may exert on brain development, sexual function, and
      behaviour. Anand and Scalzo (2000) postulated that severe
      pain during infancy may permanently and irreversibly alter
      neurological circuitry responsible for pain perception and
      memory. Hepper (1996) documented functioning memory prior to
      and immediately after birth. An adverse painful perinatal
      event, through a process of classical conditioning, may
      sensitise the infant to pain later in life (Chamberlain,
      1989, 1995; Field, 1995; Jacobson et al., 1990). Thus, Taddio
      et al. (1997) found that circumcised boys displayed
      heightened physiological pain responses to vaccinations four
      to six months after circumcision suggestive of an infant
      analogue of post-traumatic stress disorder, as compared with
      genitally intact children.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Circumcision trauma</h3>

      <p>A traumatic experience is defined in DSM-IV as the direct
      consequence of experiencing or witnessing of serious injury
      or threat to physical integrity that produces intense fear,
      helplessness or (in the case of children) agitation (American
      Psychiatric Association, 1994). The significant pain and
      distress described earlier is consistent with this
      definition. Moreover, the disturbance (e.g., physiological
      arousal, avoidant behaviour) qualifies for a diagnosis of
      acute stress disorder if it lasts at least two days or even a
      diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if it
      lasts more than a month. Circumcision without anaesthesia
      constitutes a severely traumatic event in a child's life
      (Lander, Brady-Freyer, Metcalfe, Nazerali, &amp; Muttit,
      1997; Ramos &amp; Boyle, 2001; Taddio, Katz, Ilersich, &amp;
      Koren, 1997). It is possible that the trauma of genital
      surgery might have long-lasting psychological effects
      (Bigelow, 1995; Levy, 1945; Jacobson &amp; Bygdeman, 1998;
      Anand &amp; Scalzo, 2000).</p>

      <p class="1">Van Howe (1996, p. 431) reported that, "Newborn
      males respond to circumcision with a marked reduction in
      oxygenation during the procedure, a cortisol surge, decreased
      wakefulness, increased vagal tone, and less interactions with
      their environment following the procedure..." Rhinehart
      (1999) in a report of clinical cases noted that the only
      response available to the infant is shock, wherein the
      central nervous system is overwhelmed by pain, followed by
      numbing, paralysis, and dissociation. Possibly, dissociation
      of the traumatic experience and emotional pain may be
      employed by the infant as a psychological defence (Chu &amp;
      Dill, 1990; Noyes, 1977; Rhinehart, 1999). While some babies
      have been described as being "quiet" after circumcision,
      Rhinehart concluded that the observed stillness most likely
      represents a state of dissociation or shock in response to
      the overwhelming pain.</p>

      <p class="1">Consistent with the early reports of Anna Freud
      (1952), McFadyen (1998) observed psychological trauma in her
      son following circumcision. This is sometimes extreme enough
      to impede the maternal-infant bonding (Marshall et al., 1982;
      Van Howe, 1996). As reasoned by Herman (1992) and Rhinehart
      (1999) the common factor underlying circumcision trauma is an
      experience of violence and powerlessness--inflicted by other
      human beings. Such an event was described in a study of 12
      Turkish boys circumcised in late childhood. Cansever (1965,
      p. 328) reported that "Circumcision is perceived by the child
      as an aggressive attack upon his body, which damaged,
      mutilated, and, in some cases, totally destroyed him." Ritual
      circumcision appeared to be associated with increased
      aggressiveness, weakening of the ego, withdrawal, reduced
      functioning and adaptation, and nightmares consistent with
      PTSD.</p>

      <p class="1">Ramos and Boyle (2001) investigated the
      psychological effects associated with medical and ritual
      "operation tuli" circumcision procedures in the Philippines.
      Some 1577 boys aged 11 to 16 years (1072 boys circumcised
      under medical procedures; 505 subjected to ritual
      circumcision) were surveyed to see if genital cutting led to
      the development of PTSD. Interestingly, Mezey and Robbins
      (2001) <i>estimated</i> the incidence of PTSD as 1.0% to 7.8%
      in the general British population where circumcision is not
      very prevalent. On the other hand, using the PTSD-I
      questionnaire (Watson et al., 1991) in a predominantly
      circumcised population, Ramos and Boyle <i>observed</i> an
      incidence of PTSD of almost 70% among boys subjected to
      ritual circumcision, and 51% among boys subjected to medical
      circumcision (with local anaesthetic). Long-term follow-up
      would be needed to gauge the extent to which PTSD persists
      over the lifespan of these circumcised boys.</p>

      <p class="1">The outcome of painful childhood trauma includes
      long-lasting neurophysiological and neurochemical brain
      changes (Anand &amp; Carr, 1989; Anand &amp; Scalzo, 2000;
      Ciaranello, 1983; Taddio et al., 1997; van der Kolk &amp;
      Saporta, 1991). Richards, Bernal, and Brackbill (1976) found
      that circumcision may impact adversely on the developing
      brain, and that reported "gender differences" may actually
      arise from behavioural changes induced by infant or childhood
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="1">Rhinehart (1999) in a report of adult clinical
      cases concluded that a man circumcised as a child is more
      likely to react with terror, rage and/or dissociation when
      confronted with situations interpreted as threatening. As in
      any situation of post-traumatic stress, an event resembling
      any aspect of the original traumatic experience is more
      likely to provoke negative emotions such as panic, rage,
      violence, or dissociation.</p>

      <p class="1">It is therefore not surprising that PTSD may
      result from childhood circumcision (Goldman, 1997, 1999,
      Menage, 1999; Ramos &amp; Boyle, 2001), just as it does from
      childhood sexual abuse and rape (Bownes, O'Gorman, &amp;
      Sayers, 1991; Deblinger, McLeer, &amp; Henry, 1990; Duddle,
      1991). Several researchers have concluded that PTSD may
      result from circumcision and/or from circumcision-related
      sequelae in later life. For example, Rhinehart (1999)
      reported finding PTSD in middle-aged men who had been
      subjected to infant circumcision. Circumcision involves an
      imbalance of power between perpetrator and victim, contains
      both aggressive and libidinal elements, and threatens a
      child's sexual integrity by amputating part of the genitalia.
      Some men circumcised in infancy or childhood without their
      consent have described their present feelings in the language
      of violation, torture, mutilation, and sexual assault
      (Bigelow, 1995; Hammond, 1997, 1999).</p>

      <p class="1">Even if the psychological sequelae of
      circumcision do not coalesce into a formal diagnosis of PTSD,
      it is possible that there may be long-lasting effects on a
      man's life, particularly in psychologically sensitive
      individuals with comorbidity factors (cf. Mezey &amp;
      Robbins, 2001). Presumably responding to their current
      interpretation and feelings, many circumcised men who have
      recognised the loss of a highly erogenous, irreplaceable part
      of their penis have reported long-lasting emotional
      suffering, grief, anxiety, and depression, and a sense of
      personal vulnerability (Hammond, 1997, 1999). Avoidance or
      obsessive preoccupation with such a loss, along with anger,
      can be difficult to reconcile for some men depending on their
      particular personality (Bigelow, 1995; Maguire, 1998; van der
      Kolk, 1989). Emotional numbing, avoidance of the topic of
      circumcision, and anger are potential long-term psychological
      consequences of the circumcision trauma (Bigelow, 1995;
      Bensley &amp; Boyle, 2001; Boyle &amp; Bensley, 2001; Gemmell
      &amp; Boyle, 2001; Goldman, 1997, 1999). In extreme cases,
      there might be aggressive, violent, and/or suicidal behaviour
      (Anand &amp; Scalzo, 2000; Bradley, Oliver, &amp; Chernick,
      1998; Jacobson et al., 1987; Jacobson &amp; Bygdeman,
      1998).</p>

      <h3>Circumcision and sexuality</h3>

      <p class="1">Sigmund Freud (1920) asserted that circumcision
      was a substitute for castration, suggesting a possible
      connection between castration fears, neuroses, and
      circumcision. Documented cases exist of circumcision
      resulting in a life-impairing level of castration anxiety
      (Ozturk, 1973). More recently, Immerman and Mackey (1998)
      described circumcision as "low-grade neurological
      castration." They argued that the resultant glans
      keratinisation and neurological atrophy of sexual brain
      circuitry (due to loss of sensory input to the brain's
      pleasure centre) may serve as a social control mechanism
      which produces a male who is less sexually excitable and
      therefore more amenable to social conditioning.</p>

      <p class="1">Indeed, for centuries, circumcision has been
      used as a strategy to reduce sexual gratification
      (Maim&oacute;nides, 1963, p. 609). According to Saperstein
      (1980), quoting Rabbi Isaac Ben Yedaiah, as well as the
      empirical findings of Bensley and Boyle (2001), and O'Hara
      and O'Hara (1999), heterosexual intercourse is less
      satisfying for both partners when the man is circumcised. Due
      to the neurological injury caused by circumcision, and the
      resultant reduction of sensory feedback (Immerman &amp;
      Mackey, 1998), it is highly likely that circumcision may
      promote sexual dysfunction such as premature ejaculation, and
      consequently, also the reduction of female sexual pleasure
      (cf. Money &amp; Davison, 1983). The possible deleterious
      effects on social and marital relationships (cf. Hughes,
      1990) may be considerable, especially in countries where most
      men have been circumcised.</p>

      <p><b><i>Structural Changes</i></b><br />
       Among the structural changes circumcised men may have to
      live with are surgical complications such as skin tags,
      penile curvature due to uneven foreskin removal, pitted
      glans, partial glans ablation, prominent/jagged scarring,
      amputation neuromas, fistulas, severely damaged frenulum,
      meatal stenosis, and excessive keratinisation. In addition,
      Immerman and Mackey (1998) and Prescott (1989) postulated
      that severing of erogenous sensory nerve endings in the
      foreskin during infancy leads to atrophy of non-stimulated
      neurons in the brain's pleasure centre during the critical
      developmental period.</p>

      <p class="1">Gemmell and Boyle (2001) surveyed 162
      self-selected men (121 circumcised; 41 intact) and found that
      circumcised men reported significantly less penile sensation
      as compared with genitally intact men. Participants rated
      their current level of penile sensation (on a scale from 1 to
      10) as compared with that experienced at age 18 years
      (allocated 10 out of 10). Circumcised men complained
      significantly more often than did genitally intact men of a
      progressive decline in penile sensation throughout their
      adult years--presumably due to increasing keratinisation of
      the exposed glans and inner foreskin remnant in circumcised
      men. Gemmell and Boyle also found that a significantly higher
      proportion of circumcised as compared with intact men
      reported bowing or curvature of the penis (also reported by
      Lawrence, 1997), shaft skin uncomfortably/painfully tight
      when erect, and scars/damage to the penis. Although the
      frenulum was reported as an area of heightened erogenous
      sensitivity, in the typical circumcised male, either no
      frenulum remains or only a small severely damaged remnant
      exists. The complex innervation of the foreskin and frenulum
      has been well-documented (Cold &amp; McGrath, 1999; Cold
      &amp; Taylor, 1999; Fleiss, 1997; Taylor et al., 1996), and
      the genitally intact male has thousands of fine touch
      receptors and other highly erogenous nerve endings--many of
      which are lost to circumcision, with an inevitable reduction
      in sexual sensation experienced by circumcised males
      (Immerman &amp; Mackey, 1998; O'Hara &amp; O'Hara, 1999).</p>

      <p><b><i>Functional Changes</i></b><br />
       There are also serious functional consequences of
      circumcision. Impaired sexual functioning was reported by 84%
      of respondents in a survey of circumcised men (Hammond,
      1997). Taylor, Lockwood, and Taylor (1996) provided
      anatomical and histological support for these self-reports of
      circumcised men by documenting the irreplaceable loss of
      specialised erogenous mucosa through circumcision. Further
      difficulties attributed to circumcision included intimacy
      problems (45%) and addiction/dependency problems (26%).
      Specific physical problems reported included glans
      insensitivity (55%), need for excess stimulation to enable
      ejaculation (38%), prominent scarring (29%), and insufficient
      residual shaft skin to accommodate full, untethered erections
      (27%).</p>

      <p class="1">Circumcised males may also be at risk of
      premature ejaculation, or alternatively may have to resort to
      prolonged thrusting during intercourse in order to stimulate
      sufficiently the residual erogenous penile nerve endings to
      trigger ejaculation (Bensley &amp; Boyle, 2001). They report
      that the unnatural dryness of their circumcised penis often
      makes coitus painful, resulting in chafing and/or skin
      abrasions (Gemmell &amp; Boyle, 2001). Concomitantly, O'Hara
      and O'Hara (1999) found that female partners reported
      significantly greater sexual pleasure from intercourse with
      genitally intact men as compared with circumcised men. Money
      and Davison (1983) had previously documented a loss of
      stretch receptors in the prepuce and frenulum and an
      associated diminution in sexual response, thereby restricting
      a circumcised man's ability to achieve arousal. Consequently,
      erectile dysfunction may be a complication of male
      circumcision (Glover, 1929; Ozkara, Asicioglu, Alici, Akkus,
      &amp; Hattat, 1999; Palmer &amp; Link, 1979; Stief, Thon,
      Djamilian, Allhoff, &amp; Jonas, 1992; Stinson, 1973).</p>

      <p class="1">Bensley and Boyle (2001) surveyed women and gay
      men who had previously had sexual intercourse with both
      genitally intact and circumcised men. Bensley and Boyle's
      samples comprised 35 women, and 42 gay men. In addition they
      surveyed 83 self-selected men (53 circumcised; 30 genitally
      intact) who provided self-reports regarding their sexual and
      psychological functioning. The overall results (women
      partners and gay male partners combined) were that
      circumcised partners were significantly less happy about
      their sexual functioning than were genitally intact
      partners.</p>

      <p class="1">In Bensley and Boyle's (2001) study, sexual
      dysfunction was more often reported by circumcised men who
      complained either of premature ejaculation (with little
      sexual sensation), and/or difficulty in gaining or
      maintaining an erection--the two most prevalent forms of
      erectile dysfunction. Reduced or insufficient neural feedback
      may account for circumcised men's inability to detect the
      moment when ejaculation is imminent. Premature ejaculation
      previously has been ascribed to learning or conditioning
      factors. For example, where a teenage boy is raised in an
      environment in which sexual pleasure is regarded as "sinful
      or dirty" he may have to hurry masturbation in order to avoid
      being "caught in the act." Premature ejaculation would
      therefore be negatively reinforced by avoiding an aversive or
      punitive consequence (cf. Schwartz &amp; Reisberg, 1991, pp.
      121-122). However, information is now emerging on the role of
      the prepuce in preventing premature ejaculation, wherein the
      foreskin serves to protect the corona of the glans penis from
      direct stimulation during intercourse (Halata &amp; Munger,
      1986; Zwang, 1997). Overall, circumcised men expressed
      significantly greater dissatisfaction with their sex lives
      than did genitally intact men. This result is consistent with
      the findings by Hammond (1997, 1999), and O'Hara and O'Hara
      (1999), that circumcision may impede psychosexual and
      emotional intimacy between partners.</p>

      <p><b><i>Altered Sexual Behaviours</i></b><br />
       Apart from reducing sexual sensation and pleasure (Bensley
      &amp; Boyle, 2001; Gemmell &amp; Boyle, 2001; Immerman &amp;
      Mackey, 1998; Milos &amp; Macris, 1994; Money &amp; Davison,
      1983; O'Hara &amp; O'Hara, 1999), circumcision also leads to
      changes in sexual practices. For example, Laumann, Masi, and
      Zuckerman (1997) reported that circumcision is associated
      with more elaborate sexual behaviours. It is possible that
      reduced sexual sensation may impel some circumcised men to
      engage in more elaborate sexual practices in order to attain
      sexual gratification. In regard to unsafe sex practices,
      Bensley and Boyle (2001) found that circumcised men were
      significantly less likely to use condoms than were genitally
      intact men. Presumably, use of a condom reduces sexual
      sensation, which may be of somewhat greater concern to
      circumcised men (cf. Gemmell &amp; Boyle, 2001; Van Howe,
      1999).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Other psychological considerations in circumcised
      men</h3>

      <p>In Gemmell and Boyle's (2001) survey, involuntary
      circumcision impacted negatively on various psychological
      measures. They found that as compared with genitally intact
      men, circumcised men were often unhappy about being
      circumcised, experienced significant anger, sadness, feeling
      incomplete, cheated, hurt, concerned, frustrated, abnormal,
      and violated (cf. Hammond, 1999). They also found that
      circumcised men reported lower self-esteem than did genitally
      intact respondents.</p>

      <p class="1">Rhinehart (1999) stated that psychological
      problems were almost universally noted by his self-selected
      circumcised respondents. These included reports of a sense of
      personal powerlessness, fears of being overpowered and
      victimised, lack of trust, a sense of vulnerability to
      violent attack, guardedness in relationships, reluctance to
      have relationships with women, defensiveness, diminished
      sense of masculinity, feeling damaged, sense of reduced
      penile size or amputation, low self-esteem, shame about not
      "measuring up," anger and violence towards women, irrational
      rage reactions, addictions and dependencies, difficulties in
      establishing intimate relationships, emotional numbing, a
      need for greater intensity in sexual experiences, decreased
      intimacy, decreased ability to communicate, as well as
      feelings of not being understood.</p>

      <p class="1">Hammond's (1997) sample of circumcised men
      reported emotional harm (83%), physical harm (82%), general
      psychological harm (75%), and low self-esteem (74%). The
      circumcised men frequently reported feeling mutilated (62%),
      unwhole (61%), resentful (60%), abnormal/unnatural (60%),
      that one's human rights had been infringed (60%), angry
      (54%), frustrated (53%), violated (50%), inferior to
      genitally intact males (47%), impeded sexually (43%), and
      betrayed by one's parents (34%). Similar findings emerged
      from a larger sample of 546 circumcised men studied by
      Hammond (1999).</p>

      <p><b><i>Anecdotal Accounts of Circumcision-Related
      Psychological Distress</i></b><br />
       Circumcised men have often provided anecdotal reports
      pertaining to their negative feelings about involuntary
      circumcision. For example, one man who contacted one of the
      authors (RG) at the Circumcision Resource Center in Boston
      told of an indelible scene when he was four. He was talking
      with a genitally intact boy who showed him his penis and
      explained circumcision to him. He was shocked and ashamed at
      what had been done to him and thought, "Why would somebody
      want to do that to me? They just chopped it off. It didn't
      make any sense to me." As an adult he thinks about it "every
      time I take a shower or urinate" (personal communication,
      December, 1993).</p>

      <p class="1">Another example of discovering the difference
      between being genitally intact as compared with being
      circumcised is the following retrospective anecdotal story
      also told to the same author (RG):</p>

      <p class="2">The shock and surprise of my life came when I
      was in junior high school, and I was in the showers after
      gym... I wondered what was wrong with those penises that
      looked different than mine... I soon realized I had part of
      me removed. I felt incomplete and very frustrated when I
      realized that I could never be like I was when I was
      born-intact. That frustration is with me to this day.
      Throughout life I have regretted my circumcision. Daily I
      wish I were whole (personal communication, October,
      1992).</p>

      <p>Likewise, an Australian man recently wrote to another
      author (GB) at Bond University:</p>

      <p class="2">I have been disadvantaged by inferiority and
      non-assertiveness in the workplace and in social life so much
      that I recently had to go onto a disability pension for
      chronic anxiety/anger disorder. My lifelong psychological
      distress of being circumcised definitely contributed strongly
      to steering me into this pattern of human interaction. I have
      no spare funds to take individual legal action, and no living
      person to sue for my poor quality of life, but if ever a
      class action for damages due to circumcision is mounted, I
      wish to add my name to it (personal communication, April,
      2001).</p>

      <p>Many similar anecdotal stories by circumcised men telling
      about psychological unhappiness that they perceived to be
      related to involuntary circumcision have been reported, for
      example, by Bigelow (1995) and Goldman (1997).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Methodological caveats</h3>

      <p><b><i>Sampling</i></b><br />
       One limitation of some of the foregoing research is that
      random sampling was not always enforced in subject
      recruitment (e.g., Rhinehart, 1999; Hammond, 1997, 1999).
      This may be understandable because of the difficulties in
      boosting sample sizes and the fact that participants were
      sometimes confined to certain "captive groups." In any case,
      the result is that there may be a self-selection bias as
      widely noted in survey research. Arguably, this could have
      led to inflation of some statistical effects of
      circumcision-related sequelae.</p>

      <p><b><i>Underestimation</i></b><br />
       Conversely, it is possible that problems related to
      circumcision may be greater than reported. The following
      speculations may explain why we don't hear more from many
      circumcised men about how they may truly feel (see Goldman,
      1998, pp. 43-44):</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The pressure to accept sociocultural assumptions
        regarding circumcision may prevent some men from
        recognising and feeling dissatisfaction. For example, some
        men were told when young that circumcision was necessary
        for health reasons and they did not question that
        assertion. In countries where circumcision is commonplace,
        its effects may become familiar and it is possible that
        these effects may be interpreted as "normal" (Bigelow,
        1995; Goldman, 1997).</li>

        <li>Verbal expression of preverbal feelings requires
        conscious awareness. Because preverbal traumas are
        generally unconscious, such feelings are expressed
        nonverbally through behavioural, emotional, and
        physiological forms (Chamberlain, 1989; Terr, 1988, 1991;
        van der Kolk, 1989).</li>

        <li>Any negative emotions associated with circumcision that
        may emerge into the conscious psyche may be very intense
        and disturbing. Repressing such emotions may serve to
        protect men from possible anguish. This may be compounded
        by the fear of dismissal or ridicule of one's feelings. If
        negative thoughts and/or feelings do momentarily become
        conscious, it is likely they will be suppressed.</li>

        <li>Privacy surrounding matters of sexuality may inhibit
        men from speaking out.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Nonverbal expression, lack of awareness and understanding
      of possible psychosexual sequelae related to circumcision,
      emotional repression, and fear of disclosure may help to keep
      circumcision feelings a secret. It is conceivable that the
      effects of circumcision trauma might become chronic and
      deeply embedded within the unconscious psyche, making it
      difficult to distinguish them from personality traits or
      effects due to other causes. In any case, more research is
      needed to address the conscious and unconscious psychological
      effects of circumcision on men.</p>

      <p><b><i>Cognitive dissonance</i></b><br />
       Although in recent years cognitive dissonance theory has
      fallen somewhat into disrepute (Walker, Burnham, &amp;
      Borland, 1994, p. 535), the theory may still be useful in
      explaining certain entrenched attitudes surrounding
      circumcision. Thus, the common resistance of some parents and
      doctors to information associating circumcision with harm
      invites speculation to explain it. Generally, people have a
      desire for coherence and consistency in their beliefs and
      experiences and it is possible that this factor may
      contribute to some extent to the perpetuation of cognitions
      supportive of circumcision. When inconsistency occurs,
      thereby creating cognitive dissonance, people may align their
      beliefs to fit their experience (Festinger &amp; Carlsmith,
      1959). Choosing to seek or to provide parental consent and
      then to circumcise or to allow one's child to be circumcised
      is a serious and irreversible choice. In accordance with
      cognitive dissonance theory, it would be expected that once
      the decision has been made and the circumcision carried out,
      most people would tend to appreciate the chosen alternative
      (circumcision) and depreciate the rejected alternative
      (leaving the child genitally intact)--(cf. Brehm, 1956).</p>

      <p class="1">As a result, beliefs may be adopted to conform
      with one's decision to circumcise. An example of these
      beliefs involving the psychological defence mechanisms of
      denial and rationalisation is the myth that newborn infants
      do not feel or remember pain. Even though studies suggest
      long-lasting memory of circumcision pain--particularly when
      the circumcision occurred during post-infancy childhood years
      (Chamberlain, 1989; Hepper, 1996; Rhinehart, 1999), some
      doctors who circumcise normal healthy boys may simply ignore
      this information (Stang &amp; Snellman, 1998). As well, a
      small proportion of doctors may proceed with the surgery on
      the basis of ill-informed beliefs. Others, by invoking
      psychological defences, may be perceptually blind to the pain
      associated with circumcision--perhaps as a result of their
      own circumcised status.</p>

      <p class="1">Inconsistency can also be reconciled by altering
      our beliefs. A common misconception is that the prepuce has
      no useful purpose. One circumcision advocate stated, "I
      believe the foreskin is a mistake of nature" (Wiswell, 1994).
      We may perceive and accept only information that fits our
      beliefs. Some physicians who support circumcision dismiss
      outright new information that conflicts with their
      preconceived view (Briggs, 1985). The tendency to avoid new
      information increases when the discrepancy between beliefs
      and experience increases (Kumpf &amp; Gotz-Marchand, 1973).
      Even after learning something new, people better remember
      information that supports established beliefs than they
      remember conflicting information (O'Sullivan &amp; Durso,
      1984). Avoidance of new information about the possible
      psychosexual sequelae of circumcision may lead to rigidity of
      thinking and a dependence on previously acquired dogma and
      cultural myths to counteract and subdue doubts, thereby
      maintaining cognitive harmony. As Bigelow (1995, pp. 105-106)
      stated. "This effect is very detectable among parents who
      have elected to circumcise their son--especially since they
      cannot retract their choice! These parents frequently do not
      want to hear anything negative about infant
      circumcision...."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Future directions</h3>

      <p><b><i>Foreskin Restoration</i></b><br />
       If involuntary circumcision can bring about psychological
      consequences through the aftermath of trauma, then it is
      possible that "uncircumcision" (Schultheiss, Truss, Stief,
      &amp; Jonas, 1998) may go some way towards attenuating those
      effects. In recent years, there has been an increasing
      awareness among circumcised men about the possibility of
      restoring a foreskin (albeit devoid of the amputated
      erogenous nerve endings), through a process of stretching and
      skin expansion over some years (Bigelow, 1995). Some men who
      have undergone foreskin restoration have reported discernible
      recovery of sexual sensation and function previously lost to
      circumcision, and sometimes a lessening of associated
      negative emotions (Goodwin, 1990; Greer, Mohl, &amp; Sheley,
      1982; Griffiths, 2001; O'Hara &amp; O'Hara, 2001).</p>

      <p class="1">Mohl, Adams, Greer, and Sheley (1981) failed to
      mention that one of the main reasons for circumcised men to
      restore themselves genitally was the crucial loss of prepuce
      function during sexual activity. Instead, they claimed that
      men who sought foreskin restoration were homosexually
      orientated with psychopathology including narcissistic and
      exhibitionistic body image, depression, inadequate early
      mothering, and egocentrism. Yet this conclusion was based on
      an unrepresentative sample of only eight men. These 20-year
      old results suffer from an analysis based on what today would
      be considered outdated therapeutic and discriminatory social
      prejudices against individuals with a homosexual orientation.
      Even so, Bigelow (1995), and Griffiths (2001) reported that
      most men undergoing foreskin restoration are in fact
      heterosexual. As Schultheiss et al. (1998, p. 1996) stated,
      "Nowadays, the understanding of the psychological motivations
      for uncircumcision is increasing, and the problem is dealt
      with more seriously.... the majority of the males performing
      skin-stretching are heterosexual." Postulated psychosexual
      benefits resulting from foreskin restoration have been
      discussed by Bigelow (1995).</p>

      <p><b><i>Circumcision Advocacy</i></b><br />
       Even though research suggests harmful effects of
      circumcision (e.g., Denniston &amp; Milos, 1977; Denniston,
      Hodges, &amp; Milos, 1999; Cold &amp; Taylor, 1999; Hammond,
      1999; Van Howe et al., 1999), psychological factors may make
      it difficult for circumcision advocates to stop promoting the
      practice (Goldman, 1997, 1998, 1999). Presumably, grief for
      the lost sexual body part and its functions, and the
      resultant denial of loss is important because it may explain
      the circumcised "adamant father" (who unreasonably insists on
      the circumcision of a son in the face of contrary evidence)
      as well as other manifestations of the circumcised male such
      as the "I'm circumcised and I'm fine" syndrome (Bigelow,
      1995; Ritter &amp; Denniston, 1996). Grief and denial in
      relation to involuntary circumcision may well play a role in
      the psychology of the circumcised male (Parkes, 1998). Such
      factors may figure even more prominently among those doctors
      who devote their entire medical practice or a substantial
      portion thereof to circumcising normal healthy boys when
      there is no medical reason to do so (cf. Bigelow, pp. 94-99).
      Some trauma victims experience a compulsion to re-enact the
      trauma (van der Kolk, 1989). Circumcising infants may to some
      extent involve re-enacting the trauma of one's own
      circumcision. A survey of randomly selected physicians showed
      that circumcision was more often supported by male doctors
      who themselves happened to be circumcised (Stein, Marx,
      Taggert, &amp; Bass, 1982).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>The body of empirical evidence reviewed here suggests that
      there is severe pain at the time of circumcision and shortly
      thereafter in unanaesthetised boys, as well as heightened
      pain sensitivity for some considerable period of time
      afterwards. Evidence has also started to accumulate that male
      circumcision may result in lifelong physical, sexual, and
      sometimes psychological harm as well. A variety of forces are
      converging from fields as diverse as psychology, medicine,
      law, medical ethics, and human rights, all questioning the
      advisability of circumcision which originated millenia ago
      and was promoted in the Victorian era. As Chamberlain (1998)
      pointed out, "parents are not warned that their infants will
      endure severe pain and will be deprived of a functional part
      of their sexual anatomy for life." Non-therapeutic
      circumcision of male minors is now being questioned by legal
      and ethics scholars in an unprecedented way. The mental
      health community can play an important role in the growing
      debate about circumcision. We encourage closer examination of
      this issue and even more empirical research into the
      psychosexual sequelae associated with circumcision.</p>
