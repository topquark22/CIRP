      <p><i>Bruce Bower reports from New York City at the annual
      meeting of the American Psychiatric Association</i></p>

      <h2>Exploring trauma's cerebral side</h2>

      <p>New studies suggest that people who fall prey to a severe
      stress reaction following military combat or sexual abuse
      have an unusually small hippocampus, a brain structure that
      helps to regulate memory. But scientists cannot say whether
      severe trauma somehow causes the hippocampus to shink or
      whether a small hippocampus somehow contributes to
      trauma.</p>

      <p>In a brain scan investigation by Murray B. Stein of the
      University of California, San Diego, 22 women who cited
      repeated childhood sexual trauma, displayed hippocampus
      volumes smaller by 5 percent than those of 20 women who
      reported no sexual abuse and no psychiatric disorders.
      Similar findings appeared last year (SN: 6/3/95, p.340).</p>

      <p>Sixteen of those sexually abused women suffered from
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Hippocampal volume was
      lowest in those reporting the most severe dissociation, Stein
      asserts. Dissociation includes feelings of detachment from
      one's self and other alterations of consciousness.</p>

      <p>Women abused as young children performed better on
      short-term memory tasks than those abused at later ages. The
      brains of young children may have more resilence to trauma
      than those of teenagers or adults, Stein theorizes.</p>

      <p>Another study conducted by Tamara V. Gurvits of the
      Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Manchester, N.H., found a
      24 percent smaller hippocampus size in seven Vietnam combat
      veterans suffering from PTSD, compared to seven Vietnam
      combat veterans free from PTSD and eight men who did not
      serve in the military. In the PTSD group, the smallest
      hippocampal volume appeared in those exposed to the most
      severe combat, Gurvits reports.</p>

      <p>Trauma researchers must account, however, for brain scan
      evidence that healthy people experience a drop in hippocampal
      volume of about 15 percent as they age, contends Mony J. de
      Leon of <a href="http://www.med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New
      York University Medical Center</a>.</p>

      <p>In a four year study of 405 elderly volunteers, de Leon
      and his coworkers found that probable cases of Alzheimer's
      disease often emerge in people who start out with a small
      hippocampus and mild memory problems. Hippocampal volume
      declined from 20 percent to 50 percent more in victims of
      apparent Alzheimer's disease than in healthy elderly
      controls, according to Leon.</p>

      <p>Several possible explanations exist for a link between a
      smaller hippocampus and PTSD, argues Roger K. Pitman, a New
      Hampshire colleague of Gurvits. Hippocampal shrinkage may
      occur first and boost the likelihood either of encountering
      traumas (such as making one more prone to volunteer for
      combat) or developing PTSD after trauma. Conversely,
      hippocampal atrophy may result directly from severe trauma,
      from PTSD produced by trauma, or from alcohol or illicit drug
      abuse, which frequently accompanies PTSD.</p>
