      <blockquote>
        <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT: The phenomenon of
        circumcision may well serve a range of religious and
        symbolic functions. In addition to these conceptual
        categories, we argue that circumcision alsoserves a more
        mundane, practical function of lowering excitability and
        distractibility quotients--sexual arousal--of pubescent
        males, i.e. biasing young males toward increased
        tractability which would enhance group efforts and less
        toward individual goals of amorous exchanges. Neurological
        data suggest that early lesions of the prepuce/foreskin
        tissues would generate a reorganization/atrophy of the
        brain circuitry. This re-organization/atrophy, in turn, is
        suggested to lower sexual excitability. Epithelial data
        indicate that keratinization of the more exposed glans
        penis would lower the sensibility, hence sexual
        excitability of the circumcised males's genitalia. In
        addition, circumcision removes the foreskin-prepuce which
        by secreting smegma, would also minimize any pheromonic
        qualities which the smegma may generate. Inferential data
        support the hypothesis that a practical consequence of
        circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic
        function, is to make a circumcised male less excitable and
        distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's
        authority figures.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The Circumcision Reference
      Library chooses articles based on merit. The authors of this
      article argue that 1) the foreskin is sensory tissue, and 2)
      removal of the foreskin by circumcision causes sensory
      deprivation to the brain, and 3) that sensory deprivation to
      the brain produces brain damage/reorganization, and 4) that
      sexual excitability is reduced, and 5) there is a net benefit
      to society. The Circumcision Reference Library believes that
      the first three arguments are meritorious and this article is
      included in the Circumcision Reference Library on that basis.

      <p class="text">The biocultural character of the human
      condition has recently received analytical attention (Barkow,
      1980, 1989; Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 1995; Durham, 1979,
      1990; Richardson and Boyd, 1988; Wright, 1994). The
      polarizing dichotomy of nature <i>versus</i> positions has
      been gradually replaced by an interactive paradigm wherein
      (1) over generations, the cultural "rules" of a society are
      aligned with biological bases and (2) over an individual's
      lifetime the person's "genes" help to sculpt a micro-ecology
      for the person in which he or she is comfortable/pre-adapted
      (Rowe, 1994; Scarr and McCartney, 1983). This article
      attempts to integrate one behavioral
      set&mdash;circumcision&mdash;both within cultural matrices
      and within humans' biological heritage.</p>

      <p class="text">The goal here is to integrate three major
      points. First, any culture-wide incorporation of a behavioral
      set into the day-to-day lives of a community's citizens is
      not random but filtered over time for net gains for the
      community. Second, the human's penis has a unique character
      and origin. Third, the act of circumcising the penis
      represents a net gain for the commonweal which systematically
      practices circumcision, and thereby the act has become
      embedded within the culture's overall matrix.</p>

      class="sc1">ULTURAL</span> R<span
      class="sc1">ITUALS</span></p>

      <p class="text">Although any one culture undoubtedly has
      idiosyncratic features, it is also arguable that behavioral
      themes will undergird the various cultures around the world
      (see Harris, 1974, 1979, for examples and theoretical
      discussion). For example, for any intact social and political
      groups, i.e., a tribe, to survive across generations, that
      group must solve important problems: (<i>a</i>) potable water
      must be secured and maintained; (<i>b</i>) nutrients,
      especially proteins, must be reliably provided; (<i>c</i>)
      births (at least 2,100 births per 1,000 women) and
      socialization of children must occur; (<i>d</i>) marauding
      young men from competing tribes must be prevented for
      successfully attacking the group; and (<i>e</i>) energetic
      young men <i>within</i> the group need to have their energy
      maximally guided into constructive behaviors which benefit
      the group and need to have that energy minimally allowed to
      be disruptive.</p>

      <p class="text">To the extent that a/any group group can
      fulfill these necessary, if not sufficient, preconditions,
      then the more viable that group can become in inter-cultural
      competition. The <i>World Ethnographic Sample</i> (Murdock,
      1957) and the <i>Ethnographic Atlas</i> (Murdock, 1967)
      contain numerous examples of extinct groups which were either
      eradicated or were absorbed into larger groups. This paper
      argues that circumcision can add a ply of competitiveness to
      a culture.</p>

      <p class="text">"Circumcision" involves the permanent removal
      of the prepuce or foreskin of the male, invariably a young
      male who is often an infant. A number of diverse cultures
      have included circumcision in their ritual and religious
      worlds: Judaism, Islam, tribes in sub-Saharan Africa, tribes
      of Australian aborigines. Each group has an elaborate set of
      images, metaphors, symbols, and rationales for the act
      itself: removal of the foreskin or prepuce (see Pierce, 1964,
      for a Moslem example, Turnbull, 1962 for a sub-Saharan
      African example, and Tonkinson, 1978, for an Australian
      aborgine example, and see Caldwell and Caldwell, 1996, for a
      map of the distribution of levels of circumcision in
      contemporary sub-Saharan Africa).</p>

      <p class="text">The written history of Jewish circumcision is
      both long and rich and well illustrates the ornate cultural
      context which surrounds the physical procedure itself.
      "Circumcision from the Jewish Perspective" in the
      <i>Encyclopaedia Judaica</i> (1972, p. 568-576) gives the
      following perspective on Jewish circumcision. Jewish
      circumcision originated, according to the biblical account,
      from a divine behest. From Genesis <b>17:</b>11-12 comes the
      prescription: "Every male among you shall be circumcised in
      the flesh of our foreskin, and it shall be the token of a
      covenant betwixt Me and you. And he that is eight days old
      shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your
      generations." The covenant involved a promise that Abraham's
      lineage would be multitudinous and that these multitudes
      would inherit the land of Canaan if Abraham and his
      descendants would practice circumcision. Abraham circumcised
      himself at the age of 99, his son Ishmael, all the males of
      his household and his slaves. In the following year Isaac was
      born, he, Isaac was circumcised on the eighth day.
      Circumcision was considered so important that the rabbis
      taught that were it not for the blood of the covenant
      (circumcision), heaven and earth would not exist. The ritual
      of circumcision was and is viewed as a sign of faith. Any
      perceived medical overlay of the practice was to have
      occurred only recently.</p>

      <p class="text">Complementing any religious-symbolic
      function, the behavioral question would remain: "What
      attributes of the human foreskin would be affected by being
      removed?"</p>

      <p class="sub">T<span class="sc1">HE</span> H<span

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: Most curiously, the authors
      overlooked the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/">work</a>
      of John Taylor et al., which was published 1.5 years prior to
      the appearance of this article. Taylor discovered the <a
      href="http://research.cirp.org/" target="_blank">ridged
      band</a> erogenous tissue area of the human male
      foreskin.]</p>

      <p class="text">Compared with chimpanzees and gorillas (and
      the orangutan), the human foreskin is unique in four
      respects:</p>

      <p class="text">(1) The human foreskin is hairless.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The human
      foreskin is attached at the front (fore-) of the penis rather
      than at the base (aft-) of the penis.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The human
      penis has a comparatively increased diameter.</p>

      <p class="text">In terms of diameter, there is a good deal of
      individual difference, but a reasonable average for men is
      approximately 1.5 inches in diameter for an erect penis (WHO,
      1991; Rushton and Bogaert, 1987). The average for man's
      nearest primate relative, the chimpanzee (<i>Pan
      troglodyte</i>), was 1.2 inches at the base with a slow
      tapering toward the tip (Dixon and Mundy, 1994). In fact,
      there appears to be minimal overlap between the diameter of
      the human flaccid penis and diameter of the erect chimpanzee
      penis. The minimal overlap of width is contrasted with a good
      deal of overlap in the length of the erect penis where in a
      sample of chimpanzees averaged 5.7 inches (sd = 0.8 inches)
      versus (6.2 inches for men. A sample of chimpanzees from
      Yerkes laboratory (Yerkes and Elder, 1936) averaged 6.9
      inches for the erect penis. This actually exceeds the average
      for men (at 6.2 inches). As measured by Izor et al. (1981)
      the length of the pars libera of a bonobo chimpanzee (<i>Pan
      paniscus</i>) was 1.7 inches. Diamond (1992) estimates the
      length of the gorilla's penis at 1.25 inches and that of the
      orangutan at 1.5 inches.</p>

      <p class="text">(4) The human foreskin, during sexual
      intromission, is completely within the vagina (whereas the
      pongid penile sheath is not).</p>

      <p class="text">These four differences must have occurred
      since the Pongid-Homo split and are germane to this inquiry.
      A fifth difference would include the lack of a baculum (a
      bone rod within the penis) in the human penis. This lack is
      noted, but is not seen as relevant to the present discussion
      (see Dixson (1987) for a compendium on primate penises; see
      Harcourt (1995) for a discussion of evolutionary pressures on
      male primate genitalia).</p>

      <p class="text">As <i>Australopithecus</i> evolved into
      <i>Homo</i>, a number of sexual/reproductive strategies
      (co)emerged, e.g., female orgasm, pair-bonding, hidden
      ovulation, continuous female receptivity, reduced sexual
      dimorphism. The determination of the direction in which each
      cause-and-effect relationship occurred is well beyond the
      scope of this inquiry. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable that,
      correlated with these traits, a broadened, hairless, fore-
      (rather than aft-)skin, which completely enters the vagina,
      emerged and stabilized within the genus <i>Homo</i>. To
      account for this complex of traits, the following,
      hypothesized, sequence is offered.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="indent">
      <p>(<i>a</i>) A hairless, compared with hirsute, penile
      sheath present less mechanical difficulty in entering the
      vaginal canal. The penile sheath, by definition, would be
      broader than the enclosed penis.</p>

      <p>(<i>b</i>) The relatively wider penile sheath would offer
      greater stimulation to the woman than the more slender
      filiform penis as exemplified by the chimpanzee. Women who
      enjoyed the greater stimulation would, thereby, more often
      select as mating partners the men who possessed those
      attributes (a hairless foreskin which entered the vagina). It
      should be noted that changes, i.e., elongation, in the
      chimpanzee penis could be attributed to the "sperm wars" such
      that a reproductive advantage is accrued to a male chimpanzee
      with the mechanical advantage of a longer penis (See Smith,
      1984, and Ridley, 1993 for examples and discussion). However,
      the advantages in the widened penis of men seem unlikely to
      lie in the realm of a superior mechanical sperm delivery
      system. Therefore, it is suggested that the increased
      diameter of the man's penis was selected by women, for the
      women (and as a derivative, for the men).</p>

      <p>(<i>c</i>) The selection would then occur for an
      elongation of the (wider) sheath with the prepuce migrating
      distally down the penile shaft. The distal migration
      continued until the prepuce reached the area of the glans
      penis. The prepuce would then be a foreskin (rather than an
      aft-skin). This distal migration would result in a hairless
      widened penis wherein the entire foreskin&mdash;which truly
      had become a <i>fore</i>skin&mdash;would completely enter the
      vagina during coitus.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text">The selection for a widened diameter of the
      penile shaft might have occurred without an initial "fusion"
      of the penis with the penile sheath. The preputial sac (the
      space between the prepuce and the shaft of the penis) could
      simply have become elongated.</p>

      <p class="text">However, over and beyond any mechanical
      difficulties in maintaining stability (especially without a
      baculum), a lengthened preputial sac would create a large,
      warm, moist space which becomes an excellent medium for
      micro-organisms, e.g., bacteria and subsequent diseases.
      Diseases most relevant to this argument would be sexually
      transmitted diseases (STD's). It is interesting to note that
      STD's have not been reported in feral great apes. Either
      STD's are not normative in the great apes or have simply not
      been sought, hence not found (see Phillips-Conroy et al.,
      1994) for a discussion of lack of STD data on feral primates.
      Current and arguably archaic, STD's present a number of
      reproductive problems, e.g., infertility on the part of males
      and (especially) females (Westrom and Mardh, 1990; Westrom et
      al., 1992; Hook and Handsfield, 1990) infant
      morbidity/mortality (Burnham et al., 1990; Schulz et al.,
      1990; Gutman and Wilfert, 1990), and ectopic pregnancy
      (maternal mortality) (Lurie, 1992).</p>

      <p class="text">Nocturnal erections, normative in human men
      during REM sleep would serve to expose the linings of the
      penis and foreskin to air/oxygen and act as a drying agent.
      Both events would make the medium of the elongated preputial
      sac less hospitable to micro-organisms, e. g., bacteria which
      cause gonorrhea. The exposure can kill the micro-organisms or
      curtail their rate of reproduction. Again the question of
      cause and effect would be moot. Whether this anti-pathogenic
      function would have generated nocturnal erections or simply
      reinforced the survival value of the already present trait is
      not germane. What is germane is that nocturnal erections
      would diminish the threat of infections stemming from a
      fairly new anatomical, if transitional, feature, an elongated
      preputial sac.</p>

      <p class="text">Thus, consequences of the reformatted penis
      would result in an increased stimulation of the woman and, in
      general, men are not loathe to increase the stimulation of
      women. Women would have enhanced satisfaction. Men would have
      enhanced satisfaction. So&mdash;in the face of such putative
      gender egalitarian joy&mdash;why would any cultural tradition
      emerge and stablize and be maintained which would mandate the
      systematic removal of the foreskin? In other words: What
      might the societal benefits of circumcision which would
      outweigh the costs to that individual or society? Framed more
      concisely: why lop off the foreskin? The next section
      develops an answer to the question.</p>

      OF</span> C<span class="sc1">IRCUMCISION</span></p>

      <p class="text"><i>Biological consequences of
      circumcision</i>.&mdash;<span class="yellow">The relevant and
      spare literature which deals with the (human) prepuce tends
      to refer (tacitly) to the human foreskin as a mere flap of
      skin. Anatomically, however, this description is not
      accurate. The intact human foreskin is richly innervated and
      contains holocrine glands (e.g., Tyson's glands) (see
      Sommerova, 1976; Halata and Munger, 1986; and Dail and Evan,
      1974 for reviews of the development of sensory nerve endings
      in the human penis). In terms of surface area, the human
      foreskin represents approximately 36 percent&mdash;more than
      a third&mdash;of the intact penis (Ritter, 1992). As a facet
      of the man's reproductive apparatus, the foreskin seems to be
      nontrivial.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Given that "pleasure," "feeling," and
      "sensation" are all localized within the brain, if
      circumcision were to affect the neural organization of the
      brain, <span class="yellow">then subsequent sexual reactions
      would also be affected.</span> Studies on the triangulation
      of the foreskin and the central nervous system and
      circumcision have yet to be conducted or, at least, are not
      easily findable. Nonetheless, inferential evidence is
      available.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Lesions and cortical
      reorganization</i>.&mdash;When Jackson and Diamond (1981)
      severed sensory nerves from a monkey's hand to its
      somato-cortex (the area in the brain where "touch" is
      received), there was no recovery of responsiveness to the
      denervated skin. This lack of responsiveness to touch from
      the "deadened" skin was apparently because those nerves which
      were still intact have a very limited capacity to sprout and
      to reclaim vacant territory. Florence et al. (1988) noted
      that nerve regeneration is often incomplete and disorderly
      and that the remaining area of the somato-cortex becomes
      reorganized. Large zones of such "silent" cortex persisted
      over time. Similar reorganizations of the cortex after
      amputation of a digit or after severing nerves has been
      reported for cats (Metler and Marks, 1979), raccoons (Welker
      and Seidenstein, 1959; Kelahen, et al., 1981), and rats (Wall
      and Cusick, 1984).</p>

      <p class="text">Some research has also been conducted with
      primates with similar results. For example, when nerves which
      innervated the hand of a macaque monkey were severed,
      cortical sensory areas which serve that hand did not recover
      responsiveness to cutaneous&mdash;"touch"&mdash; stimuli
      (Wall and Kaas, 1986; Huerta and Wall, 1987).</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">It appears that any
      sensory deprivation of a system can also lead to cortical
      changes.</span> For example, Kandel (1991), p 1024 noted in
      his work with ocular dominance:</p>

      <p class="quote">If one eye is closed during a critical
      period, the columns (of neurons) in the visual cortex)
      devoted to that eye shrink while those devoted to the open
      eye expand. This modifiability of the ocular dominance
      columns is restricted to a relatively short period just after
      birth...</p>

      <p class="text">See Jessell (1991) for an overview of
      neuronal reactions to injury. It is also useful to note that
      the "phantom" limb phenomenon (Melzack, 1992) has not been
      reported/found in regards to the circumcised foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text">In a review of the literature on the
      plasticity of sensory maps, Kaas (1991) offered the following
      synopsis:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="indent">
      <p>(<i>a</i>) Reorganization of sensory maps in the brain
      follows changes in neural activity patterns caused by the
      relative inactivation of (feed forward) pathways produced by
      lesions or by the (<i>i</i>) sensory surfaces, (<i>ii</i>)
      peripheral nerves, or (<i>iii</i>) more central
      structures.</p>

      <p>(<i>b</i>) Sensory maps in the brain, both early and late
      in processing hierarchies, are mutable, but such changes are
      more dramatic in higher stations. The increased level of
      change in these higher areas, closer to the cortex, may be
      because of the accumulation of serial changes and/or the
      greater potential plasticity.</p>

      <p>(<i>c</i>) Sensory maps in the somato-sensory, visual, and
      auditory systems in the brain are all capable of change.</p>

      <p>(<i>d</i>) Sensory maps within the brain have been shown
      to change in a wide range of mammalian species. The clear
      implication is that adult plasticity is a feature of all
      mammalian brains. And as a large reservoir of data
      demonstrates, the younger the individual is, the greater is
      the plasticity in the development of nervous system (see
      Kandel et al., 1991 for examples).</p>

      <p>(<i>e</i>) There is presently little evidence related to
      the <i>behavioral</i> consequences of the reorganization of
      "maps" in the brain. Nevertheless, partial recoveries of lost
      abilities which follow central damage include the
      possibilities of alterations and improvements in sensory
      skills.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text"><i>Synopsis</i>.&mdash;Framed a little
      differently within the context of circumcision, the removal
      of the foreskin would be expected to reorganized the brain's
      somato-cortex of the affected individual. Because sexual
      stimuli normally travel first to the cerebral cortex and then
      to sub-cortical areas, e.g., septum (Bennett, 1982), any
      reorganization of the cerebral cortex would be expected to
      affect the overall sexual behavior of that individual (cf.
      Masters and Johnson, 1966). <span class="yellow">The earlier
      in the male's life that the circumcision would occur, the
      more impact that the ablation would have upon his nervous
      system, and hence his behavioral tendencies.</span></p>

      <p class="text">It is argued here that a removal of the
      foreskin from an individual has consequences to that person's
      brain. The removal of the foreskin&mdash;part of the male's
      reproductive apparatus&mdash;is hypothesized to affect sexual
      excitability. The most intuitive direction of any change
      would be to lower excitability or to raise the threshold for
      sexual arousal.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Circumcision and skin texture</i>.&mdash;A
      derivative of circumcision is that keratinization or
      desensitization of the surface epithelium of the glans penis
      occurs. In other words, if the moistening protective covering
      of the glans penis is removed, then the skin on the surface
      of the glans penis would try out and become
      toughened/cornuate/"calloused." Again, the end result is
      desensitization of the man's reproductive tissues.
      Excitability would be lowered, and the threshold for sexual
      arousal would be raised.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Circumcision and pheromones</i>.&mdash;In
      addition, the human foreskin, as well as the penis proper,
      contains Tyson's glands (a type of holocrine gland) which
      secrete smegma. Smegma is a substance which is volatile and
      may act as a pheromone. During a man's sleep, such a
      pheromone would be systematically released vial nocturnal
      erections. Nocturnal erections occur systematically in the
      sleep cycle and are usually associated with REM sleep
      (Arnoff, 1991) (see Hobson et al., 1978, for a discussion of
      the ethology of the sleep cycle; see Rogel, 1978, and
      Stoddart, 1991, for a discussion of human pheromones). This
      nocturnal release of the odoriferous segments of smegma, if
      nothing else, would give an olfactory signal that a man was
      current resident resident in the sleeping quarters. A diurnal
      release in the presence of a nubile female may also prove
      distracting to the woman who, in turn, may reciprocate with
      distracting signals of her own. Circumcision removes the
      foreskin which, in turn, removes those Tyson's glands. The
      removal of the Tyson's glands precludes smegma being secreted
      from them. This preclusion would remarkedly reduce any
      pheromonic signals from occurring and thereby would act to
      lower excitability quotients within the male hierarchy and
      between the genders.</p>

      <p class="text">That is, to the extent that the olfactory
      signals are minimized, social friction or jostling for
      dominance among men may be similarly reduced. Framed
      differently, if sleeping quarters are constricted by space
      and weather, e.g., a small domicile in winter, then male
      pheromones which essentially signal other males to stay away
      can create irritation and social friction when other males
      are prevented from staying away. A removal of the pheromones
      would remove the signal and, hence, would remove any hostile
      reactions to the signal. Overall social friction within the
      group would be reduced. In addition, young men are easily
      distracted by and excited by young women. Any reduction of
      sexual signaling between the two genders would auger for
      enhanced group pacifity.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Circumcision and tribal
      competitiveness</i>.&mdash;If the above has a kernel of
      truth, then the following scenario seems reasonable. Young
      men in every tribe represent a source of potential turmoil
      and disruption within the social fabric. Any vector which
      would reduce&mdash;not eliminate, just reduce&mdash;the
      incorrigibility of young men would give that group a
      competitive edge. In other words, a marginal increase in the
      tractability of young men gives that society a competive
      advantage in group cooperation when compared to a society
      which has more easily distracted young men (see Young, 1962,
      for a complementary argument from a Freudian perspective).
      Said more explicitly, circumcision is a (low grade)
      neurologically mediated analogue to castration. Circumcision
      lowers sexual excitability/distractability without lessening
      sexual potency or levels of aggression. Potency is needed for
      the next generation. Aggression is needed for successful
      defence of the group against the forays of young men from
      alternate groups. The earlier in the male's life that
      circumcision would occur, the more effective would be the
      results. It is also the case that infant boys would generate
      less effective protestations against the procedure. To the
      extent that humans <i>are</i> affected by pheromones, the
      impact of pheromones, e.g. smegma, emanating from the prepuce
      would be similarly reduced.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Circumcision and sexually transmitted
      diseases</i>.&mdash;The debate on the current relationship
      between the status of the foreskin and sexually transmitted
      diseases is somewhat relevant. The bulk of the evidence seems
      to find little net gain in preventing disease by being
      circumcised or not being circumcised (<a
      href="/library/general/wallerstein/">Wallerstein, 1985</a>;
      Bigelow, 1991; Cook et al., 1994; Persky, 1977; Sprach et
      al., 1992; cf. Caldwell and Caldwell, 1996). Accordingly, the
      rationale for circumcision which is based on medical reasons
      <i>for the man</i> may more reflect a folklore which, in
      turn, relies on the "medical model" to justify a needed and
      mandated behavior rather than the reverse: therapeutic
      medical procedures which, because of their effectiveness, are
      inserted into the folk wisdom of a community.</p>

      <p class="text">If, however, the current consequences of an
      infection, rather than the infection itself, are reviewed,
      then a somewhat different picture emerges. Some infections,
      such as herpes, are independent of a man's circumcision
      status. Other infections, such as genital warts, seem to
      increase in incidence <i>with</i> circumcision. Additional
      infections, such as AIDS, syphilis, and gonorrhea are
      decreased with circumcision (Cook et al., 1994; Caldwell and
      Caldwell, 1996). These STDS are not only deleterious to the
      infected man, they also&mdash;when transmitted to the
      woman&mdash;create a relatively rapid and adverse impact on
      the woman's fertility, e.g. infant morbitity/mortality
      (Holmes et al., 1990; Schultz et al., 1990), infertility
      through occluded fallopian tubes (Moore and Cates, 1990;
      Westrom et al., 1992), and maternal deaths through ectopic
      pregnancies (see Lurie, 1992, for an excellent discussion on
      the lethality of ectopic pregnancies prior to twentieth
      century medical advances). Whereas a number of infected men
      may create an inconvenience in a society or tribe, a number
      of infected women represent a clear threat to the sheer
      continuity of that society or tribe over many generations.
      Accordingly, the dynamics, if any, among the (<i>i</i>)
      health of men, (<i>ii</i>) the fertility of women, and
      (<i>iii</i>) circumcision may be quite complex. Nonetheless,
      to the extent that circumcision&mdash;by reducing the
      incidence of STD's&mdash;would have reduced infertility as
      well as infant mortality/morbidity, then the greater chance
      that circumcision would have emerged and stabilized as a
      tradition within the germane group or tribe.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Circumcision and folklore</i>.&mdash;The
      preceeding analysis, which is fairly complex, would be
      possible to insert into the oral folklore of any tribe or
      group. Indeed, the Rabbi Moses Maimonides (cited in Ritter,
      1992) did make such an argument in the thirteenth century
      vis-&agrave;-vis the Jewish version of circumcision:</p>

      <p class="quote">The bodily injury caused to that organ is
      exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any
      vital function, nor does it destroy the power of generation.
      Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is
      no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual
      excitement&hellip;</p>

      <p class="text">However, such an analysis is somewhat
      cumbersome to explain under any circumstances. For a growing
      pre-pubescent child to inculcate the verities of this
      explanation stretches the imagination of the even the most
      inventive. A much more pragmatic approach to transmit the
      message across generations, from adults to children, would be
      to embed "circumcision" within the rubric of the holy, the
      supernatural, and the wishes/demands of ancestors.</p>

      <p class="text">In other words, the explanation or rationale
      in the young child's experience is that circumcision must
      occur, because it must occur, because it must occur. The
      eventuation of the phenomenon would be cultural given with no
      further explanation given nor solicited. Such imagery of an
      uncontested worldview is then supplemented with elaborate
      ritual, with group consensus, and with the juggernaut of
      inertia. All these facets within the young child's culture
      would be mutually supportive and logically consistent with
      each other. For example, as children become socialized in
      Western Europe and its extensions, they learn that "B"
      follows "A" because it does, and "7" follows "6" because it
      does. No further explanation is asked or given. It is!</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Lack of the universality of
      circumcision</i>.&mdash;With the assumption that the above
      discourse has some validity, the question would then become:
      Why have not all cultures embraced and employed
      circumcision?</p>

      <p class="text">The answer can take several forms. Alternate
      cultural forms of the containment of men's ardor are
      certainly available (e.g., warrior castes). Some groups may
      have young men whose youthful enthusiasm may be below a
      threshold which would require a drastic physical
      intervention, e.g., the Japanese and the Eskimos seem to be
      such groups. Freedman, 1974, 1979; LeVine; 1975: Orlick et
      al., 1990; Vernon, 1982). Indeed circumcision is not a
      feature native to northern climates. Unraveling such a
      putative relationship between climate/ecology and level of
      circumcision becomes an interesting question.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: CIRP believes that the authors
      exhibit a fundamental lack of understanding of human
      sexuality. It is more likely that the removal of the
      erogenous tissue of the foreskin does nothing to lessen
      sexual excitability, but does lessen the ability of the
      circumcised male to achieve sexual satisfaction and
      gratification for himself and his mate, and may consequently,
      tend to maintain the individual in a sustained heightened
      state of sexual excitement, with a heightened aggressive
      tendency. The effect of circumcision would, therefore, be
      more likely to be the opposite to that hypothesized by these
      authors.]</p>

      <p class="sub">S<span class="sc1">UMMARY</span></p>

      <p class="text">"Circumcision" is suggested to reduce young
      male's sexual excitability and distractibility. The
      advantages to the commonweal of more tractable, less
      disruptive young men seem intuitively real. Group endeavors
      involving the strength and large numbers of young men would
      be more easily initiated, organized, and executed.
      Disruptions of a sexual nature are (slightly) reduced. Given
      (1) the facile manner in which humans can create and grasp
      metaphor and (2) the importance of early learning in
      childhood upon subsequent behavior, the nesting for the
      physical act of foreskin removal within a realistic imagery
      seems pragmatic and efficacious.</p>
