    <p>Circumcision is a euphemism for genital reduction surgery or
    genital mutilation, performed by medically-licensed or
    unqualified practitioners for various reasons. It is important
    to define it honestly, for that is how the mind interprets it,
    with or without superimposed denials, explanations and
    intellectualisations.<br />
    <br />
    Many circumcisions are performed on children, who, by
    definition are not able to give informed consent of the kind
    available to adults. They are vulnerable to coercion and
    manipulation and generally have little say in what happens to
    their bodies medically &amp; surgically. They are not usually
    allowed to say <i>no</i> to medical procedures because it is
    deemed that parents &amp; doctors "know best". However, it is
    unlikely that any child, asked if they would like a person with
    a knife to cut off part of their penis, would agree to such an
    action. This would be a normal psychological reaction to the
    threat of attack and is overruled at some psychological
    cost.<br />
    <br />
    When one's own natural tendency to protect oneself is rendered
    ineffective, one loses a sense of one's own power over one's
    destiny &amp; survival, and a feeling of helplessness ensues.
    This occurs in situations of rape, torture and sexual abuse. In
    a situation where a person feels he or she cannot escape
    physical attack, the mind will "escape" by a process of
    "dissociation" - it is as if the mind leaves the body
    temporarily, so that the body can endure the attack, but the
    mind does not have to. On returning to the body, the mind may
    then be subject to unconscious repetitions of the traumatic
    memories in flashbacks or nightmares. These recurring images
    may be triggered by any situation which reminds the sufferer of
    the original traumatic event; a child who has been subjected to
    a painful surgical procedure in hospital may develop a phobia
    of hospitals or doctors or people in white coats. The child, or
    later the adult he grows into, may sweat, have palpitations,
    feel breathless, nauseated, panicky or dizzy at the thought of
    the trauma situation and try to avoid it happening again. This
    may lead to difficulty when medical attention is genuinely
    needed for a subsequent illness.<br />
    <br />
    One man, who had been subjected to circumcision at the age of
    three years old, vividly recalled at the age of thirty, how he
    had been undressed and his penis manipulated by a man in a mask
    pre-operatively, without his consent. The child had experienced
    an erection about which he was embarrassed, and then,
    post-operatively found himself with a bleeding, painful penis
    from which the foreskin had been amputated without his
    permission. This event had changed his life. He was angry that
    this had been done to him and humiliated by his powerlessness
    to protect himself from what felt like sexual manipulation. He
    felt that he had been sexually abused. In any other context
    than the medical one, the same sequence of events would be open
    to an interpretation of sexual abuse. To the child, the
    psychological impact is the same, whether it is illegal rape or
    legalised medical activity.<br />
    <br />
    Another man, who was circumcised at the age of seven, asked
    what was going to happen to him in hospital. He was told that
    it was "nothing" and he didn't need to worry his head about it.
    After the operation he was devastated to find that part of his
    penis was missing and that his trust in his parents' words had
    been misplaced. It was as if his experience of losing part of
    his body was not worth a mention or an explanation.<br />
    <br />
    The process of psychological dissociation from trauma, and the
    subsequent re-experiencing of frightening images, plus
    avoidance of situations which symbolise the trauma, is called
    Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD for short. It is a
    collection of symptoms recognised in some soldiers after combat
    and in victims of extreme terror. It has been shown to occur
    in<br />
    women after gynaecological procedures and after circumcision in
    children of both sexes.<br />
    <br />
    Some of the factors which contribute to the experience being
    traumatic are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the feelings of powerlessness or loss of control over
      one's own body;</li>

      <li>the lack of information given; the perceived lack of
      sympathy of the examiner;</li>

      <li>the experience of physical pain, and the lack of consent
      to the operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A child subjected to amputation of part of his body,
    whatever the reason given, is likely to experience all of these
    factors. In addition, if the child perceives that the parents
    have failed to protect him from surgical "attack", whatever
    their reasons, there is a loss of trust in the carers, and,
    perhaps, in all authority. This difficulty in trusting others
    can lead to avoidance of relationships, sometimes lifelong, and
    conflict with authority. Shame of the damaged penis and
    embarrassment about being mutilated can lead to avoidance of
    sexual relationships, again, sometimes lifelong.<br />
    <br />
    The child may grow up in ignorance of his circumcision,
    particularly if it has been done shortly after birth and if his
    peers are also circumcised. However, when it is discovered that
    part of his genitalia has been removed without his permission,
    often for no good reason, there is a loss reaction amounting to
    grief. The loss may be minimised and trivialised so as not to
    expose the mind to too much psychic pain; the pain of loss is
    profound. There may be a denial of its significance and, in
    order to maintain the image of the parent as "good", it may be
    idealised as a "good thing" which parents should do to their
    children if they care about them. Hence, the transgenerational
    passage of circumcision practice from father to son. For the
    cycle of mutilation to be broken, at least one generation would
    need to face the true nature of the activity and acknowledge
    the harm and the pain caused. This is a courageous act, since
    it brings into play feelings of betrayal and abandonment by
    one's own parents; that instead of protecting one's body from
    harm, they have given their child into the hands of a stranger
    to remove part of his body.<br />
    <br />
    The intellectualisation of a harmful act is a way of turning
    "bad" into "good" - the thought process may run thus: "my
    parents cut off part of my body and despite the fact that I
    didn't like it, my parents are good - so cutting off part of my
    body was good - therefore, to be a good parent myself, I must
    do the same to my son...". And so the cycle of abuse continues.
    Similarly within the medical profession- "I was
    circumcised/have done circumcisions - I was not harmed/have not
    harmed my patients - therefore to circumcise is trivial,
    harmless and necessary..." If the doctor is in a process of
    trying to deny that he has been harmed by his own circumcision,
    he may be psychologically compelled to repeat the act on his
    patients to "prove" that circumcision is "harmless". In
    addition, when a circumcision victim becomes a circumciser, he
    is no longer powerless to attack - he is now the powerful
    attacker, thus redressing some of the balance in relation to
    his own fear of repetition of his own trauma.<br />
    <br />
    We all try to repeat traumatic situations in order to resolve
    the original anxiety: battered women marry violent husbands;
    the children of alcoholics may marry drinkers; and foreskin
    amputees sometimes become compulsive circumcisers. Freud called
    it, "the compulsion to repeat"; Alice Miller described how
    people who are dissociated from, and deny the significance of,
    the original cause of their own pain, will often find
    expression in destructive acts against others.<br />
    <br />
    In order to heal losses of any kind and to avoid perpetuating
    harm on the next generation, it is therefore psychologically
    necessary to acknowledge the harm done by circumcision and to
    grieve its effect. This involves a painful and protracted
    process, including initial denial, followed by anger &amp;
    blame, then anxiety &amp; searching, sadness &amp; depression,
    and, ultimately, acceptance and reinvestment of energy into the
    future.<br />
    <br />
    Most important of all, is to enter the child's world and see
    circumcision for what it is from the child's perspective. It is
    a forced robbery of a treasured part of his body and nobody
    except he, as an adult, can legitimately give permission for
    its removal.<br />
