            <p class="text1"><b><i>Objective</i>:</b> The objective
            of our study was to assess the efficacy of topical
            steroids in the treatment of phimosis and evaluate
            patients using the Diagnostic and Statistical
            Manual-III-Revised (DSM-III- R) test with the aim of
            eliminating castration anxiety of circumcision in the
            phallic period.<br />
             <b><i>Methods</i>:</b> One hundred and forty-nine
            children with phimosis who required circumcision were
            included the study. The average age of the children was
            4.47 years. All children underwent the DSM-III-R test
            and their parents were questioned. Patients were
            separated randomly into three groups. Group I comprised
            51 children who would undergo circumcision; group II
            comprised 50 children who would be treated with a
            topical corticosteroid (0.05% bethamethasone cream)
            twice daily for 1 month; and group III comprised 48
            children who would be treated with a topical placebo
            cream. On the 5th day of treatment, parents were told
            to retract the prepuce and were given hygiene routine
            instructions. Patients were seen immediately after
            treatment and again 2 months later.<br />
             <b><i>Results</i>:</b> In group II, 16 of the 50
            children had non-retractable prepuce. Forty-two cases
            of phimosis were corrected after treatment. Eight
            patients received further monthly treatment and five
            benefited from the second course of treatment. In group
            III, 17 of the 48 patients had non-retractable prepuce
            and four had satisfactory results. Forty-four patients
            received placebo treatment for another month and
            eventually, 40 children underwent circumcision in this
            group. <span class="yellow">DSM-III-R test results

             <b><i>Conclusion</i>:</b> Topical steroids for the
            treatment of phimosis is a highly effective treatment
            alternative to surgery. It avoids or delays
            circumcision and can be practised during the phallic
            period to decrease castration anxiety. The treatment is
            suitable for patients from any religious or cultural

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision is the most frequently
      practiced surgery in Turkey for religious and traditional
      purposes. Most of the operations are performed in neonates
      and primary school children. <span class="yellow">It has been
      pointed out that between the ages of 3 and 6 years &ndash;
      the &lsquo;phallic period&rsquo; of childhood development
      &ndash; circumcision may affect the psychological status of
      the child and eventually cause psychological and behavioral
      disturbances.</span> Awareness of the phallic structure and
      gender identity develops during the phallic period. The male
      child&rsquo;s perspective on genitalia diverts to the female
      sex during this period and differences in sex are noted by
      the child. Therefore, circumcision may sometimes be imagined
      as the total loss of genitalia.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      Castration anxiety, despite its controversial nature, may
      develop during the phallic period; therefore, elective
      circumcision is generally avoided during this period.</p>

      <p class="text2">Cansever assessed 12 boys before and after
      they were circumcised and reported severe functional
      disturbances after circumcision as measured by psychological
      testing.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Kennedy reported the
      case of an adolescent boy who was traumatized by
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Yorke reported
      the need for additional studies of psychological trauma. He
      cited the trauma of circumcision as an example.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Phimosis is defined as the narrowing of the
      opening of foreskin, which makes it difficult to retract the
      foreskin to the coronal sulcus. During the neonatal period
      and up to 3 years of age, physiologic phimosis is common and
      the prepuce cannot be retracted. At around 3 years of age,
      90% of foreskins become retractable.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Pathologic phimosis occurs after 3
      years of age. When inflammatory processes and voiding
      difficulties are predominant, phimosis is the reason for
      performing circumcision before the planned time.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: The authors of this study used
      outmoded diagnostic criteria to determine the existence of
      phimosis in very young boys. It is probable that most of
      these boys would have achieved retractable foreskins without
      treatment in the course of time. For more information on the
      normal development of the foreskin see <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal</a>.]</p>

      <p class="text2">Topical steroids have proved to be effective
      in most phimotic patients.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6&ndash;13</a></sup> Excluding infectious
      processes, steroids can be used safely and easily for the
      treatment of phimosis. Our study was based on the idea that
      circumcision in patients with phimosis between the ages of 3
      and 6 years can be delayed with the use of topical steroids
      to avoid castration anxiety phenomenon. We also evaluated
      children using the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) test to assess their
      psychological status before circumcision.</p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p class="text1">Between December 1999 and June 2002, 149
      children with phimosis between the ages 3 and 6 years were
      included in the study group. Children were randomly separated
      into three groups. Group I comprised 51 children who would
      undergo circumcision, group II comprised 50 children who
      would be treated with a topical corticosteroid (bethametasone
      0.05% cream, twice daily for 1 month), and group III
      comprised 48 children who would receive a topical placebo
      neutral cream (Vaseline, twice daily for 1 month). After 5
      days of treatment, prepuces were retracted by parents each
      day throughout the treatment. Hygiene instructions were given
      to parents and children.</p>

      <p class="text2">All patients were assessed for the type of
      phimosis and classified as either: (i) retractable when a
      tight and constricting phimotic ring existed, but did not
      completely prevent the retraction of the foreskin; (ii)
      non-retractable when the ring prevented retraction of the
      foreskin, and the external urethral meatus was exposed; or
      (iii) pinpoint when the foreskin was so constricted that the
      meatus could not be visualized.</p>

      <p class="text2">Control examinations were held immediately
      after treatment and again after 1 and 2 months. The outcome
      was defined as: (i) a success if the prepuce was retractable
      and was without a ring; or (ii) a failure if a constrictive
      ring persisted.</p>

      <p class="text2">The parents provided informed consent for
      entering their children into the study. Children and parents
      were evaluated and given information about the treatment by a
      urologist and a child and adolescent psychiatrist 1 month
      before treatment. Parents were told to observe the child for
      1 month and their observations were recorded at the end of
      this period. DSM-III-R assessment was performed twice for
      each patient: the first time 1 month before the main
      treatment, before treatment information was given to the
      child and his parents; and the second time just before
      treatment, after treatment information had been provided. The
      aim of the observation and DSM-III-R evaluation was to assess
      the possibility of castration anxiety, particularly in the
      circumcision group compared to the other two groups.
      Circumcision was performed accordingly in 51 children by the
      guillotine technique under ketamine anesthesia. There were no
      postoperative complications in any of the cases.</p>

      <p class="text2">Statistical analysis was performed using the
      Pearson &chi;<sup>2</sup> test.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>
      <img src="yilmaz1-table1-2.gif" align="right" hspace="10"
      vspace="10" width="322" height="347"
      alt="Tables one and two" /> 

      <p class="text1">All patients were re-evaluated after 1 month
      and again after 2 months in the steroid and placebo groups.
      Of the 51 patients in groups I, 22 had a retractable prepuce,
      16 had non-retractable prepuce and 13 had pinpoint opening
      prepuce. Types of phimosis and success rates in groups II and
      III are shown in Tables 1 and 2.</p>

      <p class="text2">Castration anxiety was assessed by
      questioning the parents and evaluating the child by
      DSM-III-R. In the circumcision group, during the 1 month
      period before circumcision, 44 children displayed some degree
      of isolation, aggression towards the family members,
      disruption in relations with friends and fear of being alone.
      However, in the topical corticosteroid and placebo groups
      these type of disorders were detected in only three and two
      of the children, respectively. The results of the DSM-III-R
      test, which was performed 1 month before and just before the
      therapy are shown in Table 3. The difference in anxiety rates
      between 1 month before and just before treatment in group I
      were statistically significant for any kind of anxiety
      disorder (P = 0.000).</p>

      <p class="text2">In group II, 42 (84%) of 50 children
      benefited from topical corticosteroid application after 1
      month and five additional cases of phimosis were resolved
      after subsequent monthly topical corticosteroid therapy,
      yielding a final success rate of 94%. Three patients required
      circumcision because they did not respond to the
      treatment.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">In group III, four patients (8.33%) showed
      remarkable improvement and the remaining 44 patients
      underwent another monthly course of topical placebo which
      rendered four more cases of satisfactory preputial
      retraction. The remaining 40 patients underwent circumcision.
      Eventually, 50 patients had topical corticosteroids and in 47
      (94%) of them the need for surgery was eliminated. Patient
      age groups and success rates are shown in Tables 4 and 5.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision, a ritual as old as written
      history, has been applied extensively in many countries,
      predominantly for religious and traditional reasons. However,
      in cases of phimosis, paraphimosis and various infective
      disorders of the prepuce, circumcision is applied as a
      medical procedure. Regardless of the reason for circumcision,
      it is commonly accepted that the most appropriate periods in
      which to perform the surgery are the newborn and primary
      school periods. <span class="yellow">Surgical operations and
      circumcision on genitalia throughout the phallic period are
      not recommended and should be performed only if they are
      unavoidable.</span><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> In some
      communities, where almost every male has undergone
      circumcision and the timing of the operation has not been a
      concern, the hazardous effects of circumcision, particularly
      during the phallic period, should be considered. During child
      development, despite the controversy that surrounds the
      theory, the Oedipus phenomenon is defined as one of the most
      important periods of life. Many psychiatric methods study
      childhood developmental stages to detect various
      psychological and behavioral disorders. Moreover, in
      Freud&rsquo;s theory about psychosexual development,
      differences in particular stages cause differences in adult
      sexual behavior. In addition, many psychological disturbances
      are linked to the developmental stage. At around the age of 3
      years, the child enters the phallic stage, which is
      characterized by genital pleasure and the primary task of
      finding a love object that will later establish the
      child&rsquo;s object choice.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Freud named the psychodevelopmental stage
      between the ages of 3 and 5 years as the Oedipal stage and
      gave special importance to the pathogenesis of neuroses,
      anxiety disorders, hysterical personality and
      obsessive-compulsive personality during this period.
      Resolution of this stage in males begins at around 6 years of
      age. A boy during this stage fears that the father will
      remove the boy&rsquo;s penis because of the envy that exists
      between them. Therefore, this stage referred to as the stage
      of genital fears.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a>,<a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> We think that circumcision at the
      Oedipus complex stage may affect or disturb childhood
      psychosexual development and eventually is the basis for
      future disorders. In the late 19th and early 20th century,
      Freud identified castration anxiety as the result of fear of
      operations on the genitals.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      As early as 1929, Glover reported a case of impotence
      secondary to castration anxiety caused by a particularly
      brutal circumcision.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Richards
      <i>et al.</i> observed behavior differences in boys in the
      USA that were not found in boys in Europe. The USA male
      children were circumcised while the European children were
      not circumcised; therefore it was suggested that the changes
      were due to circumcision.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The 1987 DSM-III-R describes conditions for
      the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder. These
      were deemed to be exactly the same as those experienced by a
      helpless infant undergoing circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> <span class="yellow">DSM-III-R
      results in our study showed that the rate of anxiety
      disorders such as multiple anxieties, overanxious disorder,
      simple and social phobias and separation anxiety were
      remarkably higher in the circumcision group.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">McFadyen reported the psychological trauma
      experienced by her son following circumcision.
      McFadyen&rsquo;s description of her son&rsquo;s trauma is
      consistent with early reports from Freud and Cansever.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a>,<a href="#n18">18</a></sup> Maguire and
      Parkes reported on the need to grieve the loss of body parts.
      Failure to grieve the loss leaves the individual in a state
      of denial of loss and disconnected from the reality of loss
      and injury.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Even though these
      authors did not establish the link between circumcision
      during the phallic term and psychological disturbances, it
      can be inferred that circumcision during the phallic term may
      have psychological effects.</p>

      <p class="text2">Topical steroids are well established agents
      for the treatment of phimosis and are a good alternative to
      surgery.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> The success rate of
      topical therapy ranges from 67 to 95% with no reported
      side-effects.<sup><a href="#n6">6&ndash;9,11</a></sup> In our
      study, the efficacy of topical steroids in phimosis after one
      or two courses of monthly treatment was 94% and only three of
      50 patients required surgical circumcision. Golubovic <i>et
      al.</i> reported that 95% of phimosis disappeared after
      topical application of bethamethasone.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> This rate was 80% in a larger study of
      111 patients.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Another topical
      steroid, clobetasol propionate, yielded success rates between
      67 and 70% in different studies.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a>,<a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Non-steroidal ointment has also
      proved to be effective in the treatment of phimosis, yielding
      a 75% response rate.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> The 94%
      overall treatment success in our study seems to be higher
      compared to other studies. However, daily retraction and
      strict hygiene procedures with clean saline solution and
      appropriate information given to the patient&rsquo;s family
      describing the importance and conditions of daily prepuce
      care could have contributed to our high success rate.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <p class="text1">The application of topical steroids is an
      easy, effective and low-cost treatment for phimosis. <span
      class="yellow">Circumcision is a traumatic experience and
      anxiety scores in a child tested by DSM-III-R increase
      preoperatively and perioperatively.</span> In populations
      where circumcision is a cultural necessity, medical therapy
      for phimosis with topical steroids can be justified,
      particularly during the phallic period.</p>
