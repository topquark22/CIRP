         Psychic Trauma</h2>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">A symposium on trauma organized by the
      Association for Child Psychoanalysis and held in London in
      1984, bore witness to the continuing interest in the subject.
      Prepared papers by Jules Glenn (1984) and by Edgecumbe and
      Gavshon (1985) stimulated lively debate; but it was clear
      from the very active discussions that a number of issues
      remained unresolved. Twenty years earlier a symposium on the
      same subject led to an extensive collection of papers edited
      by Sidney Furst (1967) and did a great deal to map out the
      ground and clarify some important points. The contributions
      to this symposium led Anna Freud (1967) to point out that a
      number of technical terms in psychoanalysis had, in the
      course of time, suffered a widening use which had blurred
      meaning to a point at which valuable concepts were lost. She
      continued:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          We are in the position of witnessing this typical process
          with regard to the definition of trauma which extends at
          present from the original notion of the break through the
          stimulus barrier at one extreme to the notions of the
          accumulative, the strain, the retrospective, the screen
          trauma, until it becomes difficult at the other extreme
          to differentiate between adverse pathogenic influences in
          general and trauma in particular [p. 235f.].
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">She added that, like everyone else, she too
      had tended to use the term <i>trauma</i> rather loosely until
      then, but that she would find it easier to avoid this in the
      future.</p>

      <p class="text2">Careful consideration of these papers,
      including Anna Freud's own contributions, together with
      subsequent writings on the subject, suggest that this is more
      easily said than done. There is a repeated difficulty in
      restricting the definition of trauma to a serviceable
      theoretical concept that meets clinical needs and experience.
      This paper makes no such attempt, but argues that, if full
      benefit is to be derived from the many important
      contributions made to the subject, it is necessary to draw
      clear distinctions between three different conditions. Two of
      these were repeatedly discussed by Freud, namely,
      <i>traumatic neurosis</i> and <i>traumatic (automatic)
      anxiety</i>. The third, which may be called the
      <i>post-traumatic neuroticlike state</i>, requires separate
      discussion and illustration.</p>

      <p class="text2">Freud's view of the nature of the
      <i>traumatic neurosis</i> was particularly clearly set out in
      <i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</i> (1920) in the course of
      discussion of the significance of the compulsion to repeat.
      The disturbance arises when the ego is totally unprepared for
      a "traumatizing" event of <i>an external kind</i>. A
      contemporary example would be that of a car crash coming
      totally out of the blue, of which the driver had no
      anticipation and no opportunity for psychic preparation.
      Freud's view was that, in such conditions, the stimulus
      barrier broke down and the ego was overwhelmed with a degree
      of anxiety that it was totally unable to master at the time.
      The ego was "knocked out" and was temporarily unable to
      function. This period of loss of functioning follows
      immediately on impact and continues for a short and slightly
      variable period. In the current example an observer would see
      the victim as dazed, and would no doubt refer to him as
      suffering from "shock." The inference that ego functioning is
      lost is supported by the fact that the subject retains a
      clear recollection of the circumstances of the crash, but has
      no memory for the period immediately following the
      collision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The subsequent clinical picture is well
      known. It is characterized by restlessness and variable but
      diffuse anxiety. A striking feature is the recurring dream in
      which the circumstances of the crash are vividly relived.
      These frightening dreams were, in Freud's view, not really
      "dreams" at all in the sense in which these are understood
      psychoanalytically. They are a vivid reexperience of the
      disturbing event during sleep, in the course of which the
      excess excitation, bounded by the ego in its attempted
      restoration of functioning, is fractionally and repeatedly
      discharged. The traumatic event may be relived in the form of
      daydreams or preoccupations during the day.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the present context, two clinical points
      must be made about this condition. The first is that even the
      fully blown picture tends to resolve itself, without
      treatment, is somewhere around 8 months, although there are
      exceptions. Even a minor degree of anticipation may allow
      sufficient preparation for the "shock" to be less pronounced
      and for recovery to take place within a comparatively short
      time. The factors which occasionally lead to an extremely
      protracted result are not always easy to understand. The
      second and related point is that, if the victim can be
      invited by the therapist to recollect the trauma over and
      over again, with appropriate affective discharge, the period
      during which the condition persists can be effectively
      reduced. In World War II, psychiatrists dealing with
      traumatic neuroses (as opposed to battle exhaustion) arising
      in the front line found that chemical abreactions using ether
      or pentothal restored the victim to normal functioning within
      something like three weeks. We now know that the abreaction
      can be carried out without chemical assistance. The traumatic
      neurosis can therefore be conceptualized in terms of Brueur
      and Freud's notion of "strangulated affect" (1895) and,
      indeed this was explicitly foreshadowed by Freud (1893) and
      was considered in relation to the abreactive process.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="text2">The second condition with which we are
      concerned is <i>traumatic (automatic) anxiety</i>. It is well
      known that Freud reformulated the theory of anxiety in 1926.
      Anxiety was no longer initiated by repression; repression was
      initiated by anxiety. Anxiety functioned as a danger signal
      seated in the ego that warned of an impending situation of
      danger. The danger itself was such that, if the ego were
      unable to mobilize its defenses, it would be overwhelmed and
      rendered helpless by automatic anxiety in the face of a
      "traumatic anxiety- situation" (p. 148). The prototype of
      these danger situations was considered by Freud to be trauma
      of birth. Although studies by Spitz (1947) cast considerable
      doubt on whether birth per se is trauma at all and emphasized
      the role of the nurse, midwife, or doctor in initiating the
      child's "negatively tinged excitation" (1965, p. 38.), Freud
      had been quite clear that these responses were essentially
      vegetative and preceded the child's capacity to experience
      psychic anxiety. With the acquisition of this capacity, the
      child is subject to that form of pervasive psychic excitation
      which Freud had in mind in speaking of automatic anxiety.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is this pervasive anxiety which floods
      the ego when a traumatic anxiety situation is encountered and
      overwhelms the ego. The sequence of these basic danger
      situations is familiar. When the very young child is
      threatened by a degree of pervasive anxiety with which he is
      unable to deal, and which can only be assuaged by the
      ministrations of a mother who detects the source of that
      anxiety, we have the prototype for later fears of
      annihilation. This is followed by fear of the loss of the
      object, fear of the loss of the object's love, castration
      anxiety, and fear of loss of the superego's love (Freud,
      1926). once ego development is sufficiently advanced to take
      an affective sample of one of these basic danger situations,
      to experience them in miniature, it can try to bring to bear
      its resources to ward off the threat and avoid the onset of
      pervasive (traumatic) anxiety.</p>

      <p class="text2">Further comment is called for on traumatic
      anxiety and traumatic neurosis. First, traumatic anxiety is
      experienced by every child at all stages of development, is
      very often rapidly reversible, and is, to that extent, <i>not
      a traumatizing experience</i> in the sense of Edgcumbe and
      Gavshon (1985). Every infant, when his needs are not met,
      experiences "traumatic" anxiety. Indeed, if this is balanced
      by a reasonable amount of gratification, so that the balance
      between pleasure and pain is not seriously disturbed, the
      frustration is a motivating factor in development. The Garden
      of Eden offers little incentive for its inhabitants to set
      out on further explorations.</p>

      <p>The situation is quite different in the traumatic
      neuroses. At first sight, it may appear that this condition
      shares with traumatic anxiety the state of reduction to
      helplessness. There are, nevertheless, important differences.
      When the ego is overwhelmed in the traumatic neurosis, it is
      not simply flooded with pervasive anxiety. It is totally
      knocked out in a flood of excitation. What is experienced is
      not psychic anxiety but somatic vegetative excitation. A
      fuller account of the developmental factors involved in this
      process has been given elsewhere (Yorke and Wiseberg, 1977;
      Yorke et al., 1980), and its relevance for the concept of
      trauma has been discussed by Furman (1984).</p>

      <p class="text2">A breach of the stimulus barrier initiates
      the traumatic neurosis. The question of whether one can
      reasonably postulate a protective shield against excessive
      stimuli from within as well as without. Anna Freud (1967)
      explicitly said that one could. She took as her starting
      point Freud's statement that "the essence of a traumatic
      situation is is experience of helplessness on the part of the
      ego in the face of an accumulation of excitation whether of
      external or internal origin." Since then she considered that
      this quotation designated the ego as "the central victim in
      the traumatic event," she argued that "it implies that there
      exists not one stimulus barrier (against environmental
      stimuli) but two protective shields against two types of
      dangers threatening from the inner as well as from the outer
      world. These include, of course, those occasions where
      otherwise harmless external happenings are given threatening
      meaning on the basis of existing internal constellations" (p.
      236).</p>

      <p class="text2">It is important to observe that, in the
      statement quoted by Anna Freud, Freud was referring to
      <i>traumatic situations</i> - that is, those of <i>basic
      danger</i>. He was not referring to events that precipitate a
      traumatic neurosis. The one threatens or leads to pervasive
      anxiety; the other to vegetative excitation and involves a
      breach of the stimulus barrier. It is unfortunate that
      "reduction to helplessness" is so often held to characterize
      the two without the necessary psychoanalytic qualifications
      which show how different they are.</p>

      <p class="text2">The fact that this difference is repeatedly
      overlooked may well spring from Freud's varied use of the
      word "trauma" in different contexts and in different
      circumstances. The problem is in part a historical one and is
      compounded by the persistence, with fluctuating emphasis, of
      the preanalytic, traumatic theory of neurosis in later
      formulations. In this connection, Greenacre's account (1967)
      of the different meanings of the word "trauma" in succeeding
      stages of Freud's writings is indispensable. She reminds us,
      for example, that in reviewing his work with Breuer, he
      referred to "traumas" following the most trivial experiences
      of childhood (Freud, 1906), while in the <i>Introductory
      Lectures</i> many years later, he compared the traumatic
      neuroses with the symptom neuroses, and said that, although
      the two could not be closely compared, even in the latter
      there was no need to abandon the "traumatic line of approach
      as being erroneous: it must be possible to fit it in and
      subsume it somewhere else" (1916-17, p 276).</p>

      <p class="text2">It seems possible that considerations of
      this kind underlie the notion of a second barrier against
      internal stimuli. To avoid further perpetuation of
      ambiguities, a breakthrough of such a stimulus barrier would
      have to be distinguished from an untimely penetration of the
      repression barrier. Only two conditions come to mind where
      the concept of an internal stimulus barrier might appear, at
      first sight, useful: namely the stage IV nightmare in adults
      and pavor nocturnus in children. Studies of these conditions,
      which seem identical in all essentials, indicate that they
      occur during NREM sleep and are related, not to dream
      materials of the usual kind but to frightening thoughts which
      follow the secondary process (Fisher et al., 1970) The well
      known result - that the child sits upright in a state of
      absolute terror and total confusion - may suggest that
      something analogous to the initial state of traumatic
      neurosis has occurred by virtue of an invasion of the barrier
      from within. Ego functioning is again knocked out. It is
      during the resulting state of confusion that the individual
      may be endangered - a patient of my acquaintance who suffered
      repeatedly from stage IV nightmares once walked, in her
      disorientation, through a second story window and seriously
      injured herself.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nevertheless, pavor nocturnus and the stage
      IV nightmare differ in at least two major particulars from
      the condition resulting from the breach of the
      <i>external</i> stimulus barrier. First, they occur in a
      state of altered consciousness, when the ego is already
      vulnerable. Secondly, the result is not a persisting
      disorder. Even though the substantial impairment of ego
      functioning may last for many minutes of even longer, once it
      is over, the child or adult returns to normal health. And
      while these nocturnal states require further study, the need
      for a concept a second stimulus barrier appears, even in this
      restricted clinical context, an open question.</p>

      <p class="text2">If the part played by the economic factor in
      all these conditions is taken more fully into account, the
      strength of the stimulus barrier or, in the case of traumatic
      anxiety, of other opposing agents, is as important as the
      strength of the force arranged against them (A. Freud, 1967).
      Vulnerability is not evenly distributed among people; it is
      well known, for example, that the level of the pain threshold
      varies from person to person. One can certainly encounter
      cases of psychic shock that stop short of traumatic neurosis
      and suggest that any breach of the barrier has been less than
      total. It would indeed make nonsense of the concept of a
      developmental line of anxiety, and signal anxiety were held
      not to exist. While this consideration should certainly be
      kept in mind in what has been said, it does not invalidate
      the usefulness of the distinctions which have been
      emphasized. On any developmental line, way stations are still
      way stations and cannot be telescoped together.</p>

      <p class="text2">The third condition to be discussed is what
      I have called the posttraumatic neuroticlike state. It may
      best be considered with the help of an extended illustration.
      The patient, a Scotsman in early middle age, was a
      businessman with pharmaceutical training. In the course of
      analysis, he relived in transference a fantasy that his head
      was inside his mothers bottom and was being constricted by
      it. The context in which it occurred is of special
      interest.</p>

      <p class="text2">He did not seek help on account of any
      somatic symptoms. His initial complaints were of intermittent
      free-floating anxiety, episodes of mild depressive affect
      without any specific conscious content, and difficulties in
      establishing friendly relations with others. He had a girl
      friend of whom he was somewhat possessive, but his
      relationships were otherwise formal and restricted to
      essential contact.</p>

      <p class="text2">A few weeks after the start of treatment he
      expressed a number of fantasies in which I was attacked about
      the head - first by unknown persons, then by himself. In
      these attacks the brain and skull were seriously damaged. I
      commented on the growing intensity and frequency of these
      fantasies. He then told me that, around the age of 4 or 4
      1/2, he had been admitted to a hospital for a mastoidectomy,
      after a good deal of pain. He remembered the stay there as
      something horrific. Visiting was not allowed, and he had no
      access to his family. His happiest memory was of greeting his
      father who came to collect him on discharge.</p>

      <p class="text2">These concerns dominated the treatment for a
      considerable time. Fantasies of sadistic violence, in which
      he viciously attacked my head, appeared again and again in
      limitless variations. To begin with, these fantasies were not
      reported with appropriate affect, and although the sadism
      itself was expressed in the most direct manner, it was
      accompanied by only the most muted of feeling states.</p>

      <p class="text2">A sadomaschistic transference expressed the
      reexperience of the frightening operation in which he was
      either the victim or the vengeful attacker. I was repeatedly
      equated with the surgeon who drove knives into his body and
      mutilated his victim's skull, or who put damaging or
      dangerous words into his ears. The fantasy was he was the
      victim of a violent homosexual intercourse, experienced in
      terms of the chisel and the skull, soon came into awareness
      and became the subject of protracted working through.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before long, it became clear that the
      reexperience of the operation was in no way limited to
      content of this kind. It had become the overdetermined center
      of all manner of conflict and anxiety. Almost everything that
      concerned or disturbed him appeared to have some reference to
      this one dramatic episode. The anesthesia under which the
      operation was conducted (in fantasy or reality) played a
      central role. Episodes of drowsiness occurred in the analytic
      session; feelings of suffocation appeared with unfailing
      regularity; fantasies of being overwhelmed by smells, of
      being smothered and reduced to oblivion, brought repeated
      distress as the associated affect became more available.</p>

      <p class="text2">If, as a result of the continuing analytic
      work, material centered on the operation, the anesthesia and
      all the circumstances that went with it slowly yielded to a
      better understanding of the patients intense conflict at
      almost every stage of development, they did so reluctantly
      and only intermittently. When, for example, positive oedipal
      material became a central feature of our work, the wish to
      enter the body of the analyst and mother slowly achieved
      direct expression. The childhood nature of the fantasy was
      graphically illustrated by the "recollection" with which this
      vignette began. He was standing like a 3-year-old behind his
      mother's legs with his arms clasped firmly around her thighs.
      This was immediately followed by the fantasy that, in this
      position, he would have his head right up his mother's
      skirts, and in no time at all was pushing it into her bottom.
      At his point in the session he complained of a headache; and
      when I relieved him of this with an interpretation of the
      oppressive force around him, the pain gave way to a pleasant
      and welcome anesthesia as the warmth and the smell overcame
      him.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is striking how completely the phallic
      and anal material came together in the patient's childhood
      fantasies and their current reexperience. The orality, too,
      was conspicuous. At one time or another, every part instinct
      or its derivatives achieved some form of expression in the
      context of the trauma as he remembered it or, perhaps more
      correctly, fantasized it. Thus, the thoughts of being
      peacefully put to sleep were linked with the notion of
      satiation at the breast and resulting contented oblivion; but
      even this brought to mind fantasies of anesthetic
      intubation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Exhibitionism and scopophilia played a
      considerable part in this man's material. It was repeatedly
      presented in terms of the hospital experience. Getting
      undressed was linked in his mind with a fantasy of being
      stripped naked by the nurse, and getting dressed in terms of
      being wrapped in hospital gear or in bandages. The nurse
      repeatedly came to represent the woman who humiliated him,
      mocked him, and exposed his tiny genital to view. And,
      inasmuch as there was always another side to the conflict,
      she could also represent the protector who clothed him and at
      times hid him comfortingly from view. The intense ambivalence
      was manifest in these myriad ways at nearly every stage of
      treatment. Impulses to urinate and fears of wetting the couch
      were almost inextricably linked with fears of a scolding for
      failing to ask for a bedpan. Skin erotism, likewise, was
      manifest in terms of the many things that were done to his
      body in preparation for the surgical assault. (In later
      phases of the analysis all manifestations were shown to have
      far more varied determinants as these were brought into
      awareness.)</p>

      <p class="text2">The way in which the analysis repeatedly
      brought to consciousness apparent manifestations of the
      surgical trauma may best be conveyed by some sessional
      material. I have chosen an illustration from the fourth year
      of treatment to give some indication of the persistence of
      this content and to demonstrate how, even at this stage in
      the analysis, it could still play a conspicuous part in the
      treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Part of my consulting room had been freshly
      painted. When the patient lay on the couch, he expressed his
      pleasure at the smell of new paint. He had experienced some
      feelings of dizziness the previous day, as if his brain were
      being damaged. He had a fantasy that he was suffering from a
      brain disorder, perhaps of an infective kind. It made him
      very sensitive to what he called "levels of
      consciousness."</p>

      <p class="text2">At his club the previous day, he had found
      himself feeling angry with a fellow committee member. This
      colleague who, incidentally was a doctor, always spoke with
      authority, as if he knew everything and had a right to be in
      charge. The conversation was becoming somewhat acrimonious,
      though he himself had not expressed his feelings. He looked
      around the room and reflected that the building was falling
      down. They would have to move. This seemed to add to the
      general air of acrimony and discontent." The hostility seemed
      too much for him, and he was somewhat alarmed when the man
      who assumed so much authority began attacking one of the
      women members. He realized that his own feeling was
      unmistakably a childhood one that brought back to life
      quarrels between his parents, in which he was always the
      mediator. He wanted to attack his doctor colleague.</p>

      <p class="text2">We had already in previous sessions, had
      occasion to look at his fantasies of a violent primal scene,
      in which he intervened and rescued his mother from the
      hostile father. No doubt it was the work we had already done
      that helped him to say, suddenly and decisively, "I realize
      it can't really be about the doctor on the committee. I have
      no real quarrel with him. I suppose you're the one I really
      want to attack, but <i>that</i> makes me feel guilty and
      bad." He then observed that he had experienced the
      unsteadiness, the dizziness of which he had spoken, on
      leaving the committee meeting.</p>

      <p class="text2">After acknowledging his comments on the
      primal scene and his reexperience in terms of myself and my
      wife, I suggested to him that he must be struck by the way in
      which so many of his thoughts still took us back to the
      operation in childhood. The fantasy of neurological or brain
      damage still returned, and the unsteadiness, presumably was
      still linked to the anesthetic experiences. Could it be that,
      in his fantasy, the attack on his own head and the
      concomitant anesthesia followed the attack on myself in the
      form of the committee doctor? Did he perhaps experience this
      as a retaliation for his own aggression? "Well," He
      responded, I <i>do</i> have a sense of being unjustifiably
      hostile to older men. I get angry when I'm not treated as an
      equal. I suggested that, when he experienced the childhood
      feeling to which he had referred, he was not treating
      <i>himself</i> as an equal. He was silent for a time.</p>

      <p class="text2">After some reflection, he said he must annoy
      his girl friend by repeatedly drifting off in his thoughts
      whenever she talked to him. He thought this must make her
      quite angry. He recalled that his mother used to "drift off"
      whenever he wanted to talk to her, so perhaps he was
      retaliating for his mother's behavior by doing the same to
      his girl friend. Some comments about the forthcoming weekend
      as well as a future holiday brought thoughts of my "drifting
      away" from him and physically absenting myself in the same
      way that his mother had done when she had forcibly sent him
      to the hospital.</p>

      <p class="text2">For some time, almost any session picked at
      random would contain <i>some reference</i>, however slight or
      disguised, to the hospital experience although as the
      analytic work proceeded, there were longer stretches when any
      such reference was marginal. And although physical
      experiences played no part in the discomforts that drove this
      man to seek treatment, they repeatedly played a part in the
      analysis. They appeared in bodily sensations, in feelings of
      impaired consciousness, of unsteadiness, and of transient
      pain. Although their appearance was not exclusive to the
      consulting room and affected him elsewhere, and even imposed
      themselves upon his patterns of sleep, they almost always had
      transference manifestations. But perhaps the most striking
      feature of all was that, with rare exceptions, they could be
      traced to fantasies and reexperiences of the hospital trauma,
      especially the operation itself.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus I believe, this hospital experience can
      properly be regarded as a trauma, it appears to have
      attracted to itself, almost like a magnet, nearly all the
      major conflicts, expectable or otherwise, which preceded it
      as well as so many conflicts that must have followed it. The
      hospital experience therefore functions as an organizer. (<a
      href="../kennedy/">Kennedy, 1986</a>) which structures the
      patients disturbances and anxieties and lends them the shape
      they they assume when they reemerge in analysis. The analytic
      task in a case such as this consists of the slow isolation of
      the trauma from all that goes before and all that follows
      after. Whether this can ever be completely accomplished is
      another matter. However this may be, it seems justified to
      call cases of this kind <i>posttraumatic neuroticlike
      states</i>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some of these points may be made with
      greater force in the light of a treatment session from a
      comparatively late stage in the analysis. The patient
      reported that he was awakened during the night by his girl
      friend who was now pregnant. She said she couldn't sleep on
      account of a rash that was itching. He looked at it, could
      not identify it, gave her some calamine lotion, and went to
      sleep. He had a dream in which his feet were sinking into
      mud. When he finally extricated himself, the mud was clinging
      to his body.</p>

      <p class="text2">In his associations he recalled that, the
      day before, he had been trying to fix a leak in the water
      tank and, in doing so, had become very dirty. For some time
      he felt very smelly and dirty for reasons which puzzled him.
      He reminded me of the several occasions on which he had
      already referred to this experience. There was a note of
      reproof in his voice. He said there was a bit in the dream
      which suggested that he had managed to find a way of dealing
      with the mud and getting rid of it.</p>

      <p class="text2">This reminded him that he had been somewhat
      intrigued by his girl friend's rash and was determined to
      find a way to help her. He was a keen reader of medical
      literature and always regretted he had not become a doctor.
      He got hold of some textbooks on dermatology and decided it
      must be an allergic response. With more detective work and
      further questioning of his girl friend he traced the cause of
      the allergy and decided it must be an allergic response. With
      more detective work and further questioning of his girl
      friend he traced the cause of the allergy and dealt with it
      successfully. He was proud of his accurate diagnosis and
      treatment. The cause for the reproachful tone soon became
      clear. <i>He</i> had got <i>his</i> girl friend "out of the
      mud": why hadn't I solved his problem with the dirty skin in
      the same effective way he had solved hers?</p>

      <p class="text2">He turned again to his fascination with
      rashes. When he examined his girl friend, he had put his ear
      to her tummy to see if he could feel the baby kicking or hear
      the heart beat. He couldn't. He had a fleeting fantasy that
      the child would be brain damaged. But he couldn't understand
      why the rash should make him listen for the child. He also
      noticed that, right now, he felt very hot as well as
      sticky.</p>

      <p class="text2">I said that I wondered if he was recalling
      some childhood illness of his own in which he was hot because
      he had a fever, and felt dirty and sticky because he had a
      rash. Perhaps it was an illness which sometimes led to brain
      damage. He said, "That's funny. As you were talking I thought
      of measles. I did have German measles - I think at 6 or 7,
      but I had forgotten about it until now. I was frightened
      because my mother left me to go out. I heard later she'd
      knocked down a child who had to be taken to the hospital with
      a broken arm." I said, "So this was another illness linked
      with brain damage and an absent mother who injured a child."
      This reminded him that he, too, had once broken his leg and
      had a greenstick fracture of the fibia. He remembered being
      taken to the hospital lying in the back of the car. He
      paused, and then went on, "I know I'd also suffered from
      chicken pox, though I'm not sure when. I had a small cousin
      whose brain was already damaged and who died from the measles
      about the same time."</p>

      <p class="text2">He again thought about the water tank.
      (Earlier, we had traced part of his interest in water to a
      childhood fascination with urination, especially in little
      girls.) Whenever he was hot, he longed for something cool on
      his skin. He remembered that as a child his favorite book was
      <i>The Water Babies</i> and it was the chimney sweep with the
      filthy skin who was at the center of the story. He went back
      to the greenstick fracture. He remembered begging his mother
      to relieve him of the pain. When he got to the hospital, the
      anesthetic did just that and it was marvelous.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the analysis he had already discovered
      that he liked the smell of new paint; and the pleasant
      effects of a little alcohol before he went to bed gave him a
      sense of freedom from disease. But he only acquired his
      bedtime habit during analysis, and it was necessary to
      understand his pleasure in terms of its significance in the
      transference. It had for some time been progressively easier
      to link his recurrent experiences with both pleasure and pain
      and with conflicts of a varied nature deriving from different
      developmental phases. They were no longer to be understood in
      the light of an inevitable link with the "traumatic event."
      The separation of my patient's trauma from other historical
      aspects of his development allowed him to welcome a whole
      range of positive experiences and pleasurable activities as
      well as understand the many miseries which had occurred
      independently of the operation in a new light.</p>

      <p class="text2">The material from the foregoing session is
      not, however primarily reported to emphasize his point. It is
      the striking illustration of the way in which later
      significant events, conflicts, and experiences were drawn
      into the trauma that has to be underlined. <a
      href="../glover/">Glover</a> (1929), in reporting a patient
      who remembered how he burned his hand when he was about 3 1/2
      but had no recollection of a <span
      class="yellow">circumcision</span> occurring at the same
      time, suggested that traumatic memories might have a
      screening function. Furst (1967) discussed this postulate in
      underlining the fact that a "screen trauma," like a screen
      memory, can serve either to cover another more significant
      trauma or else can stand for a group or series of traumatic
      events. A point of this kind has indeed been repeatedly made
      in the analytic literature and is described, for example by
      Anna Freud (1951) and by Kris (1956) in his discussion of
      strain trauma. What we are dealing with in my adult patient,
      however is something more; <i>future</i> events are drawn
      <i>back</i> and absorbed into the single trauma long after it
      occurred.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a href="../kennedy/">Hansi Kennedy</a>
      (1986) described the treatment of an adolescent whose
      phimosis in early life was the subject of his mother's
      intrusive ministrations and led at the age of 2 years 8
      months to operative treatment. [<span
      class="yellow">circumcision</span>] The boy felt deeply that
      he had never been loved, and the attention given to his penis
      represented his principle tie to the mother. A leading
      feature of this analysis was the repetition, in thinly
      disguised enactments, of the manipulation of his genitals and
      the painful excitement this engendered in the transference.
      This dominated the early stages of the treatment, and its
      sadomasochistic character could be traced long afterward. The
      author took the view that the boy's protracted experience of
      the mother's genital attentions and the subsequent operation
      had a decisive effect on all later development, as well as
      serving to incorporate all the antecedent conflicts. For this
      reason, Kennedy refers to the boy's collective experiences as
      an "organizer" in a sense comparable to my use of the term in
      connection with my adult patient.</p>

      <p class="text2">It may rightly be asked what is meant by the
      term organizer. I have the impression that Kennedy's use of
      the term is, like mine, descriptive. That does not mean that
      our uses are identical, although, in each instance, we try to
      convey and identify a pathological process in terms which may
      be both clinically and theoretically useful. It is true that
      the presenting clinical pictures are very different, but the
      events which in each case became such a powerful determinant
      in shaping the nature and quality of the treatment experience
      can surely be called <i>traumatic</i>.</p>

      <p align="center"><big>S</big><small>UMMARY</small></p>

      <p class="text2">Discussion of psychic trauma has been
      handicapped by colloquial use of the term which broadens its
      application to a point where it undermines its psychoanalytic
      usefulness. The problem is compounded by a blurring of
      distinctions between what can properly be called the
      <i>traumatic neurosis</i> and what is often called
      <i>traumatic anxiety</i>. This sometimes results in hybrid
      concepts in which earlier and important precisions are lost.
      Furthermore, it seems possible that our understanding of the
      trauma concept has not been made easier by the hypothesis of
      a breakthrough of the barrier against internal stimuli - a
      notion that risks confusion with an untimely breakthrough of
      the repression barrier. That is not to say that the notion
      should be abandoned without further consideration.</p>

      <p class="text2">Further thought needs to be given to the
      posttraumatic neurotic- like states. Although these have been
      understood in terms of trauma as "organizer," this term is
      used by both Kennedy and myself in a descriptive sense. This
      does not obviate the necessity for greater metapsychological
      clarity in the further study of these conditions. That task
      still lies ahead.</p>
