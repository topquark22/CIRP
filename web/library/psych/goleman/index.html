      <h2>Early Violence Leaves Its Mark on the Brain</h2>

      <h3>Adolescent violence is traced to abuse and neglect in
      childhood.</h3>

      <h4>Early Violence Found to Be Etched in the Brain</h4>

      <p><b>By DANIEL GOLEMAN</b></p>

      <p>WITH rates of violence among teenagers rising
      precipitously, the argument over the causes of violent
      behavior has never been more charged. Nature got a hearing
      last month at a University of Maryland meeting on possible
      genetic influences on violence. Last weekend, nurture had its
      day, at a meeting at the New York Academy of Sciences on the
      childhood causes of violence.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Several strands of findings presented
      by researchers at the weekend conference pointed to the same
      conclusion: brutality and cruelty to children can leave a
      clear mark on the chemistry of the brain. And those changes
      in brain chemistry may be the route by which a brutalized
      child becomes a violent adult.</span> The conference also
      offered some glimmers of hope for changing an established
      inclination to violent behavior.</p>

      <p>One animal study that was particularly telling showed that
      normally mild-mannered golden hamsters that were threatened
      and attacked when they were young, and that grew up to be
      cowardly bullies, had lasting changes in the brain circuitry
      for two neurotransmitters that regulate aggression. And
      parallel data from several long-range studies of large groups
      of children show that those who were childhood victims of
      abuse or neglect were the most violent as teenagers.</p>

      <p>The hopeful news came from programs that seek to help
      these children learn to better control their aggressive
      impulses.</p>

      <p>"Even if a child has a predisposition to aggression, he
      can learn to override it," said Dr. Karen Bierman, a
      psychologist at Pennsylvania State University. "The more
      aggressive kids just need more help from their parents,
      teachers and friends."</p>

      <p>The research on golden hamsters took advantage of that
      species' habit of living singly, and being fiercely
      protective of their nesting territory---or, in this case,
      laboratory cage.</p>

      <p>In the wild, adolescent hamsters ordinarily go off on
      their own and establish a solitary nest. But in the
      experiment, adolescent hamsters were placed in the cage of a
      mature one, thus violating its territory, for an hour a day
      over a week's time---about half a hamster's adolescence. The
      older hamsters threatened and attacked the younger ones to
      protect their territory from the interloper.</p>

      <p>When those younger hamsters grew up they were given their
      own territories, and experimenters placed other hamsters in
      the cages of the traumatized ones. If an interloper was the
      same size, the traumatized hamster tended to cower or
      run.</p>

      <p>But if the interloper was smaller and weaker, the resident
      hamster attacked--- with a vengeance. "They were far more
      aggressive than normal," said Dr. Craig Ferris, a
      neuroscientist in the Behavioral Neuroscience Program in the
      psychiatry department at the University of Massachusetts
      Medical Center in Worcester. He conducted the study with Dr.
      Yvonne Delville.</p>

      <p>In a related study, anatomical studies of adult hamsters
      that had gone through similar experiences showed changes in
      the neural circuitry for vasopressin, a brain substance
      involved in the regulation of aggressive impulses in
      hamsters. The vasopressin circuitry was diminished, with less
      of the substance being synthesized by the cells. That seems
      to make the receptors for the scarcer vasopressin more
      sensitive. Dr. Ferris plans to do similar anatomical studies
      of the hamsters that were terrorized in adolescence.</p>

      <p>For serotonin, which plays a role in restraining
      aggressive impulses, the traumatized hamsters had circuitry
      that secreted larger amounts of the neurotransmitter, which
      seems to make the receptors for serotonin less sensitive.
      "The serotonin system is just not doing its job," Dr. Ferris
      said.</p>

      <p>Exactly how all this affects the hamsters depends on what
      they are confronting. "Normally, vasopressin facilitates
      aggression and serotonin inhibits it, but the system doesn't
      work very well in these hamsters," Dr. Ferris said. "They
      either get too timid or you get an explosion of aggression,"
      depending on whether they are with an animal of equal size or
      one that is a potential victim.</p>

      <p>Sluggish serotonin circuitry seems typical of more violent
      humans, too, according to studies in which people are
      injected with a dose of fenfluramine, a substance that
      stimulates receptors for serotonin. The injection leads to
      the release of prolactin, a stress hormone that can be
      measured in the blood; higher levels of prolactin indicate
      greater serotonin activity.</p>

      <p>"We find that people who are easily angered and
      impulsive---prone to shouting and throwing things, for
      example---release less prolactin than those who are not so
      irritable and impulsive," said Dr. Emil Coccaro, a
      psychiatrist in the Clinical Neuroscience Unit at the Medical
      College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. "That implies that
      the less active or responsive your serotonin system is, the
      more impulsive and aggressive you'll be."</p>

      <p>Several studies presented at the conference showed that
      children who were abused or otherwise severely stressed in
      childhood were far more likely than others to be violent as
      teenagers or adults. And, again, some of the data implicated
      changes in serotonin or related neurotransmitter systems.</p>

      <p>Dr. Cathy Spatz Widom, a psychologist at the State
      University of New York in Albany, identified 908 children who
      had been victims of criminal neglect or physical abuse that
      led to the filing of criminal charges. Tracking the
      children's criminal records over the next 20 years, she found
      that those who had been childhood victims of neglect went on
      to have 50 percent more arrests for violent crimes than did a
      comparison group, while for.those who suffered physical
      abuse, the rate of violent crimes was double that of the
      comparison group.</p>

      <p>Similar findings were reported from a study of 66
      aggressive boys winnowed from an overall sample of 1,037
      inner-city children in Montreal. While the neighborhoods
      themselves tend to breed children somewhat more prone to
      aggression, these 66 boys were at the age 6 already the most
      violent among them.</p>

      <p>"These are the boys who are always getting in trouble for
      fighting all through elementary school," said Dr. Richard
      Tremblay, a psychologist at the University of Montreal, who
      reported the main results of a 10-year study that assessed
      the boys annually. "As adolescents, these are the boys most
      frequently involved in crimes, especially violent ones." And,
      he said, they come from families that "tend to be more
      physically punitive with their children, beating them or
      using other physical punishment."</p>

      <p>A test of pain sensitivity---an indirect measure of
      serotonin function---in these same boys suggested that they
      had lower levels of the substance, according to data
      presented by Dr. Jean Seguin, a colleague of Dr.
      Tremblay.</p>

      <p>Louise Arseneault, a graduate student at the University of
      Montreal who worked on the study, presented data showing that
      the aggressive boys had difficulty focusing on activities and
      were easily distracted. The result is that they are
      impulsive, she said, and so "unable to inhibit bad
      behavior---even if they know they'll be punished for
      it---they don't seem to be able to stop themselves."</p>

      <p>Boys who showed this deficiency on neuropsychological
      tests had the biggest increase from the age of 13 to 14 in
      picking fights and other aggressive acts---a jump of 50
      percent. Their main deficiency, Ms. Arseneault said, "is in
      self-regulation, the ability to keep yourself from fighting
      because you know it's bad or inappropriate."</p>

      <p>At the weekend conference, Dr. Adrian Raine, a
      psychologist at the University of Southern California,
      reported on a study of 4,269 boys, some of whom suffered some
      form of birth complication and whose mothers were abusive or
      neglectful in infancy. He found that those boys with birth
      complications and abuse were three times as likely as the
      others to be arrested for a violent crime by the age of
      18.</p>

      <p>Particularly damaging, Dr. Raine said, is early child
      abuse, like shaking a child vigorously. He said, "We know
      that can lead to laceration of the white nerve fibers that
      link the prefrontal cortex to deeper brain structures like
      the amygdala, which are involved in the generation of
      aggressive impulses, while the prefrontal lobes inhibit those
      impulses."</p>

      <p>The ability to control aggression is learned during
      childhood. The crucial importance of such childhood learning
      was underscored by studies done with rhesus monkeys in which
      some monkeys were raised by their mothers, and others spent
      childhood without their mothers but in the company of
      same-aged peers. The result of the motherless childhood was
      something like a rhesus version of "Lord of the Flies."</p>

      <p>While mother-reared monkeys with low serotonin levels are
      more aggressive than others as juveniles, "they are also more
      prosocial," engaging in many friendly acts, too, said Dr.
      Gary Kraemer, a psychologist at the Harlow Primate Laboratory
      at the University of Wisconsin.</p>

      <p>"But if they have low levels of serotonin and are raised
      deprived of interaction with their mom, they show inordinate,
      unpredictable and extreme aggression," Dr. Kraemer said. "The
      rhesus mother helps the young one learn to organize its
      responses to other monkeys."</p>

      <p>Those results, of course, can be read as hopeful as
      well---since mothering has such a powerful effect on
      modifying aggressive impulses. And at the conference,
      educators presented hopeful reports on special programs lo
      help more aggressive children learn to keep their impulses
      under better control.</p>

      <p>"We see that after a year, children who are prone to
      aggression can learn to talk about their feelings and think
      of different ways of solving a difficulty instead of just
      hitting," said Dr. Karen Bierman, a psychologist at Penn
      State. "But the interventions can't be just with the
      child---parents and friends have to help the child find
      alternatives to aggression and learn a broader array of
      skills for resolving problems."</p>

      <p>Dr. Bierman reported results from a curriculum used in the
      early grades to teach children better ways to manage their
      emotional impulses. In one technique, for example, teachers
      help children recognize the cues in their bodies that signal
      that they are about to lose control and lash out, and remind
      them to calm down instead. The children also regularly pair
      up with a buddy to play games, supervised by a trained
      neighborhood volunteer, and solve problems that commonly lead
      to fights at that age, for example, learning about the need
      to take turns.</p>

      <p>"We think doing this repeatedly and consistently helps
      children build self-regulation skills for handling aggressive
      impulses," said Dr. Mark Greenberg, a psychologist at the
      University of Washington who is a colleague of Dr. Bierman.
      "Presumably, it strengthens connections between the centers
      for emotional control in the prefrontal lobes and those for
      emotional impulse in the limbic areas.</p>

      <p>Dr. Bierman reported that the program resulted in fewer
      arguments and fights in the classroom and the playground, and
      enabled children who were prone to aggression to control
      their impulses. This, in turn helped them to become more
      popular with their playmates.</p>

      <p>"The brain circuits that regulate aggression in humans are
      malleable through childhood, so there may be some corrective
      experiences that reverse or otherwise improve any adverse
      impact from early abuse," Dr. Ferris said. "My hope is that
      we'll focus resources on these kids so they don't go down the
      path of social failure and inappropriate, excessive
      aggression."</p>
