        <b>Abstract<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article
        describes the present status of neonatal circumcision in
        the United States and presents clinical findings regarding
        the long-term somatic, emotional, and psychological
        consequences of this procedure in adult men. These
        consequences are seen as typical of complex <a
        href="/library/psych/ptsd2/">posttraumatic stress
        disorder</a>. They emerged during psychotherapy focused on
        the resolution of prenatal, perinatal, and developmental
        trauma and shock experiences. Their relationship to
        phenomena such as trauma, shock, somatic decisions,
        discounting, and scripting is described.</b>

      <p class="text1">Psychological trauma is an affliction of the
      powerless. At the moment of trauma, the victim is rendered
      helpless by overwhelming force. When the force is that of
      nature, we speak of disasters. When the force is that of
      other human beings, we speak of atrocities. Traumatic events
      overwhelm the ordinary systems of care that give people a
      sense of control, connection, and meaning. (Herman, 1992, p.
      33)</p>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision involves the surgical
      removal of the penile foreskin, a fold of skin and mucous
      membrane that normally covers the head or glans of the penis.
      Routine neonatal circumcision is usually done from one to
      three days after birth, while Jewish ritual circumcision is
      performed on the eighth day after birth.</p>

      <p class="text2">Postnatal circumcision is still frequently
      performed in the United States, the only industrialized
      nation to continue this practice for non-religious reasons on
      a majority of newborn male babies--about 60 percent according
      to the National Center for Health Statistics. Estimating from
      this figure, doctors continue to circumcise over one million
      baby boys a year, an average of 3,500 a day or one every 25
      seconds. Circumcisions performed on Jewish newborns by a
      trained religious person called a mohel (ritual circumciser)
      account for less than 4% of this number.</p>

      <p class="text2">Controversy continues regarding the practice
      of newborn male circumcision. A variety of reasons are put
      forward both for and against the procedure, but recent
      information using reliable sources is often not well known to
      the general public or to health care professionals. My
      purpose in writing this article is to present what I found in
      my client population regarding the lifelong effects of this
      procedure. It is my hope that this will stimulate further
      thought and therapeutic exploration of this issue.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Clinical reports</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The psychotherapeutic
      approach I use when working with early trauma resolution
      involves a guided associative process that follows my
      client's flow of thoughts, memories, images, and body
      sensations. This is intertwined with a sensitive repatterning
      of memories of traumatic events and is more fully described
      in my article "Touching and Holding During Regressive
      Therapy" (Rhinehart, 1998).</p>

      <p class="text2">Many men who were circumcised as neonates
      consider it a nonissue because they cannot remember anything
      about it. In my psychotherapeutic work with men, however, it
      is clear that the memory is there. Since the event occurred
      at a very early preverbal level, it is most often experienced
      as a body or somatic memory rather than as a more familiar
      verbal memory. Various disturbing mental images and intense
      feelings often accompany the reemergence of this body memory,
      including the feel of sharp metallic instruments cutting into
      one's flesh (anesthesia is normally not used in
      circumcision), the sense of being overpowered by big people,
      being alone and helpless, feelings of terror, and a sense of
      paralysis and immobilization.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Case examples</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following four
      examples show the long-term effects of circumcision trauma,
      effects I have found typical among my clients.</p>

      <p class="text2">ST is a 44-year-old man whose adult life is
      filled with a seemingly nameless terror. This feeling was
      most intense when he had to relate to people in other than a
      superficial manner. At those times has body might start
      shaking uncontrollably. He would look away, withdraw
      inwardly, and experience a high level of embarrassment.
      During our therapeutic work, as he reexperienced the terror,
      his trembling hands went automatically to his groin to cover
      his genitals in a protective way. He felt that he was
      reliving the time of his neonatal circumcision. He was in
      physical and emotional terror as he rocked back and forth,
      feeling completely powerless, betrayed and alone. He did not
      have words for this experience, which had been "forgotten"
      until we began our work--just moans and groans of agony and
      helplessness. In his view, his circumcision was one of the
      most important experiences underlying his early decision that
      people were unsafe and dangerous. This decision expressed
      itself in his lifelong sense of fear around other people,
      especially those in positions of authority. The circumcision
      experience, bad enough in itself was made more severe by his
      mother's inability to offer him comfort at the time. This
      greatly reinforced the degree of his trauma and the resulting
      negative decisions he made about the safety of his world and
      the people in it. At present, the trauma has been largely
      resolved and his neurologic circuitry repatterned, thus
      eliminating the terror and trembling.</p>

      <p class="text2">BJ, 52 years old, came into therapy because
      he experienced "early issues coming up and polluting my
      life." During a particular session he kept using the term
      "cut off" in relation to family and other life issues. These
      issues had been triggered by his attending the bris (Jewish
      ritual circumcision) for a friend's newborn son. He heard the
      baby screaming and, much to his surprise, felt extremely
      uncomfortable, sweaty, dizzy, and aware that his genitals
      felt like they had suddenly been plunged into ice water and
      were "shrinking." Following this, he felt rage welling up at
      the idea that something was being taken from the baby--that
      he was being overpowered, reduced, and diminished against his
      will. BJ felt that this clearly related to his own neonatal
      circumcision. He was born three weeks before term weighing
      five pounds. He believes that he was not comforted or touched
      much after his premature birth or the circumcision which was
      performed on the third day in spite of his low birth weight.
      As we worked together, BJ made connections--cognitively,
      emotionally, and physically--between his early experience and
      his lifelong sense of anger, powerlessness, diminishment as a
      male, and underlying generalized ominous feeling that he was
      somehow going to be punished for being male. In photographs
      of himself as a young boy he noticed that he frequently had
      both hands covering his genitals. What also surfaced from a
      very young place was an incredulous "How can you do this to
      me--I can't trust you anymore," which reflected his feeling
      as an adult that people are untrustworthy. Connected with
      these was the belief that he was not supposed to cry or get
      mad as a result of what was done to him. Releasing and
      repatterning his feelings around his circumcision led to a
      significant increase in self-confidence, clarity in his
      relationships, and freedom to be the creative male person
      that he is without holding back because of fear of
      retaliation.</p>

      <p class="text2">RJ is in his early sixties. He had a
      lifelong fear of any sharp metal instruments. When preparing
      food, he had to use knives as sparingly as possible, and he
      could not stand to have them lying out. When he did use a
      knife, he had to clean and put it away immediately. In
      therapy, the connection of this became clear to him. The body
      memory that he experienced was an excruciating feeling in his
      penis of a sharp "steely" knife (a scapel-like instrument)
      cutting his foreskin away. New he finds it increasingly easy
      to be around knives, and he has a new sense of freedom in the
      world.</p>

      <p class="text2">WK is in his mid-forties and has experienced
      anxiety and panic all his life. As a child he described
      himself as being on edge constantly and unable to perform
      well in almost everything he tried. He felt particularly
      inadequate and worthless in academic and occupational
      settings--that is, around authority figures. During the
      initial part of our therapy, we made some progress through
      the effects of his father's frequent shaming behavior toward
      him as he grew up; this behavior created and reinforced
      feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness in WK. During
      therapy, we identified and worked with residues of birth
      trauma as well as residues of his mother's (and father's)
      unresolved depression and fear related to the SIDS death at
      six weeks of an older sister, which occurred about a year
      before his conception. However, the ease with which his
      anxiety and panic reactions could be triggered--particularly
      in relation to authority figures at work--persisted. It was
      not until he came on pictures of a neonatal circumcision that
      he became aware of the extreme trauma associated with his own
      experience. As the memory surfaced, his body suddenly became
      stiff, numb, and filled with terror, and his mind went blank
      ("cortical shock")--typical of what happens when experiencing
      this level of traumatic response). As an adult, any situation
      in which he felt vulnerable triggered this flooding reaction
      in his body/mind. It was as if his mind was operating on the
      basis of a very early decision that "big" people were
      dangerous and might attack him at any time. This early
      decision, then, had to do with maintaining a somatic state of
      hypervigilance and tension. While his rational mind could be
      clear that this was not necessary, his body maintained this
      stance anyway. This early decision had made intimate
      relationships difficult as an adult.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Later-Life Symptoms of
      Circumcision</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">Other men with whom I have worked have also
      made causal connections between present-day problems--such as
      a sense of defeat, shyness, anger, or fear--and their
      neonatal circumcision experiences.</span> I have developed a
      list of symptoms and behaviors that appear to have been
      caused or significantly conditioned by these neonatal
      experiences. Since these symptoms and behaviors can result
      from other traumatic experiences as well, this list should
      not be used as a diagnostic checklist to identify
      circumcision trauma; however, they may suggest its presence.

      <p class="text1"><b>Discussion</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea that
      circumcision may cause problems in later life is not new.
      Freud (1916-1917/1933) suggested, in his discussion of
      anxiety and instinctual life (pp. 86-87), that there could be
      a connection between castration fears, neuroses, and
      circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          It is our suspicion that during the human family's
          primaeval period castration used actually to be carried
          out by a jealous and cruel father upon growing boys, and
          that circumcision, which so frequently plays a part in
          puberty rites among primitive peoples, is a clearly
          recognizable relic of it, ...We must hold fast to the
          view that fear of castration is one of the commonest and
          strongest motives for repression and thus for the
          formation of neuroses. The analysis of cases in which
          circumcision, though not, it is true, castration has been
          carried out on boys as a cure or punishment for
          masturbation (a far from rare occurrence in
          Anglo-American society) has given our conviction a last
          degree of certainty. (pp. 86-87)
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Freud's thinking, advanced for its time, was
      in contrast to the more prevalent idea of his era that
      neonates are " very little more intelligent than a vegetable
      &hellip; not directly conscious of anything" (Goldman, 1997,
      p.7). This was the opinion of a renowned infant specialist at
      the University of Pennsylvania in 1895. Even "fifty years
      later, newborn infants were [still] believed to be incapable
      of anything except eating, moving, crying, and sleeping."
      (Spock, 1946, cited in Goldman, 1997, p.7).</p>

      <p class="text2">While Freud's thinking was focused on the
      formation of neuroses, perhaps a more accurate way of
      thinking about circumcision today is in relation to trauma,
      which we now know much more about. We also know that the
      neonate is highly intelligent even though he or she is, most
      likely, not in a position to differentiate circumcision from
      castration.</p>

      <p class="text2">In her model of human responses to trauma,
      Pomeroy (1995) brings together what we know about what trauma
      is, how it happens, and what our psychic responses to
      traumatic events. She describes three inborn levels or lines
      of defense for dealing with a threatening experience: (1)
      relational resources, consisting of boundaries and safe,
      trustworthy individual and communal connections; (2) fight,
      flight, and freeze defenses from the brains limbic system;
      and (3) shock defenses, also from the limbic system, but
      without emotional control (pp. 90-93). She points out that
      when an overwhelming threat alarm is signaled by the
      emotional brain, the emotional brain's defenses take over.
      The emotional brain responds at the level of fight-flight
      freeze (active defenses) or shock defenses (passive reflexes)
      (p. 92).</p>

      <p class="text2">In the case of circumcision, relational
      resources are unavailable to the neonate. The next level of
      fight-flight-freeze also does not serve him since he is
      easily trapped and overpowered by those performing the
      procedure. All he has left, therefore is the level of shock
      defense, which consists of central nervous system flooding by
      terror, rage, and finally numbing, paralysis, and
      dissociation; this his his last chance to control the high
      level of central nervous system activation, which might
      otherwise result in death. Watchinig videotapes of neonates
      being circumcised portrays this clearly to the aware eye. The
      so-called "quiet" after circumcision is more likely a state
      of dissociation in response to the overwhelming pain and
      terror than it is a state of peaceful relaxation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Van Howe (1996), reporting on his clinical
      study, writes, "Newborn males respond to circumcision with a
      marked reduction in oxygenation during the procedure, a
      cortisol surge [indicating strong adrenal arousal], decreased
      wakefulness, increased vagal tone, and less interactions with
      their environment following the procedure. All of these
      hinder the maternal-infant bonding experience that makes
      breastfeeding possible" (p. 431).</p>

      <p class="text2">In translating this level of experience to
      adult life, Emerson (1991), a pioneer in healing pre- and
      perinatal trauma in infants and children, has said that
      perinatal trauma (such as circumcision) results in "anger and
      rage [that] are inexplicably intertwined with low
      self-esteem, shame, guilt, violence, and disempowerment."</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Relevance to Transactional
      Analysis</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an earlier article
      (Rhinehart, 1998), p. 58) I noted that "in the October 1995
      <i>TAJ</i>, which was a memorial to Robert Goulding, he is
      quoted as talking about 'somatic redecision' (Blackstone,
      1995, p. 345). This concept arose during discussion of a
      group therapy session in which a client made a decision,
      during her work, to allow herself to reach out and be
      'cuddled tightly' by another woman, whom she had chosen as
      her 'therapist.' This somatic redecision was felt to be a
      'shift within the Child in the present' (p. 345)." From this
      we might infer that here was an earlier "somatic decision" in
      the Child of the past not to allow this type of cuddling.</p>

      <p class="text2">Steiner (1979) talked about "the somatic
      component [of a script decision] which bodily reflects the
      decision" (p. 109). Later he wrote, "The somatic component
      refers to the fact that a person who has made a decision
      invariably brings certain aspects of her anatomy into play,
      especially the musculature' (p. 111).</p>

      <p class="text2">Eskine (1980) described the three aspects of
      script that must be dealt with to achieve cure: behavioral,
      intrapsychic, and somatic (p. 103). He underlined that "the
      somatic aspects of script need to be an important focus of
      script cure" (p. 105) and that "with each scripting decision
      or script reaction I think that there is always a
      corresponding physiological inhibition or restriction within
      the body. The younger the child or more severe the trauma,
      the greater is the physiological reaction" (p. 105).</p>

      <p class="text2">For a neonate undergoing circumcision,
      perhaps it would be accurate to say that his "decision" is
      primarily somatic and derives from the defensive patterning
      of his shock experience. Because of its content and context,
      circumcision sets in place an automatic central nervous
      system and generalized somatic reaction to interpersonal
      experience from that point on. Some males will experience
      continuing vigilance, some a readiness to fight, flee, or
      freeze; and other will jump to rage, terror, or
      disconnection. It is helpful to note that, in considering the
      levels of defense, whenever the two earlier levels
      (relational and fight or flight) are experienced by the mind
      as ineffective, the mind tends not to use them later. This
      means that a mind patterned in this way jumps right to
      terror, rage and/or dissociation when confronted with
      situations that are interpreted as threatening, even though
      to the rational mind or cortex these situations may not be
      significant. In other words, when an event occurs in a man's
      life that resembles any aspect of the original circumcision
      experience, the chances that the extreme forms of panic,
      rage, violence, or dissociation might result are much more
      likely--just as they are in any other posttraumatic stress
      situation.</p>

      <p class="text2">The feelings and behaviors my clients
      experienced fit precisely unto what Herman (1992) called
      complex posttraumatic stress reaction (p. 121). They are no
      different from the experience of rape victims, combat
      veterans, female circumcision victims, and survivors of
      natural disasters. She also indicated that the common factor
      underlying the effects of trauma is the experience of
      violence and powerlessness (p. 33)--made worse if it is
      inflicted by other human beings in contrast to a natural
      disaster. Both are dramatically present in the procedure of
      neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Stern (1985) pointed out that the trauma
      disrupts the ability to cope with and assimilate information
      and also "that if the empathic failures of parents are too
      large, the sense of a cohesive self will be thrown too far
      off balance" (p. 245) Since intense affective states act as
      "cardinal organizing elements" (p. 245) in the personality,
      they leave lasting impressions.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although good experiences immediately
      following routine circumcision--such as parental holding,
      nursing, soothing, and comforting--may mitigate the intensity
      of the traumatic experience, my experience with clients
      confirms that circumcision registers in the body-mind in
      myriad ways, direct and indirect, throughout the man's
      life.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/bju.htm">Hammond</a> (1999), in
      his survey of men circumcised in infancy or childhood,
      outlines the physical, sexual, and psychological consequences
      experienced by 546 men. The leading physical and sexual
      consequences were prominent scarring of the penis (33%),
      insufficient penile skin for a comfortable erection (27%)
      (neonatal circumcisions remove what would grow to be come 51%
      of the adult penile covering, and progressive sensory deficit
      in the glans (61%) leading to compensations such as
      compulsive sexual behaviors that offer more intense kinds of
      stimulation to a sensorily dulled glans, As to the
      psychological consequences, respondents described:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Emotional distress, manifesting as intrusive thought
          about one's circumcision, including feelings of
          mutilation (60%), low self esteem/inferioty to intact men
          (50%), genital dysmorphia (55%), rage (52%)
          resentment/depression (59%), violation (46%), or parental
          betrayal (30%). Many respondents (41%) reported that
          their physical/emotional suffering impeded emotional
          intimacy with partners(s), resulting in sexual
          dysfunction&hellip;. Almost a third of respondents (29%)
          reported dependence on substances or behaviors to relieve
          their suffering (tobacco, alcohol, drugs, food and/or
          sexual compulsivity). (p. 87)
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">It is important to note that the problematic
      symptoms and behaviors that my clients experienced and
      expressed as adults might not initially lead a therapist to
      suspect such an early causal origin. Instead, they may seem
      more closely related to a highly stressful lifestyle, and it
      is true that it is in stressful times that such symptoms tend
      to surface. In most of my clients, negative experiences that
      occurred at older ages, while often significant in
      themselves, were actually layered on earlier traumatic
      experiences such as circumcision, trauma that had set up a
      basic mode of reaction to perceived threat. Therefore, in
      cases in which working therapeutically at older levels does
      not resolve a problem over the long term, it is important to
      look at earlier layers.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two other important considerations involving
      the transactions between parents, doctors, nurses, and the
      newborn are discounting and scripting.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Discounting:</i> Given that the neonate
      is a fully aware, perceptive, and responsive sentient being,
      circumcision discounts his experience in at least five
      areas:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Pain: His physical pain is ignored.</li>

          <li>Separation/abandonment: The terror of separation from
          mother and being immoblized in the circumstraint board is
          ignored.</li>

          <li>Violence: The significance and memory for him is
          ignored or rationalized.</li>

          <li>Protection: His cries of protest are not heard or
          respected.</li>

          <li>Objectification: The decision to circumcise is made
          by others as if he were an object and his experience did
          not exist or matter. This is perhaps not much different
          than decisions made about the fate of concentration camp
          internees by camp commanders; they too had their
          rationalizations.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2"><i>Scripting:</i> The circumcision
      experience for the neonate centers around abandonment,
      helplessness, pain, and violence. The neonate is uniquely
      vulnerable and responsive to these experiences, which is why
      he needs protection rather than abandonment as he integrates
      his birth experience and attempts to establish his bonding
      connection with his parents in the outside world. In my
      client population, because they were not protected from
      injury by those who were responsible for this function,
      decisions were made and beliefs created or reinforced that
      supported fear of , indifference to, and violence toward
      other human beings. These decisions and beliefs evolved into
      life scripts expressed over time. Power became identified
      with violence so that perpetrators and victims become the
      fare of life.</p>

      <p class="text2">Porter-Steele (1998) suggests that "even a
      little violence is too much, and our world has a tremendous
      amount of violence. &hellip; We [transactional analysts]
      recognize cultural and individual scripts that support
      violence instead of workable, compassionate problem solving"
      (p. 15). Perhaps routine neonatal circumcision is exactly
      this kind of culturally and individually determined
      scripting, and it can be stopped very simply, thus
      eliminating major discounting and victimization for millions
      of newborn males.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, another provocative possibility is
      mentioned by Taoist Master Mantak Chia in his book <i>Taoist
      Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy</i> (Chia
      with Winn, 1984, p. 243). He describes how the spot on a
      man's penis that is sexually assaulted during circumcision is
      reflexively connected to his heart and lung energies. This
      suggests that, in addition to the effects described in the
      article, circumcision may have a negative effect on the more
      subtle energy fields in a man's body around heart and lung
      function.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both the history of circumcision and more
      current research regarding what the newborn male experiences
      are extensively presented in books such as Goldman's (1997)
      <i>Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma</i> and <i>Questioning
      Circumcision--A Jewish Perspective</i> (1998), Brigg's (1985)
      <i>Circumcision: What Every Parent Should Know</i>, Ritter
      and Denniston's (1992) <i>Say No to Circumcision</i> and
      Denniston and Milo's (1997) <i>Sexual Mutilations: A Human
      Tragedy</i>.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Summary</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision of the
      newborn male child consists of removal of the penile
      foreskin, a normal, functional part of the child's body. The
      United States is now the only industrialized country in the
      world that continues to circumcise the majority of its
      newborn male children for non-religious reasons. <span
      class="yellow">In my client population of adult men, serious
      and sometimes disabling lifelong consequences appear to have
      resulted from this procedure, and long-term psychotherapy
      focusing on early trauma resolution appears to be effective
      in dealing with these consequences. Early prevention by
      eliminating the practice of routine circumcision is seen as
      desirable.</span> The author welcomes sharing of readers'
