      <p class="text2"><font size="2">In human studies, the
      possible long-term effects of behavior of early physical
      insult or pharmacological agents have received little
      attention. We present both circumstantial and direct evidence
      that circumcision of male infants leads to behavioral
      changes. In some American studies using circumcised infants,
      reported gender differences may instead be the result of the
      altered behavior of circumcised males. We suggest that
      circumcision requires more study in its own right and that it
      requires description if not control in all neonatal and
      infancy studies.</font></p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text2">From time to time a report appears in the
      literature on human development demonstrating that a "minor"
      stimulus event has consequences of such disproportionate
      magnitude and such temporal tenacity that it strains belief.
      An example of such a report was Whiting, Landauer, and
      Jones's (1968) suggestion that a single inoculation given
      before 2 yr of age produces taller adults than the same
      inoculation give after 2 yr. As adults and behavior
      scientists, we tend to view this and other reports with
      embarrassment if not disbelief.<font
      size="2"><sup>1</sup></font> How can a single, brief,
      innocuous event have such a profound and lasting
      experience?</p>

      <p class="text2">Given our license to do many things to
      infant animals that we may not do to human infants, the
      literature on animal development has a more extensive
      collection of such accounts which come from 2 sources. One
      source, inadvertently illuminating, is experimentation
      wherein treated animals are compared with sham-treated as
      well as untreated controls and where significant differences
      occur between the 2 control groups. The other source is the
      purposeful comparison of the size and duration of
      experimental treatments applied while the animal is
      biologically immature.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both types of studies contain communalities,
      complexities, and subleties that are instructive in
      considering analogous experimentation with human beings. As
      an example, consider an animal study finding that a drug
      administered during infancy has a demonstrable effect on
      adult behavior, physiology, or anatomy. As adults, the
      experimental group is different from the 2 control groups
      (vehicle-injected group and untreated noninjected group) and,
      moreover, the 2 control groups are different from each other.
      To what processes are those differences attributable? In this
      prototypical case several possibilities exist and are
      typically confounded:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a pharmacological
      agent may have contributed to the result, e.g., the drug
      under study, the vehicle in which it was injected, and any
      anesthetic agent used at the time of injection.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a physical insult
      may have contributed to the result, e.g., the hypodermic
      injection by which the drug was administered.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a change in
      nonsocial sensory input may have been contributory, e.g., a
      sudden drop in ambient temperature upon removal from the
      nest.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) a change in social
      stimulation may have been responsible for the effects, e.g.,
      a change in maternal behavior toward those young who were
      removed and subsequently returned to the nest.</p>

      <p class="text2">These possibilities are listed above in the
      order which, historically speaking, they have appeared
      obvious to animal experimenters. The first received earliest
      and most methodological attention whereas the last has
      attracted attention only relatively recently (Daly, 1973;
      Meier &amp; Schutzman, 1968; Richards, 1966).</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, for experimenters
      concerned with human development, the historical order of
      obviousness has been reversed. Studies of the later effects
      of early mother-infant separation have been accumulating in
      large quantity for over a quarter of a century, whereas
      studies of the long-term effects of early pharmacological
      intervention are of recent introduction and few in number.
      Effects on infant development of analgesic drugs given to
      mothers during labor have only recently been established
      (e.g., Brackbill, Kane, Manniello, &amp; Abramson, 1974).
      Some of these effects, including those on habituation
      measures, persist for at least 1 month - the oldest infants
      yet investigated (Aleksandrowicz &amp; Aleksandrowicz, 1974;
      Conway and Brackbill, 1970), whereas changes in social
      interaction measures have been found up to 60 weeks (M.P.M.
      Richards &amp; J.F.Bernal, unpublished data). Given the very
      rapid acceptance of concepts like deprivation and stimulation
      both by behavioral scientists and those responsible for
      making and administering social policies affecting children,
      that so little attention has been paid to what animal
      scientists are the more obvious sources of early influences
      on later behavior is indeed remarkable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Our purpose here is to examine the
      possiblity that 1 instance of the 2nd category of significant
      events, i.e. physical insult in the form of male
      circumcision, has both behavioral and physiological
      consequences that may have been uniformly misinterpreted by
      developmental scientists.</p>

      <p class="text2">The practice of circumcision varies widely
      throughout the world. In the United States, for example, it
      is so routine that no demographic statistics are kept on its
      incidence. Even the extensive data collection of the National
      Institute for Neurological Diseases and Stroke Collaborative
      Study did not include this statistic. The present authors had
      to inquire personally about the frequency of circumcision at
      18 American teaching hospitals. Replies indicated that 83% of
      the 14,116 male infants born during 1973 had been circumcised
      as neonates in the hospital. In the United Kingdom and much
      of Europe, where medical opinion holds that circumcision is
      unnecessary and potentially dangerous, it is rarely
      performed. In 1972 the Hospital Inpatient Inquiry for England
      and Wales (Department of Health and Social Security, 1974)
      showed that for a population of 400,000 male children under 1
      year of age, only .41% had been circumcised.<font
      size="2"><sup>2</sup></font> We may assume, therefore, that
      when male infants had been used in neonatal behavioral
      research most American subjects will have been circumcised;
      most European subjects will not have been. We note that those
      studies reporting gender differences in neonatal behavior
      (e.g. Korner, 1973) are American rather than European and
      suggest that some of the so-called gender differences may be
      the result of altered behavior following circumcision. We
      will first consider evidence that circumcision does influence
      neonatal behavior and then return to the more general issue
      of gender differences in neonatal behavior.</p>

      <p class="text2">We know of only 3 studies that directly
      attempt to examine the behavioral consequences of
      circumcision. All found significant effects. <a
      href="/library/birth/emde/">Emde, Harmon, Metcalf, Koenig and
      Wagonfeld</a> (1971) found that circumcision was followed by
      prolonged nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Not only was
      the amount of NREM increased, but the latency to onset on
      NREM sleep decreased and both the total number of NREM sleep
      periods and the number of very long NREM sleep periods
      increased. The authors conceptualized circumcision as a form
      of stress. More recently, <a
      href="/library/birth/anders/">Anders and Chalemian</a> (1974)
      also examined sleep after circumcision, find prolonged
      wakefulness with fussing and crying during the hours
      immediately after circumcision. They suggested that later
      NREM sleep shifts may be secondary to changes in wakefulness
      and also pointed out that the differing techniques used for
      circumcision (either acute incision or incision and ligature
      causing ischemic necrosis of the foreskin for several days)
      may have differential effects on behavior.</p>

      <p class="text2">Brackbill (in press) has investigated the
      effects of circumcision on responses to continuous auditory
      stimulation in 30 male neonates. Comparison groups were
      females and uncircumcised males. Arousal level, as indexed by
      heart rate (HR) and state, was measured under continuous
      auditory stimulation (white noise) during he experimental
      period and no added stimulation during the control period. No
      differences appeared between females and uncircumcised males
      during control or experimental periods for any of the state
      of HR measures used. However, when scores for females and
      uncircumcised males were compared to those for circumcised
      males, 7 of the 16 comparisions were significantly
      different.</p>

      <p class="text2">From the results of all 3 studies we may
      conclude that circumcision does have effects on infant
      behavior and psychophysiology. The direction of those effects
      and their duration await clarification. In view of all the
      evidence showing long-term behavioral, physiological,
      anatomical, and even neurophamacological effects of "minor"
      events in early animal development (e.g., Levine, 1969), we
      would be unwise to assume without empirical demonstration
      that the circumcision effects are short-lived.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gender Differences
      in Neonatal Behavior</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we remarked
      earlier, American studies have frequently reported newborn
      gender differences in, for example studies of sensory
      thresholds or sensitivity to sensory stimuli. The reports
      include findings of differential sensitivity to cutaneous
      stimuli (Bell &amp; Costello, 1964; Wolff, 1969),
      electrotactual stimulation (Lipsitt &amp; Levy, 1959), photic
      stimulation (Engel, Crowell, &amp; Nishijima, 1968), and to
      gustatory stimulation (Nisbett &amp; Gurwitz, 1970).</p>

      <p class="text2">British and Dutch studies of the newborn
      (e.g., Bench, 1969; Bench, Collyer, Langford, &amp; Toms,
      1972; Hutt, Lenard, &amp; Prechtl, 1969; Prechtl, 1972) did
      not find sex differences, provided that the sample had been
      screened to preclude babies from abnormal deliveries. (In
      unscreened samples, a greater proportion of males will have
      suffered from perinatal complications which may be associated
      with behavioral differences [see Pederson &amp; Bell, 1970].)
      As yet no study has appeared from Europe using measures of
      newborn sensitivity to cutaneous, electrotactual, or photic
      stimulation that are directly comparable to the measures used
      in American studies which report gender differences. Hence
      the possible contribution of the stressful effects of
      circumcision to these particular differences in threshold or
      sensitivity remains to be tested directly.</p>

      <p class="text2">Comparable evidence does not exist in
      studies of gestation. Nisbett and Gurwitz (1970) reported
      that female subjects had a greater preference for sweet
      substances than did male, presumably circumcised subjects. On
      the other hand no such gender differences were found in
      studies where uncircumcised males served as subjects (Desor,
      Maller, &amp; Turner, 1973; Dubignon, Campbell, Curtis, &amp;
      Parrington, 1969). (Information on circumcision was provided
      by D. Campbell &amp; J.A. Desor, personal communication.)</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Long-Term
      Consequences</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Even though short-lived neonatal gender
      differences (whether or not related to circumcision) could
      not affect the parent-child interaction and set up persistent
      styles of interchange differing for boys and girls. These, in
      turn, may have consequences for later development. Evidence
      exists from several American studies on differences in
      maternal handling of girls and boys in the early weeks of
      life (e.g., Lewis, 1972; Moss &amp; Robson, 1968; Thoman,
      Liederman, &amp; Olson, 1972), but comparable studies in
      England using similar categories of behavior yields very few
      gender differences (Bernal, 1972, 1973; Richards &amp;
      Bernal, 1972). Richards and Bernal studied a sample of 80
      infants from birth to school age. No male subject was
      circumcised. During the first 10 days of life, extensive
      observations were carried out in feeding situations.
      Information was also gathered on sleeping, crying, and
      feeding patterns. The results have been systematically
      searched for gender differences; no more have been found than
      would have occurred on the basis of chance alone. Similarly,
      gender differences at 60 weeks were minimal in number.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The extent to which
      circumcision does contribute to gender differences in
      behavior during the neonatal period, or subsequently,
      obviously demands detailed and focused study.</span> Most
      certainly, the published description of any sample using male
      neonates should indicate circumcision status. At present,
      with rare exception, this information does not appear in any
      account of subject characteristics.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The psychological literature is replete with
      reports of gender differences in many areas of behavior. In
      almost all cases where such differences have been described,
      nothing is known of their origin - the term remains
      descriptive. Many possible processes could be involved
      linking the particular pattern of behavior to the genotypic
      gender. If future research confirms that some neonatal
      "gender" differences are actually attributable to
      circumcision, we would, in these cases have an understanding
      of the outline of the process involved. In our culture,
      circumcision is selectively applied to infants of the male
      gender so that some differences in behavior stem from a
      cultural institution which results in differential physical
      treatment of the two genders. These gender differences would
      then belong to the general class of gender linked behavior
      that has its origin in culturally placed processes that
      produce particular developmental environments for infants of
      the 2 genders.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">We have reported here
      some direct and indirect evidence indicating that
      circumcision has an influence of unknown duration on the
      behavior and psychophysiology of male infants and we suggest
      that so-called neonatal "gender" differences may instead be
      circumcision differences.</span> The term "stress" has
      already been used in the literature to describe the
      psychophysiological impact of circumcision (<a
      href="/library/birth/emde/">Emde et al., 1971</a>). The
      animal literature warns us of the dangers of proposing any
      simple hypothesis linking adrenal physiology, neonatal
      behavior, and external events arbitrarily labelled
      "stressful". Nevertheless, indices of physical stress have
      been found in a proportion of human male newborns (Forsyth,
      1974).</p>

      <p class="text2">With the rise in obstetric and pediatric
      technology, young infants are increasingly subject to
      surgical treatments and pharmacological treatments either
      directly or indirectly via the mother. Existing animal
      research suggests that these treatments may have long-term
      physiological and behavior consequences for the young child.
      Unfortunately, interventions carried out under medical aegis
      have provoked little research or concern - especially by
      comparison with the behavioral scientist's long-standing
      interest in the effects of social and psychological factors.
      <span class="yellow">This is particularly worrisome in view
      of the evidence showing that the human brain is particularly
      vulnerable to exogenous and endogenous influences during the
      period of its maximum growth rate, from the latter part of
      pregnancy until approximately 18 months postnatal (Dobbing
      &amp; Sands, 1973).</span></p>
