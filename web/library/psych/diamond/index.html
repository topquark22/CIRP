    <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

    <p>This report is a long term follow-up to a "classic" case in
    the pediatric, psychiatry, and sexology literature. In this
    case an XY individual had his penis accidentally ablated and
    was subsequently raised as a female. The initial reports were
    that this individual was developing into a normally functioning
    female. The present findings show the individual did not accept
    this sex of rearing. At puberty this individual switched to
    living as a male and has successfully lived as such from that
    time to the present. The significant factors in this switch are
    presented. In instances of extensive penile damage to infants
    it is standard to recommend rearing the male as a female.
    Subsequent cases should, however, be managed in light of this
    new evidence.</p>

    <p><b>Text</b></p>

    <p>Among the more difficult decisions physicians have to make
    involve cases of ambiguous genitalia or significantly
    traumatized genitalia. The decision as to how to proceed
    typically follows the following contemporary advice: "The
    decision to raise the child as a male centers around the
    potential for the phallus to function adequately in later
    sexual relations (pp. 580)." 1 and "Because it is simpler to
    construct a vagina than a satisfactory penis, only the infant
    with a phallus of adequate size should be considered for a male
    gender assignment (pp. 1955)." 2 These management proposals
    depend upon a theory which basically says: "It is easier to
    make a good vagina than a good penis and since the identity of
    the child will reflect upbringing, and the absence of an
    adequate penis would be psychosexually devastating, fashion the
    perineum into a normal looking vulva and vagina and raise the
    individual as a girl." Such clinical advice, concerned
    primarily with surgical potentials, is relatively standard in
    medical texts 3-6 and reflects the current thinking of many
    pediatricians 7 .</p>

    <p>This management philosophy is based on two pediatric beliefs
    held strongly enough that they might be considered postulates:
    1) individuals are psychosexually neutral at birth, and 2)
    healthy psychosexual development is dependent upon the
    appearance of the genitals. These ideas arise most strongly
    from the original work of Money and colleagues. 8-12 The
    following are typical pronouncements from that research: "...
    erotic outlook and orientation is an autonomous psychological
    phenomenon independent of genes and hormones, and moreover, a
    permanent and ineradicable one as well (pp. 1397)." 9 ; "It is
    more reasonable to suppose simply that, like hermaphrodites,
    all the human race follow the same pattern, namely, of
    psychological undifferentiation at birth." 10 The first
    postulate was derived, not from normal individuals but from
    hermaphrodites and pseudohermaphrodites and the second
    postulate had only anecdotal support. Money no longer holds
    such extreme views 13 but his involvement in one particular
    case was significant enough that it became a totem in the lay
    press and a classic for the academic and medical community.
    And, as quoted above, the textbooks have not kept abreast of
    the new thinking.</p>

    <p><b>Report of a Patient:</b></p>

    <p>The case involved a set of normal XY twins, one of whom,
    John (pseudonym), at seven months of age had his penis
    accidentally burned to ablation during phimosis repair by
    cautery. 11 After a great deal of debate, the child was seen
    for consultation at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and, following
    the two postulates mentioned above, the recommendation was made
    to unequivocally raise the child as a girl, Joan (pseudonym).
    Orchiectomy and preliminary surgery to fashion a vagina
    followed within the year to facilitate feminization. Further
    surgery was to wait until Joan was older. This management was
    monitored and reinforced with yearly visits to Hopkins. The
    treatment was reported as developing successfully and that John
    was accepting life as Joan 11 .</p>

    <p>"Although this girl is not yet a woman, her record to date
    offers convincing evidence that the gender identity gate is
    open at birth for a normal child no less than for one born with
    unfinished sex organs or one who was prenataly over-or
    underexposed to androgen, and that it stays open at least for
    something over a year after birth (pp. 98)." 12</p>

    <p>"The girl's subsequent history proves how well all three of
    them [parents and child] succeeded in adjusting to that
    decision (pp. 95)." 12</p>

    <p>The effect of such reports were widespread for theory and
    practice. Sociology, psychology and women's study texts were
    rewritten to argue that, as Time magazine (Jan 8, 1973)
    reported: "This dramatic case . . . provides strong support . .
    . that conventional patterns of masculine and feminine behavior
    can be altered. It also casts doubt on the theory that major
    sex differences, psychological as well as anatomical, are
    immutably set by the genes at conception." Lay and social
    science writings still echo this case and so do medical texts.
    3- 6 , 14 The following quote is typical: "The choice of gender
    should be based on the infant's anatomy...Often it is wiser to
    rear a genetic male as a female. It is relatively easy to
    create a vagina if one is absent, but it is not possible to
    create a really satisfactory penis if the phallus is absent or
    rudimentary. Only those males with a phallus of adequate size
    which will respond to testosterone at adolescence should be
    considered for male rearing. Otherwise, the baby should be
    reared as a female." 15</p>

    <p>Our current report is in contrast to those reports and
    advice. It is based on a review of the medical clinical notes
    and impressions of therapists originally involved with the case
    and on contemporary interviews. One of us (H.K.S.) was the Head
    of the Psychiatry Department to which the case was referred in
    the patients home area. While the patient was assigned to the
    immediate care of female psychiatrists to foster female
    identification and role modeling, H.K.S. maintained direct
    supervisory control of the case. The unique character of this
    case attracted the attention of the British Broadcasting Co.
    and they invited M.D. as a consultant. 16 In 1994 and 1995, we
    collaboratively reinterviewed and recorded John, his mother and
    his wife to provide updated accounts of his progress. Findings
    are listed in general chronological order under the more
    appropriate of the two postulates for pediatric sexual
    assignment. John himself, while desiring to remain anonymous,
    strongly desires his case history be made available to the
    medical community to reduce the likelihood of others having his
    psychic trauma.</p>

    <p><b>Postulate 1: Individuals are psychosexually neutral at
    birth.</b></p>

    <p>Mother recalls: "As soon as he had the surgery, the doctor
    said I should now start treating him as a girl, doing girl
    things and putting him in girl's clothes. But that was a
    disaster. I put this beautiful little dress on him, . . . and
    he [immediately tried] to rip it off. . . I think he knew it
    was a dress and that it was for girls and he wasn't a
    girl."</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Joan could act quite feminine when she
    wanted to, and was reported as doing so, e.g. mother was quoted
    to have said: "One thing that really amazes me is that she is
    so feminine. I've never seen a little girl so neat and tidy as
    she can be when she wants to be. . . (pp. 119)." 11 However,
    she most often, would prefer to reject such behavior. It was
    also more common that she, much more than the twin brother,
    would mimic Father. One incident Mother related was typical:
    When the twins were about 4 or 5 they were watching their
    parents. Father was shaving and Mother applying makeup. Joan
    applied shaving cream and pretended to shave. When Joan was
    corrected and told to put on lipstick and makeup like Mother,
    Joan said: "No, I don't want no makeup, I want to shave."</p>

    <p>Girl's toys, clothes and activities were repeatedly
    proffered to Joan and most often rejected. Throughout childhood
    Joan preferred boy's activities and games to those of girl's;
    she had little interest in dolls, sewing or girl's activities.
    Ignoring the toys she was given, she would play with her
    brother's toys. She preferred to tinker with gadgets and tools
    and dress up in men's clothing; take things apart to see what
    makes them tick. She was regarded as a tomboy with an interest
    in playing soldier. Joan did not shun rough and tumble sports
    nor avoid fights.</p>

    <p>John recalls of Joan at the age of 12 or 13 wanting an
    umbrella: "I had a couple of bucks and went to the store to
    take a look at the umbrellas, and right beside the umbrellas
    was the toy section. I started to eyeball a machine gun. I said
    to myself 'Do I have enough money for that?'. . . I put the gun
    on the counter and asked the clerk if I had enough money. She
    had that look like 'You don't have enough but we'll let you go
    anyway.' I used it to play army with my brother". Brother often
    refused to let Joan play with his toys, so she also saved her
    allowance money and bought a truck of her own.</p>

    <p>Joan's realization that she was not a girl jelled between
    ages 9 and 11 years. John relates:</p>

    <p>"There were little things from early on. I began to see how
    different I felt and was, from what I was supposed to be. But I
    didn't know what it meant. I thought I was a freak or
    something; . . . I looked at myself and said I don't like this
    type of clothing, I don't like the types of toys I was always
    being given, I like hanging around with the guys and climbing
    trees and stuff like that and girls don't like any of that
    stuff. I looked in the mirror and sees my shoulders are so
    wide, I mean there is nothing feminine about me. I'm skinny,
    but other than that, nothing. But that is how I figured it out.
    [I figured I was a guy] but I didn't want to admit it, I
    figured I didn't want to wind up opening a can of worms."</p>

    <p>Joan knew she already had thoughts of suicide brought on by
    this sort of cognitive dissonance and didn't want additional
    stress. Joan fought both the boys as well as the girls who were
    always "razzing" her about her boy looks and her girl clothes.
    She had no friends; no one would play with her. "Every day I
    was picked on, every day I was teased, every day I was
    threatened. I said enough is enough . . ." Mother relates that
    Joan was good looking as a girl. But it was "When he started
    moving or talking, that gave him away and the awkwardness and
    incongruities became apparent."</p>

    <p>The other girls teased Joan so aggressively that she felt
    forceful retaliation was called for. One girl sat behind Joan
    and continued to hit her. "[John demonstrating] I grabbed her
    like that, by the shirt, and rammed her round the wall like
    this, threw her on the ground. . . until the teacher grabbed
    me." This resulted in Joan being expelled from school.</p>

    <p>Despite the absence of a penis, Joan often tried to stand to
    urinate. This made a mess as it was difficult to direct the
    urine stream. While she learned to sit and void she would
    nevertheless continue to occasionally stand and urinate.
    Despite admonitions against the behavior and the untidiness,
    Joan persisted to such an extent that, at school, she was
    caught standing to urinate in the girls' bathroom sufficiently
    often that the other girls refused to allow her entrance.
    Mother recalls the other girls threatening to "kill" her if she
    persisted. Joan would also go to the boy's lavatory to
    urinate.</p>

    <p>Joan was put on an estrogen regimen from the age of 12 years
    but rebelled against taking the hormones. They made her "feel
    funny" and she didn't want to feminize. She would often dispose
    of her daily dose. She unhappily developed breasts but wouldn't
    wear a bra. Things came to a head at the age of 14. In
    discussing her breast development with her endocrinologist she
    confessed "I suspected I was a boy since the second grade". The
    physician, who personally believed Joan should continue to take
    her estrogens and proceed as a girl, used that opening to
    explore in a nonjudgmental manner, the possible male or female
    paths available and what either one would mean. Since the local
    management team had already noticed Joan's preference for boys
    activities and refusal to accept female status and they had
    discussed among themselves the possibility of accepting Joan's
    change back to male, the endocrinologist explored Joan's
    options with her. Shortly thereafter, at age 14 years, Joan
    decided to switch to living as a male.</p>

    <p>Joan was the daily butt of her peer's jibes and the local
    therapists, having knowledge of her previous suicidal thoughts,
    went along with the idea of sex re-reassignment. In a tearful
    episode following John's prodding, his father told him of the
    history of what had transpired and why. John recalls: "All of a
    sudden everything clicked. For the first time things made sense
    and I understood who and what I was."</p>

    <p>John requested "male hormone" shots and gladly took these.
    He requested a mastectomy and phalloplasty The mastectomy was
    completed at the age of 14 years; surgeries for phallus
    construction were at age 15 and 16 years. After the surgical
    procedures, John adjusted well. As a boy he was relatively well
    accepted and popular with both boys and girls. At 16 years, to
    attract girls, John obtained a windowless van with a bed and
    bar. Girls, who as a group, had been teasing Joan, now began to
    have a crush on John. When occasions for sexual encounters
    arose, however, he was reluctant to move erotically. When he
    told one girl friend why he was hesitant&mdash;that he was
    insecure with his penis&mdash;she gossiped at school and this
    hurt John very much. Nevertheless, his peers quickly rallied
    round and he was accepted and the girl rejected.</p>

    <p>John's life subsequently was not unlike other boys with an
    occult physical handicap. Subsequent to his return to male
    living he felt his attitudes, behaviors and body were in
    concert; they weren't when living as a girl. At the age of 25
    he married a women several years his senior and adopted her
    children.</p>

    <p><b>Postulate 2: Healthy psychosexual development is
    intimately related to the appearance of the genitals.</b></p>

    <p>First in Baltimore, and then with the local therapists prior
    to the sex reassignment, Joan's expressed feelings of not being
    a girl would draw ridicule and she would be told something
    like: "All girls think such things when they are growing up".
    He recalls thinking: "You can't argue with a bunch of doctors
    in white coats; you're just a little kid and their minds are
    already made up. They didn't want to listen." To ease pressures
    to act as a girl, Joan would often not argue or fight the
    assignment and would "go along".</p>

    <p>Starting at age 7 years, Joan began to rebel at going for
    the consultations at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Her reason was
    discomfort and embarrassment with forced exposure of her
    genitals and constant attempts, particularly after the age of 8
    years, to convince her to behave more as a girl and accept
    further vaginal repair. This was always strongly resisted and
    led to recurrent confrontations. To encourage the visits and
    temper Joan's reluctance to travel to the consultants, they
    were combined with vacation trips.</p>

    <p>In Baltimore, the consultants enlisted male-to-female
    transsexuals to convince Joan of the advantages of being female
    and having a vagina constructed. She was so disturbing by this
    that in one instance Joan, at age 13 years, ran away from the
    hospital. She was found hiding on the roof of a nearby
    building. After age 14 years, Joan adamantly refused to return
    to the hospital. Joan then came instead fully under the care of
    local clinicians. This group consisted of several
    pediatricians, 2 pediatric surgeons, an endocrinologist, and a
    team of psychiatrists.</p>

    <p>John recalls thinking, from preschool through elementary
    school, physicians were more concerned with the appearance of
    Joan's genitals than was Joan. Her genitals were inspected at
    each visit to The Johns Hopkins Hospital.. She thought they
    were making a big issue out of nothing and they gave no reason
    to think otherwise. John recalls thinking: "Leave me be and
    then I'll be fine . . . Its bizarre. My genitals are not
    bothering me, I don't know why its bothering you guys so
    much."</p>

    <p>When asked what Joan thought of her genitals as a youngster,
    John replied "I didn't really have anything to compare myself
    against other than my brother when we were taking a bath."
    Mother confirmed that as a devout family in a very conservative
    religious community there would be few opportunities for the
    twins to have seen anyone else's genitals. Nudity was never
    acceptable. At their yearly visit to The JohnsHopkins Hospital
    the twins were made to stand naked for inspection by groups of
    clinicians and to inspect each other's genitalia. This
    experience, in itself, was recalled with strong negative
    emotions. John's brother, decades later, recalls the experience
    with tears.</p>

    <p>John recalls frustration, which remains, at not having his
    feelings and desires recognized. Without consideration of
    genitals, with the obvious absence of a penis, he nevertheless
    knew he was not a girl. When he tried to express such thoughts:
    the doctors "would change the subject whenever I tried to tell
    [doctor] how I felt. [He] didn't want to hear what I had to say
    but wanted to tell me how I should feel." Clinical notes from
    the time report he felt "like a trapped animal".</p>

    <p>In middle school Joan had a very difficult time making
    friends. Her clothes and demeanor, to her peers, did not jibe.
    Because of her behaviors they teased her with names like:
    "caveman" and "gorilla". Few children would play with her. None
    of Joan's peers knew anything of her genitals.</p>

    <p>At first the local physicians, as did Joan's parents,
    continued to reinforce her feminine identity as suggested by
    the consultants and continued to treat Joan as a girl preparing
    her for vaginal reconstructive surgery and life as a female.
    Psychotherapy, primarily by female therapists, aimed to
    reinforce her female identity and redirect her male ideation.
    This became increasingly difficult due to Joan's growing
    insistence she did not see herself as a girl and anger at being
    treated as one. John recalls: "They kept making me feel as if I
    was a freak."</p>

    <p>John knew what the clinicians wanted and recognized it
    wasn't what he wanted. Starting at age 14, against the
    recommendations of the clinicians and family, and without yet
    knowing of the original XY status, Joan, as much as possible,
    refused to live as a girl. Jeans and shirt, due to their gender
    neutral status, were her usual preferred clothes; boys games
    and pursuits her usual activities. Joan's daytime fantasies and
    night dreams during elementary school involved seeing herself
    "as this big guy, lots of muscles and a slick car and have all
    kinds of friends. . ." She aspired to be a mechanic. She
    rejected requests to look at pictures of nude females he was
    supposed to emulate. Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Tests
    at the time elicited responses more typical of a boy than a
    girl. Her adamant rejection of female living and her improved
    demeanor and disposition when acting as a boy, convinced the
    local therapists of the correctness of sexual
    re-reassignment.</p>

    <p>Following the surgery for penile construction there was
    difficulty with urethral closure and despite repeated attempts
    at repair, that problem was never rectified. John now urinates
    through a fistula at the base of his penis while sitting down.
    Much of the penis is without sensation as are the areas of
    scaring from where the grafts were taken.</p>

    <p>John's first sexual partner was a girl. He was 18 years old.
    While living as a girl and afterward as a boy, John was
    approached sexually by males. He claims never to have been
    attracted to any and his responses to such questions were
    matter-of-fact and not homophobic. John thinks his first
    recognizable sexual interest occurred about the age of 17 or 18
    years although he does recall wanting to go see the "sexy"
    Rockettes in New York on one of his trips to see the
    consultants.</p>

    <p>Coitus is "occasional" with his wife. This frequency is
    sufficient for his needs but is less than his wife would
    desire. They mostly pleasure each other with a great deal of
    physical affection and mutual masturbation. John can have
    coital orgasm with ejaculation.</p>

    <p>John recalls thinking it was small minded of others to think
    all his personality was summed up in the presence or absence of
    a penis. He expressed it thus: "Doctor . . . said, it's gonna
    be tough, you're going to be picked on, you're gonna be very
    alone, you're not gonna find anybody unless you have vaginal
    surgery and live as a female. And I thought to myself, you know
    I wasn't very old at the time but it dawned on me that these
    people gotta be pretty shallow if that's the only thing they
    think I've got going for me; that the only reason why people
    get married and have children and have a productive life is
    because of what they have between their legs." ... "If that's
    all they think of me, that they justify my worth by what I have
    between my legs, then I gotta be a complete loser."</p>

    <p><b>General comments:</b></p>

    <p>As an adult, John was asked "Why not accept being a female
    rather than fighting it?" His answer was simple. Basically he
    wanted to please his parents and placate the doctors so he
    often went along. But doing so didn't feel right and the
    confusion between his feelings and theirs he saw was mentally
    devastating and would lead to suicide if he were forced to
    continue. The most often voiced and deeply felt emotion
    expressed by Joan was always feeling different from what was
    expected or desired by others. At first, as a toddler, the
    feeling of being different was relatively amorphous. Then, even
    as a preschooler, it shifted to clearly being different from
    girls. And later, in elementary school, he began to not only
    feel different from girls but similar to the group called
    "boys". Certainly having a twin might have made this comparison
    much easier. Such a progression in thinking is common for
    atypical individuals such as homosexual males and females 17
    and hermaphroditic individuals or those with ambiguous
    genitalia 18 .</p>

    <p>The transition was gradual. When Joan thought she might
    really be a boy, instead of the girl her parents and the
    doctors told her she was, the psychic discord greatly
    frightened her even though she had suspected such was true
    since second grade. When finally told the truth, she was
    relieved since her feelings now made sense. John's anger at not
    being told the truth from the beginning persists.</p>

    <p>Following John's sex re-reassignment, the family decided to
    disregard the clinical recommendation to move from their family
    home. Instead they stayed and were open about the change. Aside
    from the financial concerns, the parents decided the word would
    get out anyway. This strategy seemed to work and John was
    accepted in a way that Joan never was.</p>

    <p>John was given testosterone following his return to male
    status. As is typical of many teen-age boys, John began to work
    out with weights. He blossomed into an attractive muscular
    young man.</p>

    <p>According to John's wife: "Before he came along I was a lot
    tougher on the kids because I had to be. [Now] John is the real
    hard one and I am the soft one. ... There is no doubt who wears
    the pants in this family."</p>

    <p>John is a mature and forward looking man with a keen sense
    of humor and balance. While still bitter over his experience,
    he philosophically accepts what happened and is trying to make
    the most of it with support from his wife, parents and family.
    He has job satisfaction and is generally self-assured.</p>

    <p><b>COMMENT</b></p>

    <p>Long term follow-ups of case reports are unusual but often
    crucial. This up-date to a case originally accepted as a
    "classic" in fields ranging from medicine to the humanities
    completely reverses the conclusions and theory behind the
    original reports. Cases of infant sex reassignment require
    inspection and review after puberty; 5 and even 10 year post
    sex reassignment follow-ups are still insufficient.</p>

    <p>Possibly the initial impressions of the consultants 11, 12
    were appropriate at the time and Joan's behavior shifted with
    development. However, it appears from clinical notes and
    impressions of the local physician's at the time, and John's
    contemporary recollections, that at no time was he fully
    accepting the sex reassignment as a girl. Indeed, the local
    physicians expressed their reservations early on 16 . When it
    became obvious, however, that the original management program
    of maintaining this male as a girl was no longer tenable and
    proving psychologically damaging&mdash;even life
    threatening&mdash;they revised their thinking.</p>

    <p>It is also possible that interpretations from the early
    years were mistaken since it is often difficult to see results
    not in keeping with one's hypotheses and management plans.
    Behavioral manifestations of typical boy behaviors would thus
    repeatedly be interpreted as tomboyish. This was true
    regardless if this was in terms of preferred activities, games,
    toys or clothing. Significantly, the conclusions that
    hermaphrodites and pseudohermaphrodites offer a model for
    normal development had been challenged before. 19-24 The
    implications of such challenges does not seem to have been
    accepted or integrated by the majority of pediatricians or
    surgeons. 7</p>

    <p>John was repeatedly admonished for behaving like a boy. Such
    management is in keeping with the belief 25-28 , that any
    acquiescence to doubt expressed by the patient would decrease
    the likelihood of an eventual successful outcome. It is
    circular reasoning to contend that Joan did not accept the
    imposed sex of rearing because of ambiguity in treatment. There
    is no evidence of such and the initial reports held that the
    rearing was appropriate 11, 12 . It is known, particularly from
    transsexuals, that casting doubt as to sexual identity usually
    forces greater introspection and security regarding a preferred
    life's direction even though counter to upbringing, parent's
    wishes, social and cultural norms and may result in less than
    adequate genitalia. 29, 30</p>

    <p>In the case under consideration, the initial management
    protocol was predicated on postulates which saw successful
    treatment involving attention to a male's self-image supposedly
    dependent upon the adequacy of a functional penis. While it can
    be accepted that such adequacy is important there is no body of
    data establishing its centrality.</p>

    <p>Other considerations are in order. Gender reassignment as
    proposed for John, and the postulates upon which they are
    based, assume the individual will learn to accept
    rearing-appropriate sex-typical behaviors, particularly when
    the genitals are at issue. These situations range from the
    urinary to erotic to narcissistic. Such behaviors, while
    important, are only one aspect of an individual's total
    sexuality. An individual's sexual profile is comprised of at
    least five levels: gender Patterns, Reproduction, sexual
    Identity, Mechanisms and sexual Orientation (PRIMO). 31, 32</p>

    <p>The sex reassignment of John to Joan only attended to the
    gender patterns, and gender roles to which he would be subject
    with the expectations his identity and other levels would
    follow. Joan did indeed become aware of the social expectations
    concomitant with the female gender but these were not in
    keeping with those with which he felt comfortable. Standing to
    urinate, despite its housekeeping and social consequences is a
    dramatic display of preference. The sex reassignment thus
    obviously failed in the area in which it was most designed to
    succeed.</p>

    <p>But it failed in the other four levels as well. The contrast
    between the female gender-typical behaviors the child was being
    asked to accept and his inner directed behavior preferences
    presented a discordance that demanded resolution. Joan's
    analysis of the situation was that she best fit in, not as a
    girl but as a boy. Thus, despite her upbringing, Joan's sexual
    identity developed as a male. Sex reassignment also obviously
    went against Joan's or John's reproductive character.
    Castration removed any reproductive capacity. Certainly unaware
    of this as a child, John very much resents this now and decries
    this loss. Castration also removed the androgen source for
    sex-typical mechanisms of sexual arousal and other
    physiological processes. His ability to ejaculate returned with
    androgen treatment. The castration and surgical scaring,
    however, has dramatically reduced erotic sensitivity to the
    perineum and subsequently reduced this option. And
    significantly, as many studies strongly indicate, sexual
    orientation is prenataly organized or at least predisposed.
    33-40 The sex reassignment did nothing to effect sexual
    orientation. Joan remained totally gynecophilic despite being
    reared as a girl.</p>

    <p>Comments from John's parents reveals another important
    consideration. With a sex reassignment they are asked to make a
    dramatic psychological adjustment in how to rear an otherwise
    normal child. Mother herself required psychiatric treatment to
    help manage her feelings in this regard. The penile ablation,
    not withstanding, they were more comfortable dealing with their
    child's original sex and the accident than with a reassigned
    sex. Although they had definitely tried to make a success of
    the original sex reassignment, they were very supportive
    &mdash;while guilt ridden&mdash;of Joan's reversion to
    John.</p>

    <p>This last decade has offered much support for a biological
    substrate for sexual behavior. In addition to the genetic
    research mentioned above there are many neurological and other
    reports which point in this direction. 31,32, 41-56 The
    evidence seems overwhelming that normal humans are not
    psychosexually neutral at birth but are, in keeping with their
    mammalian heritage, predisposed and biased to interact with the
    environment, familial and social forces, in a male or female
    mode. This "classic" case demonstrates this dramatically. And
    the fact that this was particularly expressed at
    puberty&mdash;a critical period&mdash;is logical and has been
    predicted.<sup>20, 44</sup></p>

    <p>Although this report is of the classic case of sex
    reassignment so often cited in the literature, follow-ups to
    other related cases are available. Reilly and Woodhouse 57 ,
    described 20 patients with micropenis reared as boys and none
    having any doubt as to the correctness of assignment as males.
    And many reports exist where, despite the absence of a normal
    penis 19, 32, 58-62 , males were originally reassigned as
    girls, that switched back, and successfully lived as males.
    Several of these cases offer the same sorts of findings
    presented by us; with great similarity at the ages at which
    various milestones were passed, feelings developed and their
    reassignment challenged 59, 60 A most recent case illustrates
    this.</p>

    <p>Reiner 63 reported on an adolescent Hmong immigrant who
    precipitously dropped out of school at 14 years of age. Upon
    subsequent interview she declared, although having been
    unequivocally raised as a girl from birth "I am not a girl, I
    am a boy". Indeed, physical examination revealed a 46
    chromosome, XY male with mixed gonadal dysgenesis with a female
    appearing pelvis with clitoral hypertrophy. All her school-age
    friends had been boys. She enjoyed rough and tumble play,
    avoided dolls and girls activities and would dress in a
    gender-neutral or boys way. Her feelings of being different
    &mdash;being a boy&mdash;developed from about the age of 8 and
    came to a head at 14 years. Treatment involved surgery and
    endocrine therapy. This individual, after a period of some
    depression, progressively developed into a gynecophilic
    sexually active male.</p>

    <p>These cases of successful gender change, as well as the
    present one, also challenge the belief that such a switch after
    the age of 2 years will be devastating. Indeed, in these cases
    it was salutary.</p>

    <p>It must be acknowledged that cases of males accepting life
    as females after the descruction of their penises has been
    reported 64 These reports, however, do not detail the
    individuals' sexual or personal lives.</p>

    <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

    <p>Considering this case follow-up, and as far as an extensive
    literature review can attest, there is no known case where a 46
    chromosome, XY male, unequivocally so at birth, has ever easily
    and fully accepted an imposed life as an androphilic female
    regardless of the physical and medical intervention. True,
    surgical reconstruction of traumatized male or ambiguous
    genitalia to that of a female, and attendant sex reassignment
    of males is mechanically easier than constructing a penis but
    there might be an unacceptable psychic price to pay.
    Concomitantly there is no support for the postulates that
    individuals are psychosexually neutral at birth or that healthy
    psychosexual development is dependent upon the appearance of
    the genitals. Certainly long term follow up on other cases is
    needed.</p>

    <p>In the interim, however, new guidelines are offered. We
    believe that any 46-chromosome, XY individual born with a
    normal nervous system, in keeping with the psychosexual bias
    thus prenataly imposed, should be raised up as a male. Surgery
    to repair any genital problem, while difficult, should be
    conducted in keeping with this paradigm. This decision is not
    simple 7, 13, 18, 63, 65-67 and analysis should continue.</p>

    <p>As parents will still want their children to be and look
    normal as soon after birth as possible, physicians will have to
    provide the best advice and care, consistent with present
    knowledge. We suggest this means referring the parents and
    child to appropriate and periodic long term counseling rather
    than immediate surgery and sex reassignment just because that
    seems a simpler immediate solution to a complicated problem.
    With this management, a male's predisposition to act as a boy
    and his actual behaviors will be reinforced in daily
    interactions on all sexual levels and his fertility preserved.
    Social difficulties may reveal themselves as puberty is
    experienced, however, there is no evidence that with proper
    counseling and surgical repair when best indicated, an
    adjustment will not be managed as teen-agers manage other
    severe handicaps. Future reports will determine if we are
    correct.</p>
