      <h2>Children have feelings too</h2>

      <p class="text1">As a child psychiatrist, one of my missions
      in life has been to teach medical students that <span
      class="yellow">children have feelings.</span> A simple point,
      which as part of my job I have also had to remind paediatric
      colleagues about at times. Why then, was I so shocked by my
      own son's response to surgery?</p>

      <p class="text1">Last year at the age of 7, my younger son
      had to have a circumcision. We had not taken the decision
      lightly, but he had had several local infections as a result
      of not being able to retract his foreskin. Fortunately, when
      we explained what was needed, he responded well. After some
      initial anxiety he took matters into his own hands, and came
      back from school one day with a list of those boys who had
      had the "special" operation. This seemed to reassure him
      enormously.</p>

      <p class="text1">The staff at the local hospital were
      excellent. Apart from embarrassment at having to wear a
      backless theatre gown, the preoperative preparation went
      well. The hospital had a power cut just as we were going to
      theatre, but contingency plans were quickly put in place.
      Once there, the anaesthetist delivered an obviously well
      rehearsed line about drinking a glass of milk in a special
      way. He showed him the milky fluid in the syringe, and
      managed to change his story quickly and convincingly in
      response to the immediate retort, "But I don't like
      milk."</p>

      <p class="text1">After surgery, my son woke up abruptly. I
      told him that he had had his operation and he gently lifted
      the covers and peered downwards. "Have they killed my
      willie?" he asked. "They have, they've killed it." I was
      shocked and hastily tried to reassure him even though my own
      brief glance had taken me aback too. His penis was, of
      course, very swollen and bloody. I managed to remember that
      he had also had a penile block and may well have been feeling
      that his organ was dead.</p>

      <p class="text1">As the local anaesthesia wore off, he
      experienced pain which was helped by paracetamol. However,
      the magic syrup did not serve to modify his <span
      class="yellow">indignation and outrage</span> about what had
      happened. For several days (as the parent at home and looking
      after him) I was subjected to tirades about nurses and
      doctors and how wicked they were. (Did he mean me too?)
      "They're just there to torture children, to hurt them, and
      make them cry. They're evil." He seemed clear that he was
      "never ever going to that hospital again." He refused to
      drink so that he did not have to pee. I tried hard not to get
      into a battle about this, but of course ended up using
      bribery as an alternate strategy.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">At times, he literally
      roared with rage.</span> This was interspersed with more
      quiet reflective periods when I would catch him staring down
      at his penis with tears in his eyes. Thankfully at other
      times he seemed lost in the world of video entertainment. He
      took pleasure in commanding me to bring him snacks composed
      of various delicacies, including pepperamis (a long standing
      favourite), which had to be arranged to his satisfaction on
      the plate before serving. I told a colleague who telephoned
      that I was being put through an emotional wringer.</p>

      <p class="text1">Worse was yet to come. On the third day it
      became obvious that he had a wound infection. I telephoned
      the surgery and asked for a home visit. The receptionist
      passed me on to the general practitioner, who gave me a hard
      time, even though I explained that he was ill, and even if he
      were not that I would not be able to get him to put on pants
      or trousers. He agreed to come but when he arrived saw fit to
      lecture me further. I was close to tears and could not fight
      back even though I wanted to and was annoyed at myself for
      not doing so. He dismissed my claim that my son had been
      pyrexial the night before, but seemed to mellow as he looked
      at his penis and agreed that he did have an infection. As
      well as prescribing antibiotics, he told me that I would have
      to deslough the wound regularly. <span
      class="yellow">Adhesions under the foreskin meant that the
      wound consisted of not just the sutured area, but also most
      of the glans.</span> During the following few days I spent
      hours painstakingly softening and removing the detritus with
      a cotton bud, thankfully to good effect.</p>

      <p class="text1">When the general practitioner referred us
      back to the hospital on the sixth day my heart sank. How
      would I get this child who was so full of loathing for the
      staff to go back there to see them? Surprisingly easily as it
      happened. My son has always been a very contained little boy
      outside of our home. Even though he gives us a very hard time
      about not wanting to go to school, for example, he is a model
      pupil, and as it turned out, even though he put me through
      hell at home, he was a model patient when we returned to the
      outpatient department. Our visit marked the abating of his
      fury and the beginning of his recovery. His penis now looks
      beautiful, and works effectively too. He had a brief period
      practising peeing up the bathroom wall but since then all has
      been well.</p>

      <p class="text1">Children react in different ways to illness
      and loss. I felt under attack during the period of my son's
      recovery from a minor operation and was left in no doubt that
      the experience had had a profound effect on him. I am not
      sure that general practitioners or hospital professionals
      appreciate what parents have to do in these situations. Those
      whose children have longer term illness or need repeated
      surgery have to cope with far more than I did and need our
      affirmation and support in order to do so.</p>
