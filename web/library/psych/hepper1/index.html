          <p align="justify">Whether fetal memory exists has
          attracted interest for many thousands of years. The
          following review draws on recent experimental evidence to
          consider two questions: does the fetus have a memory? And
          if so, what functions(s) does it serve? Evidence from
          fetal learning paradigms of classical conditioning,
          habituation and exposure learning reveal that the fetus
          does have a memory. Possible functions discussed are:
          practice, recognition of and attachment to the mother,
          promotion of breastfeeding, and language acquisition. It
          is concluded that the fetus does possess a memory but
          that more attention to the functions of fetal memory will
          guide future studies of fetal memories abilities. &#127;

      <p align="justify">Memory is something we all take for
      granted. It is difficult to imagine functioning in the world
      without a memory. The effects of Alzheimer's disease (<a
      href="#n1">1,2</a>), or reports of people with brain lesions
      that affect specific aspects of memory (<a
      href="#n3">3-5</a>) all vividly illustrate the crucial role
      that memory plays in our lives. For example, our ability to
      learn, retain information for short- or long-term periods,
      recognise individuals, objects, and to recall previous events
      or learning experiences, all depend on memory. For many
      years, it was thought the newborn infant did not possess a
      functioning memory, but rather memory developed over the
      months and years following birth. Study of newborns, and
      premature infants (<a href="#n6">6,7</a>), in recent years,
      however, has changed this view. Newborns have been shown, via
      a variety of learning paradigms, habituation (<a
      href="#n8">8,9</a>), classical conditioning (<a
      href="#n10">10,11</a>), associative learning (<a
      href="#n12">12,13</a>) and imitation (<a
      href="#n14">14,15</a>), to possess a functioning memory.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
      would be entirely possible that the memory abilities start at
      the moment of birth. Some event during the birth process
      triggers, along with other changes required for life outside
      the womb, activity in the central nervous system and hence
      memory begins. However this is unlikely (<a
      href="#n16">16</a>). It is more likely that memory begins
      prenatally and the period of birth merely marks a transition
      from memory functioning <i>in utero</i> to memory functioning
      <i>ex utero</i>. This is not to suggest that memory when it
      begins to function is capable of all the feats of an adult's
      memory. Rather memory, at its developmental origin in the
      prenatal period probably functions in some rudimentary form
      and develops, both quantitatively and qualitatively, as the
      individual matures.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      the aim of this review to discuss memory <i>in utero</i>. It
      is not intended to comprehensively review all studies in the
      area but rather illustrate salient points and issues. Two
      general areas will be considered. First, is there evidence of
      memory before birth? And second, if memory exists, does it
      have a function(s)?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Is their evidence of memory in
      utero?</font></p>

      <p align="justify">Just as studies exploring memory in the
      newborn infant have used learning paradigms, similar
      paradigms have been applied to the fetus to explore its
      memory. Paradigms of "exposure learning", classical
      conditioning and habituation have been used to examine fetal
      learning and fetal memory.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Studies of classical conditioning of the fetus, although few,
      have a long history, dating back to the 1930s. Ray (<a
      href="#n17">17</a>) paired a vibration (the CS) with a loud
      noise (the UCS). Although using only a single subject and
      reporting no data, Ray concludes the subject suffered "no ill
      effects from her prenatal education"(p.177), suggesting the
      fetus was successfully conditioned. Using a similar procedure
      Spelt (<a href="#n18">18</a>) paired a vibration (the CS)
      with a loud noise (the UCS). He reported that after 15-20
      pairings, most fetuses, in the last 2 months of gestation,
      responded to the vibration (CS) alone. More recently Feijoo
      (<a href="#n19">19,20</a>) paired maternal relaxation (the
      UCS) with music (the CS) and examined individuals as fetuses
      and after birth. After 24 pairings of the stimuli, when the
      music was played to the fetus in the last weeks of pregnancy,
      individuals began moving and when played to the new-born,
      these babies stopped crying, opened their eyes and exhibited
      fewer clonic movements.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Recently I have replicated Spelt's study (<a
      href="#n18">18</a>). I used a pure tone as the CS and a
      vibro-acoustic stimulus as the UCS. Fetuses were aged between
      32 and 39 weeks of gestation at the time of testing.
      Approximately 50% of the fetuses (10/19) showed successful
      conditioning after 10-20 trials. Successful conditioning was
      unrelated to gestational age, or sex. It remains to be
      determined exactly why some fetuses exhibit conditioning and
      others do not.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To
      date the earliest observations of successful classical
      conditioning are in fetuses at 32 weeks of gestation (<a
      href="#n18">18</a>, pers. obs.). However, it must be noted
      that attempting to determine the first appearance of
      particular fetal abilities is problematical (<a
      href="#n21">21</a>). Whilst successful classical conditioning
      (or other paradigms) may indicate, if properly conducted, the
      existence of memory. Poor paradigms, inappropriate stimuli,
      or response measures may all contribute to unsuccessful
      conditioning rather than the absence of memory. Hence
      descriptions of the earliest occurrence of behaviours must be
      treated cautiously.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
      of the most successful paradigms used to explore newborn
      memory and perceptual abilities has been that of habituation.
      Habituation can be defined as the decrement in response to
      stimuli following repeated presentation of the same stimulus
      (<a href="#n22">22</a>). Whilst the majority of habituation
      studies in newborn infants have used visual stimuli, studies
      examining habituation in the fetus have used auditory
      stimuli. This preference is largely due to the ease of
      presenting auditory stimuli to the fetus and the difficulty
      of presenting visual stimuli. Despite many reported studies
      of habituation in the fetus, poor experimental paradigms in
      many of these reduce their usefulness in elucidating
      underlying memory processes (<a href="#n23">23</a>).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      However, the fetus has been demonstrated to habituate to
      auditory stimuli. For example (<a href="#n24">24</a>) using
      movement as the response, fetuses at 36 weeks of gestation
      were shown to habituate to a 250 Hz pure tone; to respond
      again, to the presentation of a novel stimulus, a 500 Hz tone
      and following repeated presentation of this tone to
      habituate, finally on re-presentation of this tone to
      habituate; finally on re-presentation of the original tone,
      250 Hz, the fetus initially responded (dishabituated) but
      then habituated quickly, faster than on its original
      presentation. Habituation of heart-rate response has also
      been demonstrated (e.g. <a href="#n25">25,26</a>).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      earliest habituation response has been demonstrated at 22-23
      weeks of gestational age and seems to occur earlier in
      females than in males (<a href="#n27">27</a>). Interestingly,
      the onset of auditory habituation corresponds to the onset of
      fetal auditory abilities (<a href="#n28">28</a>). It may be
      that habituation is present earlier than this however as the
      fetus is unable to respond to auditory stimuli before this
      time, habituation to auditory stimuli is unable to be
      evidenced earlier than 22 weeks gestation. Stimulation using
      other sensory modalities, e.g. olfaction/taste, whih are
      functional at earlier gestational ages (<a
      href="#n16">16,21</a>), may reveal habituation at even
      earlier gestational ages.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      final paradigm used to investigate fetal learning and memory
      is that of "exposure" learning. This paradigm has the
      potential to be a powerful tool in the exploitation of fetal
      memory abilities given the control available to the
      experimenter over the presentation of the stimulus and
      subsequent testing.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
      study looked at the ability of the fetus to learn a TV theme
      tune, "Neighbours", frequently heard by the mother during her
      pregnancy (<a href="#n29">29,30</a>). In the first experiment
      newborn infants (2-4 days of age) of mothers who watched
      Neighbours during pregnancy (and heard the theme tune) became
      alert stopped moving and their heart rate decreased
      (orienting) upon hearing the tune. These same individuals
      showed no such reaction to other, unfamiliar tunes. Newborns
      of mothers who did not watch the TV programme during
      pregnancy showed no reaction to the tune. There was no
      exposure to the TV tune after birth, the last exposure
      occurring before birth. Hence individuals must have learned
      the information about the tune prenatally and retained it 2-4
      days until tested postnatally. A second experiment examined
      when learning and memory could first be evidenced before
      birth. Individuals were observed using ultrasound and their
      response to the theme tune noted. Individuals exposed to the
      theme tune showed a significant increase in movements at 37
      weeks of gestation but not at 30 weeks of gestation. Fetuses
      not previously exposed to the tune showed no response at
      either age. This suggests that the ability to recognise
      familiar stimuli commences between 30 and 37 weeks of
      gestation (although see comments above). A third experiment
      looked at the duration of this memory by examining the
      response of individuals, prenatally exposed to the tune, 21
      days after birth. Whilst the previous study showed newborns
      at 2-4 days of age "recognized" the tune there was no
      response when individuals were tested at 21 days of age. This
      may indicate that any recognition of memory is lost by 21 day
      of age in the absence of any postnatal exposure. Despite
      making inroads into the development of fetal memory much
      remains unanswered. Exactly how this memory is acquired,
      simple exposure leading to recognition or some form of
      classical conditioning, is unknown. Similarly, prenatal
      exposure to stimuli in this study was relatively uncontrolled
      thus exactly how much exposure to establish a preference is
      yet to be determined. The study does indicate that the fetus
      is able to learn and remember familiar auditory stimuli in
      the womb, retain this information over the birth period and
      that this learning is specific to the familiar stimulus.
      Other studies have confirmed the ability of the fetus to
      learn familiar audtory stimuli in utero (<a
      href="#n31">31,32</a>)</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      above studies, using different paradigms, have all
      demonstrated successful learning and the presence of memory
      abilities in the fetus. The use of identical paradigms as
      used in newborns, infants and adults may suggest identical
      memory processes are used in solving these tasks. However
      great care must be exercised here. Similar learning abilities
      have been observed in a variety of fetal animal, including
      invertebrates (<a href="#n33">33-37</a>). Similar behavioural
      demonstrations of memory need not necessarily indicate
      similar memory processes or underlying neural mediation, or
      even continuity with the later memory processes of the
      individual.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Function(s) of fetal memory.</font></p>

      <p align="justify">One important question that has frequently
      been overlooked is the study of fetal memory is what
      function(s) does it serve? The function(s) of fetal memory
      are of central importance. A better understanding of fetal
      memory function may enable researchers to design more
      appropriate paradigms to investigate memory in utero. Whilst
      there is much that is unknown about the development of fetal
      behavior, and much more to be found out in the future, one
      things that I can be sure of is that fetal memory does not
      exist to enable the fetus to learn about TV theme tunes!</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      therefore important to consider the potential function(s)
      memory <i>in utero</i> may serve. There is little direct
      evidence to support the following speculations at present but
      they form a useful guide for future investigations of fetal
      memory.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be that fetal
      memory serves no function. Memory has to start at sometime. A
      time probably determined by the maturational status of the
      central nervous system. If the central nervous system
      develops to the extent required to sustain or support memory
      function prenatally, then memory will also start
      prenatally.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fetal
      memory may serve a "practice function". There is much
      evidence of other behaviours starting before the time they
      are needed. Fetal breathing is one example of this. These
      movements beginning at 10-11 weeks of gestation (<a
      href="#n38">38</a>), are similar to those exhibited after
      birth to enable breathing (<a href="#n39">39</a>). Yet there
      is no air in the womb. A similar example is presented by eye
      movements; coordinated eye movements occur in the womb in the
      absence of all but the most limited visual stimuli (<a
      href="#n40">40</a>). It has been considered that behaviours
      that are crucial to a certain stage of development are
      practiced prior to this time to ensure they functioned
      efficiently when needed. Such interpretations have often been
      considered only with respect to behaviours serving direct
      physiological need, e.g. breathing. The same however may hold
      true for psychological functions.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Memory is essential for normal functioning and it is not too
      surprising that such an important psychological function is
      "practiced" before birth in some form. It has been
      well-established that the structure of the central nervous
      system is partly under the control of activity within the
      system (<a href="#n41">41-44</a>). It may well be that
      activity generated within the central nervous system from the
      fetus's use of memory also exerts an influence on the
      structural development of those parts of the CNS involved in
      memory.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fetal
      memory may serve a number of specific functions, dependent
      upon the learning of particular stimuli prenatally.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Prenatal memory may be important for the development of
      attachment and other maternal recognition. There is much
      evidence that the fetus learns the speech characteristics of
      its mother prenatally and prefers its mother's voice to other
      female voices after birth (<a href="#n12">12,13</a>, <a
      href="#n45">45-47</a>). It may be that by learning to
      recognise its mother prenatally the newborn infant has a
      "familiar" stimulus in its environment after birth to respond
      to. As well as enabling recognition of the mother this may
      also mark the beginnings of attachment. It should be noted
      that it is unlikely that the newborn recognizes this familiar
      stimulus as its mother, but rather a familiar auditory
      stimulus. However this prenatal priming may ensure and
      promote both the recognition of the individual's mother and
      the development of attachment. Although further evidence is
      required it may be that the individual learns about its
      mother's smell prenatally (<a href="#n48">48</a>) and this
      too would similarly promote maternal recognition and
      attachment.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      memory in utero may be important for the establishment of
      breast feeding. The mother's diet flavours both the amniotic
      fluid and her breast milk (<a href="#n49">49-51</a>). The
      fetus may learn about the flavour of the amniotic fluid via
      its swallowing of this fluid which begins at 12 weeks of
      gestation (<a href="#n38">38</a>). When presented to the
      breast for the first time, the newborn recognises the
      colostrums as familiar due to the presence of the same tastes
      that have been present in the amniotic fluid. This may
      enhance the individual's willingness to suck and promote
      breast feeding. It should be noted that in today's society,
      alternatives to breast milk are readily available and infants
      who do not breast feed can be readily supplied with
      alternatives. However, in evolutionary terms when the
      mother-newborn system was evolving, any newborn which failed
      to feed would die due to lack of food. In such an environment
      it may be expected that conditions would be established to
      ensure the infant did breastfeed. Prenatal familiarisation
      with the taste of milk would contribute to ensuring
      breastfeeding was successfully established. Recent evidence
      suggests the fetus can learn tastes experienced only
      prenatally (<a href="#n52">52</a>) and through such learning
      acquires a preference for these tastes (<a
      href="#n53">53</a>). Furthermore, preliminary observations at
      my lab indicate those mothers who experience the greatest
      change in diet between before and after birth have the
      greatest difficulty in establishing breastfeeding.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
      final area where fetal memory may be important, is in the
      acquisition of language. I have noted above the ability of
      the fetus to learn its mother's voice (<a href="#n12">12,
      13</a>, <a href="#n45">45-47</a>). Recordings the fetal
      uterine auditory environment, reveal the prosodic nature of
      speech can be clearly heard inside the womb (<a
      href="#n54">54, 55</a>). Further, the fetus has been shown to
      be able to differentiate between different speech sounds in
      the womb (<a href="#n54">54, 55</a>). Further, the fetus has
      been shown to be able to differentiate between different
      speech sounds in the womb (<a href="#n56">56-58</a>).
      Newborns also seem to have a preference for their mothers'
      native language (<a href="#n59">59</a>). It may be that
      experience of speech prenatally begins the process of
      acquiring language.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></p>

      <p align="justify">Thus there are a number of possible
      reasons why the fetus should have a functioning memory, not
      perhaps of the complexity of the adult or even infant, but
      sufficient to ease its progress in its new world after birth.
      Further studies are required to examine whether these
      proposed functions, or indeed others, do actually exist. They
      may also serve to direct future research into fetal memory,
