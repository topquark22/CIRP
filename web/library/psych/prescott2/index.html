      <h2>Genital Pain vs. Genital Pleasure:<br />
       Why the One and Not the Other?</h2>
      <i>by James W. Prescott</i>
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genital mutilations of
      both males and females have been a common practice in many
      cultures and have existed from the earliest days of recorded
      history. These excruciating painful procedures have been
      inflicted upon newborns and adolescents for a variety of
      reasons. Religious beliefs and social-cultural customs,
      particularly "rites of passage ceremonies" have been
      historically the primary reasons for both male and female
      genital mutilations. Only recently has one form of genital
      mutilation, male circumcision, come under a different rubric
      of justification, i.e., modern medicine.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      a major thesis of this presentation that male circumcision is
      not primarily a medical issue but rather has its roots in
      deeply held religious beliefs and social customs that defy
      rational and humane understanding. The devastating practices
      and consequences of female genital mutilation that have been
      so well documented by Fran Hoskin provides a context for
      understanding the religious forces of toleration and support
      for male genital mutilations, i.e., circumcision. Why is it
      that certain elements of the medical profession can offer
      support for male genital mutilation (circumcision) but not
      female genital mutilation that is so widespread in other
      cultures of the world?</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
      why have the medical professions, until very recently,
      ignored and denied the extraordinary and excruciating pain
      that the newborn experiences when part of its skin (the
      foreskin) is shredded and cut from the rest of its body?</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>This indifference
      to human pain and suffering of the circumcised newborn is not
      confined to the medical profession</i></b> but is widespread
      throughout many cultures, particularly where other forms of
      male and female genital mutilations are practiced. In this
      psychologist's opinion, all forms of genital mutilation that
      are inflicted upon unconsenting children are de facto acts of
      torture and mutilation which are in violation of <i>Article 5
      of the United Nations <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a></i> which states that <b>"no one shall be
      subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading
      treatment or punishment."</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      position statement has been unanimously approved as a
      resolution by the General Assembly of this Conference.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      my conviction that the acts of newborn and adolescent torture
      and mutilation which occurs in ritual male and female genital
      mutilations must be understood within the broader context of
      human torture, mutilation and violence against the human body
      which is pandemic throughout the world. The key to
      understanding this pain and violence is to be found in
      understanding its converse, i.e., pleasure and peace where
      physical pleasures of the body, particularly sexual
      pleasures, are considered inherently dangerous by many
      fundamentalist/orthodox religious traditions which they
      believe threatens the salvation of the soul and society.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      understanding of the reciprocal relationship between pain and
      pleasure; our tolerance and support for the torture and
      mutilation of the human body and intolerance for the physical
      pleasures of the body involves profound issues of moral
      philosophy of good and evil, of the moral theology of pain
      and pleasure; and how these moral value systems become
      encoded in the developing human brain and thus, behaviors
      which includes the social-moral values and ideologies of
      human culture. In brief, it is my contention that the
      ultimate resolution of the circumcision issue and other forms
      of male/female genital mutilations will involve primarily the
      ethical, moral and neuropsychological issues involved in
      torture and mutilation and less in the presumptive medical
      and social benefits of genital mutilations.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
      proceeding with a summary of the religious, philosophical and
      scientific data in support of this thesis, I would like to
      comment very briefly on two medical studies that purport to
      provide statistical medical evidence for the practice of
      circumcision and which raises serious ethical/moral issues
      when findings from presumptive pathological groups are
      generalized to healthy groups to justify surgical procedures
      on healthy groups in the guise of &nbsp; "preventive
      medicine."</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
      is the study of Dr. William Cameron of the University of
      Manitoba where it was reported in a sample of 292 men who had
      patronized prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya that 20% of
      uncircumcised men became infected with AIDS virus, whereas
      only 3% of circumcised men became infected with the AIDS
      virus. It was also reported that 85% of the prostitutes were
      infected with the AIDS virus. Some have suggested that
      circumcision may offer a degree of prevention against the
      AIDS virus.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that
      circumcision vs. non-circumcision, and not other variables,
      can account for this difference, <b><i>how can the grossly
      negligent and irresponsible sexual behaviors and poor
      personal hygiene practices of OTHERS be used to justify the
      genital mutilation of the INNOCENT?</i></b> Another example
      of the misuse of statistical inference from medical data is
      provided by the studies of Dr. Thomas Wiswell.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one
      of Dr. Wiswell's studies where he evaluated the incidence of
      Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in 422,238 boys born to Army
      families, he found a ten-fold increase in UTIs in
      uncircumcised vs. circumcised boys. The increase was 1.1% vs.
      .11% respectively, where one third of the 1.1% later
      developed serious medical complications. This finding of 1.1%
      and/or the .034% serious medical complications in
      uncircumcised newborns is now being used to justify the
      routine genital mutilation of 99% of healthy male newborns
      who do not develop UTIs. Since female infants were found to
      have 0.57% incidence of UTI which is 50% of the uncircumcised
      males (1.1%), it is clear that there are other variables
      unrelated to circumcision that contribute to UTIs. I will
      leave to other investigators the exploration of these other
      uncontrolled variables that contribute to UTIs.</p>

      <h3>Early Sensory Influences Upon Brain Development and
      Behavior</h3>

      <p align="justify">There is a well established body of
      scientific data that documents the role of sensory
      stimulation and deprivation upon brain development and
      emotional-social, psychological and mental development. From
      the perspective of the developmental neuropsychological
      sciences, there can be little question that the extraordinary
      pain experienced by newborns, children and adolescents who
      are subjected to ritual genital mutilations has a profound
      influence upon the brain and later behaviors. It is this
      writer's conviction that the extraordinary pain and trauma
      experienced through genital mutilations--an organ and brain
      system that is designed for the experience of sexual pleasure
      and the expression of sexual love--has permanently altered
      normative brain development for the normal expression of
      sexual pleasure and love. <i><b>It is proposed that this
      genital pain has long-term developmental consequences for the
      ability of such individuals to differentiate pain from
      pleasures in love relationships and to develop intimate
      sexual relationships.</b></i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      not without psychobiological consequence that the brain
      system which is designed for the experience of pleasure and
      the expression of sexual love is first encoded with
      extraordinary and excruciating pain. In such individuals, all
      subsequent acts or experiences of genital pleasure are
      experienced upon a background of genital pain that is now
      deeply buried in the subconscious/unconscious brain.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>It is this
      developmental neuropsychologist's conviction that these early
      experiences of genital pain contribute to the encoding of the
      brain for sado-masochistic behaviors.</b></i> The brain
      system that has been designed for pleasure has first and
      foremost become saturated or encoded with pain that now
      limits and qualifies all subsequent experiences of pleasure.
      When these early experiences of genital pain are followed by
      a developmental deprivation of physical affectional pleasure
      in the maternal-infant relationship and in the adolescent
      sexual relationship, then violent destructive behaviors are
      the inevitable outcome.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally significant, is
      the prediction that the cumulative consequences of
      <b><i>these developmental experiences of genital pain and
      affectional deprivation precludes the possibility of
      realizing the spiritual dimensions of human
      sexuality.</i></b> These relationships have been discussed
      elsewhere and need not be repeated here. Suffice it to note
      that it has been possible to predict with 100% accuracy the
      torture, mutilation and killing of enemy captured in warfare
      in 49 primitive cultures from the two variables of
      deprivation of physical affection in the maternal-infant
      relationship and in the adolescent sexual relationship; and
      that brain dysfunction underlies this SAD (Somatosensory
      Affectional Deprivation) induced violent behaviors.

      issue of <i>The Truth Seeker</i>)</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of
      the most recent studies is particularly germane to this these
      was reported by Jacobsen et al., in Acta Psychiatr. Scand.
      (2987:76-364-371) entitled <a
      href="/library/psych/jacobsen1/"><i>Perinatal Origin of Adult
      Self-Destructive Behavior</i></a>. The summary of this study
      is provided by the abstract which reads as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><i>The study was undertaken to test
          whether obstetric procedures are of importance for
          eventual adult behavior of the newborn, as ecological
          data from the United States seem to indicate. Birth
          record data were gathered for 412 forensic victims
          comprising suicides, alcoholics and drug addicts born in
          Stockholm after 1940, and who died there in 1978-1984.
          The births of the victims were unevenly distributed among
          six hospitals. Comparison with 2,901 controls, and mutual
          comparison of categories, showed that suicides involving
          asphyxiation were closely associated with asphyxia at
          birth, suicides by violent mechanical means were
          associated with mechanical birth trauma and drug addition
          was associated with opiate and/or barbiturate
          administration to mothers during labor. Irrespective of
          the mechanism transferring the birth trauma to
          adulthood---which might be analogous to imprinting---the
          results show that obstetric procedures should be
          carefully evaluated and possibly modified to prevent
          eventual self-destructive behavior.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">Specifically, the authors reported that a
      perinatal event of Asphyxia (a lack of oxygen) carried a risk
      factor for suicides from hanging, strangulation, drowning and
      gas poisoning that was <b><i>five times greater than for
      controls</i></b>; for perinatal mechanical trauma, e.g.,
      breech presentations, forceps delivery and multiple nuchal
      loops, the risk factor for suicides from hanging and other
      mechanical injuries was <b><i>twice as great as
      controls</i></b>; for perinatal events of opiate/barbiturate
      use the risk factor for drug addition was approximately
      <b><i>three times greater than the controls</i></b>.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an
      earlier study of 52 adolescent suicides, <a
      href="/library/psych/salk1/">Salk, et al.</a>, (1985)
      reported three prenatal/perinatal risk factors that
      significantly discriminated the suicide group from the two
      matched non-suicide control groups. These were: 1)
      respiratory distress for more than one hour at birth; 2) no
      antenatal care before 20 weeks of pregnancy; and 3) chronic
      disease of the mother during pregnancy which were found in
      81% of the suicide cases. These authors were quite uncertain
      as to the mechanisms by which prenatal/perinatal birth trauma
      were linked to suicidal behaviors.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David
      Levy in a 1945 study on the "Psychic Trauma of Operations in
      Children" reported on three cases of male circumcisions at
      ages 12 months (2 cases) and 6 1/2 years. Psychological
      trauma included the development of night terrors, temper
      tantrums and rage. In the 6 1/2 year old, suicidal impulses
      developed. Levy reports:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><i>"...a circumcision at the age of 6
          years 7 months was preceded by a struggle of the patient
          with his father and the anesthetist before they
          overpowered him. Immediately after the anesthesia wore
          off, he said over and over, 'They cut my penis. I wish I
          were dead.' The rest of the day, the patient never left
          his mother's side. Thereafter his previous temper
          tantrums developed into destructive rages. During the
          treatment he played numerous killing games, in which his
          father was the principal victim. The operation
          represented a castration by his father."</i> (p. 10).</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions must be raised
      as to the extent to which rage and suicidal behaviors are
      engendered by the assaults of circumcision whether conducted
      during the newborn or child/prepubertal periods. (There are
      approximately a third more suicides than homicides in the
      U.S.). Is there a link between circumcision and the
      willingness to kill oneself or others for one's
      religious/national beliefs, particularly when circumcision
      occurs at the age of puberty, as it does in the Muslim
      culture? The willingness of many Muslim men to die or kill
      for their religious beliefs is well known, e.g. the cases of
      Salman Rushdie and Sirhan Sirhan may be representative
      here.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
      href="/library/psych/jacobsen1/">Jacobsen, et al.</a>, (1987)
      noted in their study that hypoxia during birth might cause
      minimal brain damage that could result in destructive
      behaviors. However, these authors questioned whether
      neurological injuries due to hypoxia could be the main
      factor, "since altogether rather few victims suffered from
      asphyxia during birth. None of the 86 suicides from poisoning
      by solid or liquid substance and none of the 53 alcoholics
      were reported to have been asphyxial."</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
      are several points to be made concerning these two studies.
      First, Faro and Windle (1969) in their experimental asphyxal
      studies in monkeys documented both immediate and delayed
      brain damage by as much as 10 years in these monkeys. In
      short, there is a delayed "time bomb" of brain damage that
      occurs long after the initial injury or insult. It would
      appear that later stages of brain development are dependent
      upon earlier stages of brain development which must be normal
      if later stages of development are to be normal. Secondly,
      there are a variety of traumas/injuries that can simulate or
      mimic asphyxial effects.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
      example, sensory deprivation (like asphyxia) can damage the
      sensory receptors and sensory pathways of the brain.
      <i><b>This neuronal damage from sensory deprivation prevents
      normal sensory stimulation of the brain which is essential
      for normal brain development and function. This is why the
      experiencing of sensory pleasure--physical affection and
      sexual pleasure--is essential for normative brain
      development, function and behavior.</b></i></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      effects of sensory deprivation or altered and abnormal
      sensory environments upon brain development and behavior are
      well documented. This is a mechanism which I will now focus
      upon since it is my conviction that a variety of early
      traumatic events of pain, derivation and stress, including
      asphyxia, damage the affectional neuronal systems of the
      brain. It is this damage that compromises or prevents the
      development of affectional bonds of pleasure since these
      brain systems for pleasure have been damaged by these early
      insults and injuries. This thesis constitutes the
      neuropsychological foundation of my SAD (Somatosensory
      Affectional Deprivation) theory of alienation, depression,
      addictive and violent behaviors.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      for these reasons, that SAD is proposed to be the process or
      mechanism which can account for the linkage between
      prenatal/perinatal trauma and suicides that have been
      reported by <a href="/library/psych/salk1/">Salk, et al.</a>,
      and by <a href="/library/psych/jacobsen1/">Jacobsen, et
      al</a>.</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
      Somatosensory Affectional Deprivation (SAD) theory is based
      on the nature of brain processes where I has been well
      established that activation of the pleasure circuits of the
      brain inhibit the activity of the violence circuits of the
      brain. This normative reciprocal relationship ceases to
      function when the neuronal circuits of the brain that mediate
      pleasure are insufficiently developed---a form of brain
      dysfunction/damage---due to sensory deprivation of physical
      affectional pleasure, specifically, somesthetic (touch) and
      vestibular (movement sensory stimulation. Gentle touch and
      rocking of the infant are powerful sensory stimuli for
      pleasure, comfort and a sense of "basic trust" for the
      infant/child. When these sensory stimuli are absent and, in
      addition, are replaced by painful sensory stimulation, then
      the neurobiological foundations for depressive, addictive and
      violent behaviors are established.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      brief, the emotional pain of affectional deprivation (the
      failure of love in the maternal-infant and parent-child
      relationships, and in our sexual relationships) seeks relief
      through drugs, alcohol and violence---in the rage of our
      physical assaults against others; beatings, rape, homicide
      and suicide---one of the leading mental health problems of
      our children and youth. <i><b>Why should our children and
      youth be committing suicide in such great numbers--a 112%
      increase from 1980 to 1985 for children aged 10 to 14
      years?</b></i> Does genital mutilation and sexual abuse in
      combination with SAD facilitate suicidal and assaultive
      behaviors?</p>

      <p align="justify">A further correlate to the above
      relationships and why certain postnatal traumas are tolerated
      (e.g., genital mutilations) is to be found in our cultural
      mores that places a high moral value on pain, suffering,
      deprivation; and immorality upon the physical pleasures of
      the body. It is for these reasons that the pain of genital
      mutilation is tolerated and supported and why the pleasure of
      genital stimulation is forbidden--with all the developmental
      neuropsychological and moral consequences that such events
      have upon the individual and culture.</p>

      p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now review the real
      reasons for circumcision as given by certain moral traditions
      and the anti-pleasure ethic that is endemic to many religious
      traditions that support the pain/pleasure reciprocity
      principal and provides the linkage to violent
      behaviors.<br />
      <br />
       

      <h3>PHILOSOPHICAL/RELIGIOUS BASES FOR GENITAL
      MUTILATIONS</h3>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      well recognized that circumcision in the Jewish religious
      tradition represents a covenant with God (See Gerald Larue's
      <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/second/larue.html">article</a>
      in this issue). It is less well recognized that the
      diminution of sexual pleasure is another major reason for
      circumcision in the Jewish religious tradition. This reason
      is clearly stated by Moses Maimonides in the <i><a
      href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">Guide of the
      Perplexed</a></i> (1190) which merits its full
      reproduction:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <center>
            <h4>ON CIRCUMCISION</h4>
          </center>

          <p align="justify"><i>"As regards circumcision, I think
          that one of its objects is to limit sexual intercourse,
          and to weaken the organ of generation as far as possible,
          and thus cause man to be moderate. Some people believe
          that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's
          formation; but every one can easily reply: How can
          products of nature be deficient so as to require external
          completion, especially as the use of the foreskin to that
          organ is evident. <b>This commandment has not been
          enjoined as a complement to a deficient physical
          creation, but as a means for perfecting man's moral
          shortcomings. The bodily injury caused to that organ is
          exactly that which is desired;</b> it does not interrupt
          any vital function, nor dies it destroy the power of
          generation. <b>Circumcision simply counteracts excessive
          lust; for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the
          powerful sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the
          natural enjoyment;</b> the organ necessarily becomes weak
          when it loses blood and is deprived of its covering from
          the beginning. Our Sages say distinctly: It is hard for a
          woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse,
          to separate from him. This is, as I believe, the best
          reason for the commandment concerning
          circumcision."</i>(Part III, Chapter 49)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere in the Jewish
      religious tradition clear warnings are given concerning the
      dangers of sexual pleasure. The following quotes are taken
      from the <i><b>Code of Jewish Law</b></i>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <h5>Chapter 150</h5>

          <p><b>The Sin of Discharging Semen in Vain</b></p>

          <p align="justify"><b>1:</b> <i>It is forbidden to
          discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any
          other mentioned in the Torah. Those who practice
          masturbation and cause the issue of semen in vain, not
          only do they commit a grave sin, but they are under a
          ban, concerning who it is said (Issiah 1:15): "Your hands
          are full of blood," and it is equivalent to killing a
          person. SE what Rashi wrote concerning Er and Onan in the
          <b>Sidrah of Vayeshev</b> (Genesis 37), that both Er and
          Onan died for the commission of this sin. Occasionally,
          as a punishment for this sin, children die when young,
          God forbid, or grow up to be delinquent, while the sinner
          himself is reduced to poverty.</i></p>

          <center>
            <h5>Chapter 151</h5>
          </center>
          <b>Laws of Chastity</b> 

          <p align="justify"><b>17.</b> <i>Semen is the vitality of
          man's body and the light of his eyes, and when it issues
          in abundance, the body weakens and life is shortened. He
          who indulges in having intercourse, ages quickly, his
          strength ebbs, his eyes grow dim, his breath becomes
          foul, the hair of his head, eyelashes and brows fall out,
          the hair of his bear, armpits and feet increase, his
          teeth fall out, and many other aches besides these befall
          him. Great physicians said that one out of a thousand
          dies from other diseases, while nine hundred and
          ninety-nine die from sexual indulgence. Therefore, a man
          should exercise self-restraint.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Roman Catholic Church is equally affirmative on the moral
      dangers of masturbation whose only purpose is sexual
      pleasure. In the Vatican's "Declaration on Sexual Ethics,"
      published by the <b>Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of
      the Faith</b> (December 29, 1975), formerly the Holy Office
      of the Inquisition, the following is stated:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <center>
            <b>On Masturbation</b>
          </center>

          <p align="justify"><b>9.</b> <i>The traditional Catholic
          doctrine that masturbation constitutes a grave moral
          disorder is often called into doubt or expressly denied
          today. It is said that psychology and sociology show that
          it is a normal phenomenon of sexual development,
          especially among the young... This opinion is
          contradictory to the teaching and pastoral practice of
          the Catholic Church. Whatever the force of certain
          arguments of a biological and philosophical nature, which
          have sometimes been used by theologians, in fact both the
          Magisterium of the Church--in the course of a constant
          tradition--and the moral sense of the faithful have
          declared without hesitation that masturbation is an
          intrinsically and seriously disordered act.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, the Roman
      Catholic church affirms the moral value of pain and suffering
      in The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola (the
      founder of the Society of Jesus):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><i>"The third kind of penance is to
          chastise the body, that is to inflict sensible pain on
          it. This is done by wearing hair shirts, cords, or iron
          chains on the body, or by scourging our wounding oneself,
          and by other kinds of austerities"</i> (1541).</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
      other examples could be cited, the most significant of which
      is the <i>Crucifixion</i> itself. God the Father's Divine
      Plan of Incarnation for his son: "So the Word was made
      flesh;" (John 1:14); and "I did not come of my own will; it
      was He who sent me" (John 8:42) was a plan for the
      mutilation, torture and murder of His only-begotten Son on
      the cross (euphemistically called "sacrificed") --- for the
      ulterior motive of human salvation! The ultimate
      psychopathology of this event is equating this mutilation,
      torture and murder with LOVE! Clearly Christian Love is as
      much an expression of pain and suffering as pleasure. <b>It
      is this fusion of pain and suffering with love that forms one
      of the roots of sado-masochism which is so prevalent in
      monotheistic and patristic cultures.</b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given
      the violence that this Father inflicted upon the Son He loved
      (and others), is it so surprising to find so much violence of
      other Fathers inflicted upon their sons (and daughters)? If
      "Man" is made "Unto the Image and Likeness of God", then the
      violence of "Man", becomes more understandable. Remember, it
      is this same God the Father that demanded the torture of
      helpless male newborns through the ritual mutilation of their
      genitals, called circumcision -- a practice that continues
      today in many monotheistic cultures.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
      was pain and violence and not pleasure and peace selected as
      the primary path for establishing the "bond" between God and
      Man and for human salvation? In all His Wisdom, Power and
      "Love" could He not have found a different solution to the
      enigma of human "salvation"? The answers to these questions
      lie elsewhere.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      should be recognized that the roots of the morality of pain
      and suffering and the immorality of physical sensual/sexual
      pleasure antedate the Crucifixion and the rise of monotheism.
      These basic concepts existed in parallel civilizations where,
      for example, the ancient Greek philosophers provided a clear
      metaphysical theory of good and evil that was directly
      related to a moral theology of pain and pleasure.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek Metaphysical
      Dualism provided the following equations:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>MATTER</b> = Body, Evil, Wickedness, Darkness,
          Chaos = <b>FEMALE;</b><br />
           <b>FORM</b> = Soul, Goodness, Godlike, Lightness, Order
          = <b>MALE.</b></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Pythagoras (c.
      582-c.507 B.C.) who provided the sex fender equivalents of
      maleness with goodness; and femaleness with evil:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <i>"There is a good principle which has created order,
          light and man; and a bad principle which has created
          chaos, darkness and woman."</i>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given
      this information is it so surprising to find the following in
      <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> (25:33): <b>From the woman came the
      beginning of sin, and by her we all die</b>." And in Paul,
      <i>I Corinthians</i> (7:1): "<i>Now concerning the things
      whereof you wrote me: It is good for a man not to touch a
      woman</i>." Many other examples could be mentioned that are
      too numerous to cite which reflect this absurd and more
      erroneous dualistic moral theory of human nature, gender and
      behavior.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Maimonides has perhaps provided the clearest exposition of
      these metaphysical/moral/gender relationships in <i>The Guide
      of the Perplexed</i> (when the word "matter" occurs think
      "female," when the word "form" occurs think "Male"):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><i>"All bodies subject to generation
          and corruption are attained by corruption only because of
          their matter; with regard to form and with respect to the
          latter's essence, they are not attained by corruption,
          but are permanent...Similarly every living being dies and
          bwecomes ill solely because of its matter and not because
          of its form. All man's acts of disobedience and sin are
          consequent upon his matter and not upon his form, whereas
          all his virtues are consequent upon his
          form...consequnetly it was necessary that man's very
          noble form, which as we have explained is the <b>image of
          God and His likeness</b>, should be bound to earthy,
          turbid and dark matter, which calls down upon man every
          imperfection and corruption; He granted it -- I mean the
          human form -- power, dominion, rule, and control over
          matter, in order that it subjugate it, quell its
          impulses, and bring it back to the best and most
          harmonious state that is possible (III:8, pp.
          430-432).</i> (Part III, Chapter 8)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is now more
      clear how philosophical and theological moral dualism has
      conspired against the human body, particularly the female
      body and the sensual/sexual pleasures that they represent.
      This moral dualism of Western Civilization which subordinate
      female to male; assures the continuing inequality of woman to
      man and supports the violence of man against woman and her
      children. (Reich, 1971).</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      fundamentalist/orthodox morality of Western Civilization
      requires that the sensual/sexual pleasures of the body must
      be extremely limited if not destroyed to achieve "salvation
      of the soul" (re, the "virtues" of celibacy, virginity and
      chastity). What better place to begin that with the
      mutilation and destruction of the genitals which are designed
      to experience sensual pleasure and share sexual love?</p>

      <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>It is not without
      reason the the monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity,
      Islam) have carried their religions on the edge of the sword
      -- the same sword that cuts the genitals of children (male
      and female): and which mutilates their souls.</i></b></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
      clear to this writer that, before genital mutilations of our
      children can cease, before male violence against children can
      end, and before human violence can be eliminated, a moral
      revolution must take place. Pain must be declared immoral and
      pleasure must be declared morally necessary, If we are to
      become moral persons. In the words of Walt Whitman:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <center>
            <i><b>IF ANYTHING IS SACRED,<br />
             THE HUMAN BODY IS SACRED."</b></i>
          </center>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="justify">
      <i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the
      dualistic/theistic moral foundations of Western Civilization
      must be transformed if human equality, compassion, justice
      and love are to be realized; and if the human species is to
      survive.</b></i></p>
