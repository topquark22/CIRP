        <h2>TRAUMA IN CHILDHOOD</h2>

        <h3>Signs and Sequelae as Seen in the Analysis<br />
         of an Adolescent</h3>

        <h3>HANSI KENNEDY, Dip. Psych.</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Peter's analysis lasted for six years and
      started at the age of 13. Early traumatic and disturbing
      events played a striking part in his pathology and were
      vividly reexperienced in treatment. This short paper
      describes some of these reenactments and gives reasons why
      the experiences from which they derived might properly be
      described as "traumatic."</p>

      <p class="text2">In spite of Peter's long and in many ways
      successful analysis, he remained a rather depressed young
      man, dominated by pervasive feelings of inadequacy which he
      tried to escape by sexual activities. During treatment, his
      compulsive masturbation, accompanied by sadomasochistic
      fantasies and his tendency to enactment, increasingly forced
      me to think of his disturbance in terms of sexual
      perversion.</p>

      <p class="text2">During his masturbatory practices, he needed
      to create, simultaneously or in quick succession, sexual
      excitement, pain, and anxiety. He masturbated from early
      childhood, but in adolescence he enhanced his orgastic
      pleasure by tying a plastic bag over his head. In this way
      his fantasy was that a female partner was castrating and
      suffocating him was give an added dimension of reality.</p>

      <p class="text2">A connection can readily be made between
      these sexual fantasies and practices and experiences in his
      third year of life, when he suffered intermittently from
      painful infections of the penis. These involved the mother in
      repeated examinations and manipulations of his genitals.
      <span class="yellow">Phimosis eventually required
      circumcision at 2 years, 8 months.</span> His mother stayed
      with him in the hospital but could only report his bad
      reaction to anesthetic. In analysis Peter claimed to have
      memory of mother driving him to hospital for the operation,
      but this memory lacked any affective coloring.</p>

      <p class="text2">There can be no doubt from Peter's analytic
      material that these events were crucial in the formation of
      his psychopathology and that, at least retroactively, they
      were experienced as vengeful attacks and punishments by his
      mother. By the time he entered analysis, his masturbatory
      conflicts were firmly linked with his feelings about his
      damaged penis and the conviction that he was an inadequate
      person in every respect. This narcissistic vulnerability and
      depleted self-esteem had, of course, earlier roots.</p>

      <p class="text2">Peter was a disappointment to his mother
      from the day he was born. She was an inexperienced, anxious,
      rigid mother who was quite unable to cope with an infant
      whose behavior failed to match her exact expectations. The
      pregnancy proceeded according to plan until Peter arrived 12
      days too early and had to be extracted by forceps. He cried a
      great deal during the first few months, which upset his
      parents' regimental household and lifestyle. He did not feed
      according to his mother's schedule, and her worry about his
      poor weight gain and slow physical growth led her to "force
      food into him." She probably became even less responsive to
      Peter's needs when she became pregnant, for a second time
      when he was only eight months old. All these circumstances
      reflect an unsatisfactory early interaction between mother
      and child, and the inadequate and curtailed symbiotic phase
      formed the core of Peter's disturbed self and object
      relationship.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the second year of life, Peter's
      interaction with mother was dominated by what she described
      as "their great battle over toilet training." A battle which
      started when she was only 1 year old went on until well into
      this third year of life. when daytime bladder control was
      finally achieved. Contributory factors to this long delay
      included a stressful 2-week separation from mother and home
      at the time of the brothers birth, and the onset, some months
      later, of the phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mother's narcissistic hurt and guilt in
      relation to Peter's imperfections may well have been
      compensated by her pleasure and pride in the new baby who
      seemed to thrive both physically and psychologically. Both
      parents described this younger brother as more satisfactory
      in every way. Not surprisingly, Peter's development began to
      lag, and according to his mother, his younger brother talked
      before he did. Irrespective of the accuracy of this
      information, it does suggest that Peter could not express his
      feelings in words at the time of the circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The unfavorable comparison with began on the
      day his brother was born became a bane of Peter's life. He
      felt that his brother was not only better loved but was
      superior in every respect. Two years before his referral for
      treatment, which was obstensibly was for learning
      disabilities in spite of his good intelligence (IQ 120+),
      Peter had suffered the ultimate humiliation of this younger
      brothers advance to a class above him at school.</p>

      <p class="text2">He envied but also idealized this brother,
      casting him in the role of a genius - a second Einstein -
      whom he could never emulate. His revengeful hatred of the
      brother, an ever recurring theme in this analysis, was
      understood as a displacement of feelings he harbored for his
      mother for producing the brother and for favoring him. Later
      in treatment this also appeared as an oedipal displacement
      from the father who "possessed' the mother.</p>

      <p class="text2">I have discussed the transference
      developments in Peter's analysis (1980). They led to a very
      clever recasting of his psychology in terms of double
      identification with the clever Jews who were nevertheless
      discriminated against and circumcised, and with the powerful,
      sadistic, get morally despicable Nazis. This expressed both
      the ambivalent investment of self and object relationship. It
      provided immense opportunities not only for the development
      of the analytic process, but also for resistance and
      stagnation in the analytic work when he used the treatment to
      gratify his sadomasochism. Even the most careful monitoring
      of countertransference cannot prevent a sadomasochistic
      patient from exploiting the analytic situation for perverse
      gratification. At all times Peter worked hard to get himself
      into a state of sexual excitement which served to ward off
      his depressive feeling states.</p>

      <p class="text2">I hope this brief overview will provide
      sufficient background to give perspective to the analytic
      material which follows. <span class="yellow">This is
      unavoidably selective but I hope it indicates the
      significance of Peter's experiences around the phimosis and
      circumcision.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Both anxiety and guilt helped to make Peter
      a secretive boy, who, throughout the first year of analysis,
      deliberately withheld and distorted material. But at the
      beginning of treatment the anxiety was so pervasive that he
      could hardly communicate verbally. When he talked at all, his
      speech was difficult to understand and he was reduced to
      muttering under his breath such comments as "What is going to
      happen?" or "I haven't told you anything about my sins." I
      felt at the time that he was reacting to analytic situation
      as if it represented the Day of Judgement. In retrospect it
      is not difficult to see that the intimacy of the analytic
      setting, of being alone in the room with a woman who was
      immediately cast in the role of dangerous castrator, was both
      terrifying and seductive. Affectively, it seemed to have
      revived the traumatic childhood experiences in the most
      dramatic way.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the early weeks of treatment he would
      silently draw maps of the London Underground system and
      respond to any comment I made by blotting them out. He would
      do so with such ferocity that big holes were all that were
      left on paper. This, while my attempts to establish contact
      through verbalization always mobilized fears that I might
      discover what he was deliberately trying to keep hidden, his
      sexual preoccupations were betrayed by his actions and
      concomitant affect.</p>

      <p class="text2">Intense anxiety about his damaged penis was
      evident from the way he treated the felt-pens he used for
      drawing. He often handled them roughly and the anxiously
      looked at the tips for damage.</p>

      <p class="text2">As if to underline his derisive rejection of
      my cautious and carefully worded interpretations, he also
      rejected my felt-pens and brought his own from home. This led
      to a strange enactment of the third week of treatment. He
      selected a red pen and found that the protective cap was
      stuck so he could not use it. He began to push and pull the
      cap with a mounting excitement and anxiety. Once or twice he
      held it out to me, apparently to elicit my participation, but
      then mistrustfully withdrew it. His face was flushed and his
      hands were covered with red paint. when he finally succeeded
      in pulling off the cape He anxiously inspected the tip,
      hitherto protected to see if it was damaged; and he
      disparagingly declared that his mother would jolly well have
      to provide a new one. While this material opened up the
      analytic work on his masturbation conflicts, and his view of
      the mother as responsible for his damaged penis, the full
      significance of this enactment in terms of his childhood
      experiences when his penis was sore and he had difficulty in
      urinating was recognized only some months later in connection
      with another, more dramatic, enactment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Following his brother's visit home from
      boarding school (week 36) we had an unusually good session.
      For once Peter seemed in touch with his unhappiness and was
      able to talk about anger and resentment with his parents for
      being interested only in his brother. He complained that the
      whole weekend was spent in praise of his brothers good
      examination results and is making plans for his brother's
      future privileged education. He had experienced all this as a
      deliberate humiliation and reproach from his parents and
      throughout the weekend had felt an unwanted outsider in his
      own family. I had commented on the long-standing nature of
      such feelings and how they had contributed to his pervasively
      low self-esteem. Peter replied that the brother was the cause
      of his trouble and that he wished him dead or, better still,
      that he had never been born. Right at the start of this
      session it emerged that the weekend had also been the
      celebration of the brother's birthday.</p>

      <p class="text2">He arrived the next day in a completely
      different state of mind. He was regressed; his communications
      were again non-verbal; his nose was blocked by an attack of
      hayfever, and he was desperate about the discomfort. He
      considered phoning his mother for advice, but reproachfully
      demanded instead that I do something about his agony and
      provide him at least with tissues. This I did. He started to
      attack his nose in a most sadistic manner. He placed a paper
      tissue on his lap, leaned over it, and tried to force mucous
      from his nose. He pulled, pushed, poked and blew, using both
      hands for these manipulations. He was totally self-absorbed
      in this frenetic activity which went on for quite some time
      until I intervened. I suggested that his concern about, and
      vicious treatment of his nose really referred to his penis
      and that he might be remembering something of what happened
      to him when he was a small boy and had phimosis. I tried to
      to put into words some of the discomfort and pain he must
      have suffered at the time, especially when urinating or when
      his penis was touched by his mother. Peter listened
      attentively and smilingly and said that I saw sex in
      everything. But he at once stopped attacking his nose and
      showed no further signs of discomfort from the hay fever.</p>

      <p class="text2">Similar material reappeared on many
      subsequent occasions; it was particularly telling when we
      explored his compulsive need to masturbate. He explained that
      every time he failed to ejaculate he would have to try again.
      As this sometimes happened 10 to 12 times a day, it made his
      penis so sore that he feared permanent damage. In this way he
      was also attacking himself, while in his fantasies he was
      raping a girl.</p>

      <p class="text2">The equation of ejaculation and urination,
      as a means of attack on the female object, persisted from his
      toilet- training battle with his mother. This battle was the
      background to his somatic and psychological experiences at
      the time of the phimosis and circumcision. This was also the
      psychological content of enactments during the early months
      of treatment, when he wanted to use his felt-pens on me,
      tried to squirt drops at me with his nasal dispenser, and
      left little pools of water all over the floor of my room.
      Later, when verbalization replaced acting, he would just
      threaten to piss on me when he felt he needed to
      counterattack. There was a mounting excitement and triumph at
      the height of the attack, but his was at once followed by
      fear of retaliation. But eventually we learned that an
      important motive for the attack had been the wish to engage
      the object - even if it was only in battle.</p>

      <p class="text2">This sadomasochistic mode of relating was
      evident in all of Peter's relationships outside the analysis
      as well. He provoked others to counterattack though his
      non-verbal attacks and abuse.</p>

      <p class="text2">With his mother, he still achieved closeness
      though his body. While she was quite impervious to his
      psychological needs, she always appeared concerned about his
      physical ailments and imperfections. The slightest complaint
      of pains in his neck or back secured the mother's immediate
      attention, and she would start to massage him. She repeatedly
      drew attention to a minor impairment in the movement of his
      left arm for which she gave him physiotherapy. She often
      dragged him to doctors. e.g., for a verruca which she thought
      should be excised rather than treated medically as the doctor
      suggested. There were endless battles about cleanliness and
      about he need for Peter's hair to be "trimmed" (a term he
      also used to describe circumcision).</p>

      <p class="text2">In this way the mother reinforced Peter's
      castration anxiety, and she communicated her view of him as
      imperfect. But her physical ministrations sexually excited
      her adolescent son and in this way she perpetuated and
      compounded his difficulties. When the doctor suggested
      prophylactic injections for the hay fever, the mother
      persuaded him to let her give Peter the course of injections
      herself. Although he feared that she might hurt him or ever
      kill him, he submitted to her without protest. In the
      analysis he spoke of using the experience as a stimulus for
      new variations of his sexual fantasies.</p>

      <p class="text2">I can see with hindsight that this material
      was also enacted in the transference, long before the full
      implications were understood. In the eight week of treatment
      he developed a sudden pain in his back and wanted me to do
      something about it. Instead of exploring with me what
      something could mean, he quite literally stripped to the
      waist, ostensibly to see what his mother could have put in
      his vest to cause the pain.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">There can be little
      doubt that the somatic and psychological experiences
      occasioned by the phimosis and circumcision were experienced
      by Peter as abuse and victimization.</span> Child abuse by
      mothers and medical experimentation by Nazi doctors on the
      sexual organs of concentration camp victims were recurring
      topics in the analysis. He also emphasized that such
      brutalities left the victims physically mutilated, mentally
      retarded, or even dead. He, of course, saw himself both as
      physically mutilated and mentally retarded.</p>

      <p align="justify"><span class="yellow">It would seem that
      the traumatogenic experiences in his second and third year of
      life also unleashed massive aggression which his
      disciplinarian parents met with condemnation, physical
      beatings, and further assaults and abuse.</span> Peter's
      "sins" and "guilty crimes," to which he alluded at the
      beginning of treatment, referred to quite violent, aggressive
      attacks on animals and children. He "accidentally" killed a
      kitten; he hit a boy over the head so he needed six stitches;
      and he almost drowned a girl in the swimming pool. These
      episodes must have occurred between the ages of 4 and 8. He
      was riddled with guilt about these murderous attacks. After
      his banishment to boarding school, his behavior was reversed.
      Though, in more subtle ways, he himself soon became the butt
      and victim of others.</p>

      <p class="text2">Primitive aggression threatens to destroy
      the object and self and mobilizes massive anxiety. It may
      well be that for Peter the anesthetic concretized and
      dramatized self destruction, death, and suffocation. The
      mother had told us that Peter reacted badly to the
      anesthetic, but was unable to remember anything else about
      the circumcision. It may be speculative to suggest that Peter
      brought into analysis somatic memories of the panic he
      experienced when given the anesthetic, but the idea was
      prompted by the following events.</p>

      <p class="text2">From time to time Peter froze into a
      motionless state and sat for several minutes with fixed
      staring eyes and a masklike facial expression. He would
      emerge from this trancelike state, either spontaneously or in
      response to my intervention, only after a violent jerking
      movement of his head, which was suggestive of a deliberate
      effort to rid himself of something compelling and terrifying.
      In discussion various hypotheses were suggest to account for
      these puzzling episodes. Did they indicate a kind of petit
      mal caused by organic impairment? Did they suggest a kind of
      hysterical twilight state or even some kind of hallucinatory
      experience? Did they represent attempts to immobilize his
      body in order to control sexual excitement and terrifying
      fantasies?</p>

      <p class="text2">As soon as Peter's fear of treatment
      lessened and he could begin to permit himself to convey his
      feelings and fantasies, these trancelike states disappeared
      and an organic basis seemed unlikely. But a defensive
      "withdrawal into fantasy" in the face of anxiety, or painful
      effect mobilized by any kind of internal or external
      impingement, remained. At such times Peters was always
      difficult to reach.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is of interest that in the third year of
      treatment the trancelike state made a brief reappearance in
      one of the sessions. I noted that it was a dramatization of
      the early states because by that time Peter's self-observing
      capacities were sufficiently developed to prevent
      precipitation into panic. He could also acknowledge what had
      happened and explore it a little. He recalled the frequency
      of such panic states in and out of analysis and thought of
      them collectively as "my madness." He thought now that it was
      his way of "shutting off" the outside world and concentrating
      exclusively on fantasy. I was doubtful whether he really had
      this degree of voluntary control. We were able to link the
      heightened state of anxiety in this particular session to a
      transference fantasy that his sadistic attacks would really
      destroy me, bring treatment to an end, and leave him totally
      abandoned. It was this "painful realization" he must of tried
      to "shut out."</p>

      <p class="text2">I have always harbored the fantasy that the
      anesthetic was given by a mask and a bottle. If this were so,
      it would make sense of Peter's perception of death as
      suffocation, and his use of a plastic bag, in later
      adolescence, to support his fantasies of castration and
      suffocation by a big woman. It is a fact that fantasies of
      being victimized, passively overwhelmed, and cruelly punished
      to the point of death were sexually exciting just because the
      aggression was turned against the self and alleviated
      guilt.</p>

      <p>Discussion</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The events surrounding
      the phimosis, the concomitant interventions, as and
      subsequent operation profoundly affected Peter's
      development.</span> Self and object representations were
      crystallized around these experiences, and the relationship
      locked in a sadomasochistic battle for survival. The
      perception of his mother as malicious attacker, whose
      longed-for attention an concern could be obtained only by
      suffering pain and be relinquishing his penis, absorbed,
      restructured and organized a whole range of earlier
      experiences and conflicts.</p>

      <p align="justify">His unrequited longing to be loved, his
      envy of his brother as usurper of his rightful place, the
      dangers stemming from his heightened aggression - nurtured by
      unmet early needs, forced feeding, and rigid toilet training
      - all became organized around the experience engendered by
      the phimosis and circumcision. The anal phase battle for
      power and control acquired a particular potent input from
      hurting an being hurt and became focused on the penis. The
      mother became all important as the provider of pain and
      sexual excitement - a sadistic attacker and seducer - and a
      powerful model for identification.</p>

      <p class="text2">All this colored the way Peter came to
      experience his rivalry with the feared and oedipal father,
      his highly ambivalent relationship to his brother, his
      banishment from home at the age of 8, and his relationships
      with to teachers and peers at boarding school. <span
      class="yellow">What was so striking in Peter's analysis was
      the way in which all the avenues pursued led to the
      experiences surrounding the circumcision.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">How do we conceptualize the nature of such
      an "organizing experience" (<a href="../yorke/">Yorke,
      1986</a>) which not only shapes what Herzog (1985) has called
      "the developmental line of personal meaning" but also propels
      the psychosexual development along a deviant path and
      generally constricts ego functioning?</p>

      <p class="text2">Of course the analysis only gradually and
      laboriously unraveled the various layers and developmental
      transformations of Peter's masturbation fantasies and
      conflicts. But how do we explain the emergence of specific
      and and apparently encapsulated memories, through the most
      primitive, symbolic, and concretized enactments at the
      beginning of the analysis?</p>

      <p class="text2">Do these unconscious enactments of the
      manipulations of the penis, the difficulties in urinating,
      and the experiences of the anesthetic reflect the the
      "traumatic" impact of these events? Affectively they were all
      charged with an admixture of excitement, pain, and panic. Are
      we to interpret them as signs of "trauma" in the classical
      sense, that they mobilized a degree of affective excitation
      which overwhelmed vulnerable ego functions; could not be
      dealt with at the time, became encapsulated as primitive
      memory structures, until they were reworked and raised to a
      higher level of integration in the course of the
      analysis?</p>

      <p class="text2">There were also some technical implications
      concerning reconstruction, which arise when working with a
      patient like Peter. <span class="yellow">I found it useful to
      organize my reconstruction around the "trauma of the
      circumcision" because this was the most meaningful in terms
      of Peter's current experience.</span> But in the view taken
      of an intrapsychic "organizing experience," reconstructions
      of this kind may also be more meaningful in terms of the
      childhood past. Reconstructions must be intrapsychically
      meaningful rather than be historical or developmentally
      accurate.</p>
