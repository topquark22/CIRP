      <h2>McLean Researchers Document Brain Damage Linked to Child
      Abuse and Neglect</h2>

      <p class="text1"><b>December 14, 2000 -- Belmont, MA</b> --
      McLean Hospital researchers have identified four types of
      brain abnormalities linked to child abuse and neglect,
      providing the first comprehensive review about the multiple
      ways in which abuse can damage the developing brain. In the
      Fall 2000 issue of <a
      href="http://www.dana.org/books/press/cerebrum/"
      target="_blank">Cerebrum</a>, the researchers also review
      evidence that suggests this early damage to the developing
      brain may subsequently cause disorders like anxiety and
      depression in adulthood.</p>

      <p class="text1">The science shows that childhood
      maltreatment may produce changes in both brain function and
      structure," says Martin Teicher, MD, PhD, director of the <a
      href="http://medapps.med.harvard.edu/psych/redbook/redbook-family-child-12.htm"
       target="_blank">Developmental Biopsychiatry Research
      Program</a> at McLean, and author of the paper. Although a
      baby is born with almost all the brain cells (neurons) he
      will ever have, the brain continues to develop actively
      throughout childhood and adolescence. "A child's interactions
      with the outside environment causes connections to form
      between brain cells," Teicher explains. "Then these
      connections are pruned during puberty and adulthood. So
      whatever a child experiences, for good or bad, helps
      determine how his brain is wired."</p>

      <p class="text1">The McLean team identifies four types of
      abnormalities caused by abuse and neglect. "These changes are
      permanent," says Teicher. "This is not something people can
      just get over and get on with their lives."</p>

      <p class="text1">Limbic irritability: The limbic system is a
      network of brain cells sometimes called the "emotional
      brain." It controls many of the most fundamental emotions and
      drives important for survival. The McLean researchers found
      evidence that abuse may cause disturbances in electrical
      impulses as limbic nerve cells communicate, resulting in
      seizures or significant abnormalities on an EEG, a diagnostic
      test that measures brain waves. The researchers studied 253
      adults who came to an outpatient mental health clinic for
      psychiatric assessment. A little more than half reported
      being physically and/or sexually abused as children. The
      researchers developed a checklist (the Limbic System
      Checklist-33 or LSCL-33) to determine how often the patients
      experienced symptoms similar to those that occur in patients
      with temporal lobe epilepsy. They found that patients who
      experienced abuse scored much higher suggesting an underlying
      disturbance in the limbic system. Follow-up studies of 115
      children admitted to McLean were conducted to measure EEG
      disturbances. Patients with a history of abuse were twice as
      likely as non-abused patients to have an abnormal EEG.
      Interestingly, all of the extra EEG abnormalities affected
      the left hemisphere of the brain. EEG abnormalities were
      associated with more self-destructive behavior and more
      aggression.</p>

      <p class="text1">Arrested development of the left hemisphere:
      The brain is divided into two hemispheres, with the left
      controlling language and the right responsible for
      visual-spatial ability, perception and expression of negative
      affect. In six separate studies and analyses, the smallest
      involving 20 people and the largest involving 115, the
      researchers reviewed medical records, conducted
      neuropsychological tests to measure left- and right-brain
      abilities, examined the results of MRI scans to provide
      pictures of the brain at work, and studied the results of
      sophisticated EEG coherence tests, which provided information
      on brain structure as well as function. These studies provide
      evidence of deficient development of the left brain
      hemisphere in abused patients, so that the right hemisphere
      may be more active than in healthy individuals. The
      researchers speculate that the left hemisphere deficits seen
      in abused patients may contribute to the development of
      depression and increase the risk of memory impairments.</p>

      <p class="text1">Deficient integration between the left and
      right hemispheres: The corpus callosum is a major information
      pathway connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. The
      researchers reviewed MRI brain scans from 51 patients
      admitted to McLean's <a
      href="http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/patient/child/"
      target="_blank">Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Program</a>,
      and compared them to 97 MRIs of healthy children obtained
      from the <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/"
      target="_blank">National Institute of Mental Health</a>. In
      abused children, the corpus callosum was smaller than in
      healthy children. After reviewing the medical records, the
      researchers found that neglect was associated with a 24
      percent to 42 percent reduction in the size of various
      regions of the corpus callosum in boys, but sexual abuse had
      no effect. In girls, sexual abuse was associated with an 18
      percent to 30 percent smaller size in the corpus callosum,
      but neglect had no effect. They also found that abused
      patients shifted degree of activity between their two
      hemispheres to a much greater extent than normal. They
      theorize that a smaller corpus callosum leads to less
      integration of the hemispheres. This in turn can result in
      dramatic shifts in mood or personality.</p>

      <p class="text1">Increased vermal activity: The cerebellar
      vermis is a part of the brain that is involved in emotion,
      attention and the regulation of the limbic system. The McLean
      researchers used a new functional MRI technique known as T2
      relaxometry, which provides information about blood flow to
      the brain during a resting state, to measure vermal activity
      in both abused and healthy individuals. Thirty-two adults
      participated, including 15 with a history of sexual or
      intense verbal childhood trauma but no physical trauma. The
      higher a participant's LSCL-33 score, the greater the degree
      of vermal activity or blood flow. The researchers theorize
      that the abused patients had higher vermal activity in order
      to quell electrical irritability within the limbic system.
      They hypothesize that the cerebellar vermis helps to maintain
      emotional balance, but that trauma may impair this
      ability.</p>

      <p class="text1">After documenting these four types of brain
      abnormalities, the McLean researchers examined animal studies
      to determine how such damage might occur. Such studies show
      that neglect and trauma increase production of cortisol and
      decrease production of the thyroid hormone, which affect
      development of neurochemical and neurotransmitter receptors
      in the hippocampus, amygdala and locus coeruleus, parts of
      the brain that regulate fear and anxiety. <span
      class="yellow">Based on these studies, the McLean team
      theorizes that the stress caused by child abuse and neglect
      may also trigger the release of some hormones and
      neurotransmitters while inhibiting others, in effect
      remolding the brain so that the individual is "wired" to
      respond to a hostile environment.</span></p>

      <p class="text1">"We know that an animal exposed to stress
      and neglect early in life develops a brain that is wired to
      experience fear, anxiety and stress," says Teicher. "We think
      the same is true of people."</p>
