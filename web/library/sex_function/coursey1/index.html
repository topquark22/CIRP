      <center>ABSTRACT</center>
      <br />
      <br />
       
      <p class="abstract">Purpose: We ascertained the impact of
      anterior urethroplasty on male sexual function.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Materials and methods: A validated
      questionnaire was mailed to 200 men who underwent anterior
      urethroplasty to evaluate postoperative sexual function.
      Questions addressed the change in erect penile length and
      angle, patient satisfaction with erection, preoperative and
      postoperative coital frequency, and change in erection noted
      by the sexual partner. Results were stratified by the
      urethral reconstruction method, namely anastomosis, buccal
      mucosal graft, penile flap and all others, and compared with
      those in a similar group of men who underwent circumcision
      only.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Results: Of the 200 men who underwent
      urethroplasty 152 who were 17 to 83 years old (mean age 45.7)
      completed the questionnaire. Average followup was 36 months
      (range 3 to 149). <span class="circ">Overall there was a
      similar incidence of sexual problems after urethroplasty and
      circumcision.</span> Penile skin flap urethroplasty was
      associated with a slightly higher incidence of impaired
      sexual function than other procedures (p &gt;0.05). Men with
      a longer stricture were most likely to report major changes
      in erectile function and penile length (p &lt;0.05) but
      improvement was evident with time in 61.8%.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Conclusions: Overall anterior urethral
      reconstruction appears no more likely to cause long-term
      postoperative sexual dysfunction than circumcision. Men with
      a long stricture may be at increased risk for transient
      erectile changes.</p>

      <p><span class="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: This file contains a
      study of the effects on erectile function of anterior
      urethroplasty. This normally would not be of interest to us
      except for the fact that the study used a group of 22 men who
      were circumcised in adult life as a control group. This group
      is of interest to us, because of the high incidence of sexual
      problems experienced by this control group of circumcised
      men. 27.3 percent experienced worsened erections and 22.7
      percent experienced a major change in erection length. 65
      percent of partners noticed a change in erection. Highlights
      have been placed in the text where this group is
      discussed.]</b></span></p>

      <p class="text">Reported outcomes of urethral reconstruction
      surgery have traditionally focused only on urodynamic
      parameters, such as the flow rate, American Urological
      Association symptom score or recurrent stenosis requiring
      further instrumentation. Although male urethral
      reconstruction has become increasingly popular and effective,
      to our knowledge little is known about its potential impact
      on subsequent sexual performance. In 1993 Mundy reported a 5%
      rate of permanent impotence after anastomotic transperineal
      and abdomino-perineal urethroplasty, and a 0.9% rate after
      patch graft urethroplasty.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> No
      others have specifically addressed this topic.</p>

      <p class="text">We assessed the effects of anterior
      urethroplasty on sexual function in men who were potent
      preoperatively. We specifically evaluated whether any
      particular type of anterior urethral reconstruction procedure
      was associated with an increased risk of adverse sexual
      sequelae. Results were compared with those in a similar group
      of men who underwent circumcision only.</p>

      <center>
        MATERIALS AND METHODS
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text">We mailed a validated male sexual performance
      questionnaire to 200 consecutive unselected men with a mean
      age plus or minus standard deviation of 43.8 &plusmn; 2.38
      years who underwent anterior urethral reconstruction
      performed by 1 of 5 sub-specialist reconstructive urological
      surgeons (A. F. M., J. W. M., C. S., K. M. and N. A.) at the
      5 study centers (see appendix). Patients with pelvic trauma
      and those not sexually active preoperatively were excluded
      from analysis. The questionnaire was formulated to assess
      perceived changes in satisfaction with erection, erect penile
      length and angle, and changes in these parameters with time.
      Alterations in the frequency of intercourse and changes in
      patient erection noted by their partners were also recorded.
      The questionnaire was validated for content by a statistician
      after input by 5 staff urologists. Each question achieved a
      relevancy score of greater than 90% with the Content Validity
      Index scale.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p>The same questionnaire was mailed to 48 men who under-went
      simple circumcision for phimosis or another benign
      indication. These men were similar in age (mean 49.8 &plusmn;
      3.2 years) to those in all 4 urethroplasty groups
      (Student-Newman- Keuls post hoc statistical test p = 0.61).
      The mean time between surgery and questionnaire completion
      was 36 months for urethroplasty and 16.5 months for
      circumcision. Patients were divided into groups based on the
      type of surgery performed, including groups
      1&mdash;anastomotic urethroplasty, 2&mdash;buccal mucosal
      graft urethroplasty, 3&mdash;penile flap urethroplasty,
      4&mdash;other variants of anterior urethral reconstruction,
      including 2-stage and combined procedures, and <span
      class="circ">5&mdash;circumcision</span>. Responses were
      compared among the groups (independent variable) with the
      Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance to test the null
      hypothesis that the response did not depend on the type of
      surgery. The same method of analysis was used to compare the
      impact on intercourse frequency and partner perception in the
      5 groups.</p>

      <center>
        RESULTS
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text">Of the 248 men mailed a questionnaire 190
      responded for an overall response rate of 76.6%, of whom 16
      were excluded from analysis because they had not been
      sexually active preoperatively. The remaining 174 cases were
      included in analysis and stratified into groups 1&mdash;56
      anastomotic urethroplasties, 2&mdash;26 buccal mucosa graft
      urethroplasties, 3&mdash;44 penile flap urethroplasties,
      4&mdash;26 other methods of anterior urethroplasty, such as a
      combined or 2-stage procedure, and <span
      class="circ">5&mdash;22 circumcisions.</span></p>

      <p class="text">In the urethroplasty groups overall
      satisfaction with erection after surgery improved or did not
      change in 69.1% of patients and worsened in 30.9%. Table 1
      lists the responses per urethroplasty type. Men who reported
      worse erectile function had a significantly longer stricture
      than those with improved or unchanged erection (mean 6.8
      &plusmn; 5.5 versus 4.4 &plusmn; 3.7 cm., p = 0.017). <span
      class="circ">In the circumcision group 72.7% and 27.3% of men
      reported improved satisfaction or no change and worsening,
      respectively.</span> There was no statistically significant
      difference among any of the groups.</p>

      <p>The majority of the men in all groups reported no major
      decrease in erect penile length or major change in the angle
      of erection postoperatively (table 1). Overall those who
      noticed an altered erectile angle and penile length had a
      significantly longer stricture than those who did not (p
      =0.05). Penile flap urethroplasty resulted in slightly more
      penile shortening and erectile angle alteration than the
      other procedures (p =0.05, table 1) but they appeared to
      improve with time (table 2).</p>

      <p class="text">When questioned on the impact of surgery on
      sexual relations, about a third of the men who underwent
      urethroplasty and <span class="circ">65% of those who
      underwent circumcision reported that their partners noticed a
      change in erection (table 2).</span> Again men with a longer
      stricture were most likely to report a change (p =0.05).
      Nevertheless, in most urethroplasty and circumcision cases
      little or no change in intercourse frequency was noticed
      after surgery.</p>

        DISCUSSION
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text">When assessing the possible association of a
      specific surgical procedure with postoperative sexual
      dysfunction, one must consider the increase in erectile
      problems with advancing age, such as a reported increase in
      complete impotence from 5% at age 40 years to 15% at
      70,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and the documented
      association with various procedures. After vascular surgery
      and coronary artery bypass grafting erectile dysfunction has
      been reported in up to 33% of cases.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> After abdominoperineal rectal excision
      impotence has been noted in 15% to 69% of cases.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5, 6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="image"><img src="table1.gif" height="297"
      width="719" alt="Table 1" /></p>

      <p class="text">Various urological procedures have been
      associated with erectile dysfunction, including those for
      benign prostatic hyperplasia in up to 50% of men with severe
      voiding symptoms,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> transurethral
      prostate resection in 4.8%,<sup><a href="#n9">8</a></sup>
      direct vision internal urethrotomy in 10%,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> prostate needle biopsy in up to
      15%,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> radical prostatectomy
      with a 65% impotence rate in men younger than 60 years and a
      much higher rate in older patients,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> and external beam irradiation with
      decreased potency in up to 47.5%.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Up to 26% of men with prostate
      cancer treated with watchful waiting only report erectile
      dysfunction.12 In regard to urethroplasty the series of Mundy
      of 200 patients indicated temporary impotence less than 3
      months in duration in 53% who underwent anastomotic and 33%
      who underwent patch repair.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      However, these rates dramatically decreased with time to 5%
      and 0.9%, respectively. We were surprised by the reported
      rate of sexual difficulty after anterior urethroplasty in our
      series, which in our experience seemed higher than that
      described by patients during followup examination. However,
      we believe that these questionnaire responses are credible
      because the data were unfiltered, that is written directly by
      patients at home and, thus, not subject to physician bias,
      coaching or interpretation. There appears to be little
      anatomical basis for severe erectile dysfunction after
      anterior urethral reconstruction. By cadaveric dissection Lue
      et al determined that some cavernous nerve fibers pass
      through the tunica albuginea to supply the corpus spongiosum
      but most remain about 3 mm. outside, occupying the 1 and 11
      o&rsquo;clock positions at the level of convergence of the
      crura of the corpora cavernosa.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Penile neurovascular evaluation of
      our patients was not recorded, nor was the response to
      treatment. Our finding that patients who underwent end-to-end
      primary anastomosis or buccal mucosal grafting for bulbar
      stricture reported the least decrement in erectile
      satisfaction corroborates the conclusion of Lue et al that
      the corpus spongiosum conducts only a minority of the overall
      erectile neural mechanism.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> It
      also underscores our clinical observation that the corpus
      spongiosum is highly elastic and can be readily
      re-anastomosed after mobilization and stricture excision
      despite a mean stricture length of 1.875 cm.</p>

      <p class="image"><img src="table2.gif" width="718"
      height="301" alt="Table 2" /></p>

      <p class="text">Although perceived changes in satisfaction
      with erection were not statistically significant among our
      groups, almost 41% of the penile skin flap group reported
      worsening postoperatively. In these men stricture length was
      greater (mean 6.7 cm.) than in those who underwent the
      anastomotic or graft technique, implying more extensive
      fibrosis. Furthermore, the flap was raised by dissection
      close to the neurovascular bundles along the dorsal penile
      shaft, risking nerve damage.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      However, because all surgeons in this series have had
      extensive experience, we believe that inadvertent nerve
      injury during harvest was unlikely. There is no question that
      penile flap urethroplasty usually produces moderate genital
      edema that may be several weeks in duration. When combined
      with contracture of the circumferential penile incision line
      and the simple loss of penile skin, it may contribute to
      perceived shortening. Tissue expansion during erection seems
      to mitigate any tethering that may be present immediately
      after surgery.</p>

      <p class="text">Notably the circumcision group was smaller,
      the response rate was less and the mean interval between
      surgery and questionnaire completion was shorter than in the
      urethroplasty group. However, because the men who underwent
      circumcision were similar in age and sexually active, we
      believe that they represent a valid if not ideal penile
      surgery control group. Although in 1 review of circumcision
      no conclusive evidence of interference with sexual function
      was identified,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> <span class="circ">in our study
      the reported change in erection and impact on sexual
      relations was similar to or greater than that in the 4
      urethroplasty groups.</span> Perceived changes in erection after a
      penile skin flap procedure or circumcision may be heightened
      because they result in a readily visible surgical wound that
      changes penile appearance. A perineal wound resulting from a
      buccal mucosal graft or anastomotic urethroplasty is not as
      readily apparent to the patient and not as likely to cause
      ecchymosis or edema. Therefore, there may be fewer effects in
      terms of perceived body image alteration. As in any
      retrospective study based on a patient questionnaire, ours is
      open to the criticism that it presents subjective data on a
      topic that is influenced by many internal and external
      factors. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that
      the presentation of this element of postoperative
      satisfaction is important for ensuring accurate patient
      counseling.</p>

        CONCLUSIONS
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text">Our findings imply that in experienced hands
      most men who undergo anterior urethral reconstruction are no
      more likely to have impaired sexual function than those who
      undergo circumcision. When alterations in penile appearance
      and sexual performance occur after anterior urethroplasty,
      they appear to be transient and associated with a longer
      stricture.</p>
