      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> Quantitative somatosensory testing,
      including vibration, pressure, spatial perception and thermal
      thresholds of the penis, has demonstrated neuropathy in
      patients with a history of erectile dysfunction of all
      etiologies. We evaluated which measurement of neurological
      function of the penis was best at predicting erectile
      dysfunction and examined the impact of location on the penis
      for quantitative somatosensory testing measurements.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> A total of 107 patients were
      evaluated. All patients were required to complete the
      erectile function domain of the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, of whom 24 had no
      complaints of erectile dysfunction and scored within the
      "normal" range on the IIEF. Patients were subsequently tested
      on ventral middle penile shaft, proximal dorsal midline
      penile shaft and glans penis <span class="yellow">(with
      foreskin retracted)</span> for vibration, pressure, spatial
      perception, and warm and cold thermal thresholds.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Mixed models repeated measures analysis of
      variance controlling for age, diabetes and hypertension
      revealed that method of measurement (quantitative
      somatosensory testing) was predictive of IIEF score (F = 209,
      df = 4,1315, p &lt;0.001), while site of measurement on the
      penis was not. To determine the best method of measurement,
      we used hierarchical regression, which revealed that warm
      temperature was the best predictor of erectile dysfunction
      with pseudo R(2) = 0.19, p &lt;0.0007. There was no
      significant improvement in predicting erectile dysfunction
      when another test was added. Using 37C and greater as the
      warm thermal threshold yielded a sensitivity of 88.5%,
      specificity 70.0% and positive predictive value 85.5%.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Quantitative somatosensory testing
      using warm thermal threshold measurements taken at the glans
      penis can be used alone to assess the neurological status of
      the penis. Warm thermal thresholds alone offer a quick,
      noninvasive accurate method of evaluating penile neuropathy
      in an office setting.</p>

      carefully retracted the foreskin for the purposes of this
      experiment. The contribution of the nerves of the foreskin
      and the <a href="http://research.cirp.org/"><i>ridged
      band</i></a> to sensitivity, pleasure, and satisfaction,
      therefore, were excluded from the testing. Moreover, this
      experiment was carried out under static conditions. The
      foreskin, however, moves dynamically during coitus through
      its <i>gliding action</i>, thereby stimulating the nerve
      endings in the foreskin and providing pleasure and
      satisfaction to the individual. The evidence provided by this
      study, therefore, points to the foreskin, not the glans
      penis, as the major source of penile sensitivity, pleasure,
      and satisfaction.]</p>
