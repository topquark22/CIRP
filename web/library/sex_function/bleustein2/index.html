    <h3 align="center">EFFECTS OF CIRCUMCISION ON MALE PENILE
    SENSITIVITY</h3>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p align="center"><b>Clifford B Bleustein*, Haftan Eckholdt,
      Joseph C Arezzo, Arnold Melman, Bronx, NY</b></p>

      <p><b>Introduction and Objective:</b> Controversy continues
      to exist about the effect of circumcision on penile
      sensitivity and sexual satisfaction. This study was designed
      to evaluate penile sensitivity in both circumcised and
      uncircumcised males. We evaluated both large and small axon
      nerve fibers using vibration, pressure, spatial perception,
      and warm and cold thermal thresholds. Measurements both in
      functional men and men with erectile dysfunction (ED) were
      obtained to evaluate for differences in penile
      sensitivities.<br />
      <br />
       <b>Methods:</b> Seventy-nine patients were evaluated. In the
      cohort evaluated, 54% (43/79) were uncircumcised, while 46%
      (36/79) were circumcised. All patients completed the erectile
      function domain of the International Index of Erectile
      Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Patients were subsequently
      tested on the dorsal midline glans of the penis. <span
      class="yellow">In uncircumcised males, the foreskin was
      retracted for testing.</span> Vibration (Biothesiometer),
      pressure (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments), spatial perception
      (Tactile Circumferential Discriminator), and warm and cold
      thermal thresholds (Physitemp NTE-2) were measured. Bivariate
      relationships were assessed using chi square, t test, and
      Pearson correlations. Composite null hypotheses were assessed
      with mixed models repeated measures analysis of variance
      allowing us to covary for age, diabetes, and
      hypertension.<br />
      <br />
       <b>Results:</b> Functional group t test analysis only
      demonstrated a significant (p= 0.048) difference for warm
      thermal thresholds with a higher threshold (worse sensation)
      for uncircumcised men. However, significance was lost when we
      controlled for age, hypertension, and diabetes. For the
      dysfunctional groups t-test analysis only demonstrated a
      significant (p= 0.01) difference for vibration
      (biothesiometry) with a higher threshold (worse sensation)
      for uncircumcised men. Again, this also lost significance
      (p=0.08) when controlling for age, hypertension, and
      diabetes. We also found that overall race is related to
      circumcision status with Caucasian men 25 times and African
      American men 8 times more likely to be circumcised than
      Hispanics.<br />
      <br />
       <b>Conclusions:</b> We present a comparative analysis
      between uncircumcised and circumcised men using a battery of
      quantitative somatosensory tests that evaluate the spectrum
      of small to large axon nerve fibers. We demonstrated that
      there are no significant differences in penile sensation
      between circumcised and uncircumcised men with respect to
      vibration, spatial perception, pressure, warm and cold
      thermal thresholds in both patients with and without erectile
      dysfunction.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: The methodology in this study
      is flawed and displays a fundamental lack of undestanding of
      foreskin innervation and function. Blustein <i>et al.</i>
      carefully retracted the foreskin for the purposes of this
      experiment. The contribution of the nerves of the foreskin
      and the <a href="http://research.cirp.org/"><i>ridged
      band</i></a> to sensitivity, pleasure, and satisfaction,
      therefore, were excluded from the testing. Moreover, this
      experiment was carried out under static conditions. The
      foreskin, however, moves dynamically during coitus through
      its <i>gliding action</i>, thereby stimulating the nerve
      endings in the foreskin and providing pleasure and
      satisfaction to the individual. The evidence provided by this
      study, therefore, points to the foreskin, not the glans
      penis, as the major source of penile sensitivity, pleasure,
      and satisfaction.]</p>
