    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text1">In assessing the link between male
      circumcision and cervical cancer in female partners, Dr
      Rivet<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> ignores the fact that,
      morphologically, the prepuce is highly specialized
      tissue<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> and might be worthy of
      preservation in itself.</p>

      <p class="text2">The "ridged band" is a ring of uniquely
      corrugated mucosa just inside the tip of the prepuce: it is
      highly vascular, and its individual ridges are tipped with
      Meissner corpuscles known to be sensitive to movement, such
      as that incurred by sexual intercourse. <span
      class="yellow">Work in progress shows that stretching the
      prepuce and its ridged band triggers reflex contraction of
      muscles of the bulb of penis known to be associated with
      ejaculation and, not insignificantly, erogenous
      sensation.</span> Further information on the ridged band can
      be found at <a href="http://research.cirp.org/"
      target="_blank"><b>http://research.cirp.org</b></a>.</p>

      <p class="text2">As if excision of the prepuce and its
      specialized tissue were not enough, my colleagues and
      I<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> found that routine neonatal
      circumcision regularly removes a large portion of the true
      skin of the penile shaft. It follows that the usual parade of
      "cosmetic" side effects of routine neonatal circumcision
      woefully underestimates its true cost.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sexual function is only rarely included in
      circumcision discussions and, without it, parents seeking
      advice for properly informed consent, as well as their baby
      boys, are poorly served.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dr Rivet would be well advised to stick with
      her original and much sounder advice to parents. And, of
      course, to include an update on preputial structure and its
      relationship to adult sexual function.</p>
