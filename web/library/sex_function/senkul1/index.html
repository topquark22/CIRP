      <p class="abs">ABSTRACT</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To evaluate the effects
      of adult circumcision on sexual function in men circumcised
      only for religious or cosmetic reasons.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>METHODS:</b> The study group consisted of
      42 male patients with a median age of 22.3 years (range 19 to
      28) referred for circumcision from June 2002 to January 2003.
      Of the 42 men, 39 desired circumcision for religious reasons.
      Before circumcision, their sexual performance was evaluated
      using the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMSFI) and
      ejaculatory latency time. The BMSFI evaluation and
      ejaculatory latency time measurements were repeated after a
      postoperative interval of at least 12 weeks. The scores in
      the five main sections of the BMSFI and the ejaculatory
      latency times before and after circumcision were
      analyzed.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>RESULTS:</b> The differences in the mean
      BMSFI scores were not statistically significant in any of the
      five sections. <span class="yellow">However, the mean
      ejaculatory latency time was significantly longer after
      circumcision (P = 0.02).</span></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Adult circumcision does
      not adversely affect sexual function. The increase in the
      ejaculatory latency time can be considered an advantage
      rather than a complication.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UROLOGY

      <p><span class="init">C</span>ircumcision is a surgical
      procedure performed for centuries for medical, religious, and
      several other reasons. Erectile impotence was one of those
      indications as reported in the 19th century,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> but a recent study has shown that
      circumcision can even be harmful to erectile function.<sup><a
      href="#n">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The studies that have evaluated the effect
      of circumcision on sexual function were done on men
      circumcised for medical problems arising from their
      preputium, and the sexual performance of those subjects may
      have been affected by these pathologic findings, a drawback
      for the comparison of sexual function before and after
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In this prospective study, we evaluated the
      effects of adult circumcision on sexual function in men
      circumcised only for religious or cosmetic reasons.</p>

      <p class="heading1">MATERIAL AND METHODS</p>

      <p class="text2">Our group consisted of 42 male patients with
      a median age of 22.3 years (range 19 to 28) referred for
      circumcision to our department between June 2002 and January
      2003. Although 39 of them desired circumcision for religious
      reasons, the other 3 were referred for cosmetic reasons. All
      the subjects were heterosexual and sexually active, and none
      was using medication or a device to promote erections. The
      exclusion criteria consisted of the presence of penile skin
      lesions such as phimosis, balanitis, and condyloma acuminata
      and diseases such as diabetes mellitus or depression.
      Thirty-one of the subjects had a regular sexual partner and
      seven more had more than one partner. The partners were not
      interviewed. All patients provided informed consent.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before circumcision, their sexual
      performance was evaluated with the Brief Male Sexual Function
      Inventory (BMSFI), consisting of sexual drive, erection,
      ejaculation, problem assessment, and overall satisfaction
      sections (Table I.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> In a 2-week
      period before the procedure, the subjects were asked to
      measure their ejaculatory latency time during at least three
      sessions of sexual intercourse. This was the time elapsed
      from intromission to ejaculation. Circumcision was performed
      under local anesthesia, and dorsal slit or sleeve techniques
      were used, depending on surgeon preference. BMSFI evaluation
      and ejaculatory latency time measurements were repeated after
      a postoperative interval of at least 12 weeks.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">The scores of the five main sections of the
      BMSFI and the ejaculatory latency times before and after
      circumcision were analyzed with a paired samples <i>t</i>
      test and the significance level was set at <i>P</i>
      &lt;0.05.</p>

      <p class="heading1">RESULTS</p>

      <p class="text2">The mean scores of the five main sections of
      the BMSFI before and after circumcision and the mean
      ejaculatory latency times before and after circumcision are
      listed in Table II. <span class="yellow">Although the
      differences in the mean BMSFI scores were not statistically
      significant in any of the five sections, the mean ejaculatory
      time was significantly longer statistically after
      circumcision. (<i>P</i> = 0.02).</span></p>

      <p class="heading1">COMMENT</p>

      <p class="text2">In Muslim and Jewish communities,
      circumcision is generally done in the neonatal period or
      during childhood, as a requirement of the religion. In the
      other western communities, it is mostly practiced for medical
      or cosmetic reasons. It has been reported that 77% of the
      male population born in the United States has been
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> In Turkey, 95 % of
      the population is Muslim and almost all of the male
      population is circumcised in childhood. However, because we
      practice in a military hospital, we encounter the rare
      subjects who were not circumcised for socioeconomic reasons
      in childhood. Of the 42 patients in our study, 92.8% had not
      been circumcised during childhood for such reasons; the
      others were non-Muslim patients who desired circumcision for
      non-religious reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a study which Collins <i>et
      al.</i><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> evaluated the effect of
      circumcision on adult men, they reported that only 1 of 15
      patients were circumcised for adult reasons; all of the other
      patients had medical indications. According to Collins <i>et
      al.</i>, this was a weakness of the study because the
      pathologic features of the preputium might have played an
      inhibitory role on sexual function. Collins <i>et al.</i>
      pointed out that subjects with a religious or cosmetic
      circumcision would have constituted an ideal group for such a
      study.</p>

      <p class="text2">The epidermis of the glans penis is
      keratinized in circumcised males. These changes may result in
      decreased sensitivity. Masters and Johnson<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> have shown that circumcision does not
      effect sensitivity. However, later, it was speculated that
      these changes lessen the tactile and erogenous sensitivity of
      the penis. Fink <i>et al.</i> have also shown that the
      sensitivity decreases in males who have undergone
      circumcision in adulthood. We evaluated the sensitivity as a
      function of the ejaculatory latency and found that in our
      group the ejaculatory latency time increased significantly
      after circumcision. This may have been a result of an
      increase in the subject's self-esteem, becase in the Muslim
      community, circumcision is traditionally considered a must
      for manhood.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision has been debated for decades as
      to its effect on sexual function. Pienkos<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> reported that during the Korean war,
      soldiers asked for it, with the expectation of an increase in
      their sexual satisfaction. Laumann <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> observed that uncircumcised men have
      more sexual problems than circumcised men. In their series of
      15 patients, Collins <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> found no statistically significant
      changes in the results in the BMSFI parameters of the
      subjects before and after circumcision. However, Fink <i>et
      al.</i><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> reported that
      circumcision had a negative effect on erectile function but
      had increased sexual satisfaction. Our study, done with an
      ideal group, has confirmed the result of Collins <i>et
      al.</i>,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and we can say with
      certainty that adult circumcision does not adversely affect
      sexual function.</p>

      <p class="text2">The BMSFI was chosen for the present study,
      because it was simple for our patient to answer. The
      inventory has been reported to provide a reliable and valid,
      yet parsimonious, way to characterize sexual function.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Because it does not specifically
      address the problem of premature ejaculation, the ejaculatory
      latency time was also measured.</p>

      <p class="text2">The increase in the ejaculatory latency time
      can be considered an advantage rather than a complication.
      However, concerning the cause of that increase, in a Muslim
      community, the psychological influence of circumcision may be
      more pronounced than the organic effect.</p>
