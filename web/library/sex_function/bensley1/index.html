            <h3>Effects of male circumcision on female arousal and
            orgasm</h3>

            <p>While vaginal dryness is considered an indicator for
            female sexual arousal disorder,<sup><a
            href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> male circumcision may
            exacerbate female vaginal dryness during
            intercourse.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> O'Hara and
            O'Hara reported that women who had experienced coitus
            with both intact and circumcised men preferred intact
            partners by a ratio of 8.6 to one.<sup><a
            href="#n4">4</a></sup> Most women (85.5%) in that
            survey reported that they were more likely to
            experience orgasm with a genitally intact partner:
            `They [surveyed women] were also more likely to report
            that vaginal secretions lessened as coitus progressed
            with their circumcised partners (16.75,
            6.88&ndash;40.77).' <sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

            <p>Presence of the movable foreskin makes a difference
            in foreplay, being more arousing to the female.<sup><a
            href="#n4">4</a></sup> Women reported they were about
            twice as likely to experience orgasm if the male
            partner had a foreskin.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
            The impact of male circumcision on vaginal dryness
            during coitus required further investigation.</p>

            <p>We conducted a survey of 35 female sexual partners
            aged 18 to 69 years who had experienced sexual
            intercourse with <i>both</i> circumcised and genitally
            intact men.</p>

            <p>Participants completed a 35-item sexual awareness
            survey. Women reported they were significantly more
            likely to have experienced vaginal dryness during
            intercourse with circumcised than with genitally intact
            men c 2 (df = 1, n = 20) = 5.0, p &lt;0.05.<sup><a
            href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>Women who preferred a circumcised male sexual
            partner averaged 27.3 years of age (SD = 8.2), while
            those whose stated preference was for a genitally
            intact partner had a mean age of 36.4 years (SD =
            13.7). Thus, the role of the male foreskin in
            preventing loss of vaginal lubrication during
            intercourse may become more discernible with increasing
            age among women. We reported:</p>

            <blockquote>
              `During intercourse, the skin of an intact penis
              slides up and down the shaft, stimulating the glans
              and the nerves of the inner and outer foreskin. On
              the outstroke, the glans is partially or completely
              engulfed by the foreskin with more skin remaining
              inside the vagina than is the case with the
              circumcised penis. This `valve' mechanism is thought
              to retain the natural lubrication provided by the
              female because the bunched up skin acts to block the
              lubrication escaping from the vagina, which results
              in dryness.'<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Our work, which supports the hypothesis of Warren
            and Bigelow<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and the
            findings of O'Hara and O'Hara <sup><a
            href="#n4">4</a></sup> about the role of the male
            prepuce during coitus is fully reported in Denniston et
            al.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>Research generally has not considered possible
            adverse effects of male circumcision upon female sexual
            arousal and response. While Moynihan reported that
            vibratory thresholds, blood flow and hormone levels
            were studied,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> there was
            no mention of circumcision status of the male partner.
            Likewise, Leiblum failed to control for male
            circumcision status.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> In
            light of published findings,<sup><a
            href="#n4">4,5</a></sup> this is a serious
            methodological omission.</p>

            <p>Most likely, reported vaginal dryness and the
            related clinical designation `female arousal disorder'
            is but a normal female response to coitus with a man
            with an iatrogenically deficient penis.<sup><a
            href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>It is imperative that future studies of female
            arousal disorder record and control the circumcision
            status of male sexual partners.</p>
