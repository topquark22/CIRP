      US-British comparison.</h2>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> The purpose of this study was to
      characterize sexual behavior and opinions about sex in the
      United States and Britain; implications are discussed for
      effective public health policy regarding sexually transmitted
      diseases (STDs) in the United States.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Large-scale national probability surveys
      conducted in the 2 countries detailed sexual behavior,
      opinions, and the revalence of STDs.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> In comparison with that of Britain, the US
      population has <span class="yellow">greater variability in
      sexual behavior</span>, less tolerant opinions about sexual
      behavior, and a <span class="yellow">higher STD
      prevalence</span> and <span class="yellow">lower condom
      usage</span> among men.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The survey data show compelling
      evidence from both countries of a strong association between
      number of sex partners and STD risk. In the United States
      relative to Britain, there is both <span
      class="yellow">greater dispersion in sexual behavior</span>
      and a greater incidence of unconditional opposition to
      certain sexual practices. The former implies a need for
      strong public health policy to address the risks of STDs, but
      the latter implies strong opposition to that policy. This
      disjuncture between public health need and feasibility may
      contribute to the high US rate of STDs.</p>
