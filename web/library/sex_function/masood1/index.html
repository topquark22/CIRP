      <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p class="abstract"><b><i>Objectives:</i></b> Currently no
      consensus exists about the role of the foreskin or the effect
      circumcision has on penile sensitivity and overall sexual
      satisfaction. Our study assesses the effect of circumcision
      on sexually active men and the relative impact this may have
      on informed consent prior to surgery. <b><i>Materials and
      Methods:</i></b> One hundred and fifty men between the ages
      of 18 and 60 years were identified as being circumcised for
      benign disease between 1999 and 2002. Patients with erectile
      dysfunction were excluded from the study. The data was
      assessed using the abridged, 5-item version of the
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Questions
      were also asked about libido, penile sensitivity, premature
      ejaculation, pain during intercourse and appearance before
      and after circumcision. IIEF-5 data was analysed using
      two-tailed paired t test to compare pre-operative and
      post-operative score changes across the study group. For the
      rest of the questions, data was analysed using &lsquo;Sign
      Test&rsquo;, calculating two-sided p values and 95%
      con-fidence intervals. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Fifty-nine
      percent of patients (88/150) responded. The total mean IIEF-5
      score was 22.41 8 0.94 and 21.13 8 3.17 before and after
      circumcision, respectively (p = 0.4). Seventy-four percent of
      patients had no change in their libido levels, 69% noticed
      less pain during intercourse (p ! 0.05), and 44% of the
      patients (p = 0.04) and 38% of the partners (p = 0.02)
      thought the penis appearance improved after circumcision.
      Penile sensation improved after circumcision in 38% (p =
      0.01) but got worse in 18%, with the remainder having no
      change. Overall satisfaction was 61%.
      <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Penile sensitivity had variable
      outcomes after circumcision. <span class="yellow">The poor
      outcome of circumcision considered by overall satisfaction
      rates suggests that when we circumcise men, these outcome
      data should be discussed during the informed consent
      process.</span></p>

      one and two.]</p>

      <h5>Introduction</h5>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision was performed 15,000 years ago
      for unknown reasons, but was thought to be a sacrificial rite
      [<a href="#n1">1, 2</a>]. It is still widely practised in the
      USA, although the national USA circumcision rate has dropped
      from 85% in 1980 to 59% in the mid 1990&rsquo;s [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>]. Similarly, in the UK the pro-circumcision
      views were popular in the 1930&rsquo;s and 1940&rsquo;s,
      especially in the upper social classes. This concept changed
      in the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s and more neutral
      attitudes occurred. Currently, only 1&ndash;2% of boys will
      need circumcision for medical reasons [<a
      href="#n4">4</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">In the UK, adult circumcision is routinely
      performed as a day case. Generally, when the adult male is
      informed about circumcision, he is only told about the
      immediate post-operative complications, whilst the long-term
      adverse effects of circumcision are less detailed.</p>

      <p class="text2">The subject of informed consent is highly
      topical because of clinical governance and medico-legal
      implications. It has been shown that training on how to
      obtain informed consent varies considerably [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. This is due to differing knowledge bases
      and the inconsistency amongst senior doctors. This emphasises
      how difficult it can be to explain even a minor
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Long-term adverse effects of circumcision
      have been studied from the psychological impact to the loss
      of sexual enjoyment by the patient and his partner [<a
      href="#n6">6, 7</a>]. However, there is controversy about the
      effect of circumcision on penile sensations and male sexual
      function. No consensus exists regarding the role of the
      foreskin in sexual performance and satisfaction. Gemmell and
      Boyle [<a href="#n8">8</a>] found that circumcised men had
      significantly less penile sensation compared with
      non-circumcised men; however others found this loss to be
      favourable as it gives them more control over orgasms [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>]. Four recent studies have shown conflicting
      results. Three of the studies did not show any significant
      effect on penile sensation and sexual function in adults [<a
      href="#n10">10&ndash;12</a>]. The fourth study showed that
      erectile function and penile sensitivity decreased but
      overall satisfaction improved after circumcision [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>] .</p>

      <p class="text2">Due to the high number of circumcisions
      performed in the UK and the controversy in the medical
      literature, we have performed the present study to assess
      men&rsquo;s experience in our area both before and after
      circumcision. This was intended to help surgeons who
      undertake circumcision to adequately inform their patients of
      the outcomes related to sexual intercourse and penile
      sensitivity.</p>

      <h5>Patients and Methods</h5>

      <p class="text3">One hundred and fifty men between the ages
      of 18 and 60 years were identified as having been circumcised
      between 1999 and 2002 by the sleeve technique. All these men
      were sexually active before and after surgery and had no
      history of erectile dysfunction. Patients with histological
      diagnosis of penile carcinoma and history of erectile
      dysfunction before circumcision were excluded. Ethical
      committee approval was obtained before conducting this
      study.</p>

      <p class="text3">Patients were asked to complete the
      abridged, 5-item version of the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF-5) [<a href="#n14">14</a>] ( table 1
      ). A modified questionnaire ( table 2 ) was also designed
      asking patients to compare pain during intercourse, penile
      sensations, libido, premature ejaculation and cosmetic
      appearance for the patients and the partner before and after
      the circumcision as well as overall satisfaction after
      circumcision ( table 2 ). A free text comments box was also
      provided. The data was collated and cross-referenced with all
      other patient information.</p>

      <p class="text3">Case notes of all patients who responded to
      the questionnaire were reviewed to assess the indication for
      the procedure, grade of surgeon, any complexity at surgery,
      histological diagnosis and any post-operative surgical
      complications. The questionnaire was completed after a
      minimum of 3 months after circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text3"><i>Statistics</i><br />
       &emsp;&emsp; Two-tailed paired t test was used to compare
      pre-operative and post-operative IIEF-5 score changes across
      the study group ( table 1 ). For the modified questionnaire (
      table 2 ), the &lsquo;Sign test&rsquo; with 95% confidence
      interval was used to assess the statistical difference [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>] . The &lsquo;Sign test&rsquo; tests the
      null hypothesis that, within the relevant population of men
      having a circumcision, the number with better outcomes is
      equal to the number with worse outcomes. Consequently, those
      who respond &lsquo;Same&rsquo; contribute nothing to
      answering this question and so are ignored. The
      &lsquo;two-sided&rsquo; p value was calculated, which relates
      to the alternative hypothesis that, within the population,
      the number of &lsquo;better&rsquo; and &lsquo;worse&rsquo;
      responses are unequal. Several of the tests were significant
      at the 5% level at least due to there being significantly
      more reporting &lsquo;better&rsquo; than reporting
      &lsquo;worse&rsquo; for a number of the questions.</p>

      <h5>Results</h5>

      <p class="text2">Eighty-eight of 150 patients responded to
      the questionnaire (response rate 59%). Four patients were
      excluded because they only partially completed the
      questionnaire. questionnaire. Of the 84 (56%) patients
      included in this study, 80 patients were white British men
      and 4 of Asian origin. All had sexual intercourse before and
      after circumcision. Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) and
      phimosis due to chronic inflammation/balanitis
      (histologically diagnosed) were the commonest reasons for
      circumcision (BXO = 39%, chronic inflammation/chronic
      balanitis 33%, Zoon&rsquo;s balanitis 2% and for 25% the
      specimen was not sent for histology as the foreskin was
      merely tight but did not appear scarred/inflamed or grossly
      diseased).</p>

      <p class="text2">The age distribution was: 18&ndash;25 years
      = 4.7%; 26&ndash;35 years = 23.8%; 36&ndash;45 years = 30.9%;
      46&ndash;55 years = 29.7%, and 56&ndash;60 years = 10.7%.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mean total IIEF-5 score of the 84
      patients at baseline was 22.41 &plusmn; 0.94 compared to
      21.13 &plusmn; 3.17 after circumcision. The difference
      between pre- and post-circumcision patients was not
      statistically significant (p = 0.4). There was a significant
      improvement in pain/discomfort during intercourse and
      erection after circumcision (p &lt; 0.05). Only 18% of the
      patients complained about loss of/or altered penile
      sensation, whereas 38% found better sensation (p = 0.01).
      Libido was unaffected in 74%. Sixty-four percent had no
      problem with premature ejaculation before or after
      circumcision. <span class="yellow">Only 13% reported
      improvement in premature ejaculation, whereas 33% found it
      worse.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Forty-four percent of patients (p = 0.04)
      and 38% of their partners (p = 0.02) were happy with the
      appearance of the penis after circumcision. Sixty-one percent
      were satisfied with the circumcision (p = 0.04).</p>

      <p class="text2">Fourteen patients (17%) were not satisfied
      with the circumcision, but only 1 patient in this group had
      any obvious post-operative complications (bleeding). The
      histological diagnosis in this group was chronic inflammation
      (n = 4) and BXO (n = 2). No histology was available for 8
      patients.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: The great majority of the men
      in this study had benign disease of the prepuce. The before
      and after comparison for most of the men compares the
      condition of having a diseased prepuce to the condition of
      having no prepuce. This study does not indicate the
      comparison of the condition having a healthy prepuce to the
      condition of having a no prepuce.]</p>

      <h5>Discussion</h5>

      <p class="text2">Over 20,000 circumcisions per year are
      performed in the National Health Service in the UK
      (www.menshealth forum.co.uk). Medical indications for this
      procedure include phimosis, paraphimosis, recurrent balanitis
      and posthitis (inflammation of the prepuce). Although it is a
      simple procedure, a patient should be counselled about the
      associated morbidity. Generally, patients are informed of the
      immediate post-operative complications, including bleeding,
      haematoma and infection, whereas the long-term consequences
      of the operation are rarely discussed. <span
      class="yellow">As informed consent is an integral part of
      health care provision, matters such as reduction of penile
      sensation, reduced sexual satisfaction and worsening of
      erectile function should all be addressed.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1920, Sigmund Freud [<a
      href="#n16">16</a>] stated that circumcision was a substitute
      for castration, suggesting a possible connection between
      castration fears, neuroses and circumcision. Many studies
      have shown the presence of thousands of erogenous nerve
      endings on the inner layer of the foreskin [<a
      href="#n17">17, 18</a>]. Hammond [<a href="#n19">19</a>]
      described that circumcised men, men with intact short
      foreskin and those who keep their foreskin retracted have
      greater keratinisation of the glans epithelium. This
      keratinisation causes reduction of the penile sensation,
      hence reducing enjoyment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Fink et al. [<a href="#n13">13</a>] have
      recently shown that adult circumcision is associated with a
      significant decrease in erectile function and penile
      sensation. However, as with our study, approximately 62% of
      their patients were satisfied after a circumcision. Laumann
      et al. [<a href="#n20">20</a>] analysed the data from a
      survey that included 1,410 men. They found that uncircumcised
      men were more likely to experience sexual dysfunction,
      especially later in life. Collins et al. [<a
      href="#n">10</a>] conducted a prospective study where 15
      adult men were asked to complete a questionnaire before and
      12 weeks after circumcision. They did not find any clinically
      important adverse effects of circumcision on sexual
      function.</p>

      <p class="text2">To evaluate the effects of circumcision,
      Bleustein et al. [<a href="#n11">11</a>] tested 36
      circumcised and 43 uncircumcised men for level of vibration
      (Biothesiometer), pressure (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments),
      spatial perception (Tactile Circumferential Discriminator),
      and warm and cold thermal thresholds (Physitemp NTE-2) in the
      large and small axon nerve fibres in the dorsal midline glans
      penis. They demonstrated that there were no significant
      differences in penile sensation between circumcised and
      uncircumcised men with respect to vibration, spatial
      perception, pressure, warm and cold thermal thresholds in
      patients with and without erectile dysfunction. A recently
      published study by Enkul et al. [<a href="#n12">12</a>] has
      again shown that adult circumcision does not adversely affect
      sexual function. In our study the difference between the mean
      total IIEF-5 score before and after circumcision was not
      significant. Only 18% of our patients complained about
      decreased sensation after circumcision as compared to 38% who
      experienced improved sensation (p = 0.01), with 44% who had
      no change.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision affecting the sexual pleasure
      of the female partner has been studied by O&rsquo;Hara and
      O&rsquo;Hara [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. Their survey found that
      women preferred vaginal intercourse with an uncircumcised
      man. In our study 38% of female partners found improvement in
      cosmetic appearance after circumcision (p = 0.02) compared to
      19% who found the appearance worse. Similarly, 44% of the men
      in this study were pleased with the appearance of their penis
      (p = 0.04) compared to 25% of men who were unhappy. In the
      present study there is significant improvement in discomfort
      and pain after circumcision (p = 0.04). <span
      class="yellow">This can be easily explained by the fact that
      these patients had a diseased and tight foreskin, which made
      intercourse painful before circumcision.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision was previously believed to
      improve premature ejaculation and help prolong intercourse,
      but we were unable to find this effect [<a href="#n9">9,
      21</a>]. <span class="yellow">Only 13% of our patients
      reported improvement whereas 33% found the problem had gotten
      worse.</span> Sixty-one percent of our patients were
      satisfied and pleased (p = 0.05) with circumcision compared
      with 17% who were unhappy after circumcision. Of the 17%
      patients who were unsatisfied, 1 patient complained of a
      significant loss of penile sensation, commenting in
      retrospect that he would not have undergone surgery had he
      known. Of the 14 unsatisfied patients only 2 had scarred
      foreskins due to BXO (histological diagnosis). This
      demonstrates that there are fewer unsatisfied patients when
      the circumcision is done for diseased foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">As 17% of patients in the present study were
      unsatisfied, we raise the important issue of informed
      consent. The medical literature regularly shows that
      incomplete information is conveyed by the surgeons or
      understood by the patient. Studies have shown that physicians
      routinely underestimate the patient&rsquo;s desire for
      information and there is a significant discrepancy between
      what physicians assume a patient wants to know and what the
      patient actually expects [<a href="#n22">22</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">We have demonstrated that in adults,
      circumcision does not appear to have significant adverse
      effect on sexual function. <span class="yellow">In spite of
      that we suggest that before circumcision, men should be
      warned of the long-term consequences (penile sensations and
      effect on erectile function) as well as be talked through the
      more traditional subjects (peri-operative
      complications).</span></p>
