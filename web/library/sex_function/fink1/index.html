      <p class="abstract">Purpose: Evidence concerning the effect
      of circumcision on sexual function is lacking. <span
      class="yellow">Men circumcised as adults are potentially in a
      unique position to comment on the effect of a prepuce on
      sexual intercourse.</span> We examine sexual function
      outcomes in men who have experienced sexual intercourse in
      the uncircumcised and circumcised states.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Materials and Methods: Men 18 years old
      or older when circumcised were identified by billing records
      during a 5-year period at an academic medical center. Medical
      charts were reviewed for confirmation of the procedure and to
      identify the indication(s). These men were surveyed to assess
      erectile function, penile sensitivity, sexual activity and
      overall satisfaction. Data were analyzed using paired t tests
      to compare category scores before and after circumcision.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Results: A total of 123 men were
      circumcised as adults. Indications for circumcision included
      phimosis in 64% of cases, balanitis in 17%, condyloma in 10%,
      redundant foreskin in 9% and elective in 7%. The response
      rate was 44% among potential responders. Mean age of
      responders was 42 years at circumcision and 46 years at
      survey. <span class="yellow">Adult circumcision appears to
      result in worsened erectile function (p = 0.01), decreased
      penile sensitivity (p = 0.08),</span> no change in sexual
      activity (p = 0.22) and improved satisfaction (p = 0.04). Of
      the men 50% reported benefits and 38% reported harm. Overall,
      62% of men were satisfied with having been circumcised.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Conclusions: Our findings may help
      urologists better counsel men undergoing circumcision as
      adults. Prospective studies are needed to better understand
      the relationship between circumcision and sexual
      function.</p>

      <p><span class="navy"><b>[CIRP note: Most (84%) of the men in
      this study had a preexisting problem of phimosis, balanitis,
      or condyloma. There was no clear sample of normal, healthy,
      intact men for comparison. Even so, thirty-eight percent of
      the circumcised men were dissatisfied with the results of
      their circumcision.]</b></span></p>

      <p class="text">Scientific information that physicians can
      use as a basis for recommending or not recommending
      circumcision in neonates or adults is limited. Controversy
      surrounding neonatal circumcision continues to exist. Neither
      the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of
      Family Physicians nor American Urological Association has a
      specific recommendation endorsing or opposing
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> However, these
      organizations do have policy statements on circumcision
      recommending the unbiased discussion of the evidence
      regarding this procedure. The evidence concerning the effect
      of circumcision on sexual function is lacking.</p>

      <p class="text">Beliefs differ on how circumcision affects
      the sensitivity of the glans and pleasure with sexual
      intercourse. Some believe that circumcision results in
      diminished sensitivity of the glans,<sup><a href="#n1">1,
      4</a></sup> whereas others believe that it results in more
      pleasurable sexual intercourse.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5-7</a></sup> A study by Pienkos, a military
      surgeon who surveyed men requesting circumcision during the
      Korean War, revealed that men requested circumcision with the
      expectation of improved sexual satisfaction.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> The sensitivity of the glans and
      pleasure with sexual intercourse as dependent on the presence
      of foreskin have received little formal investigation.
      Masters and Johnson performed neurological testing on the
      glans of circumcised and uncircumcised men finding no
      significant difference in sensation.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> To our knowledge no study in this
      regard has been conducted on men undergoing circumcisions as
      adults.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Men who have undergone
      circumcision as adults are potentially in a unique position
      to comment on the effect of a prepuce on sexual

      sensitivity, sexual activity and overall satisfaction in men
      who have experienced sexual intercourse in the uncircumcised
      and circumcised states.</p>

        METHODS
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="text"><i>Participants.</i> We identified men who
      were circumcised at age 18 years or older by reviewing
      billing records at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill Medical Center between January 1, 1995 and December 31,
      1999 for Current Procedural Terminology code 54161. Medical
      charts were reviewed to confirm that the procedure had been
      done and to determine the indications. We then developed a
      survey in-strument to gather additional information. The
      institutional review board at the University of North
      Carolina at Chapel Hill approved this study.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Survey instrument.</i> We investigated the
      effect of circumcision on erectile function, penile
      sensitivity, sexual activity and overall satisfaction.
      Existing indexes, scales and questionnaires were reviewed for
      ability to evaluate these categories. Although certain
      individual questions were applicable, no instrument had been
      specifically designed to evaluate these sexual function
      outcomes. Items from the International Index of Erectile
      Function, Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, Brief
      Sexual Function Questionnaire, Center for Marital and Sexual
      Health Functioning Questionnaire, and National Health and
      Social Life Survey were included or adapted.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9-13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The survey contained questions to obtain
      demographic information (age, race), co-morbidities
      (depression, diabetes, heart disease) and basic sexual
      histories (sexual orientation, sexual activity before and
      after circumcision). To evaluate sexual function outcomes we
      used Likert scales ranging from 1 to 5 to measure strength of
      agreement/disagreement with statements and to quantify the
      frequency of specific sexual practices. We asked responses
      for before and after circumcision. We also included open
      ended questions to gather descriptive information about
      perceived benefits and harms, and any general comments.</p>

      <p class="text">Discussions were held with men who had
      undergone adult circumcision to identify issues important to
      them. Their input helped us decide what types of questions to
      include in the survey. Once designed, the survey was
      pretested and modifications were made. The anonymous surveys
      were coded to allow tracking. Addresses were obtained from
      billing information. After the first mailing 3 successive
      mailings were sent to nonresponders.</p>

      <p class="text"><i>Statistical analysis.</i> We compared
      responders to nonresponders by age at circumcision and age at
      survey using paired t tests. We used chi-square goodness of
      fit analysis to compare indication and Pearson's chi-square
      test for race. We then limited further analysis to
      heterosexual men to enhance internal validity of the study.
      We analyzed all heterosexual responders together to find the
      overall effect of circumcision on all men, and we also
      analyzed the subgroup of men who had sex with the same
      partner before and after circumcision to control for
      different sexual experiences with different partners.</p>

      <p class="text">For individual items on the survey we
      performed paired t tests on the Likert scores before and
      after circumcision. The Likert scores for 3 items were
      combined to yield each of the 4 category scores of sexual
      function outcomes, such that all categories had a potential
      maximum score of 15. The survey items used to calculate each
      category score are shown in the Appendix. Sample size was not
      sufficiently large to perform factor analyses. Items were
      grouped into a priori categories based on similarity of
      content. Higher scores for all of the categories represent
      increases, and so for some items the Likert scale scoring was
      reversed. Therefore, all responders had 4 category scores for
      sexual function before and 4 scores for after circumcision.
      We used paired t tests to compare each category score before
      and after circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">We adjusted for age by performing linear
      regression in which the outcome was the category score after
      circumcision, the main exposure was the category score before
      circumcision, and the potential covariable was the difference
      between the age at survey and age at circumcision. The age at
      survey differed from the age at circumcision by the time
      elapsed since the procedure. Since men served as their own
      controls, we were able to adjust for age by using change in
      age. We compared the prevalence of co-morbidities before and
      after circumcision using McNemar's chi-square test, and since
      they did not differ significantly, we did not otherwise
      adjust for them. All statistical analyses were performed
      using Stata 6.0 (Stata Corporation 1999, College Station,
      Texas).</p>

        RESULTS
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="text">From billing records 133 patients were
      identified as having had adult circumcisions and 123 of these
      procedures were confirmed on chart review. The indications
      for the procedures are shown in table 1. Phimosis was the
      most common indication, 9 men (7%) underwent an elective
      procedure and 1 man was circumcised for penile cancer. Of the
      123 surveys initially mailed 5 were returned by family
      members indicating that the patient was dead. Another 20
      surveys were returned by the postal service because the
      address was incorrect and no forwarding information existed.
      A total of 43 completed surveys were returned for a response
      rate of 44% for potential responders and a rate of 35% for
      all patients having undergone adult circumcision.</p>

      <p class="image"><img src="table1.gif" height="212"
      width="523" alt="Table one" /></p>

      <p class="text">The responders were representative of
      nonresponders by age at circumcision, age at survey and
      indication, but not by race (table 2). No Hispanic men
      responded. Of the responders 40 (93%) identified themselves
      as heterosexual and no men reported that they were bisexual.
      Of all responders 90% had had sex before the procedure, 86%
      had sex after the procedure, and 79% had sex before and after
      the circumcision, including 72% had sex before and after with
      the same partner. Those who had sex after circumcision waited
      an average of 9 weeks.</p>

      <p class="text">Compared to before circumcision, men reported
      reduced erectile function, decreased penile sensitivity, no
      change in sexual activity and improved satisfaction after
      circumcision (table 3). We found essentially the same trends,
      although the magnitude differed, among the subgroup of men
      who had sex with the same partner before and after
      circumcision except that these men experienced increased
      sexual activity.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The reduction in
      erectile function was statistically significant. Some men
      were unable to have erection after the procedure but even
      those who were able to have sex with the same partner before
      and after the procedure reported worsened erectile function.
      This difference remained significant when adjusted for age
      and co-morbidities. Some comments were: "Erections are
      shorter time now." "Penis smaller. Now have erectile
      dysfunction."</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The reported decrease in
      penile sensitivity that resulted from circumcision bordered
      on statistical significance. Men who had sex with the same
      partner before and after circumcision reported greater
      reduction in penile sensitivity than other men.</span> How
      men viewed the decreased penile sensitivity differed:
      "Somewhat less sensitivity helps prolong intercourse." " I
      had been warned that I would lose sensitivity, but overall, I
      feel that I was not completely informed."</p>

      <p class="text">The all responders group reported worsened
      erectile function and decreased penile sensation, as well as
      decrease in sexual activity that was not statistically
      significant. However, men in the same partner group actually
      reported increased sexual activity but this too was not
      statistically significant. The comments were mixed: "No sex
      drive." "Sex is a lot better."</p>

      <p class="image"><img src="table2.gif" height="351"
      width="526" alt="Table two" /></p>

      <p class="text">A higher satisfaction score represented a
      more pleasing appearance of the penis and less pain. After
      circumcision there was a statistically significant
      improvement in how men thought the penis looked to them and
      to their partners, and a reduction in pain experienced with
      erection. "It don't hurt to have intercourse or get an
      erection." "More pleasing to look at." "I feel like I have a
      penis that I'm proud of now." After circumcision men were
      more likely to have their partners start sexual activity with
      them, more likely to receive oral sex, and as likely to
      perform anal sex, try different sexual positions and
      masturbate, but none of these changes was statistically
      significant. The subgroup of men who had sex with the same
      partner before and after circumcision were more likely to
      have their partners start sexual activity with them (p =
      0.05), more likely to receive oral sex (p = 0.08) as likely
      to perform anal sex and masturbate, and more likely to try
      different sexual positions (p = 0.33).</p>

      <p class="image"><img src="table3.gif" height="307"
      width="550" alt="Table three" /></p>

      <p class="text">Of the responders 47% reported that sex was
      physically more pleasurable and 47% also said that their sex
      lives were more satisfying after circumcision. Additional
      comments included improved penis cleanliness and easier
      voiding after circumcision. When asked generally about
      benefits and harms, 50% reported a perceived benefit or
      improvement, and 38% reported a perceived problem or
      difficulty as a result of the procedure. Overall, 62% of men
      were satisfied with having been circumcised.</p>

      <center>
        DISCUSSION
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="text">Although many have speculated about the
      effect of a foreskin on sexual function, the current state of
      knowledge is based on anecdote rather than scientific
      evidence. Myths have mostly addressed changes in penile
      sensitivity but some have also regarded sexual activity and
      satisfaction with appearance. Little has been written about
      the effect of circumcision on erectile function. Few studies
      have investigated the relationship between male circumcision
      and sexual function.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Pleasure with sexual activity could mean
      enjoyment of the shared sexual act and being a good sexual
      partner, or it could reflect a pleasing sensation from
      physical stimulation. Many believe that circumcision reduces
      penile sensitivity<sup><a href="#n1">1, 4</a></sup> but some
      believe that it prolongs intercourse <sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and provides greater pleasure during
      sexual intercourse.<sup><a href="#n5">5-7</a></sup> Theories
      to explain the decreased sensitivity are that the epithelium
      of a circumcised glans becomes cornified <sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and sensory nerve receptors in the
      glans become desensitized from constant stimulation.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Taylor et al offer a histologically
      based theory on how the prepuce enhances sensitivity through
      it's "<a href="http://research.cirp.org/"
      target="_blank">ridged band</a>."<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/masters.htm"
      target="_blank">Masters and Johnson</a> performed
      exteroceptive and light tactile discrimination on the ventral
      and dorsal surfaces of the penis, with particular attention
      to the glans, of circumcised and uncircumcised men finding no
      clinically significant difference.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> We found a statistically significant
      decrease in penile sensation following circumcision in men
      but our respondents had mixed feelings. Some responders
      appeared to be better able to satisfy their partners after
      circumcision but some men were not satisfied with the
      decreased sensation of physical stimulation. It seems that
      sexual pleasure means different things to different men and
      should be more specifically defined in future studies.</p>

      <p class="text">Although 1 myth concerning the appearance of
      the penis is that the uncovered glans is more aesthetically
      pleasing,<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> some parents decide
      to have the newborns circumcised because they believe it will
      make him look better.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> In a
      survey of college women 87% expressed preference for pictures
      of circumcised over uncircumcised penises.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> We found that the men in our study
      and their partners were more likely to think that the penis
      looked good after circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">Laumann et al analyzed data from the National
      Health and Social Life Survey and found that circumcised men
      were slightly less likely to experience sexual dysfunction
      and were somewhat more likely to engage in more elaborate
      sexual practices, such as oral sex, anal sex and masturbation
      than uncircumcised men.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">We found that circumcised men were instead
      more likely to have erectile dysfunction. Our study
      populations differ in that we evaluated men circumcised as
      adults but the worsened erectile function remained when
      adjusted for age and the presence of diabetes, depression and
      cardiovascular disease. A few men reported concern that the
      penis was smaller after circumcision. Perhaps circumcision in
      some men is psychologically traumatic and interferes with
      erectile function. Like Laumann et al, we found increased
      frequency of oral sex in men after circumcision but we found
      no change in the frequency of anal sex or
      masturbation.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Because this study was cross-sectional rather
      than prospective, it is limited by recall bias. However, the
      directionality of that bias is unclear. Since we did not
      assess men's expectations before they were circumcised, we
      are unable to comment on how their expectations might have
      affected their biases. Another limitation is that men may
      have been recalling sexual experiences before circumcision
      when suffering from the medical problem that was the
      indication for the procedure. However, if circumcision was
      supposed to correct the problem then we would have expected
      entirely favorable outcomes. Instead we found worsened
      erectile function and decreased penile sensitivity.</p>

      <p class="text">Our small sample size reduces the power of
      the study and, therefore, the ability to detect small but
      significant changes and, although responders to the survey
      appear similar to nonresponders, generalizeability may be
      limited. Our analysis of only responders and of men who
      underwent circumcision rather than alternative treatments
      creates potential for selection bias. This study is patient
      oriented and analyzes subjective reports. Objective data,
      such as duplex Doppler ultrasound and penile biothesiometry,
      are needed to assess erectile function and penile sensation
      before definitive conclusions can be made. Since we studied
      circumcision in adults, our findings may not be
      generalizeable to neonatal circumcision. Our survey
      instrument was not formally tested for reliability or
      validity.</p>

        CONCLUSIONS
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="text">To our knowledge we present the first study
      to evaluate specifically men who experienced sexual
      intercourse in the uncircumcised and circumcised states.
      Although our study has some methodological limitations, it
      contributes to our knowledge about the effect and outcomes of
      adult circumcision. <span class="yellow">We found that adult
      circumcision appears to result in worsened erectile function,
      decreased penile sensitivity and improved satisfaction.
      Overall, the majority of men were satisfied that they had
      undergone circumcision which suggests that in this population
      factors in addition to sexual function affect
      satisfaction.</span> Our findings may help urologists better
      counsel men about adult circumcision. Prospective studies,
      including those with objective measurements, are needed to
      better understand the relationship between circumcision and
      sexual function.</p>
