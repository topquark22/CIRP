      <h2>The effect of male circumcision on sexuality</h2>

      <p><b>DaiSik Kim and Myung-Geol Pang</b></p>

      <div class="section">
        OBJECTIVE
      </div>

      <p>To prospectively study, using a questionnaire, the
      sexuality of men circumcised as adults compared to
      uncircumcised men, and to compare their sex lives before and
      after circumcision.</p>

      <div class="section">
        SUBJECTS AND METHODS
      </div>

      <p>The study included 373 sexually active men, of whom 255
      were circumcised and 118 were not. Of the 255 circumcised
      men, 138 had been sexually active before circumcision, and
      all were circumcised at &gt;20 years of age. As the Brief
      Male Sexual Function Inventory does not specifically address
      the quality of sex life, questions were added to compare
      sexual and masturbatory pleasure before and after
      circumcision.</p>

      <div class="section">
        RESULTS
      </div>

      <p>There were no significant differences in sexual drive,
      erection, ejaculation, and ejaculation latency time between
      circumcised and uncircumcised men. Masturbatory pleasure
      decreased after circumcision in 48% of the respondents, while
      8% reported increased pleasure. Masturbatory difficulty
      increased after circumcision in 63% of the respondents but
      was easier in 37%. About 6% answered that their sex lives
      improved, while 20% reported a worse sex life after
      circumcision.</p>

      <div class="section">
        CONCLUSION
      </div>

      <p><span class="yellow">There was a decrease in masturbatory
      pleasure and sexual enjoyment after circumcision, indicating
      that adult circumcision adversely affects sexual function in
      many men,</span> possibly because of <a
      href="/library/complications/">complications of the
      surgery</a> and a <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">loss of
      nerve endings</a>.</p>
