      <h2>Circumcision in Adults: Effect on Sexual Function</h2>
      <i>TO THE EDITOR:</i> 

      <p class="text2">Senkul <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> surveyed young men of military age in
      Turkey before and after elective circumcision. They reported,
      &ldquo;Adult circumcision does not <i>adversely</i> affect
      sexual function,&rdquo; although a significant increase in
      ejaculatory latency times was recorded. Unfortunately, older
      men, in whom problems may be more likely to occur, were not
      included in the study.</p>

      <p class="text2">This survey was carried out in Turkey. Male
      circumcision is deeply woven into the fabric of Turkish
      society.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Turks consider that
      one is not a man until one is circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Culture is a confounding factor in
      studies regarding circumcision,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      and this study does not escape the influence of culture.
      Goldman<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> reports:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Defending circumcision requires minimizing
        or dismissing the harm and producing overstated medical
        claims about protection from future harm. The ongoing
        denial requires the acceptance of false beliefs and
        misunderstandings of facts. Cultural conformity is a major
        force perpetuating non-religious circumcision, and to a
        greater degree, religious circumcision. The avoidance of
        guilt and the reluctance to acknowledge the mistake and all
        that that implies help to explain the tenacity with which
        the practice is defended.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">The claim that &ldquo;adult circumcision
      does not <i>adversely</i> affect sexual function&rdquo; is a
      value judgment rooted in the culture of Turkey.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Other researchers may consider an
      increase in ejaculatory times to be adverse.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other authors&rsquo; findings that
      circumcision <i>does</i> affect sexual function are helpful.
      Earlier work by Winkelmann<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      showed that the foreskin is the site of the mucocutaneous
      region and that closely packed end organs extend from the
      distal end of the prepuce back to the hairy skin. Winkelmann
      characterized this as a <i>specific erogenous zone</i>.
      Taylor <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> subjected
      the prepuce to anatomic examination. They found a previously
      unknown structure, which they called the <i>ridged band</i>,
      of highly vascularized and innervated tissue just inside the
      tip of the prepuce and near the mucocutaneous boundary.
      Penile nerves provide sensory input to both the central and
      sympathetic nervous systems.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      Waldinger<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> reports that an
      ejaculatory circuit exists in the central nervous system that
      controls ejaculation. Winkelmann<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> observed, &ldquo;Certain pathologic
      states might be explicable on the basis of diminished or
      augmented cutaneous nerve supply.&rdquo; The excision of the
      ridged band nerve plexus by circumcision and consequent
      diminishment of sensory input would explain the increase in
      ejaculatory times reported by Senkul <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Senkul <i>et al.</i> failed to ask the
      crucial question, &ldquo;Is sexual pleasure increased or
      decreased by circumcision?&rdquo; Another study, carried out
      in a different culture (America) answers that question.
      Denniston<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> carried out a survey
      of 38 adult males who were circumcised at least 2 years after
      they commenced sexual intercourse. <span
      class="yellow">Thirteen men felt that sexual intercourse was
      better after circumcision, but 22 felt that intercourse was
      worse and would not have the circumcision again, because of
      loss of sexual pleasure.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">There are ethical concerns regarding the
      nontherapeutic circumcision of minors.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Elective circumcision should be
      restricted to adult males who, after being fully informed of
      the diminution of sensory input and pleasure associated with
      circumcision, <i>personally</i> give their <i>informed</i>
      consent.</p>
