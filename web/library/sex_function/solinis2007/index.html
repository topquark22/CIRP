      <p><b>Background:</b> The aim of the study was to compare
      sexual life and enjoyment of men (and their partner) that
      were circumcised as adults before and after their
      circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> The study included 123 sexually active men
      that were circumcised two years before or more. The mean age
      was 36 years (22&ndash; 64). All the men filled a
      questionnaire about the quality of their sexual life and the
      sexual enjoyment before and after circumcision. Also, there
      were questions about partner&rsquo;s sexual life improvement.
      The results are presented below.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> 16% answered that their sex life was
      improved, while 35% reported a worse sex life after
      circumcision. There were no significant differences in
      erection and ejaculation. 65% reported that the ejaculation
      latency time increased significantly after circumcision but
      only 10% of them reported that this fact improved sexual
      life. 46% of men reported that their partner&rsquo;s sexual
      life worsened after circumcision, 33% reported that their
      partner&rsquo;s sexual life improved and 21% reported no
      significant difference.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> There was a decrease in couple&rsquo;s
      sexual life after circumcision indicating that adult
      circumcision adversely affects sexual function in many men
      or/and their partners, possibly because of complications of
      surgery and loss of nerve endings. The results support the
      view that physicians and parents should be informed of the
      potential benefits and risks before newborns are
      circumcised.</p>
