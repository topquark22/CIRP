      <p class="abstext">Oxidizing agents such as prilocaine are
      the most common cause of acquired toxic methemoglobinemia.
      Use of prilocaine for circumcision as a local anesthesia may
      lead to toxic methemoglobinemia in newborns and early
      infancy. It is characterized by an acute onset of cyanosis
      and diagnosis should be treated with methylene blue. We
      present three infants who developing methemoglobinemia soon
      after circumcision. They were treated successfully by
      methylene blue orally and ascorbic acid intravenously. <span

      <p class="heading">Introduction</p>

      <p class="text2">Hemoglobin is categorized as methemoglobin
      if the iron of heme is oxidized to ferric (Fe<sup>+3</sup>)
      form. Methemoglobinemia is characterized by increased
      quantities of ferric iron containing hemoglobin over 1%. It
      is characterized clinically by cyanosis. Cyanosis suggests
      hypoxia in an infant or newborn. Several factors including
      hematological, cardiac or respiratory may be a cause of
      hypoxia. Since methemoglobin is useless as an oxygen carrier,
      it causes a varying degree of cyanosis. Methemoglobinemia may
      arise from hereditary disorders, but exposure to medication
      is the most common cause of methemoglobinemia.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> We report cyanosis developing in three
      cases in newborns and early infancy due to use of prilocaine
      hydrochloride as a local anesthetic during circumcision.</p>

      <p class="heading">Case Reports</p>

      <p class="text2">Twenty-nine-day-old, 40-day-old and
      3-month-old male infants were admitted with cyanosis. In
      their history, cyanosis appeared 60, 180, 30 minutes after
      prilocaine injection. <span class="yellow">Prior to
      circumcision, approximately 5 ml (5, 4 and 5 mg/kg
      respectively) prilocaine hydrochloride (Citanest&reg; 0.5%)
      had been injected subcutaneous as local anesthesia to all
      patients.</span> All of them had normal gestation and a
      history of uneventful spontaneous vaginal delivery. No
      abnormality was established in their physical examination
      except for cyanosis. Their arterial blood gases were within
      normal ranges. Glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenases of all
      patients were normal. Chest radiograms and electrocardiograms
      were normal. Hemoglobin levels were 8.5 g/dl, 9 g/dl and 10.9
      g/dl respectively. Methemoglobin levels were 20%, 29%, 27%
      respectively. Other biochemical analyses including renal and
      liver function tests were normal. Dextrose (5%) containing
      saline fluid intravenously was started to all patients and
      1mg/kg of methylene blue orally plus ascorbic acid
      intravenously (100 mg/kg once a day) were given. Cyanosis
      completely disappeared at the 90, 100, 110 minutes of
      treatment respectively.</p>

      <p class="heading">Discussion</p>

      <p class="text2">Carrying of oxygen by hemoglobin to the
      tissues is vital. Methemoglobin has less oxygen carrying
      capability than functional hemoglobin. Heme iron autoxidized
      by several oxidant factors converts hemoglobin to
      methemoglobin during circulation.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Erythrocytes have some mechanisms to
      convert oxidized heme iron to normal ferrous
      (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) state. The major mechanism for this
      conversion is soluble NADH cytochrome b<sub>5</sub>
      reductase.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Deficiency of NADH
      cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase and several abnormal
      hemoglobin variant as designated hemoglobin M may cause
      hereditary methemoglobinemias.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Methemoglobinemia manifests clinically by
      cyanosis if more than 1% of the hemoglobin pool is oxidized
      to the ferric form.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> It is well
      tolerated to methemoglobin concentration to 10%-20% but above
      70% may cause death.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Because of
      lower activity of NADH cytochrome b 5 reductase in
      erythrocytes from infants aged less than 3 months, this age
      group may be more susceptible for methemoglobinemia.<sup><a
      href="#n3">4,5</a></sup> As with our cases, the most common
      cause of methemoglobinemia is medication. Ingestion or
      exposures of skin or mucous membranes to oxidizing agents
      lead to methemoglobinemia.<sup><a href="#n1">1,6</a></sup>
      Prilocaine as a local anesthetic is a well known oxidizing
      agent. It leads to an increase of methemoglobin concentration
      in 1 to 6-year-old children.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      Previously, Kara et al<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> and
      Ozbek et al reported cases developing methemoglobinemia after
      prilocaine injection during newborn and infancy. They treated
      them with intravenous methylene blue. Unfortunately, because
      we could not find intravenous form of methylene blue, we had
      to give oral form. Although methylene blue is an oxidant, its
      reducing metabolic product is leukomethylene blue responsible
      for converting to ferric (Fe<sup>+3</sup>) iron to ferrous
      (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) state.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      Dextrose should be given because it is a major source of NADH
      in erytrocytes.<sup><a href="#n">1</a></sup> Ascorbic acid
      decreased methemoglobin formation and can be used in
      treatment.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Use of prilocaine is
      common during minor surgery in infancy and childhood.
      Circumcision during newborn and early infancy is a common
      religious practice especially in the Jewish and Islamic
      populations in our country (Turkey).</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">In conclusion,
      methemoglobinemia, a life-threatening condition, usually
      arises from use of oxidizing agents such as prilocaine in
      newborns and during early childhood, because infants less
      than 3 months of age are more susceptible to
      prilocaine.</span> Physicians should be careful with this age
      group. When diagnosed, methylene blue should be given
      immediately.</p>
