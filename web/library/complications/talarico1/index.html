      CIRCUMCISION</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is probably the most commonly
      performed operation.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> With the
      evolution of a more sophisticated society and the
      presentation of ideas associating preputial tissue and smegma
      with neoplasia and psychological problems, circumcision has
      been increasingly requested and demanded. Accordingly the
      vast number of circumcisions, either ritualistic or cosmetic
      have led to a gradually increasing number of complications,
      such as meatal stenosis and ulcer, hemorrhage, sepsis,
      denudation of penile skin, laceration, glandular injuries,
      gangrene, preputial cysts and fistula. Recently we
      encountered a case of concealed penis which was detected when
      the child was 5 weeks old. A review of the literature
      revealed 4 previously recorded cases.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="section">CASE HISTORY</p>

      <p class="text2">Shortly after the spontaneous delivery of a
      normal-appearing boy, urologic consultation was requested
      because of a small penis. Examination revealed an
      exceptionally deep prepubertal fat pad with a penis that was
      normal on palpation. Circumcision was performed with the
      Hollister-Plastibell. When the child was 5 weeks old he was
      examined by the pediatrician because his mother could not
      find his penis. Examination revealed normal scrotal
      development with a rather deep prepubertal fat pad and an
      area of erythema, puckering and scar tissue. There was a pin
      point opening (fig. 1, <i>A</i>) through which a fine stream
      of crystal clear urine could be expressed with pressure. The
      penis could be palpated beneath the tissue.</p>

             <small>Fig 1. <i>A</i>, concealed penis 5 weeks
            post-neonatal circumcision. <i>B</i>, adhesions
            disrupted</small></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Exploration via transverse incisions on
      either side of the opening exposed the glans which had some
      adhesions around the site of circumcision. These adhesions
      were disrupted (fig. 1, <i>B</i>) and the edges of the
      transverse incisions were sutured to the mucosa at the
      coronal sulcus.</p>

      <center>
        <table width="212" summary="figure 2">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="talarico1-fig2.gif" width="210"
            height="217" alt="Figure two" /><br />

            readily visible.</small></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Postoperatively, the mother was taught to
      clean the area and to retract the deep prepubertal fat pad
      from the glans. When the child was 11 months old the glans
      was freenly visible. (fig. 2) An additional operation is not
      anticipated.</p>

      <p class="section">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text2">Penile concealment, although rare, poses
      several problems with regard to the performance and followup
      of newborn circumcision. Besides the cosmetic deteriorization
      [sic] of the child&rsquo;s genital area, the overwhelming
      problem is functional.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the cause of this entity can only
      be postulated, the most commonly accepted theory is the
      tendency of the penile shaft to retract into a deep
      prepubertal fat pad. This disappearance, although temporary,
      can became more permanent by the reaction of the newly formed
      circular mucocutaneous union with cicatrization. The
      puckering scar tissue builds up, closes over the retracted
      penis and completely entombs it in a pseudosac with pinpoint
      opening for the egress of urine. Fortunately, the glans
      around the meatus is not involved in this scarring
      process.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recently, Trier and Drach suggested that
      inadequate separation of the inner surface of the prepuce
      from the glans, coupled with the use of a circumcision
      device, can lead to the problem of penile concealment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since neonatal circumcision is so frequently
      performed with some type of device, it is our opinion that
      this method is here to stay. Therefore, we suggest a more
      adequate disruption of adhesions and more aggressive followup
      in the case of newborn circumcision. The obstetrician and/or
      pediatrician should examine the child more frequently. The
      mother should be instructed in cleansing the genital area and
      retracting the skin around the penis. This is especially true
      in a child with a deep prepubertal fat pad. By so doing, the
      entity of penile concealment may be eliminated.</p>

      <p class="section">SUMMARY</p>

      <p class="text2">A case of concealed penis has been presented
      with a discussion of the possible causes.</p>

      <p class="section">ADDENDUM</p>

      <p class="text2">Since writing this paper, I have seen a
      second case of concealed penis following newborn
      circumcision. The patient had a repeat circumcision at the
      age of 2 months.</p>
