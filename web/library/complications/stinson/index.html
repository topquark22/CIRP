      <h2>Impotence and Adult Circumcision*</h2>
      <b>Joseph M. Stinson, M.D.<sup>+</sup></b> 

      <p>Departments of Physiology and Medicine, <a
      href="http://www.mmc.edu/" target="_blank">Meharry Medical
      College</a>, Nashville Tennessee</p>

      <p>EXTENSIVE debate on the advisability of circumcision in
      the neonatal period was initiated by Preston in 1970,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> who suggested that boys could always
      elect circumcision later if desired. On the other hand,
      evaluation of patients undergoing circumcision between the
      ages of four and seven revealed extensive detrimental
      psychological effects.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> It is
      the purpose of this report to suggest that greater attention
      be given to the potential for psychologic problems related to
      elective circumcision in the adult.</p>

      <p>The patients presented as case reports were all on active
      duty with the United States Air Force and had some problems
      peculiar to this status. All had complete physical and
      laboratory examinations,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      including examination of external and internal genitalia,
      neurological examination, complete blood counts, oral glucose
      tolerance tests, protein bound iodine and T-4 uptake, serum
      electrolytes, VDRL, sperm counts, and 2-hour urinary
      keto-steroids and hydroxysteroids. All were within normal
      limits with the exception of reactive hypoglycemia in one
      patient, who had a blood sugar of 40 mg% at three-hours
      postprandial.</p>

      <p><b>CASE REPORTS</b></p>

      <p><b>Case 1.</b> W. J., a 23-year-old black father of two,
      was circumcised at age 22 while on a tour of duty
      unaccompanied by his wife. His first post-operative attempt
      at intercourse, which coincided with his first attempt at
      extramarital intercourse, was a failure. Impotence continued
      after he returned to his wife. He refused psychiatric
      consultation, and was treated with Halotestin, 10 milligrams
      daily, with temporary improvement.</p>

      <p><b>Case 2.</b> J. G., a 31-year-old white father of two
      (ages 9 and 10) underwent elective circumcision at age 28,
      and vasectomy at age 30. The latter was done while the
      patient was separated from his wife, and he noted the onset
      of impotence as that tour of duty was nearing completion.</p>

      <p><b>Case 3.</b> M. J., a 29-year-old black father of two,
      had an elective circumcision at age 23. He also gave a
      history of intermittent low-back pain since the age of 20.
      impotence was transient, hut recurring. When first seen by
      the author he complained of impotence accompanied by low-back
      pain with radiation into the posterior aspect of both thighs.
      Evaluation by cardiovascular surgeons, neurologists and
      orthopedic surgeons failed to disclose any physical basis for
      the pain, and alt symptoms were considered psychological. He
      was treated at various times with Halotestin 10 to 20 mg.
      daily, Cytomel 5 to 25 mcg. daily, or Valium 20 mg. daily
      without any change in the recurrent nature of his impotence
      or low-back pain.</p>

      <p><b>Case 4.</b> B. A., a 34-year-old white father of three,
      was circumcised at age 22. He was seen initially because of
      chronic epigastric pain. Upper GI series, oral
      cholescystogram and barium enema were normal, as were liver
      function studies. He was treated with Valium for a functional
      gastro-intestinal syndrome, and later reported that Valium
      reduced his libido. Further questioning revealed that
      impotence had been present periodically for several
      years.</p>

      <p><b>Case 5.</b> B. S., a 31-year-old white father of two,
      had elective circumcision and vasectomy while serving a tour
      of duty requiring separation from his family. On returning
      home, he learned that his wife had filed for divorce. He had
      a full-blown psychotic reaction requiring extensive
      hospitalization and psychotherapy. On return to an acceptable
      level of function he found himself impotent.</p>

      <p><b>COMMENT</b></p>

      <p>Since the widespread adoption of vasectomy as a means of
      voluntary-sterilization, follow-up studies have led to the
      recommendation that pre-operative evaluation include
      psychologic assessment.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> No such
      recommendation is made for elective circumcision in the
      adult. While this report cannot claim to show a causal
      relationship between circumcision and impotence, adult
      circumcision is the one common thread ill the five patients
      presented. In addition, two of the men had vasectomies, two
      first noted impotence during extra-marital intercourse, one
      had impotence accompanied by low-back pain,<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and one noted impotence after a severe
      psychotic episode. Tile latter had been treated with various
      psychotropic drugs. There was probably a great deal of
      interplay between circumcision and these other factors.
      Nevertheless, it is felt that these case reports are adequate
      to recommend psychological evaluation prior to elective
      circumcision, and post-operative psychological counselling
      when the procedure is done on an emergency basis.</p>
