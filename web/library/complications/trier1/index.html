      MD, Tucson, Ariz.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>The majority of nonritual
      circumcisions are performed with the aid of devices, the
      metallic bell (Gomco) clamp and the plastic bell clamp. A
      significant number of complications mostly minor, have been
      found in the literature dealing with circumcision. Concealed
      penis, one such complication, was recently seen in two
      infants. Inadequate dissection of the prepuce and removal of
      excess penile skin and removal of excess penile skin are the
      causes of this complication.</b></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="initial">W</span>ith the
      exception of ritual circumcision, perusal of the literature
      concerning circumcision of the infant penis discloses that
      the overwhelming majority of these procedures are performed
      with the use of special devices, the metallic bell (Gomco)
      clamp or the plastic bell clamp.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-9</a></sup> Neither device diminishes the need
      for understanding the anatomy of the penis nor does it lessen
      responsibility for wound care and post-operative observation
      of the patient. A number of reported complications of
      circumcision are due to failure to observe recommendations
      for the use of the device. Displacement of the ring of
      plastic bell clamp onto the shaft of the penis with the
      danger of necrosis of the distal penis due to venous and
      lymphatic obstruction has been cited by several
      authors.<sup><a href="#n5">5-7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Excessive bleeding after circumcision most
      commonly followed use of the metallic bell clamp where
      dependence for hemostasis was placed only on the crushing
      effect of the clamp on wound edges.<sup><a
      href="#n">1</a></sup> Apparent damage to the ventral surface
      of the penis in control of postcircumcision bleeding was
      blamed for the development of urethral fistulae in three
      infants.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Meatal ulceration has been a significant
      complication in several reported series of infant
      circumcision. MacKenzie, however, ascribes meatal ulceration
      to contact of the unprotected glans penis with ammonical
      diapers and not to the trauma of the operative procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recent treatment of two infants with
      concealed penis suggests additional causes for complications
      of circumcision: failure to perform the operative steps
      required before application of the circumcision devices to
      the penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two infants were admitted with absence of
      visible penis, an infrapubic cutaneous sinus tract from which
      urine flowed, and a history of circumcision using a device.
      Physical examination in both cases otherwise revealed healthy
      male infants, each with normal scrotum and testicles.
      Palpation of the pubic area in both infants disclosed a
      subcutaneous mass believed to be the penis (Fig.1 left and 2
      left).</p>

      <p class="text2">A dorsal incision was made in the sinus
      tract in both infants, splitting the sinus tract and
      revealing the glans penis tightly adherent to the inner
      surface of the prepuce. Excessive smegma was present,
      particularly in the coronal sulcus. The preputial tissue was
      dissected proximally away from the glans to its reflection at
      the corona of the glans penis, and the free edge of the
      longitudinal dorsal slit then sutured transversely to the
      pubic skin (Fig 1 right and 2 right. Although a deficit of
      penile skin seemed present in both infants, no attempt at
      further construction seemed justified at this time.</p>

      <p class="section">Comment</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1958, Byars and Trier<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> reported a case of concealed penis
      identical to the present cases in a 2-month-old male infant.
      Shulman et al<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> reported
      another case in a 3-year-old boy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both groups of authors suggested that the
      penis was forced into a subcutaneous position by wound
      contraction following circumcision. They attributed
      concealment of the penis to readherence of mucous membrane of
      the prepuce to the glans penis and the tendency of the penis
      to retract into the fatty mons pubis where it was trapped by
      the contraction of the circular circumcision wound above
      it.</p>

      <p class="text2">We propose a much simpler explanation:
      failure to completely separate the inner surface of the
      prepuce from the glans penis. Circumcision, when correctly
      performed, eliminates the possibility of phimosis by excision
      of the a sufficient portion of redundant prepuce in order to
      leave the glans penis exposed. Usually, more of the inner
      preputial surface than the outer requires excision, so that
      very little penile skin need be discarded. If the inner
      surface of the prepuce is not adequately dissected from the
      surface of the glans penis, mot or all of the inner surface
      of the prepuce remains. Penile skin is then pulled into the
      circumcision device and amputated immediately, or in a
      week&rsquo;s time in the case of the plastic bell clamp. The
      circular wound contracts as it heals<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> and confines the glans penis in a
      subcutaneous position.</p>

      <p class="text2">This deformity should occur less often after
      circumcision without use of a device, since it is then easier
      to recognize failure to dissect the prepuce completely free
      from the glans. MacGowan<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      warns, however, that it is possible to bivalve the penis or
      create hypospadias or epispadias by inadvertent introduction
      of a scissor blade into the urethral meatus unless the same
      precautions are taken.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is essential, therefore, in performing
      circumcision, by whatever means, that complete dissection of
      prepuce from the glans penis be carried out, if necessary by
      carefully enlarging the phimotic orifice as dissection
      proceeds until the coronal sulcus is reached, and that
      excision of penile skin be adequate but conservative.
      Assurance of uncomplicated wound healing is provided by
      inspection of the wound and of the plastic bell clamp ring if
      present, within the first postoperative week.</p>
