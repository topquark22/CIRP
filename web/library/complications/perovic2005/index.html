      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Penile trauma is difficult physical and
      psychological problem and rare because the penis is mobile
      and largely protected by its position; however, in erect
      state in adult, penis becomes more prone to trauma [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. Penile trauma has different underlying
      causes; it may be iatrogenic or caused by motor vehicle
      accidents, child abuse, animal bites, gun shoot or
      self-mutilation [<a href="#n2">2-5</a>]. Reports of trauma to
      the external genitalia are sporadic; the type and extension
      of penile trauma varies in severity from small to more
      serious injuries and total emasculation. We present our
      experience with severe penile injuries in unusual cases and
      choice of their treatment.</p>

      <h4>Material and methods</h4>

      <p class="text1">We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients aged
      from 10 to 52 years (mean 28 years) treated for penile injury
      in the period from March 1999 to August 2004. Etiology was
      different: traffic accident, burn, iatrogenic, electrocution,
      gun shoot and self-mutilation trauma. All injuries were
      classified in three groups: complete avulsion, penetrating
      injury and amputation. Different procedures for treatment of
      these injuries were used according to the case. Approach was
      individualized and based on using available vital penile
      tissue combined with different pedicled or free flaps and
      grafts (table 1).</p>

      <h5>Case histories</h5>

      <p class="text1">Case 1. A 19-years-old boy was injured in
      traffic accident by prolonged contact with exhaust pipe of
      the car. Burning trauma involved 30% of the body including
      penile skin which was completely destroyed. Patient was
      referred to us six months after injury with completely
      trapped penis. Since the most surrounding skin was damaged
      and scarred, femoral pedicled flap was created and wrapped
      around the penile shaft, previously dissected from the scar
      tissue. Three months later the flap was divided from its base
      and reconstruction of the penile body was completed. Good
      aesthetic and functional outcome was achieved after two
      repeated liposuctions and fatty reduction of the new penile
      skin (Figs. 1-5).</p>

      <p class="text1">Case 2. A 22-years-old man with penetrating
      penile injury due to traffic accident was admitted one year
      after trauma. Penis was completely burned ventrally. During
      surgery, midshaft urethral injury, as well as partial loss of
      ventral tunica albuginea were noted. This tunica defect
      resulted in severe ventrolateral curvature. The anterior
      urethra was mobilized and directly anastomozed. Curvature was
      corrected by incisional corporoplasty. Reconstruction of the
      penile body skin was done using vascularized sliding flaps
      created from remaining penile skin (Figs. 6-9).</p>

      <p class="text1">Case 3. A 41-years-old man was injured in a
      traffic accident, by contact with exhaust pipe. Six months
      after the trauma, severe deformities of the penis were
      obvious. Dorsally, glans and penile severe curvature was
      noted. After scar resection, the distal part of the left
      corpora cavernosa were missing, while the tip of the right
      one was fibrous. Corpora cavernosa were reconstructed by
      joining the right corporal tip and remaining left one. The
      penile body skin was reconstructed using remaining sliding
      skin flaps. Six months later, hyaluronic acid was injected
      into the glans for its better sculpturing (Figs. 10-15).</p>

      <p class="text1">Case 4. A 15-years-old boy was referred to
      us six months after injury caused by electrocution during
      voiding on high-voltage electric-current wire. He presented
      with penile shaft amputation and fibrotic remnants of corpora
      cavernosa. Three fingers of the left hand were also
      amputated. This patient underwent radial forearm
      fasciocutaneous flap phalloplasty. Two staged urethroplasty
      was performed using buccal mucosa graft. Initially, semirigid
      penile prosthesis was implanted to prevent neophallus
      retraction and replaced later by bicomponent inflatable
      penile prosthesis (Excel-Mentor). Glanular resculpturing was
      simultaneously performed during staged surgery [<a
      href="#n6">6</a>] (Figs. 16-23).</p>

      <p class="text1">Case 5. A 11-years-old child presented with
      difficult psychological problems due to iatrogenic penile
      amputation. He underwent exstrophy-epispadias repair in
      newborn elsewhere. Mitrofanoff stoma was created for bladder
      empting. We decided to perform total phalloplasty using
      musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap. The length of the
      neophallus is 16 cm. It is longer then normal for the age,
      but adequate for the adult, since the neophallus does not
      follow genital but only somatic growth. Psychological state
      of the child after surgery is completely improved. This
      patient is awaiting penile prosthesis implantation after
      puberty (Figs. 24-27).</p>

      <p class="text1">Case 6. A 19-years-old man underwent
      congenital ventral penile curvature repair elsewhere. On
      physical examination corporal bodies and glans were missing
      due to vascular injury during initial surgery. Most of the
      penile skin survived. This patient underwent several surgical
      procedures. First, semirigid penile prosthesis were implanted
      into the remaining penile stumps proximally and covered with
      remaining skin distally. Three months later, urethroplasty
      with inlay buccal mucosa graft was started. Tubularization of
      the flap was done six weeks after initial procedure. To gain
      urethral coverage good vascularized flap from the scrotal
      skin was harvested. Finally, semirigid prosthesis was
      replaced with bicomponent inflatable prosthesis
      (Excel-Mentor). Functional results (voiding and erection) are
      satisfactory with acceptable aesthetic appearance (Figs.
      28-36).</p>

      <p class="text1">Case 7. A 20-years-old psychiatric patient
      performed glans self-mutilation in local anesthesia. Glans
      reconstruction was done using remaining inner preputial
      layer. Six months later glanular corona was created by
      injection of hyaluronic acid. Esthetic outcome is very good
      (Figs. 37-39).</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text1">The follow-up was from 6 months to 6 years
      (mean 2,8 years). The causes of penile injury in these series
      were traffic accidents (14 pts. -41%), iatrogenic trauma (13
      pts. -38%), self-mutilation (2 pts. -6%), electrocution (1
      pt. -3%), burns (2 pt. -6%) and gun shoot trauma (2 pt. -6%).
      Results of our treatment are showed in table; good aesthetic
      and functional results, including satisfactory sexual
      intercourse, were found in 30 patients (88%). In 4 cases with
      penile amputation complications occurred and required
      additional treatment; there were infection after penile
      prosthesis implantation in one and urethral complications
      (one stenosis and two fistulas) in three cases.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Severe penile injuries are rarely reported
      and caused by different mechanisms; it may be iatrogenic or
      caused by traffic accidents, child abuse, animal bites, gun
      shoot or self-mutilation. <span class="yellow">Iatrogenic
      injuries are commonly reported after circumcision or
      difficult penile surgeries performed by inexperienced
      urologists (hypospadias, epispadias or curvature
      repairs).</span> Despite the different mechanisms of injury,
      the end results of severe penile trauma vary from penile
      avulsion to total emasculation [<a href="#n2">2-5</a>].</p>

      <p class="text1">The management of penile injury depends on
      its mechanism and duration before presentation. Treatment
      should be taken immediately to prevent delayed complications
      such as infection, curvature, erectile dysfunction, missed
      urethral injury and chronic pain [<a href="#n7">7</a>].
      However, severe penile trauma can be associated with injury
      of adjacent organs (scrotum, pelvis, buttock, tight) and
      staged treatment is recommended. There are yet no written
      algorithms for the treatment of severe penile trauma after
      stabilization of the patient. The reconstructive goals are to
      rebuild a penis of good conformation and to restore function.
      Well vascularized remaining penile tissues should be
      augmented with judicious use of grafts, flaps, fillers, and
      prosthetic components. The challenge of penile reconstructive
      surgery for the resourceful urologist is to blend time
      honored concepts with the latest technologies creating a
      uniquely eclectic approach. Patient needs may best be served
      at medical centers staffed with such reconstructive
      urologists who interfacing with allied disciplines will offer
      counsel regarding the various options, their pros and cons,
      and the anticipated post operative course.</p>

      <p class="text1">We treated 34 patients with severe penile
      injury during five years. The most common causes were traffic
      accident with prolonged burns and iatrogenic injuries after
      repair of congenital penile anomalies. Although the treatment
      should undertaken immediately [<a href="#n8">8</a>], all of
      our patients referred to us several months after injury. This
      way, their reconstruction included usage of all remaining
      penile tissue combined with local flaps and grafts. Good
      results of penile body reconstruction were achieved using
      various surrounding vascularized flaps. In penetrating
      injuries, corporal deformities were repaired depending on
      case. Urethral reconstruction included simple closure with
      watertight, spatulated, catheter-stented technique and
      absorbable suture. The most severe cases underwent staged
      repair.</p>

      <p class="text1">Penile amputation may be treated by
      different free transfer flaps for partial or total phallic
      replacement [<a href="#n9">9</a>]. We usually used
      musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap due to its advantages.
      Neophallus has excellent length and circumference. It is
      important for phalloplasty in children when difficult
      psychological problems are occurred. Neophallic size in
      children should have an adult size since it follows only
      somatic growth. Neophallic retraction is more less then in
      fasciocutaneous phalloplasty (forearm flap) since muscle
      tissue could prevent contraction and makes penile prosthesis
      implantation much easier. Disadvantage is inability to
      provide protective sensitivity although anastomosis between
      thoracodorsal and ilioinguinal nerve could be promising.
      Implantation of semirigid prosthesis is recommended three
      months after phalloplasty to prevent phallic retraction. It
      could be replaced later with inflatable prosthesis. Corporeal
      remnants are very useful for proximal support of the
      cylinders and should be used always. In cases where penile
      stamps are absent, cylinders base can be extended with
      vascular prostheses to allow its fixation to the pubic
      periost [<a href="#n10">10</a>].</p>

      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      There are no specific guidelines for the treatment of severe
      penile injury which is a complex and multifaceted subject.
      Care must be taken with goal of optimizing long-term sexual,
      cosmetic and voiding outcomes. Penile reconstructive surgery
      is a challenging and technique driven activity, perhaps best
      undertaken by experienced urologists working with a team of
      associates in allied specialties.<br />
