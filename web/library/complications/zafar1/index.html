      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Once established in an institution,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks
      have proved difficult to eradicate, despite intensive
      infection control measures. This report describes the
      nosocomial infection with MRSA of 22 <span
      class="yellow">male infants</span> in a neonatal nursery
      during a 7-month period and the infection control procedures
      that effectively brought this outbreak under control and
      eliminated recurrence for more than 3 1/2 years.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> After a single index case of bullous
      impetigo caused by MRSA in a neonate discharged from the
      nursery 2 weeks previously, an additional 18 cases of MRSA
      skin infections were clustered in a 7-week period. Aggressive
      infection control measures were instituted, including changes
      in umbilical cord care, <span class="yellow">circumcision
      procedures</span>, diapers, handwashing, gloves, gowns,
      linens, disinfection, placement in cohorts of neonates and
      staff, surveillance, and monitoring.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> These measures were not effective in
      slowing the outbreak. The single additional measure of
      changing handwashing and bathing soap to a preparation
      containing 0.3% triclosan (Bacti-Stat) was associated with
      the immediate termination of the acute phase of the MRSA
      outbreak.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> The nursery has remained free of MRSA
      for more than 3 1/2 years, attesting to the success of our
      program.</p>

      <h3>Text Extract One:</h3>

      <p class="text2">From 1961 to 1987 there were 25 reported
      nursery outbreaks of <i>S. aureus</i> infection in the United
      States.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> The suspected mode of
      transmission was hand carriage by health care workers, and
      two of these 12 outbreaks were caused by
      methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA).<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Several studies have reported that
      as many as 30% to 50% of physicians and nurses have
      colonization of their anterior nares with <i>S. aureus</i>,
      and 2% are colonized with MRSA.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11-14</a></sup> Whether this carriage plays a
      role in nursery outbreaks, however, is unknown.</p>

      <h3>Text Extract Two:</h3>

      <p class="text2">Of particular interest was the fact that all
      22 infected neonates were male and all but two were
      circumcised. Previous studies have reported that male
      neonates are more likely to become colonized<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup> and infected<sup><a
      href="#n77">77,79</a></sup> with <i>S. aureus</i> than are
      female neonates. In one study, the male-female infection rate
      was 3:1<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup>, in another it was
      6:1.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> High male-female ratios
      have also been reported in outbreaks of neonatal scalded skin
      syndrome.<sup><a href="#n80">80-82</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">Authors of these reports speculated that the
      circumcision site may be particularly susceptible to
      bacterial growth.</span> In our study, however, none of the
      MRSA infections were at the circumcision site, although many
      were in the genital region. No conclusions could be drawn to
      explain the fact that only male infants were infected with
      MRSA in this outbreak.</p>
