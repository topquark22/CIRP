      <h4>Case report</h4>

      <p class="text1">An 8-day-old male newborn presented 1 h
      after accidental amputation of the distal glans penis during
      ritual circumcision. The excised tissue, comprising the
      distal glans, meatus and distal urethra, was wrapped in
      sterile saline-soaked gauze.</p>

      <p class="text2">Intra-operative examination showed a viable
      penis, with no shaft skin loss, and a clean wound resulting
      from excision of the foreskin and distal part of the glans. A
      gentle and minimal debridement of the corpus spongiosum was
      performed and the urethra and the corpus spongiosum were
      re-anastomosed with 7/0 and 6/0 dexon sutures, respectively,
      over a 6 F silicone Foley catheter (Figs 1 and 2).</p>

      <p class="text2">The skin of the penile shaft was closed
      using a pursestring suture over the reattached part of the
      glans and around the catheter (Fig. 3). The pursestring was
      released after 48 h and the shaft skin was allowed to retract
      proximal to the corona.</p>

      <p class="text2">Tetracycline ointment was applied on the
      glans three times a day. The urethral catheter was removed
      after 2 weeks, with a good take of the graft. After 2 months,
      there was no meatal stenosis and voiding was normal.</p>

      <h4>Comment</h4>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision is the most common operation in
      male newborns in Israel. In the ritual setting its risks
      remain controversial. Although a minor procedure, the
      incidence of complications ranges from 1.5 to 5% [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Glanular amputation is a rare complication
      of neonatal circumcision and should be treated according to
      the principles of grafting [<a href="#n2">2</a>].
      Intra-operative debridement allows neo-vascularization and
      immobilization of the graft with dressings or with the
      shaft-skin &lsquo;purse-string&rsquo; is important in
      allowing imbibition and inosculation. Antibiotics are
      appropriate to prevent infection. The purse-string&rsquo; of
      the penile shaft skin was used because no shaft-skin is lost.
      The most common complication of the procedure, meatal
      stenosis, was avoided successfully in this case.</p>

      <h4>Editorial</h4>

      <p class="text1">The authors report what they describe as a
      rare complication following a neonatal ritual circumcision of
      amputation of the distal glans penis. It is said that about
      65% of male newborns in the United States are circumcised.
      All Jews are circumcised neonatally and the majority of
      Muslims circumcised when they are older. Fistula formation,
      lymphoedema and iatrogenic hypospadias have all been
      reported. Most amputations are almost certainly not reported.
      I have seen half a penis amputated in a 4-year-old boy during
      a ritual Muslim circumcision. The penis was left by the
      General Practitioner surgeon in the waste-paper basket of his
      surgery but successfully re-anastomosed to the corpora with
      some skin loss when it was eventually retrieved. Circumcision
      is not an operation to be undertaken lightly and if it is to
      be performed in Great Britain it is probably best performed
      in a hospital environment, in an older child as a general
      anaesthetic day-case. The costs to the Health Service of
      carrying out these religious circumcisions are probably less
      than treating the complications that occur from untrained
      circumcisionists carrying out the operations under local
      anaesthesia in private practice.</p>
