      <b>The case against neonatal circumcision</b> 

      <p class="text1">S<font size="1">IR</font>,&mdash;Many
      complications of circumcision, which include infection,
      haemorrhage, injuries to the glans and shaft, meatal ulcers,
      and meatal stenosis have been known for years. A recent
      leading <a href="/library/general/BMJ/">article</a> (5 May, p
      1163) discussed current medical opinion on the subject. We
      would like to add the following case history to the
      literature.</p>

      <p class="text2">A healthy 1-week-old infant had a
      circumcision performed by a well-trained and experienced
      physician without any anaesthetic. The infant tolerated the
      procedure well except for excessive crying, which began at
      the time of the operation. The mother, attempting to soothe
      the distressed infant, resumed breastfeeding after the
      operation. An episode of vomiting followed the feeding. An
      apnoeic spell followed the emesis. The infant was taken to a
      local emergency room and subsequently transferred to the <a
      href="http://www.chla.org/">Children's Hospital</a> of Los
      Angeles. He received a complete septic workup, intravenous
      antibiotics and hospitalisation for five days of observation
      until the cultures were negative and sepsis was ruled out.
      The infant was discharged from the hospital six days after
      circumcision doing very well.</p>

      <p class="text2">Infants do feel the pain of the surgical
      removal of the foreskin performed without any anaesthetic,
      and they respond to the pain by crying. That crying may be
      excessive. Air may be swallowed. Mothers do soothe their
      infants by feeding them. Vomiting may follow the feeding.
      Apnoea may follow vomiting.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision can be the onset of an
      unfortunate and unnecessary medical history. It is a
      procedure that should not be considered minor. If
      circumcision is done, it should be done with anaesthesia. But
      is it really worth the risk of anaesthesia? Pros and cons
      should be thoroughly and completely discussed with the
      infant's parents before the procedure is done.</p>
