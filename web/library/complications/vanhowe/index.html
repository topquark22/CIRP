      <p class="text"><b>Objective</b> To document prospectively
      variation in penile morphology and clinical findings in
      children.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Patients and methods</b> The study
      comprised a consecutive sample of 468 boys whose consultation
      with a physician included a genital examination in a primary
      care paediatric practice in rural northern Wisconsin.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Results</b> Circumcised boys under 3 years
      of age were significantly more likely to have a partially or
      completely covered glans, a reddened meatus, balanitis, or
      trapped epithelial debris, and less likely to have a fully
      exposed glans than were circumcised boys of 3 years or older.
      Among the 238 boys under 3 years, those circumcised were
      significantly more likely to have non-cosmetic problems,
      including coronal adhesions, trapped epithelial debris, a
      reddened meatus, preputial stenosis (phimosis) and balanitis
      than were boys with a foreskin. Findings in the circumcised
      group under 3 years included: fully exposed glans (n=78,
      35.6%), partially covered glans (n=67, 30.6%), adhesions
      (25.6%), completely covered glans (20.1%), entrapped
      desquamated epithelial debris (24.7%), reddened meatus
      (19.1%), balanitis (15.5%), and preputial stenosis (0.9%).
      Only two genital examinations in boys with foreskins revealed
      pertinent findings. Coronal adhesions develop in circumcised
      boys at 2-6 months of age and usually resolve by 24 months.
      The degree of skin covering the glans after neonatal
      circumcision peaks at 6 months of age.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Conclusions</b> There are significant
      variations of appearance in circumcised boys; clinical
      findings are much more common in these boys than previously
      reported in retrospective studies. <span class="yellow">The
      circumcised penis requires more care than the intact penis
      during the first 3 years of life. Parents should be
      instructed to retract and clean any skin covering the glans
      in circumcised boys to prevent adhesions forming and debris
      for accumulating.</span> Penile inflammation (balanitis) may
      be more common in circumcised boys; preputial stenosis
      (phimosis) affects circumcised boys and intact boys with
      equal frequency. The revision of circumcision for purely
      cosmetic reasons should be discouraged on both medical and
      ethical grounds.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text">One of the most frequently cited reasons for
      neonatal circumcision in the USA is for a `boy to look like
      his father'[<a href="#n1">1</a>]. According to past studies,
      between 1%[<a href="#n2">2,3</a>] and 9.5%[<a
      href="#n4">4</a>] of boys circumcised at birth will have the
      procedure revised or redone, and 2.8% of parents will
      complain of the cosmetic appearance[<a href="#n5">5</a>].
      Although the natural progression of the appearance of the
      normal penis has been well documented to date [<a
      href="#n6">6,7</a>], no study has documented penile
      appearance beyond the first year of life in a mostly
      circumcised population. This study examines prospectively the
      prevalence and kinds of penile variation and clinical
      findings in a general paediatric practice.</p>

      <p><b>Patients and methods</b></p>

      <p class="text">The study population consisted of a
      consecutive sample of 468 males up to 18 years old who had
      their genitalia examined by the author in Minocqua, Wisconsin
      between 1 June 1995 and 30 April 1997. These examinations
      included sports physical and well-child examinations, and
      sick visits where a genital assessment was part of a physical
      examination for a specific problem: 822 such genital
      examinations were performed. Tanner sexual maturity ratings
      (I-V) [<a href="#n8">8</a>] were documented for all patients
      and the penis categorized as `glans fully exposed', `corona
      covered', `glans partially covered' and `glans completely
      covered' corresponding respectively to the D, C., B and A
      classifications described by Wynder and Licklider [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>]. The descriptions were tallied by the
      author and Fisher's two-sided exact test used to calculate P
      values.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p class="text">Of the boys studied, 36 (7.7) had foreskins,
      reflecting the high incidence of neonatal circumcision in the
      northern Midwest USA: all but one boy was rated Tanner I.
      Parents commented about the penis is 27 instances: the
      findings in the 25 circumcised boys did not differ in type
      from those boys where no comment was made and three comments
      were made about two boys with a foreskin. Nearly all boys
      studied were Causcasian; only two were of Hispanic origin,
      one of mixed race, one black, and 30 native Americans. No
      differences in circumcision rates were noted between racial
      or ethnic groups. Most of the boys under 3 years old had been
      circumcised using a Plastibell or a Mogen clamp. The method
      used in the older boys is unknown. Only seven boys were
      identified as being circumcised after the newborn period.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mean
      (SD) age at the time of examination differed significantly
      between boys with and without foreskins at 2.07 (2.94) years
      and 3.46 (4.64) years, respectively (Z=-4.03, P,&lt;0.001)
      because there were no older boys with foreskins. Boys graded
      Tanner I showed no age difference and this relationship held
      for those &gt;3 years and those &gt;3 years of age.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
        circumcised boys and uncircumcised boys &lt;3 years old
        were compared (Table 2), the former were more likely to
        have a non-cosmetic penile problem (either adhesions, a
        skin bridge, trapped epithelial debris, preputial stenosis,
        or balanitis), a finding associated with hygienic practices
        (either sub-preputial debris, reddened meatus, or
        balanitis; P=0.001); coronal adhesions or bridges
        (P=0.002), trapped epithelial debris, or meatitis. These
        findings were also present when all circumcised and
        uncircumcised Tanner I boys were compared, except the
        finding of trapped epithelial debris was statistically
        significant (P=0.043). Non-cosmetic findings were markedly
        more common in Tanner I circumcised boys than those with a
        foreskin, with an odds ratio (OR; 95%CI) of 10.22
        (2.41-43.26), but the rate of preputial stenosis was not
        statistically different, at 0.18 (0.01-2.11; P=0.240). For
        circumcised boys &lt;3 years of age, there was significant
        correlation between coronal adhesions and a glans that was
        partially or completely covered (5.03, 2.51-10.13),
        sub-preputial debris and a partially covered glans (3.12,
        1.65-5.93), partially covered glans and non-cosmetic
        findings (2.37, 129-4.35), partially covered glans and
        hygiene-related findings (2.40, 1.33-4.32), coronal
        adhesions and sub-preputial debris (7.35, 3.75-14.45),
        balanitis and reddened meatus (2.38, 105-5.37), and coronal
        adhesions and hygiene related findings. (3.88, 2.10-7.19).
        Patients with non-cosmetic findings were likely to have
        more genital examinations than those that did not. Boys
        with a fully exposed glans had fewer genital examinations,
        with a mean (sd) of 1.58 (1.12) versus 2.72 (1.92) (Z =
        -5.45, P&lt;0.001) and were less likely to have
        sub-preputial debris (OR 0.02, 0 - 0.16), non-cosmetic
        findings (.18, 0.10-0.33), or hygiene-related findings
        (0.31, 0.17-0.56).</p>

        <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
        circumcised boys &lt;3 years of age with adhesions, the
        mean age at which this observation was made (105
        examinations) was 8.65 (5.20) months. Fifty-one circumcised
        boys with coronal adhesions or skin bridges underwent more
        than one examination. The percentage of these 51 boys with
        adhesions at different ages is shown in Fig. 1; there was a
        pattern of developing adhesions at 2-6 months of age. Most
        of the adhesions had resolved by 24 months of age after
        parents were instructed to regularly apply gentle
        retraction on the adhesion. The degree of penile skin
        covering the glans is shown in Fig. 2. On average, the
        glans was covered most at 6 months and there was a gradual
        increase in glans exposure after 6 months.</p>

        study examining the range of penile appearance in infant
        boys circumcised shortly after birth [<a
        href="#n10">10</a>] and three of the incidence of `penile
        problems' and `later complications' in young boys [<a
        href="#n2">2,5,11</a>]. Unlike <a
        href="/library/complications/fergusson/">Fergusson <i>et
        al.</i></a>, who used a retrospective chart review over an
        8-year span to estimate the incidence of `penile problems'
        based on patient of parental complaint [<a
        href="#n5">5</a>], the present study examined prospectively
        each boy whose presentation necessitated a genital
        examination; parental comments or complaints were sparse.
        Fergusson <i>et al.</i>, relying on parental comments,
        retrospectively found only 16% of circumcised boys up to 8
        years old with `penile problems'. By contrast the present
        study documented non-cosmetic penile problems in 42.9% of
        circumcised boys up to age 8 years. Parental complaints in
        this study would only have identified 14.2% of the penile
        findings in boys &lt;3 years old. In keeping with Fergusson
        <i>et al.</i>, more non-cosmetic penile findings in
        circumcised boys were found in the early years of life.
        However, when comparing the findings in boys with
        foreskins, Fergusson <i>et al.</i> documented more total
        `penile problems' (P=0.043) than the present study. Despite
        a similar study design, significantly more later
        complications than the 13% found in the <a
        href="/library/procedure/metcalf/">study</a> by Metcalf
        <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n2">2</a>] were documented in the
        present study. No `complications' were seen in the study by
        Metcalf <i>et al.</i> among boys who had foreskins.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      retrospective study of penile complaints by Herzog and
      Alvarez [<a href="#n11">11</a>] suggested that the total
      frequency of complications was significantly higher in boys
      with foreskins. Unfortunately, these authors failed to
      control for ethnicity; Hispanic boys were more likely to have
      penile complaints whether they had a foreskin (OR 2.56,
      1.03-6.38) or not (3.46, 1.19-10.07). When controlled for
      ethnicity, neither Hispanic boys with foreskins (1.31,
      0.51-3.36) nor non-Hispanic boys with foreskins (1.78,
      0.62-5.05) had a significant increase in complications. The
      overall finding resulted form Hispanic boys constituting 67%
      of those with foreskins and only 16% of the circumcised
      group, rather than the presence or absence of a prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared
      with the circumcised boys examined by Herzog and Alvarez, the
      circumcised boys in the present study were more likely to
      have balanitis, adhesions, or a `complication'. Comparing the
      boys with foreskins in the two studies, Herzog and Alvarez
      found more `total complications' (P=0.195), but the
      difference was not statistically significant.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      cosmetic results of circumcision documented here are similar
      to those reported by <a
      href="/library/procedure/patel/">Patel</a> [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]. In that study of 100 infant boys, half
      had their glans partially or completely covered by skin.
      Patel also reported meatal ulcers in 31 of the boys and
      meatal stenosis in eight. Post-circumcision phimosis was seen
      in one boy [<a href="#n10">10</a>].</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high
      degree of variability in appearance could not be related to
      the technique used or the physician using it. When operating
      on the infantile penis, the surgeon cannot adequately judge
      the appropriate amount of tissue to remove because the penis
      will change considerably as the child ages, such that a small
      difference at the time of surgery may translate into a large
      difference in the adult circumcised penis. To date, there
      have been no published studies showing the ability of a
      circumciser to predict the later appearance of the penis.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
      fifth of circumcised boys aged &lt;3 years in this study had
      a completely covered glans. It is unclear how many had a
      buried penis as this was not specifically investigated.
      Buried penis is a congenital deformity that is often not
      recognized in the neonatal period; circumcision of these boys
      can result in serious complications[<a href="#n12">12</a>].
      If the penis is small, any surgery should be deferred until
      it can be clearly shown that it is not a buried penis.
      Additional, several boys presenting for `recircumcision' may
      have a buried penis. Attempting to recircumcised these boys
      often makes the condition worse and reconstruction more
      problematic [<a href="#n12">12</a>]. Little [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>] suggested letting the child grow out of
      the problem without surgical intervention. When parents
      request revisional surgery [<a href="#n14">14,15</a>] the
      surgeon confronts four dilemmas; first, it is impossible to
      predict how the penis will look after puberty in a
      pre-pubescent child; second, once skin is taken off, it is
      hard to replace. If too much skin is taken off, there may not
      be enough skin for the penis to become erect in adulthood
      without pain, skin tears, or pubic hair being pulled up onto
      the base of the penis [<a href="#n16">16</a>]; third, an
      infant's circumcised penis that is covered with skin may
      represent a `hidden' penis, in which case standard
      circumcision revisional techniques [<a href="#n14">14</a>]
      could make the situation worse [<a href="#n12">12</a>]; and
      finally, it is not clear in the light of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/">recent statement</a> by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics whether
      a surgeon can obtain informed consent, parental assent, or
      informed parental permission for cosmetic surgery in a
      pre-verbal child [<a href="#n17">17</a>]. Even if the surgeon
      is prudent and refuses to perform the surgery, many parents
      in the USA will pursue subsequent consultations with other
      surgeons until they find one willing to perform the procedure
      [<a href="#n18">18</a>].</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If after
      circumcision the raw areas of the penile skin or remaining
      preputial tissue are in contact with the denuded glans,
      adhesions may occur. The 29.7% of boys &lt;3 years old with
      adhesions or skin bridges emphasizes the importance of
      continuing penile care in the circumcised infant.
      Gracely-Kilgore [<a href="#n20">20</a>] found that 15% of
      circumcised boys on their first visit had coronal adhesions
      and the present study produced similar findings in initial
      visits of circumcised boys &lt;3 years of age. This study
      confirms that adhesions are not residual areas of embryonic
      adhesions that were not lysed adequately during circumcision,
      as had been reported previously.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
      the infant with a normal prepuce requires no special care [<a
      href="#n23">23,24</a>] the circumcised boy needs to have any
      skin overlying the glans pulled back and cleaned regularly
      until 15-18 months of age, to prevent adhesions to the glans
      from reforming and debris from accumulating [<a
      href="#n20">20,21,25,26</a>]. The connections between the
      inner lining of the prepuce and the surface of the glans
      dissolve over time. Forceful tearing of these connections
      which increases the possibility of infection, bleeding, and
      scar formation, has not been shown to be more effective than
      gentle daily retraction.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
      paediatricians, the author included, often mis-label
      balanitis as `candidal diaper rash' when the circumcision
      scar and glans are the focus of the infection. In a large
      retrospective study, the incidence of balanitis in
      circumcised and uncircumcised boys did not differ
      significantly [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. Balanitis or
      irritation was documented in 4% of circumcised boys up to age
      12, compared with 10.4% in the present study. The
      retrospective nature of the study, coupled with mislabelling,
      may be responsible for underestimating the incidence in
      circumcised boys.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a
      prospective study, nine (1.6%) of 565 intact Japanese boys
      &lt;10 years old had balanitis [<a href="#n7">7</a>]; in the
      present study, 20 (5.6%) of 357 boys &lt;10 years old were
      recorded as having balanitis at their initial examination.
      Although the value of comparing prospective data from
      different studies is limited, it appears that circumcised
      boys &lt;10 years old are more likely to develop balanitis
      than are normal boys (OR 3.81, 95%CI 1.73-8.53). While
      inflammation of the penis may occur more frequently in
      circumcised boys, balanoposthitis in the normal penis may be
      more painful because of the nerve-endings sensitive to fine
      touch in the prepuce [<a href="#n27">27</a>]. Most of these
      cases, regardless of circumcision status can be treated
      successfully with topical therapy.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two
      patients were noted to have preputial stenosis secondary to
      scarring from their neonatal circumcision, which did not
      allow retraction of residual skin over the glans. Incidences
      of 0.32% [<a href="#n28">28</a>], 0.4% [<a
      href="#n11">11</a>] and 1% [<a href="#n10">10</a>] have been
      reported for preputial stenosis resulting from neonatal
      circumcision. While the exact incidence of preputial stenosis
      is unknown, it is most likely between 0.9% [<a
      href="#n29">29</a>] and 1.9% [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. The <a
      href="/library/normal/kayaba/">prospective Japanese study</a>
      found only four 1.9% intact boys under age 2 years (n=213)
      had a `pinhole' prepuce' [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. This does not
      differ significantly from the rate of preputial stenosis seen
      in circumcised boys &lt;2 years old in the present study
      (P=0.444), suggesting that preputial stenosis, often referred
      to as `phimosis' may affect both circumcised and intact boys
      with equal frequency.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      common finding of sub-preputial debris in circumcised infants
      may reflect inadequate hygiene; the debris found consisted of
      lint, dirt, talc, stool and detritus. The association between
      subpreputial debris and coronal adhesions implicates poor
      hygiene as a possible cause. In the normal penis, muscle
      fibres are arranged in a whorl to form a sphincter that keeps
      unwanted contaminants out [<a href="#n30">30</a>]. Urine
      swirling under the prepuce in the normal infant male flushes
      any contaminants from the subpreputial space [<a
      href="#n31">31</a>] and may explain the paucity of findings
      in this population. Subpreputial debris may have been
      under-reported in young intact boys because forcible
      retraction of the foreskin, which is a harmful practice [<a
      href="#n23">23</a>], was not performed.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      present findings highlight the importance of assuring parents
      about their child's penile appearance. Parents who elect to
      have their boys circumcised for cosmetic reasons may be
      disappointed by the wide variability documented here. As
      physicians, we may have a moral obligation to steer parents
      away from unnecessary and costly circumcision revision until
      the child is old enough to consent to the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of
      the weaknesses of previous studies was their reliance on
      parental comment as the sole inclusion criterion. It is
      difficult to measure the prevalence of parental
      dissatisfaction. The scarcity of comments may reflect the
      lack of a clear notion of how the circumcised penis should
      appear. In the USA, there is general ignorance among parents
      and physicians about the appearance and function of the
      normal penis, let alone that which is surgically altered. The
      lack of comment may also reflect a society that is accustomed
      to seeing a wide variety of surgical altered penises. The
      greatest weakness of the present study was the relatively few
      boys with foreskins, which limited the power of the
      statistical analysis. These boys received more genital
      examinations, which would tend to over-represent the number
      of penile findings.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      conclusion, there is a wide penile variation in young
      circumcised boys: penile findings among these boys are much
      more common than previously reported in retrospective
      studies. Practitioners need to be familiar with the
      prevalences of these findings to give accurate information to
      parents. When discussing the advantages and disadvantages of
      neonatal circumcision, <span class="yellow">parents need to
      know that the circumcised infant requires more attention and
      penile hygiene than the uncircumcised infant; circumcision
      does not prevent phimosis and circumcised boys are more
      likely to develop balanitis, meatitis, coronal adhesions and
      meatal stenosis.</span></p>
