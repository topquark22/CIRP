      <p class="title">THE TOAD IN THE HOLE CIRCUMCISION &mdash; A
      SURGICAL BUGBEAR</p>

      <p class="author">BY DOUGLAS H. STEWART, M. D.. F. A. C.
      S.</p>

      <p class="text2">The term &ldquo;Toad in the Hole&rdquo; is
      derived from the Hebrew kitchens and cook-books; and it is
      here used because the writer never has heard any other name
      for the condition about to be described. The clearest mention
      of the matter is the following paragraph from the pen of Dr.
      Thomas H. Lanman of Boston*: &ldquo;There is one type of case
      that should be especially mentioned because <span
      class="yellow">it is the sort for which circumcision is
      inadvisable.</span> It is that the boy has a very small penis
      and a large pad of suprapubic fat, and post-operative care
      and cleanliness are made very difficult. Extreme cases
      present the appearance of an umbilical polyp, and this is
      alarming to the parents.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present writer admits at once that he
      has never produced a toad in the hole, therefore there is no
      case here of a burnt child dreading fire. It is somewhat like
      the child who fears and shuns fire because he has seen a
      friend and companion burnt. While it is true that the writer
      has no troublesome case of his own, it is equally true that
      he has had troubles sufficient in explaining away the results
      obtained by others. As Dr. Lanman states, those
      &ldquo;results&rdquo; are &ldquo;alarming,&rdquo; and this is
      so whether the operation has been performed by a surgeon or a
      mohl.</p>

      <p class="text2">As to the religious rite when performed by
      mohl, the parents are much overwrought by a toad in the hole
      result; because they hold tenaciously to the opinion that if
      a surgeon had done the work, the accident would not have
      occurred. Instances, facts of a sort, gossip, and so called
      evidence furnish a perfect deluge of words by way of proof of
      this contention. On the contrary, when the operator was a
      surgeon, orthodox relatives, perhaps not unstimulated by mohl
      and rabbi, make it their duty to impress upon the parents
      that the calamity (so called) is a direct visitation of a
      just God in his wrath for a sinful violation of the plain
      written law. To add to the hurly-burly, the wretched parents
      assert and are assured that their child is forever impotent
      and will have no children. Surely under all the circumstances
      one may easily understand that some unenlightened people are
      brewing a very pretty kettle of obstinately maintained
      misapprehensions which soon are to be masqueraded as
      facts.</p>

      <p class="text2">Why the matter has not been brought into the
      courts is incomprehensible; because the people interested
      have a way of talking things over and stirring each other up,
      until their outlook become vicious and their hatred for the
      operator grows boundless. What decision a judge and jury
      would come to is unfathomable. Particularly so in view of the
      fact that physicians themselves, who are not familiar with
      the condition under discussion, appear to maintain a
      condemnatory silence when brought into its presence. There
      are now two patients under observation (aged 4 years and 63
      years) who have presented about all of the angles of the toad
      in the hole result. The operations were performed by two
      different and competent surgeons. For the purpose of this
      paper the writer has taken them aside in private and has
      asked them the hypothetical question: &ldquo;If placed under
      oath, would you feel bound to say that the operator was at
      fault?&rdquo; Thus far the answers have been affirmative. At
      the same time it should be clearly stated that explanation
      and demonstration always caused a reversal of opinion. The
      writer&rsquo;s opinion is that, of an exhibition of a toad in
      the hole patient to a jury could be managed, the verdict
      would coincide with the amount demanded and the defendant in
      a malpractice suit would pass many unhappy hours, not matter
      how innocent he might be. And he would have the greatest
      trouble to escape punitive damages, if he did finally escape.
      Yet the whole thing us but a bugbear, and like most bugbears,
      no matter how slight itself, it makes for a very real alarm.
      All one has to do is to show that the alarm is unwarranted
      and unjustified by any fact of the case. Yet this is not a
      simple matter, since it include explaining away of a
      parent&rsquo;s insistence on believing what he sees with his
      own eyes; untaught and untrained as they are. &ldquo;He saw
      with his own eyes that the child had a penis before
      operation; and he now sees that the child has no penis, or
      has only a damaged one.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">The way some of the mothers howl and cry
      over the toad in the hole condition is most startling. One
      woman made such a terrific noise that all the ambulant
      patients rushed out of the building and into the street in a
      panic. The psychology of the unreasoning expression of terror
      that can be evidenced by Russ-pol Jewess is most interesting,
      but would carry us too far afield; therefore this sketchy
      portrait will furnish example enough.</p>

      <p class="text2">In managing toad in the hole patients it is
      well for the physician to be forearmed with some sort of
      formula that will carry hope, comfort and peace to the
      nervous, frightened parents&mdash;something that the
      wayfaring man, though a fool, cannot mistake. Here is one:
      &ldquo;Stop fussing. We will get the boy a good wife
      yet.&rdquo; The language may not be polished but the people
      understand it, and its effect as a wiper away of tears is
      prompt and satisfactory; whereas gentleness and kindness
      would be misunderstood, unappreciated and might add fuel to
      the fire.</p>

      <p class="text2">Photographs of the toad in the hole
      condition have not been satisfactory, because the picture
      shown the penis plainly and not at all as seen by the
      untrained or careless eye. In reality the parts all fit
      together with a marvelous adjustment. So perfect is it at
      times that two ellipses, one within the other, drawn upon the
      back of the clenched fist will make a good illustration. Let
      the inner ellipse represent the glans and penis. Let the
      outer ellipse represent the rime of the socket or curb of the
      well, as it were. Then with a cotton swab and some tinct.
      Iodine or other color let this be drawn (as stated, upon the
      dorsum of the first).</p>

      <p class="text2">In some instances with a flaccid penis at
      rest in the hole there is little or no protrusion or
      protuberance. The penis can be lifted or drawn out of the
      socket, or the pad of fat can be pushed back; but when erect
      the penis climbs out, as it were. In the child patient at
      present under observation the non-protrusion and smoothness
      would have to be seen to be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="text2">The treatment of the child is planned
      according to a routine that was formulated many years ago and
      it has served its purpose well. It is merely the diet for and
      the treatment for obesity. The child is supposed to be
      weighted weekly and its diet so regulated that the weight is
      kept down to standard for age. As has already been pointed
      out, the condition is brought about by a more or less
      localizied obesity, together with a small sized penis. After
      severance of the foreskin, which in this instance may be
      compared to a sort of suspensory ligament, the penis sinks
      into a sort of well in the excessive supra-pubic fat pad. The
      curb of the well is formed by a fold of the skin. For
      cleansing purposes, fill the hole and applying freely in its
      neighborhood, one heaping teaspoonful of Sod. Bicarb. Plus
      one level teaspoonful of Sod. Perborate dissolved in a
      tumblerful of warm water acts like an alkaline non-irritant
      H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and thus lessens the usual
      difficulty of maintaining post-operative cleanliness.</p>

      <p class="text2">The adult (aged 63) under observation states
      that he always needed circumcision and was so advised by
      various physicians. <span class="yellow">However, the matter
      was put off until he was 40 years of age, when he wished to
      marry and therefore had a circumcision performed; after which
      his penis promptly fell down the hole.</span> He found no
      trouble with sexual intercourse that was satisfactory to both
      parties. His wife has three healthy children. He can have
      intercourse when he wishes but is rationally abstentious. In
      this patient when the penis is flaccid all is so smooth that
      a cursory glance from the side (lateral), when the man is
      lying down on his back, might mistake pad, penis, and socket
      for a vulva. However, at the least erection the lips of the
      socket are shoved apart sidewise and the penis projects quite
      as it should. Manifestly this patient neither required nor
      desires treatment. He came for a herniotomy which was
      successfully performed.</p>

      <p class="text2">A colleague suggests by way of conclusion
      that about the most valuable thing in treatment is a
      suggestion, that comes from the writer&rsquo;s advice to the
      mothers: &ldquo;Bring your child to me on the fourth Thursday
      of each month and I will watch over his development.&rdquo;
      This it appears works out pretty well in keeping the mother
      from wandering about with her child and thus obtaining all
      sorts of misunderstood and disquieting opinions. The patients
      are usually brought for two or three months and by that time
      the parents have seen the child with an erect penis; or they
      have become accustomed to the appearance of things so that
      they are persuaded that the child has a penis, or they have
      become convinced by some weird and unknown reason that all
      their worry was but a false alarm in every way. After such
      conviction they come occasionally, perhaps once in five
      years. At least they come if they are at all uneasy in mind,
      or they come to show the doctor how well the child did come
      along. In one instance they came to talk about the
      child&rsquo;s fruitful marriage and to make arrangements for
      his wife&rsquo;s approaching confinement.</p>
