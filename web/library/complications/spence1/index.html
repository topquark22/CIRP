      <h2>Chilling of Newborn Infants: Its Relation to<br />
      Circumcision Immediately Following Birth</h2>

      <p><b>GEORGE R. SPENCE, MD,<sup>+</sup> <i>Silver Spring,
      Md</i></b></p>

      <blockquote>
        The author has shown that the delay of holding a newborn in
        the delivery room for circumcision before his removal to
        the nursery results in chilling. He recommends postponement
        of the operation to later in the neonatal period.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>F<font size="-1">OR SOME YEARS</font> in this community,
      it increasingly has become customary to perform routine
      circumcision in the delivery room immediately after birth and
      before sending the infant to the nursery.</p>

      <p>Because it was noted that some circumcised infants were
      arriving in the nursersy with rather low temperatures, a
      study was carried out at Holy Cross Hospital to determine
      whether circumcision in the delivery room increased the
      likelyhood of chilling infants.</p>

      <p>This statistical study of 1047 newborn infants in 1968,
      indicates that the percentage of chilled infants in the
      circumcised group was significantly greater than in the
      uncircumcised group.</p>

      <p>The following is the routine care given to infants in the
      delivery room: An infant who is born in this hospital is
      received from the delivery table by a nurse who carries him,
      wrapped in a dry towel, to the resuscitation unit where he is
      wrapped in a warmed cotton blanket and resuscitated. Infants
      who are to be circumcised remain in the resuscitation unit
      until the obstetrician finishes with the mother; the infant
      then is placed on the circumcision table, still covered
      except for the genital region, and is circumcised. He is then
      carried to the nursery. There is a warmer beneath the infant
      in the resuscitation unit but none on the circumcision
      table.</p>

      <p>On arrival at the nursery the infant's rectal temperature
      is taken immediately and recorded.</p>

      <h3>Technique</h3>

      <p>In this study, to exclude other major factors affecting
      temperature, it was thought desirable to exclude infants
      whose condition had been compromised or who were at risk of
      other reasons. Therefore no infant was accepted into the
      study who had been admitted to either the premature or
      observation nurseries. The period of study included 8 months
      in 1968. No similar study of this type has been found in the
      literature.</p>

      <p>The infants were divided into two main groups. Group I
      included the infants who were circumcised in the delivery
      room immediately following birth; Group II consisted of the
      male infants not circumcised at that time and the female
      infants. The groups were then further subdivided by setting
      arbitrary ranges and placing each baby into its division,
      depending on the rectal temperature recorded on admission to
      the regular nursery. These temperature ranges were:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Temperatures above 37.2 C (99.0 F)<br />
        Temperatures from 36.7 - 37.2 C (98 - 98.9 F)<br />
        Temperatures from 36.1 - 36.6 C (97 - 97.9 F}<br />
        Temperatures from 35.5 - 36.1 C (96 - 96.9 F)<br />
        Temperatures from 35.0 - 35.5 C (95 - 95.9 F)<br />
        Temperatures below 35.0 (95.0 F)
      </blockquote>

      <p>By this procedure it was possible to obtain percentage
      differences between the circumcised and the uncircumcised
      infants (Fig.1). The time elapsed from birth of an infant
      until arrival in the newborn nursery was recorded, and
      averaged for each group (Table 1).</p>

        <img src="table1.gif" alt="Table 1" />
      </center>

      <p>The differences in time that elapsed from the moment of
      delivery until arrival in the nursery averaged 8.7 minutes
      longer in the circumcised group. This increased time in the
      delivery room probably contributed to the heat loss and was
      due to the extra time for the obstetrician to complete his
      attention to the mother and to perform the circumcision.</p>

      <p>If we classify infants as chilled, those whose
      temperatures were below 35.5 C (96.0 F), we find that 7.0% of
      the uncircumcised are chilled, compared with 12.8% of the
      circumcised. By using the chi-square calculation on the 2 by
      2 contingency table, P&lt;.01. This is a highly significant
      difference. It would appear that to escape chilling at the
      time of birth, it would be safer to be in the uncircumcised
      group of infants.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>Is excessive heat loss at the time of birth a handicap to
      the newly born infant? The answer must be yes. At this very
      early period of life, immediately following delivery, infants
      are less able to conserve body heat than later in the
      neonatal period.[<a href="#n1">1-4</a>]</p>

      <p>Silverman and his associates[<a href="#n1">1,5,6</a>] have
      shown that infants have a decreased morbidity and mortality
      if they are kept in a neutral thermal environment. Bruck,[<a
      href="#n7">7</a>] in 1961, wrote that a fall in body
      temperature increased the oxygen requirements of
      neonates.</p>

      <p>Gandy and co-workers[<a href="#n8">8</a>] showed that
      cooling in the delivery room caused a distinctly stressful
      situation in newborn infants. In the presence of normal
      Po<sub>2</sub> (plasma oxygent content), cooling caused a
      compensated acidosis and with a low Po<sub>2</sub> it caused,
      frequently, an uncompensated acidosis and a lowering of the
      pH of the blood.</p>

      <p>Miller and Oliver[<a href="#n9">9</a>] demonstrated that
      chilled infants took a longer time to reach body temperatures
      than did infants kept warm after birth.</p>

      <p>In this series of infants there was a statistical increase
      in the number of chilled babies who arrived in the regular
      nursery at our hospital after having been circumcised in the
      delivery room, when compared with babies who arrived there
      under similar circumstances but not circumcised. Circumcision
      was probably responsible for the delayed arrival time of
      Group I.</p>

      <p>Because there is convincing proof in the recent literature
      that chilling puts the newborn infants under handicap in
      several ways, it would be better, perhaps to defer
      circumcision until a later time in the neonatal period when
      an infant's temperature regulated mechanism is better
      stablized.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>A study was made of the temperature of 1047 newborns
        upon arrival in the regular nursery at a general community
        hospital. Babies that were at risk and/or were premature
        were excluded from the study.</li>

        <li>Circumcision in the delivery room caused a
        statistically significant increase in the number of chilled
        babies admitted to the regular nursery and increased the
        time elapsing from birth until arrival in the nursery.</li>

        <li>It is suggested that circumcision be delayed until a
        later date than immediately following birth, and until an
        infant's temperature has returned to normal.</li>
