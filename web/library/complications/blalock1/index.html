      <h2>Outpatient Management of Phimosis Following Newborn
      Circumcision.</h2>

      <p><b>H. Jason Blalock, Vijaya Vemulakonda, Michael L.

      <p>Division of Urology,<br />
       <a href="http://www.uth.tmc.edu/" target="_blank">University
      of Texas-Houston Medical School</a>,<br />
       Houston, Texas, USA.</p>

      <p><b>PURPOSE</b> We reviewed our experience in treating
      patients with a trapped penis due to phimosis following
      newborn circumcision. The outcome of treatment of this
      condition at the outpatient clinic was examined. Possible
      etiological factors leading to this complication were
      determined.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS</b> A total of 521 pediatric patients underwent
      <a href="/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco circumcision</a>
      while under local anesthesia at our outpatient clinic between
      1994 and 1999. <span class="yellow">Phimosis was noted in 15
      patients (2.9%), and an additional 13 patients were referred
      to our clinic with phimosis after undergoing circumcision
      elsewhere.</span> These 28 patients underwent treatment for
      the phimosis at the outpatient clinic. The phimotic ring was
      manually dilated with a fine hemostat. Careful traction with
      sterile gauze was then used to reduce the phimotic band below
      the glans penis. No evidence of glans ischemia was noted.
      Mild edema of the pericoronal skin collar was common. Cases
      referred after age 6 months or those weighing more than 14
      pounds were treated as an elective outpatient surgical
      procedure.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS</b> Three patients had recurrence of the
      phimosis. These cases were managed with manual retraction of
      the prepuce at the clinic. At 1 month followup 27 patients
      had resolution of the phimosis. One infant was lost to
      followup. Factors contributing to development of phimosis
      after newborn circumcision were reviewed. Ten of the patients
      had obvious poor penile skin attachment with concealment of
      the penis even after resolution of the phimosis. Phimosis
      occurred more frequently in older patients undergoing
      circumcision-15 patients were older than 1 month at
      circumcision. Mean body weight of the latter group at
      circumcision was 12 pounds.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b> Phimosis with a trapped penis is an
      infrequent <span class="yellow">but important complication of
      circumcision.</span> This condition is more likely to occur
      in older infants and those with poor attachment of the penile
      skin to the shaft. Early recognition allows outpatient
      treatment with excellent results, avoiding operative
      intervention with general anesthesia.</p>
