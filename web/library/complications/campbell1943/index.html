      <p class="cirp">Meredith F. Campbell, M.D., is the author of
      the famed <i>Campbell's Urology</i>, a standard textbook that
      has been published for decades in many periodically updated
      editions.<br />
      <br />
       In this paper, Dr. Campbell clearly identifies the lack of a
      foreskin (caused by circumcision) as a etiological factor in
      the development of meatal stenosis. Most cases of meatal
      stenosis, therefore, are iatrogenic complications of
      circumcision.<br />

      <p class="text2">Stenosis of the external urethral meatus is
      the neglected stepchild among serious urinary tract
      obstructions. A study of the world's medical literature of
      the past 25 years discloses an average of one contribution a
      year on the subject, predominantly in German, and nearly
      always concerned with a single case report.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Its consideration in urologic and
      pediatric literature has been scant. Most patients in whom
      the lesion is recognized are children., in practically all of
      whom may be considered congenital and it may also be
      congenital in adults. In older patients its recognition is
      most likely to coincide with attempted urethral
      instrumentation or the acquisition of gonorrhea. While the
      symptomatic discomfiture due to urinary difficulty
      immediately concerns the patient or his parents, urinary
      backpressure damage of the proximal urinary tract, and
      particularly the kidney, is the important vital
      consideration. Urographic study in a relatively small series
      of these cases may be expected to reveal examples of advanced
      upper tract obstruction uropathy and wholly disproportionate
      to the commonly accepted benignity of the meatal lesion.
      Despite the usual utter simplicity of diagnosis of meatal
      stenosis by inspection and its treatment by meatotomy,
      thousands are today suffering serious progressive urinary
      tract obstruction because of the failure of their medical
      advisors to recognize this condition. This report is based on
      a clinical study of 152 personal cases in which I have
      satisfactory office or hospital records. Adults have not been
      included nor have a large number of children whose records
      have been inadequate. The age of the patients in this series
      range from 7 weeks to 16 years; a fourth were under 24 months
      of age; half were between 24 months and 10 years. Twenty-six
      were females. The common complication of stenosis of the
      external meatus&mdash;the ulcerated meatus&mdash;is also
      considered. Unfortunately for our records, urographic studies
      were made in only a limited number (63, cytoscopy 87) of
      these patients, yet sufficient to demonstrate beyond question
      the potential gravity of the tight urethral meatus.</p>

      <p class="secthead">ETIOLOGY</p>

      <p class="text2">Etiologically stricture of the external
      meatus may be classified as: 1) congenital (98 percent); 2)
      acquired (2 per cent) a) traumatic (indwelling catheter,
      instrumentation, etc.); b) Infection (gonorrhea,
      non-gonorrheal infection, vaginitis, etc.).</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Congenital.</i> This variety is analogous
      to, and frequently accompanies, congential stricture in the
      urethra proper (3 cases), at the bladder neck (1 case), in
      the ureteral (2 cases), intestinal and biliary tracts. An
      abnormal tight local embryonal closure of the urethral gutter
      occurs and in the absence of infection there is little or no
      sclerosis. Whether of embryonal correlation, when a long
      prepuce exists, a tight phimosis commonly accompanies a
      normally situated stenosed meatus. Parenthetically, at
      circumcision, if there is any question as to the adequacy of
      the meatal caliber, I routinely perform liberal meatotomy. In
      my experience, urethral stenosis commonly occurs in
      hypospadias (12 cases in this series) and is the urgent
      consideration; it also occurred in one case of epispadias and
      in 3 cases of congenital torsion of the penis.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Acquired.</i> Urethral stenosis
      presenting a picture of sclerotic stricture may result from
      trauma or infection or the combination of these processes.
      This lesion is observed chiefly in adults, and particularly
      since the advent of transurethral prostatic resection and the
      more widespread employment of the indwelling catheter. Here
      localized meatal ulceration, due to the trauma, foreign body
      reaction and the constant moisture of the discharge whih the
      catheter engenders, heals by sclerosis and produces
      stricture. Doubtless, the incidence of meatal stenosis caused
      by instrumental trauma (sounds, cystoscopes, etc.) is
      relatively small. In the male, urethritis may conceivably be
      an etiologic factor in some instances but as a rule the tight
      meatus passes unrecognized until the acquisition of gonorrhea
      or some instrumentation directs attention to the condition.
      In three of our cases there had been "recurrent non-specific
      urethritis" and we believe to be due to the tight meatus. In
      3 boys, acute gonorrhea caused the pin-point orifice to be
      discovered; the youngest was 3 1/2 years old. In the female a
      persistent or severe vaginitis may explain instances of
      meatal stenosis and here the urethral lesion is definitely a
      sclerotic one. Yet we have observed the condition
      congenitally in several young girls in some of whom the
      excessive backpressure injury cystographically and
      cytoscopically presented the picture of bladder damage so
      commonly seen in advanced prostatic obstruction.</p>

      <p class="secthead">PATHOLOGY</p>

      <p class="text2">Pathologically, the backpressure changes are
      usually greatest in the bladder, and, secondly, in the upper
      urinary tract; the complicating infection which may always be
      anticipated&mdash;for example, so-called "chronic pyelitis"
      in the young accelerates the destructive process. Urinary
      infection was recorded in a fourth of our patients, in 16 of
      whom the urologic examination was performed because of
      "chronic pyelitis."</p>

      <p class="text2">In some instances the dilatation is
      localized to the lower tract and particularly the urethra as
      was observed in a seven year old boy<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> admitted to the hospital because of
      hematuria. The bleeding was found to originate in a
      congenitally stenosed ulcerated meatus. The entire urethra
      and particularly the prostatic segment were markedly dilated;
      the bladder wall showed only slight damage and the
      uterovesical valve mechanism was still intact. Yet the
      extreme bulbous dilatation of the prostatic urethra was most
      unusual. In a newborn colored child an extermely large an
      apparently swollen prepuce was noted. A week later the
      obstetrical intern performed circumcision but at once found
      himself in a large ventral cavity connected with the urethral
      lumen. The operation was continued with removal of
      considerable tissue but not nearly all the urethral
      diverticulum which he failed to recognize. I saw the child
      the next day for the first time and found an exceeedingly
      small urethral meatus behind which the diverticulum had
      formed as a blowout process. Liberal meatotomy was performed
      and the channel distal to the diverticulum sac (measured 2 by
      2 cm.) was kept widely dilated with sounds; 6 months later,
      drainage of the bladder by catheter inserted through a
      perineal bouttoniere was followed by excision of the sac and
      closure of the urethra with a most satisfactory result. Yet
      the child is seen periodically for prophylactic urethral
      dilatation. A large urethral diverticulum at the base of the
      penis in a 4-months-old child with persistent pyuria likewise
      formed as a blow-out behind a pin-point meatus (fig. 1).</p>

      <p class="text2">In a 7-year-old boy examined because of
      dysuria a tight external urethral meatus was found;
      cystoscopy and cystography revealed widespreiad vesical
      sacculation with moderate dilatation.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> No vesico-ureteral reflex was noted.
      Wide meatomy and periodic progressive meatal dilatation to
      no. 22 F. was the treatment and was faithfully attended by
      the patient. Two years later irregularity of the vesical
      outline still existed but to far less degree than originally
      noted. Two girls aged 13 and 30 months respectively were
      examined because of so-called chronic pyelitis. Each was
      found to have a tight congenital stenosis of the external
      urethral meatus with advanced trabeculation and sacculation
      of the bladder wall. The cystoscopy and cystography pictures
      were those commonly observed in advanced prostatic
      obstruction. Yet simple periodic dilatation with sounds,
      together with administration of urinary antiseptics were
      curative.</p>

      <p class="text2">Ureterectasis and hydronnephrosis develop
      according to the severity and duration of the obstruction.
      Extreme dilatation of the entire urinary tract above a
      stenosed urethral meatus was observed in a newborn at autopsy
      at Bellevue Hospital, was seen clinically at 13 days, and a
      few similar instances are reported in medical literature.
      Mild upper tract dilatation was cystographically demonstrated
      in a three-year-old girl with a stenosed urethral meatus. In
      an 18-months-old boy with a tight balanitic meatus, the
      entire upper tract was excessively dilated (fig. 2); the
      residual was 500 cc. A No. 5 F. catheter was employed
      indwelling for 1 week; the meatus was incised and a No. 10 F.
      catheter was worn for another week. Thereafter the urethra
      was kept dilated (meatus No. 20 F.) and the urinary infection
      (Steptococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus and colon
      bacillus) was eradicated with sulfadiazine. Six months later
      the anatomic restitution was only slight. Yet the boy now
      empties his bladder and improvement in renal function attests
      successful therapy. A 6-months-old boy presented the same
      picture with wide dilatation of the bladder and bilateral
      vesicouteral reflux (fig. 3). Here, also striking functional
      inprovement followed wide meatotomy and periodic progressive
      dilatation wit sounds; considerable anatomic restoration was
      also observed. Vesical diverticulum was observe in the
      children of this series woh were cytoscropically studied, yet
      in 2 cases each there were vesical calculi and reduplicated
      ureters. In our failure to perform complete cysoscopic and
      urographic investigationn in all these cases, it is probable
      that coexisting and/or complicating urologic lesions were
      overlooked. Inflammatory and congestive lesions in the deep
      urethra were overlooked. Inflammatory and congestive lesions
      in the deep urethra, prostate, anterior trigone and
      especially the verumontanum are common with meatal stenosis.
      In 5 cases the enormously enlarged and engorged verumontanum
      extended well back into the vesical outlet.</p>

      <p class="text2">Ulceration of the meatus is discussed under
      Complications.</p>

      <p class="secthead">SYMPTOMS</p>

      <p class="text2">Dyuria, frequency of urination and hematuria
      are the chief symptoms; 49 of these patients were examined
      beacuse of so-called persistent enuresis and 16 because of
      "chronic pyelitis." Not only is there hesitancy in starting
      the stream, but the stream itself is unusually small and the
      pressure generated to force the urine through the tight
      meatus will sometimes throw this fine stream 6 to 8 feet.
      This is often accompanied by crying, screaming, strangury and
      a face red or purple from straining. As urine retained in the
      urethra leaks out slowly after urination there is terrminal
      dribbling and wetting of the clothes. Chronic or recurrent
      vesical retention may be accompanied by leakage or overflow
      incontinence and in nine of our patients the obstruction
      produced abdominal pain. In short, the symptoms are those
      common to all lower urinary tract obstructions including the
      systematic manifestations of complicating infection and
      diminished renal function. With ulceration of the meatus, and
      with or without scab formation or incrustation, urination is
      apt to be especially painful and reflexly or consciously
      cause teh patient to refrain from voiding. Yet as Brenneman
      has indicated, the application of cocaine to the tender
      meatus will temporarily permit painless urination. With
      meatal ulceration or the cracking of the scab covering the
      ulcer, the appearance of blood in the urine or on the child's
      clothing is most alarming to the parent who usually seeks
      medical attention for the child at once.</p>

      <p class="secthead">DIAGNOSIS</p>

      <p class="text2">This is by inspection and utterly simple;
      should diagnostic confirmation be needed, employ exploration
      of the stenosed meatus by surgical probe or small steel
      sound. When ulceration or incrustation of the meatus exist,
      there very presence should at once suggest the diagnosis.</p>

      <p class="secthead">TREATMENT</p>

      <p class="text2">In males, my preference is liberal meatotomy
      with a fine scissors or small scalpel at the outset and
      subsequent progressive dilatation of the stenosed meatus with
      steel sounds. In children under one year of age it is our
      practice to keep the meatus dilated to at least No. 16 F. and
      in children from 2 to 5 years of age the dilatation is
      maintained up to No. 22 F. In females, instrumental
      dilatation is preferable to meatotomy In this series
      meatotomy alone was performed in 4 cases (3 acute gonorrhea),
      dilatation only was employed in 31 (including 26 females),
      and in the remaining 117 combined meatotomy and dilatation
      was the treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">At the time of the initial instrumentation,
      a small sound or bougie should be passed to the bladder to
      determine there are no other congenital urethral
      obstructions. When possible, determination of the residual
      urine is of added value and is usually carried out at the
      time of initial visit and meatotomy. In males we perform
      meatotomy and instrumentation without anesthesia and usually
      in the office. Muco-cutaneous suture of the meatus is not
      required. Yet it is important that the mother or nurse be
      instructed to separate widely with her fingers the incised
      meatal margins. Despite this, there is usually fairly rapid
      closure of the opening and 5 to 7 days after meatotomy we
      again dilate the meatus, at which time the healing wound will
      be reopened. Occasionally it is necessary to do a second
      meatotomy. The meatal dilatation is repeated 4 or 5 times at
      lengthening intervals, and I prefer to see the patient again
      in 4 to 6 months after he has been thought cured to ascertain
      the meatus is still adequately open.</p>

      <p class="text2">Co-existing infection is treated by the
      administration of urinary antiseptics and failure to achieve
      prompt sterilization of the urine, as indicated by 2 sterile
      cultures, calls for a complete urologic investigation; other
      congenital obstructionss and/or lesions not recognized at the
      time of the initial examination may be present.</p>

      <p class="secthead">COMPLICATIONS</p>

      <p class="text2">The various complications of stenosis of the
      exteral meatus have been considered in previous paragraphs.
      Of these, ulceration of the meatus merits special
      consideration since apparently it is mysterious and
      perplexing to most physicians. The ulceration appears about
      the periphery of the stenosed meatus and usually extends 2 or
      3 mm. within this opening. <span class="yellow">Although I
      have seen it in the uncircumcised (3 cases in this series),
      it is more common in boys who have been circumcised or whose
      short prepuce leaves the meatus well exposed.</span> With
      drying of the ulcer, a scab or incrustation forms which
      further diminishes the meatal caliber or may completely seal
      it over between voidings. With cracking of the ulcer or scab,
      or pulling off of the incrustation by clothing, active
      bleeding occurs; the blood may be in the urine or appear only
      on the diaper or underclothing. In the past this condition
      has been attributed to ammoniacal diaper, dietary
      indiscretion, too much cream and a host of other extraneous
      causes. Moreover, pediatrists who have been particularly
      interested in this problem, and notably Brenneman<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> and Cook,<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> believe that the tight meatus is the
      result of the ulceration and not, as we believe, the basic
      cause of the erosion. In short, the stricture
      preexists&mdash;usually congenitally; ulceration follows, and
      the cycle of healing and further ulceration with progressive
      narrowing of the orifice ensues. The application of an array
      of salves and ointments, powders, the sterilization of the
      ammoniacal diapers, and other therapies have been widely
      advocated, chiefly by pediatrists, but I have yet to see a
      case not promptly and permanently cured by the establishment
      and maintenance of a wide urethral meatus.</p>

      <p class="secthead">SUMMARY</p>

      <p class="text2">Urologic study of patients, and especially
      the young, with stenosis of the external meatus forcibly
      demonstrates the potential gravity of the obstructive lesion.
      In mild cases dysuria may be the only symptom; secondary
      ulceration of the meatus is likely to alarm the patient. Yet
      when eradication of the obstruction is neglected,
      backpressure damage to the upper urinary tract is almost
      certain to ensue and even death from renal failure may
      ultimately occur.</p>

      <p class="text2">The diagnosis is readily made by inspection
      and meatotomy is the treatment. Following meatotomy it is
      mandatory that the orifice be kept widely patent by periodic
      progressive dilatation with sounds until such time as the
      caliber of the meatus remains generously large.</p>
