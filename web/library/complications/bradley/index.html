      <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="abstract">Guidelines of psychosexual management
        for infants born with physical intersex conditions are
        intended to assist physicians and parents in making
        decisions about sex of assignment and rearing including the
        following: 1) sex assignment should be to the gender that
        carries the best prognosis for good reproductive function,
        good sexual function, normal-looking external genitalia and
        physical appearance, and a stable gender identity; 2) the
        decision regarding sex assignment should be made as early
        as possible, referably during the newborn period, with an
        upper age limit for reversal of an initial sex assignment
        no later than 18 to 24 months; and 3) there should be
        minimal uncertainty and ambiguity on the part of parents
        and professionals regarding the final decsion about sex
        assignment and rearing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">J. Money used these guidelines in a
        case of a biologically normal male infant (one of a pair of
        monozygotic twins) whose penis was accidentally ablated
        during a circumcision at the age of 7 months. The decision
        to reassign the infant boy to the female sexand to rear him
        as a girl was made at 17 months, with surgical castration
        and initial genital reconstruction occurring at 21
        months.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Money reported follow-up data on this
        child through the age of 9 years. Although the girl was
        described as having many "tomboyish" behavioral traits, a
        female gender identity had apparently differentiated. Thus,
        it was concluded that gender identity is suficiently
        incompletely differentiated at birth as to permit
        successful assignment of a genetic male as a girl, in
        keeping with the experiences of rearing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Subsequent follow-up by other
        investigators reported that by early adolescence the
        patient had rejected the female identity and began to live
        as a male at the age of 14 years. In adulthood, the patient
        recalled that he had never felt comfortable as a girl and
        his mother reported similar recollections. At age 25, the
        patient married a woman and adopted her children. The
        patient reported exclusive sexual attraction to
        females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The present case report is a long-term
        psychosexual follow-up on a second case of ablatio penis in
        a 46 XY male. During an electrocautery circumcision at the
        age of 2 months, the patient sustained a burn of the skin
        of the entire penile shaft, and the pens eventually
        sloughed off. At age 7 months, the remainder of the penis
        and the testes were removed. By age 7 months, if not
        earlier, the decision was made to reassign the patient as a
        female and to raise the infant as a girl.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The patient was interviewed on two
        occasions: at 16 years and twice while in the hospital for
        additional surgery at 26 years of age. At ages 16 and 26,
        the patient was living socially as a woman and denied any
        uncertainty about being a female. During chilhood, the
        patient recalled that she self-identified as a "tomboy" and
        enjoyed stereotypically masculine toys and games; however,
        the patient also recalled that her favorite playmates were
        usually girls and that her best friend was always a
        girl.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When seen at age 16, the patient had
        been admitted to the hospital for vaginoplasty. At that
        time, she wished to proceed with the further repair of her
        genitalia to make them suitable for sexual intercourse with
        males. At age 26, the patient returned to te hospital for
        further vaginoplasty.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regarding the patient's sexual
        orientation, she was attracted predominantly to women in
        fantasy, but had had sexual experiences with both women and
        men. At the time of the second surgery, she was in a
        relationship with a man and wished to be able to have
        intercourse. The patient's self-described sexual identity
        was "bisexual." After surgery at age 26 years, the patient
        developed a rectovaginal fistula. Within a few months of
        the surgery, the patient and her male partner separated for
        reasons other than the patient's physical problems. The
        patient subsequently began living with a new partner, a
        woman, in a lesbian relationship.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The psychosexual development of our
        patient was both similar to and different from the patient
        described earlier. Our patient differentiated a female
        gender identity; in contrast, the other patient had adopted
        a male gender identity after experiencing intense
        discomfort living as a female, apparently around the
        beginning of adolescence. At the time of interview at age
        26, our patient was living with a man, but they
        subsequently separated and she began a new relationship
        with a woman; the other patient was married to a woman. Our
        patient had a "bisexual" sexual identity; the other patient
        had a "heterosexual" sexual identity. The patients were
        similar in that they had a childhood history of
        "tomboyism." Our patient was predominantly sexually
        attracted to womn; the other patient was exclusively
        sexually attracted to women. Our patient had sexual
        experiences with both women and men; the other patient had
        sexual experiences only with women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The most plausible explanation of our
        patient's differentiation of a female gender identity is
        that sex of rearing as a female, beginning at around age 7
        months, overrode any putative influences of a normal
        prenatal masculine sexual biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Because cases of ablatio penis in
        infancy are so rare and long-term follow-up data are scant,
        it is obviously impossible to know whether our patient or
        the previous case would be more typical of the psychosexual
        outcome in a larger sample of such individuls. However, our
        case suggests that it is possible for a female gender
        identity to differentiate in a biologically "normal"
        genetic male. At present, however, the clinical literature
        is deeply divided on the best way to manage cases of
        traumatic loss of te penis during infancy. Further study is
        clearly required to decide on the optimal model of
        psychosocial and psychosexual management for affected
        individuals.</p>

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">I</span>n the 1950s,
      Money and colleagues<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>
      developed guidelines of psychosexual management for infants
      born with physical intersex conditions. They were intended to
      assist physicians, other health professionals, and parents in
      making decisions about sex assignent and rearing. These
      guidelines included the following: 1) sex assignment should
      be to the gender that carries the best prognosis for good
      reproductive function (if attainable at all), good sexual
      function, normal-looking external genitalia and physical
      appearance, and a stable gender identity (sense of self as a
      boy or a girl), all of which would putatively foster a
      healthy psychosocial adaptation<sup><a href="#n3">3,4;
      2</a></sup>) the decision regarding sex assignment should be
      made as early as possible, preferably during the newborn
      period, with an upper age limit for reversal of an initial
      sex assignment no later than 18 to 24 months<sup><a
      href="#n3">5; 3</a></sup>) there should be minimal
      uncertainty and ambiguity on the part of parents and
      professionals regarding the final decision about sex
      assignment and subsequent sex of rearing.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> As noted by Meyer-Bahlburg,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> these guidelines have informed the
      standard medical and psychosocial care of infants born with
      physical intersex conditions for several decades in the
      United States and other countries.</p>

      <p class="text2">Follow-up studies of infants with physical
      intersex conditions showed that sex of rearing, in comparison
      with the various parameters that constitute biologic sex, was
      the best predictor of subsequent gender identity formation.
      For example, most genetic feales with congenital adrenal
      hyperplasia (CAH) reared as girls developed a female gender
      identity,<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> even though they
      had been exposed prenatally to increased levels of
      androgens<sup><a href="#n9">9,10</a></sup> (although
      subsequently controlled postnatally by glucocorticoid
      replaceent therapy)<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> and were
      born with masculinized genitalia (although surgically
      feminized postnatally, usually in the first few years of
      life).<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Parents reported that
      they were able to rear their children as girls with little
      reservation or ambivalence.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There have, however, also been cases of
      gender change from female to male later in life in CAH
      genetic females, which have been associated with delayed
      decisions about sex assignment, chronic ambiguity about sex
      of rearing, inconsistent adherence to glucoorticoid
      replacement therapy, and lack of surgical feminization of the
      external genitalia.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> These
      findings underscore the importance of both psychosocial and
      medical factors in the clinical care of infants born with
      physical intersex conditions.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Money<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,15</a></sup> applied the guidelines of
      psychosexual management for intersex children to a case of a
      biologically normal male infant (one of a pair of monozygotic
      twins) whose penis was accidentally ablated (flush with the
      abdominal wall) during a circumcision by electrocautery at 7
      months of age. It then necrosed and sloughed off.</span> The
      decision to reassign the infant boy to the female sex and to
      rear him as a girl was made when he was 17 months of age,
      with surgical castration and initial genital reconstructin
      performed at 21 months of age, which fall at the upper bound
      of the age range recommended for sex assignment (or
      reassignment) of infants born with physical intersex
      conditions.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Money<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      reported follow-up data on this child through 9 years of age,
      at which time the patient was described as having many
      "tomboyish traits, such as abundant physical energy, a high
      level of activity . . . and being often the dominant one in a
      girl's group."<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Money
      reported, however, that a female gender identity had
      apparently differentiated: "Her behavior is so normally that
      of an active little girl, and so clearly different by
      contrast from the boyish ways of her twin brother, that it
      offers nothingto stimulate one's conjectures."<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Thus, Money concluded that "gender
      identity is sufficiently incompletely differentiated at birth
      as to permit successful assignment of a genetic male as a
      girl . . . and differentiates in keeping with the experiences
      of earing."<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> When Money first
      reported the case, it received widespread media
      attention<sup><a href="#n16.">16</a></sup> and was noted in
      many pediatric, psychology, and sociology textbooks as a
      powerful proof of the importance of environmental influences
      on gender identity formation.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Subsequently, however, Diamond<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> reported the further course of
      events for this patient. By early adolescence, the patient
      had rejected the female identity and, at 14 years of age,
      began to live as a male.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>
      Indeed, when interviewed in his early 30s, the patient's
      recall of his childhood gender development was that he had
      never felt comfortable as a girl, and his mother reported
      similar recollections. At age 14, the patient received a
      mastectomy and began testosterone replacement therapy;
      surgical procedurs for phallus construction were performed at
      15 and 16 years of age. At 25 years of age, the patient
      married a woman several years his senior and adopted her
      children. The patient reported exclusive sexual attraction to
      females.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The long-term psychosexual outcome of this
      patient, which also received recent widespread media
      attention,<sup><a href="#n19">19-22</a></sup> has been used
      as evidence against the importance of sex of rearing for
      gender identity formation and also as a general critique of
      the guidelins of psychosexual management that have been used
      in the care of infants with physical intersex
      conditions.<sup><a href="#n18">18,23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Unfortunately, the factors that resulted in
      the long-term outcome for the case remain unclear. On the one
      hand, the eventual adoption of a male gender identity and the
      emergence of sexual feelings toward women could be viewed as
      primarily attributable to he influence of a normal male
      sexual biology in utero.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18,23,24</a></sup> On the other hand, the failure
      of the female gender identity to maintain itself by
      adolescence could be attributed to psychosocial factors, such
      as parental ambivalence regarding the initial dcision to
      reassign the infant as a girl. Ultimately, all one can
      conclude is that the experiment of nurture eventually failed,
      but why it did cannot be determined.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present case report is a long-term
      psychosexual follow-up on a second case of ablatio penis,
      alluded to by Money<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> but
      reported here for the first time.</p>

      <h4>CASE REPORT</h4>

      <p class="case">The patient is a chromosomal 46 XY male.
      <span class="yellow">During an electrocautery circumcision at
      2 months of age, the patient sustained a burn of the skin of
      the entire penile shaft, and the penis eventually sloughed
      off.</span> Consequently, the patient was unable to void
      thrugh the urethra, resulting in a suprapubic cystostoma. The
      patient was hospitalized subsequently for care of the
      surgical complications, and at 7 months of age was referred
      to Johns Hopkins Hospital (by ABC, the mother's obstetrician
      and the physician who had delivered the patient), where the
      remainder of the penis and the testes were removed. The
      suprapubic cystostoma was eventually closed, and the patient
      was then able to void through the urethra. Sometime between
      the circumcision accident and the hospital admission, the
      decision was made to reassign the patient as a female and to
      raise the baby as a girl. This was recognized formally at the
      time the patient was admitted to Johns Hopkins, because the
      infant was identified in hospital records as female.</p>

      <p class="case">The patient was interviewed on two occasions
      by a psychiatrist (SJB): at 16 years of age and twice while
      in hospital for additional surgery at 26 years of age. When
      the patient was 16, her mother also was interviewed. At age
      26, the patient also was evaluted independently by a
      gynecologist (GDO) and then, after surgical complications
      (see below), by ABC several months later.</p>

      <p class="case">At 16 and 26 years of age, the patient was
      living socially as a woman. She denied any uncertainty about
      being female from as far back as she could remember and did
      not report any dysphoric feelings about being a woman.
      Indeed, three of the present authors who interviewed the
      patient (SJB, GDO, ABC) were in agreement that she was
      comfortable living as a woman. She recalled that during
      childhood, however, she self-identified as a "tomboy" and
      enjoyed stereotypically masculine toys and games. On the
      other han, the patient had not engaged in cross-dressing or
      other forms of passing as a boy, and she recalled that her
      favorite playmates usually were girls and that her best
      friend was always a girl.</p>

      <p class="case">The patient's perception was that her mother
      was a "matter-of-fact" individual who, when told that she
      needed to rear her child as a female, simply did so. The
      patient indicated that in this respect she is much like her
      mother and, despite numerous adversities, has decided that
      she simply has to get on with life and do whatever she can
      rather than worry or obsess about issues.</p>

      <p class="case">Before the patient's birth, the parents were
      having long-standing marital difficulties and were seen for
      counseling by ABC. The patient's conception was motivated, in
      part, by the parent's attempt to salvage their marriage;
      however, the parents eventually divorced when the patient was
      approximately 3 to 4 years of age, in part because of the
      father's alcoholism but also because of the father having had
      a greater difficulty than the mother in dealing with the
      "loss" of his son. After a few years, her mother remarried
      and the patient developed a positive relationship with her
      stepfather, although there were some concerns about his
      drinking and his relationship with her mother.</p>

      <p class="case">Two months before the patient's 11th
      birthday, she was started on feminizing hormonal therapy
      (Premarin), which has continued to the present time. The
      patient was told about the circumcision and penile ablation
      when she was 12 years of age because she had begun asking her
      mother whether there was something wrong with her. During the
      interview with the mother when the patient was 16, she
      reported that the penile stub, which had been left after the
      initial surgery, became erect when the patient showered or
      swam, and that this caused some difficulties dressing her in
      bathing suits. At 16 years of age, the patient reported that
      she was aware that her genitalia looked neither exactly like
      those of other girls nor like those of a boy.</p>

      <p class="case">When seen at age 16, the patient had been
      admitted to hospital for vaginoplasty. At that time, she
      denied any concerns about her gender identity and clearly
      wished to proceed with the repair of her genitalia to make
      them suitable for sexual intercourse with males.</p>

      <p class="case">At 26 years of age, the patient returned to
      hospital for additional vaginoplasty. She reported difficulty
      with intercourse after her earlier surgery because the
      vaginal opening was too small. At the time of the second
      surgery, she was in a relationship wih a man and wished to be
      able to have intercourse. She also reported three significant
      sexual relationships with women. The patient noted that she
      found women more physically attractive than men, especially
      when naked. She found male genitalia "funny"; hoever, she
      found men sexually attractive if they were clothed or in
      underwear. In addition to the three relationships with women,
      the patient reported three sexual relationships with men. She
      reported better relationships with men in terms of sharing
      intersts (eg, in her occupation) and a sense of openness with
      them. She felt, however, that she got along better sexually
      with women. In the relationship with her current male
      partner, she reported that she had tried to scare him off,
      apparently out of a sense that he would reject her when he
      knew her. Despite these rebuffs on her part, they appeared to
      be getting along well and she had begun to realize that he
      was, in fact, accepting of her and liked her for who she
      was.</p>

      <p class="case">Physically, the patient presented as a tall
      (175 cm), thin female, casually dressed but readily perceived
      as a woman. On examination at age 26 (performed by GDO), her
      breast development was Tanner stage V with a B size cup.
      Abdominal and pubic examination revealed a mons with a
      midline deficit consistent with her two previous
      reconstructive surgeries. The external genitalia showed
      prominent, redundant, bilateral rugated labia majora with a
      positive cremasteric reflex. The remains of the penile glans
      were consistent in size with a normal clitoris but deviated
      to the right. It was positive for sensation. She had a
      palpable, thick chord of erectile tissue running from the
      glans over the pubic symphysis, remnants of the corpus
      spongiosum. She specifically complained of engorgement of
      this area with sexual arousal. She had a 2-cm mass on the
      anterior aspect of the left labia majora which she found
      irritating; it was later determined to be the remnants of the
      scrotal sac. The vaginal introitus had a reasonable opening,
      acceptable for intercourse; however, there was a stenotic
      band on the right anterior margin which she complained made
      intercourse painful. The vaginal canal accepted two fingers
      with good length, but deviated 30 derees to the patient's
      left and reportedly made penile-vaginal intercourse
      impossible. She reported arousal with stimulation of the
      reconstructed clitoris and her breasts.</p>

      <p class="case">The patient denied ever feeling that she had
      wanted to be a male and saw many advantages to being female;
      however, she readily acknowledged masculine interests,
      consistent with her occupation in a "blue collar" job
      practiced almost exclusively by men. She did not report a
      desire to become a parent. Despite her masculine occupational
      and recreational interests, she related to the interviewer as
      a female, discussing her dilemmas around her current
      relationship. She reported that previously she used to
      dislike her nose and thought that she was too skinny and too
      tall, but now feels that the only part of her body that
      bothers her are her genitals. This was related to their
      interfering with her being able to have intercourse. Her
      overall lifetime score on the Kinsey scale<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> (a 7-point rating scale, where 0 =
      exclusive heterosexuality and 6 = exclusive homosexuality) in
      fantasy was a 5 (predominant sexual attraction to women) and
      in behavior was a 3 (equivalent amounts of sexual experience
      with men and women). The patient's self-described sexual
      identity was "bisexual."</p>

      <p class="case">Unfortunately, after the most recent surgery,
      the patient developed a recto-vaginal fistula. Within a few
      months of the surgery, the patient and her male partner
      separated for reasons other than the patient's physical
      problems. The patient's post-surgery omplications have been
      monitored by ABC and she reported to him that she was
      currently living with a new partner, a woman, in a lesbian
      relationship.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">The psychosexual development of our patient
      was both similar to and different from the patient described
      earlier.<sup><a href="#n15">15,17,18</a></sup> Our patient
      differentiated a female gender identity, with no evidence of
      gender dysphoria in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood; in
      contrast, the other patient had adopted a male gender
      identity after experiencing intense discomfort living as a
      female, apparently from approximately the beginning of
      adolescence,17 if not earlier.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18,22</a></sup> At the time of the interview at
      age 26, our patient was living with a man, but they
      subsequently separated and she began a new relationship with
      a woman. The other patient was married to a woman. Our
      patient had a bisexual sexual identity; the other patient had
      a heterosexual sexual identity. The patients were similar in
      that they had a childhood history of tomboy-like behavior,
      including a high activity level and a preference for
      stereotypically masculine toys. However, our patient also
      recalled healthy friendships with other girls, compared with
      the other patient, who was apparently rejected and socially
      ostracized by other girls.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      Our patient was predominantly sexually attracted to women;
      the other patient was exclusively sexually attracted to
      women. Our patient had sxual experiences with both women and
      men; the other patient had sexual experiences only with
      women.</p>

      <p class="text2">The most plausible explanation of our
      patient's differentiation of a female gender identity is that
      sex of rearing as a female, beginning at approximately 7
      months of age, overrode any putative influences of a normal
      prenatal masculine sexual biology. Altough it is not possible
      to state with precision what constituted our patient's sex of
      rearing as a girl, it clearly included her parents agreeing
      to the sex reassignment decision (although this was easier
      for the mother than for the father), the adoption of a
      stereotypically female name, and the patient being perceived
      as a girl by significant others in her social environment. In
      this case, then, the experiment of nurture was successful
      regarding female gender identity differentiation.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are two likely reasons, perhaps
      related, why the gender identity development of our patient
      differentiated as a female, whereas it did not (at least in
      the long run) in the previous case. First, in our case, the
      decision to reassign the patient to te female sex occurred
      approximately between 2 and 7 months of age; in the other
      case, it occurred only at 17 months, and surgical castration
      and vaginoplasty were performed at 21 months. Second, it is
      possible that the parents of our patient, particularly the
      mother, had less ambivalence about the decision than the
      parents of the other patient, perhaps because the decision
      was made earlier in the patient's life.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is, however, of importance that our
      patient had a strong history of behavioral masculinity during
      childhood and a predominance of sexual attraction to females
      in fantasy. Girls with CAH also display masculine gender role
      behavior<sup><a href="#n7">7,26</a></sup> and, in
      adulthood,are more likely to be bisexual or homosexual than
      are female controls.<sup><a href="#n8">8,27,28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some would argue, therefore, that both the
      behavioral masculinity in childhood and the predominance of
      sexual attraction to females in adulthood are related to our
      patient's normal masculine sexual biology in utero,
      particularly with regard to prenatal anrogenization of the
      central nervous system.<sup><a href="#n29">29,30</a></sup>
      Perhaps, therefore, these two components of psychosexual
      differentiation-gender role and sexual orientation are more
      strongly influenced by biologic factors than is gender
      identity formation. This conjecture is consistent with
      experimental research on lower animals in which, for example,
      it is well established that female fetuses exposed to
      increased levels of androgen exhibit a shift toward
      male-typical patterns of gender role behavior and
      sex-f-partner preference.<sup><a href="#n31">31-33</a></sup>
      There is, however, no comparable animal analogue for human
      gender identity formation, given its subjective,
      phenomenologic nature.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nonetheless, it also is important to note
      that our patient desired, at least at the time of our
      evaluation, to pursue a sexual relationship with a man;
      indeed, her primary reason to seek additional vaginoplasty in
      adulthood was to enhance the sexual aspec of that
      relationship. However, during the course of our interviews
      with the patient at age 26, she switched from living with a
      man to living with a woman, suggesting that her partner
      preferences remain in flux, and the long-term nature of her
      interpersonl sexual relations is uncertain.</p>

      <p class="text2">Because cases of ablatio penis in infancy
      are so rare, and long-term follow-up data are scant, it is
      obviously impossible to know whether our patient or the
      previous case would be more typical of the psychosexual
      outcome in a larger sample of such individals. However, our
      case suggests that it is possible for a female gender
      identity to differentiate in a biologically normal genetic
      male, which supports the original conclusion of Money et
      al<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> that sex of rearing may be
      the most important determinant of a erson's gender
      identity.</p>

      <p class="text2">At present, however, the clinical literature
      is deeply divided on the best way to manage cases of
      traumatic loss of the penis during infancy.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,18,34-37</a></sup> On the one hand, there is
      resort to the orthodox policy advocated by Money and
      colleagues.<sup><a href="#n1">1,5</a></sup> On the other
      hand, Diamond and Sigmundson<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>
      suggest that such patients be reared as boys, despite the
      absence of a penis, on the grounds that the central nervous
      system has been biased in a masculine direction, in part
      because of normal prenatal androgenization. They recommend
      that "[s]urgery to repair any genital problem, although
      difficult, should be conducted in keeping with this
      paradigm."<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> To some extent,
      the course of action in individual cases may be dictated
      partly by parental choice between these two competing models
      of psychosexual management. Additional study is clearly
      required to decide which model of management results in the
      best possible psychosocial and psychosexual adaptation for
      individuals so affected.</p>
