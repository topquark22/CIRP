        <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT. <i>Objective.</i> To describe
        the etiology and management of the group of abnormalities
        referred to as the inconspicuous penis.</p>

        <p class="abstract"><i>Patients.</i> Nineteen boys referred
        to two pediatric urologists over a period of two years with
        penises that appeared abnormally small, but on palpation
        and measurement were found to have normal shaft with a
        normal stretched length. Diagnoses included were buried
        penis, webbed penis, and trapped penis. Patient&rsquo;s
        ages ranged from one week to 13 years.</p>

        <p class="abstract"><i>Findings.</i> There were eight
        patients (42%) with trapped penis, and <span
        class="yellow">all were complications of circumcision. (age

        penis, two had been circumcised prior to diagnosis.</span>
        One (5%) had webbed penis and one (5%) had combined buried

        medical conditions or parental concerns. The webbed penis
        was surgically repaired as was the combined buried and

      <p class="text2">Inconspicuous penis is a term used in
      referring to a phallus that is or only appears to be small.
      Seven urologic entities that fall under this term have been
      described.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> These conditions are
      poor penile suspension, buried penis, webbed penis, trapped
      penis, concealed penis,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      diminutive penis,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and
      micropenis (five of these are shown in figure 1). Proper
      treatment is dependent on accurately diagnosing which entity
      is present.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the inconspicuous penis is well
      described in the urologic literature over the past 25 years
      failed to reveal a reference regarding the inconspicuous
      penis or any of the seven entities (except micropenis) that
      make up this condition. It is important, however, for
      pediatricians to be aware of this group of disorders for
      three reasons: first, <span class="yellow">circumcision is
      certainly contraindicated in some</span><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup>; second, the abnormal appearance of
      the external male genitalia may be a source of psychologic
      trauma for children.<sup><a href="#n4">4-6</a></sup>; and
      third, some cases may be associated with sexual
      dysfunction,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> pain, and/or
      abnormalities of the urinary stream.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> These problems may be prevented if the
      children are referred to a skilled urologist for appropriate
      surgical reconstruction.</p>

      <p class="text2">A brief review of the anatomy in the genital
      area is helpful in understanding the inconspicuous penis and
      methods of surgical repair. Scarpa's fascia is a membranous
      fascial sheet composed of elastic tissue which covers the
      anterior abdominal wall subc utaneously. It extends
      inferiorly over the external inguinal ring and into the penis
      and scrotum with the superficial fascia of the groin and
      perineum. Finally, the penis is attached to the front and
      sides of the pubic arch by means of the penile suspens ory
      ligament.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> (Fig. 2).</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1986, Maizels et al,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> developed the first classification
      system for a group of five disorders they called the
      inconspicuous penis (Fig. 1) The literature on this subject
      is confusing because various authors use the same terms but
      with different meanings. In this paper we will attempt to
      describe and define each of the seven entities currently
      included under the term inconspicuous penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">We present a review of cases of
      inconspicuous penis seen over the past 2 years by members of
      the General Pediatrics Section and two members of the Section
      of Pediatric Urology at Phoenix Children's Hospital. Nineteen
      boys qualified for inclusion in th is series by meeting the
      definition of Maisels et al.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> We
      note the characteristics of these children, as well as their
      treatment and results of treatment. The cases are described
      in the Table. The following cases illustrate the three
      categor ies of inconspicuous penis found in our series:
      buried, trapped, and webbed penis.</p>

      <h4 align="center">CASE 1: BURIED PENIS</h4>

      <p class="text2">A nine year old was referred because the
      patient and both parents were concerned about the appearance
      of his penis. Physical examination revealed a very obese
      uncircumcised child with a very prominent mons pubis. Only 2
      cm of the penis was visible, a lthough palpation revealed a
      normal penile length with well formed corpora.</p>

      <p class="text2">Surgery included lysis of dense dartos
      bands, degloving of the penis, and dissection of the shaft to
      the pubic bone. The foreskin and Z-plasties were use to
      provide appropriate covering for the shaft. Suprapubic
      liposuction was also performed. At fol low-up in three
      months, the penis was normally protuberant and the surgical
      incisions had healed well.</p>

      <h4 align="center">CASE 2: TRAPPED PENIS</h4>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">A 2-day-old underwent a
      routine circumcision. Examination of the penis prior to
      circumcision revealed a normal shaft and glans. He
      subsequently developed cicatricial scarring and phimosis
      rapidly over a 2-week period. The penis became entrapped in s
      car tissue and retracted into the prepubic fat and fascia.
      Contractures healed over the distal glans, leaving a very
      small opening for urination.</span> He was referred to a
      pediatric urologist, who diagnosed trapped penis at 4 weeks
      of age. The contractures subsequently softened over the first
      year of life. By age 1, the penis was fully extended, thereby
      eliminating the need for surgical revision of the
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4 align="center">CASE 3: WEBBED PENIS</h4>

      <p class="text2">A 12-day-old was referred to the department
      of pediatric urology for circumcision. A penile abnormality
      had been noted on the initial newborn assessment. Physical
      examination revealed an uncircumcised phallus with a
      nonretractable foreskin and significant penoscrotal webbing.
      Circumcision was attempted by his primary physician, but the
      webbing was extensive enough to prevent placement of the
      Gomco clamp.</p>

      <p class="text2">The patient was observed for 6 months, but
      there was no change. The abnormality was subsequently
      repaired. Surgery consisted of circumcision followed by
      degloving of the penis, lysis of abnormal connective tissue
      bands, and removal of excess skin and subcutaneous fascial
      tissue. The procedure was finished with longitudinal closure
      and approximation of the shaft and coronal skin such that the
      penis extended appropriately. Several follow-up visits
      revealed good healing, with a normally positioned and
      extended penis.</p>

      <h4 align="center">RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="text2">The cases listed in the Table are primarily
      of three types: older, very obese boys with or without proper
      circumcisions; infants with a large peripenile fat pad with
      or without a normal circumcision; and infants with a
      circumcision resulting in the complications of phimosis
      and/or cicatricial scarring. In our series of 19 patients,
      there were 8 trapped penises (42%), 9 buried penises (47%), 1
      webbed penis (5%), and 1 case of combined buried and webbed
      penis. The ages of diagnosis ranged from 1 week t o 13 years.
      Ten children had been circumcised before referral and 9 had
      not. Of the 10 circumcised cases, only 2 had a retractable
      foreskin; the other 8 of these were trapped.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thirteen patients underwent surgical
      procedures, 12 of whom were seen in follow-up. All were
      considered by their surgeon and family to have a satisfactory
      or good outcome. Two patients did not undergo repair because
      of parental concerns or underlying medical problems. Three
      patients are currently scheduled for surgical repair. One of
      our cases of buried penis was associated with a urinary tract
      infection. In that patient, circumcision and lysis of
      adhesions were performed to help avoid recurrent infections
      as well as for cosmetic purposes.</p>

      <p class="text2">Seven (37%) of the 19 children were not
      referred by their physicians. Four of these had a trapped
      penis; 3 had buried penis. One case of trapped penis resolved
      with conservative management. All of the other self-referred
      cases were surgically repaire d. One case of trapped penis
      which developed after circumcision resulted in the initiation
      of a medical liability suit against the primary
      physician.</p>

      <h4 align="center">DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">An abnormal appearance of the external
      genitalia may have psychologic effects on the child and his
      family.<sup><a href="#n4">4,6</a></sup> Fear of discover and
      teasing by classmates may result in depression, feelings of
      inadequacy, and insecurity. Boys may exaggerate the possible
      functional and cosmetic significance of anomalous genitalia.
      Parents frequently worry about future potency and fertility.
      Early surgical reconstruction may therefore benefit the child
      and parent as well.<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> It is
      very important for the primary care physician to make a
      correct diagnosis and to promote timely referral.</p>

      <p class="text2">The buried penis was initially described by
      Keyes<sup><a href="#n8">8,9</a></sup> in 1919. It consists of
      a penile shaft that is otherwise normal but buried within an
      overabundance of prepubic fat (Figs. 3 and 4) Abnormal dartos
      bands coursing between Scarpa's fascia and the penis, binding
      the penis in varying degrees, have also been
      described.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">Circumcision of the inconspicuous penis is
      contraindicated before the urologist examines the
      child.</span><sup><a href="#n1">1,3</a></sup> The penis may
      simply appear to have a redundant foreskin and need
      circumcision. Instead the penis may be bound by dartos bands
      or penoscrotal webbing and the shaft will be demonstrated to
      be a normal length when freed up surgically. It is essential
      that primary care physicians be aware of this fact, because
      <span class="yellow">a circumcision may render optimal
      surgical revision difficult or impossible. In addition the
      circumcision may result in an unsatisfactory result, with
      cicatricial scarring and/or phimosis (trapped
      penis).</span><sup><a href="#n1">1,10</a></sup> Repair of the
      trapped penis is significantly more costly than simple
      circumcision and presents additional surgical risks. In some
      cases the dartos bands may be palpable,<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> a physical finding that may help
      make the diagnosis. Buried penis may occur with or without
      phimosis.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> In addition, the
      penis may be inconspicuous when the penile suspensory
      ligament anchors the penis to the pubic bone so poorly that
      the penis droops and the normal contour of the phallus is
      lost (poor penile suspension). Some children may have both of
      these problems simultaneously.</p>

      <p class="text2">The webbed penis consists of midline skin
      webs and/or dartos bands at the penoscrotal angle which bind
      the ventrum of the penis to the scrotum (Fig. 5). This
      obscures the penoscrotal angle and the penis as well<sup><a
      href="#n">1,9</a></sup>. This fusion may be compl ete, with
      total absence of differentiation of the penis from the
      scrotum, or incomplete, with one or more webs of varying
      length connecting the penis and scrotum.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> The webbed penis may occur rarely as
      an isolated anomaly, but more commonly occurs in conjunction
      with a hypospadias, chordee, or micropenis.<sup><a

      <p class="text2">The trapped penis is characterized by the
      shaft of the penis being bound down in scar tissue and thus
      becoming embedded in the scrotum and prepubic fat, (Fig. 6).
      <span class="yellow">This can be seen after trauma or
      overzealous circumcision. However, it may also occur after an
      appropriate circumcision when the buried penis is contained
      within an enlarged fat pad, allowing the penile skin to be
      pushed forward and heal over the glans. The most common
      antecedent in the literature is a circumcision which removes
      an excessive amount of skin from the penile shaft as well as
      the prepuce.</span> The trapped penis may also be the result
      of removing too little inner preputial skin. In this
      instance, the raw edges of the incised foreskin protrude
      beyond the distal portion of the glans. With nothing to
      separate them, they may heal together. As healing takes
      place, the penis is tethered by scar tissue which retracts
      the penis, frequently leaving little more than the urethra
      visible. Of the children in our series, 42% came to us with
      this iatrogenic complication.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">Physical examination of the trapped penis
      may reveal a scarred or irregularly shaped glans with
      apparent displacement of the meatus and/or tenting of the
      scrotum or skin of the lower abdomen toward the base of the
      penis. There may be a history of delayed healing of the
      circumcision due to extensive tissue damage.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some authors<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      have used the term concealed penis to pertain the phallus
      that is normal but concealed behind overlapping suprapubic
      fat. It exists only in extremely obese individuals.</p>

      <p class="text2">A penis may be small and malformed as a
      result of epispadias/exstrophy, severe hypospadias,
      persistent mullerian structures, or chromosomal
      abnormalities. These individual entities are well described
      in the literature. This category is sometimes referred to as
      the diminutive penis and is distinguishable from micropenis
      since the micropenis is small but not malformed.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,6</a></sup> The micropenis may be secondary to a
      number of endocrine abnormalities involving the
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis such as hypopituitarism,
      Kallman's syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome. Rudimentary
      testes and anorchia may be associated with micropenis.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">All of the urologic entities under the term
      inconspicuous penis except micropenis and diminutive penis
      have a normal-sized phallus. One may palpate adequate corpora
      and demonstrate the normal length of the stretched penis. The
      normal range for newborns is 3.5 plus/minus 0.7 cm.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,18</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Cases have been reported in which in error,
      a circumcision was done to help expose an inconspicuous
      penis.<sup><a href="#n1">1,5</a></sup> There was no increased
      exposure, however, and valuable foreskin, which could have
      been used in subsequent surgery, was lost. There was no
      increased exposure, however, and valuable foreskin, which
      could have been used in subsequent surgery was lost. In many
      cases when the shaft of the penis is surgically allowed to
      protrude normally, there is insufficient skin to cover the
      shaft fully. Use of the foreskin becomes vital for optimum
      surgical repair. In some cases no repair may be needed and
      the urologist may proceed with a simple circumcision.
      However, this decision should remain with the surgeon and the
      primary care physician should leave the foreskin intact.</p>

      <p class="text2">The various surgical repair procedures are
      well described in the literature. An array of techniques are
      available including Z-plasties, lipectomy, liposuction,
      dartos band release, vascularized skin flaps, split thickness
      skin grafts, and anchoring of the skin at the base of the
      penis to the pubic periosteum.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2,6,10,12-16,19,20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some authorities believe the treatment of
      choice for the concealed penis (with a true overlapping
      abdominal fat pad is weight reduction,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> although this has not been uniformly
      effective and may be difficult to achieve and
      maintain.<sup><a href="#n1">1,6,11,21</a></sup> Lipectomy and
      liposuction may be valuable.</p>

      <p class="text2">The indications for surgical treatment of
      the inconspicuous penis are not clear. The appearance of the
      inconspicuous penis of many, but not all boys will improve
      with growth.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Case 2 is a
      dramatic example of this. This two month old child with a
      trapped penis and only a very small opening for urination
      developed a normal penis by age 1 year. The natural history
      of these entities, including how many boys will spontaneously
      achieve an acceptable appearance and at what point in life is
      not known. Longitudinal studies are needed. Simple weight
      loss may well be the treatment of choice for many boys with
      inconspicuous penis. Horton et al prefer to delay surgical
      correction until school age or older, whereas others advise
      surgical intervention in infancy.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Devine has described adults with persistent
      buried penis. Reflecting on his experience with adolescents
      who have experienced no improvement over time, Shapiro<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> suggests the existence of anatomic
      variants that are permanent. Devine describes a range of
      severity of tethering of the penis by dartos bands. Some
      bands connect to the proximal penis, but others course to the
      coronal margin, the latter being the most severe.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Some of our younger patients have
      demonstrated such extensive binding of the penis by elastic
      dartos bands at surgery that is seems unlikely that this
      excessive fibrous tissue would resolve spontaneously.
      Conversely, children whose pubic fat is easily retracted to
      reveal a normal penis may well deserve lengthier observation.
      In the future, we hope, physicians will learn to identify
      early in life those variants that will self-correct in
      infancy. We have observed marked improvement of an infantile
      trapped penis (case 2). Time and perhaps progressive
      retraction of the foreskin by a caretaker, may correct many
      of these.</p>

      <p class="text2">While definitive indications for surgical
      repair are being developed, we must keep in mind that boys
      with an inconspicuous penis are conscious of this problem
      prior to puberty and that surgery may be more helpful
      "earlier rather than later."<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,13</a></sup> Children with urinary tract
      infection associated with a webbed or buried penis should be
      considered for early surgical correction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Several articles describe an improved
      self-image after surgery for patients with the entities
      described herein, in children old enough to have sufficient
      awareness of their problem.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,10,14</a></sup>. When the parents were asked,
      they were said to have been highly motivated to have the
      surgery done and are commonly pleased with the
      results.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The primary care <a
      href="/library/legal/USA/llewellyn/">physician's
      liability</a> in this area seems high. Forty-two percent of
      the cases in this series had a complication of their
      circumcision necessitating surgical revision. One of these
      cases in his series resulted in a law suit against the
      primary care physician because of a poor result after
      circumcision. To quote Devine, "unless concealment of the
      penis is recognized, this can be an anatomic, a psychologic,
      and a litigious disaster."</span><sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Thirty-seven percent of our cases were
      self-referred to the urologist, perhaps indicating
      underrecognition and underreferral by medical professionals.
      Further education of the medical community regarding the
      inconspicuous penis is important. Several papers state that
      the buried penis is a rare entity. In the past 4 months, as
      modest awareness of our interest in this subject came about
      in our community, the number of referrals has risen
      dramatically. We suggest that these entities are not as rare
      as previously thought and, with better recognition, larger
      numbers of cases will be diagnosed and treated.</p>
