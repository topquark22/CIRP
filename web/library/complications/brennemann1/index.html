      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This article from the year 1921
      was chosen for the Circumcision Reference Library because of
      Dr. Brennemann's excellent description of the meatal disease
      that occurs only in circumcised boys. Dr. Brennemann goes to
      great lengths to blame the ammoniacal diaper as the cause of
      meatitis, meatal ulceration, and meatal stenosis while almost
      ignoring the obvious conclusion that removal of the
      protective foreskin by doctors causes the problems described,
      and that the problems described could easily be stopped by
      not doing circumcisions.</p>

        CIRCUMCISED<br />
         CHILD*</p>

         <span class="city">CHICAGO</span></p>

      <p class="text">For a number of years my attention has been
      drawn with increasing frequency to a peculiar lesion of the
      meatus urinarius <span class="yellow">occurring only in
      circumcised male children, and characterized by ulceration,
      crusting, narrowing of the urinary passage, and nearly always
      accompanied by painful urination, often with distended
      bladder, and occasionally, by hemorrhages.</span> I have been
      able to find only one reference<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      to it in the literature. While this condition probably is
      common in occurrence in the experience of all pediatricians,
      I am inclined to believe that it is more common in this
      locality and in more recent years than in some other
      localities and in my own earlier years, and that the
      manifestations are more severe.</p>

      <p class="text">My first impression was that this lesion was
      caused by rubbing against the clothing of the naturally most
      accessible and most vulnerable portion of the exposed glans,
      the meatus. This, however, seemed improbable, for it would
      hardly explain the deep ulceration often seen, and it was
      soon evident that similar lesions about the diaper region
      were not infrequently present at the same time. For a time
      attention was directed to the narrowness of the meatus as a
      possible cause, though we soon learned that we were looking
      for a cause in what was really an effect. Routine examination
      of the urine gave us no help. Only in the past year or two
      has the real explanation become increasingly evident. In the
      twenty-five or more cases seen during the past winter and
      spring there has been no exception to the observation that
      this lesion is associated with what is known as the
      ammoniacal diaper. I had not been aware that anyone had ever
      reached a similar conclusion, but on looking on
      Zahorsky&rsquo;s paper<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> on the
      ammoniacal diaper again I found that he had devoted a
      paragraph to an excellent description of the lesion in
      question and had also traced its origin to the ammoniacial
      diaper So far as I know this is the only reference to this
      association in the literature.</p>

      <p class="text">While the condition itself is rarely, if
      ever, of serious import, it is nevertheless usually very
      troublesome and the apparent lack of knowledge of its
      pathogenesis would seem to warrant its presentation. Its
      peculiar location, moreover, always causes deep concern in
      the household.</p>

      <p class="text">More commonly the lesion manifests itself as
      a rather superficial ulceration about the meatus. From what
      we have know about the development of similar ulcers in the
      diaper region due to the same cause it is probably preceded,
      as pointed out by Zahorsky,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> by
      a vesicle, though this is rarely seen before it is broken. At
      times the ulcer becomes deep and extensive, up to 2 mm. in
      depth and more than 5 mm. in width. Usually it is more or
      less covered by a crust which is very firmly attached over a
      considerable area. Surrounding the ulcer there is often an
      area of inflammation which involves both the adjacent surface
      of the glans and extends into the urethral opening with
      consequent narrowing. In the severe cases there are commonly
      present at the same time erythema, vesication, and ulceration
      of the glans, scrotum and rest of the diaper region wherever
      the diaper is in extensive contact with the skin.</p>

      <p class="section">SYMPTOMS</p>

      <p class="text">The symptomatology is evident from the
      pathology. The salty urine coming in contact with the denuded
      meatus causes acute pain when the child begins to urinate. He
      immediately stops urinating and cries with pain. A subsequent
      attempt to urinate, as the discomfort from a distended
      bladder forces him to try again, leads to the same result. No
      amount of coaxing will induce him to try it again until the
      distended bladder becomes intolerable or begins to overflow.
      Then, having once started, the grateful relief that comes
      from emptying the bladder and the lessening of the pain of
      the first contact with the urine will cause him to continue
      to urinate until the bladder is more or less emptied. Unless
      the condition is quickly remedied the same cycle repeats
      itself at the next urination. Often the emptying of the
      bladder is deferred for from twelve to eighteen hours. As a
      rule, the condition is less severe than just described, and
      the child will urinate before there is a very painful
      distension.</p>

      <p class="text">In some cases there is a greater or lesser
      degree of mechanical obstruction. The urethral opening is
      nearly always narrowed, often so much so that the urinary
      stream is threadlike and the urine can be expelled only with
      evident effort. I have never seen this alone cause serious
      obstruction. A more frequent complete cause of nearly
      complete obstruction is the scab that forms on the ulcerated
      area. This is very adherent and can hardly be removed without
      tearing and bleeding of the denuded and adjacent portion of
      the glans. This is practically always accompanied by a
      narrowing of the meatus, and it is at times impossible to
      tell whether the occlusion is due chiefly to the scab or to
      the narrowing of the urethra itself. Two cases that recently
      came under observation illustrate these points.</p>

      <p class="section">REPORT OF CASES</p>

      <p class="case">C<span class="sc">ASE</span> 1.&mdash;A child
      aged 2 years, was unable to empty his bladder, both because
      of pain and obstruction and because of overextension of the
      bladder. From time to time, there was a dribbling oveflow
      that found considerable difficulty in making its exit. In
      spite of desperate efforts, aided by coaxing from his mother,
      he was able only intermittently to force out to a height of
      two feet two tiny divergent streams no thicker than a fine
      thread.</p>

      <p class="case">Examination showed the meatus completely
      covered with a firm dry parchment-like crust that almost
      completely occluded the opening, and so firmly adherent, it
      did not seem expedient to remove it at the time. The bladder
      was distended almost to the umbilicus. By continuous, gentle
      pressure over the bladder, we were finally able to empty it
      almost completely through the two minute openings. If
      pressure over the bladder was stopped for a moment, the flow
      would stop immediately as if the bladder had been paralyzed
      by the over distention.</p>

      <p class="case">C<span class="sc">ASE</span> 2.&mdash;A boy,
      aged 2&frac12; years, was apparently unable to empty the
      bladder, probably because of pain and of great narrowing of
      the meatus. The opening was barely visible, being so small
      that it would hardly have admitted a fine needle. The meatus
      itself was apparently narrowed to this degree and was further
      covered by a tough skinlike crust that had to be removed, but
      only at the expense of considerable pain and some blood and
      adjacent epidermis. Even then the meatus could barely be made
      out, and it was difficult to see how the bladder could be
      emptied through it.</p>

      <p class="text">A permanent narrowing of the meatus,
      analogous to a stricture, apparently never occurs ever after
      repeated and prolonged ulceration. In the two cases just
      cited, after appropriate treatment, the urinary stream was
      apparently of normal caliber on the following day. The
      restoration to a normal condition is commonly as rapid as the
      original production of the lesion itself.</p>

      <p class="text">One other symptom occasionally causes great
      concern to the mother but is never serious. If the ulceration
      is deep and extensive, there is, at times, a little
      hemorrhage especially at the end of urination. It is
      surprising that this does not happen oftener when one
      considers the great vascularity of the glans.</p>

      <p class="text">The ammoniacal diaper that apparently always
      causes this condition of the meatus is to me still surrounded
      with mystery in spite of its common occurrence. Clinically it
      manifests itself as follows. An infant or young child that
      has, perhaps, attracted no attention to its general heath or
      its state of nutrition, or digestion, except that it is
      constipated, is noticed when changed at night or in the
      morning to have a very strong odor of ammonia about the wet
      diaper. This odor is not simply one detectable on close
      effort. The fumes are comparable to those than escape from a
      bottle of ammonia. They are distinctly irritating to the
      nostrils, and even cause a biting sensation in the eyes as
      one stoops over the open diaper. This condition is rarely
      noticed, except at night and most often toward morning. If
      the urine of such a child voided later is allowed to stand in
      a vessel no odor of ammonia is detectable even if it is kept
      at room temperature. Sometimes, the condition is present
      every night, continuously and consecutively, as in a case I
      saw recently, for over a year. Again, it is apparently
      absent, or barely noticeable, for weeks and months, only to
      appear again without any change in health or in food, with
      violent manifestations. In one of my own children during the
      second year the condition would occasionally appear in mild
      form, then be absent for weeks or months. Suddenly at night,
      without premonition, or any known provocation, the child
      would wake up toward morning screaming with pain, the diaper
      would be almost intolerably strong of ammonia, and the whole
      diaper region would be reddened and painful as if scalded,
      and covered with blisters. In a day or so without any
      treatment the condition would disappear as mysteriously as it
      came, only to reappear at a subsequent time, perhaps for a
      longer stay. The condition is apparently much more frequent
      in private homes than in hospital wards.</p>

      <p class="text">Many children have this ammoniacal diaper for
      weeks and months without any other unpleasant symptoms.
      Usually it produces at least a local redness and subsequent
      desquamation of a large part of the diaper region. In severer
      cases there is scattered vesication and ulceration. These
      ulcers often remain denuded for a long time, often they heal
      over but remain as discrete nodules during the whole time
      that the ammoniacal condition persists. Often the exposed
      meatus is the only seat of a deeper lesion; rarely it
      escapes; as a rule, it is involved with the rest of the
      diaper region.</p>

      <p class="text">For the production of skin lesions contact
      with wet ammoniacal diaper is apparently always necessary.
      The word diaper is, of course, here used in a generic sense
      and includes any article of clothing, or bedding. The skin is
      always most irritated where the contact is most intimate and
      prolonged&mdash;over the buttocks and lower back, from lying,
      and across the abdomen and about the thighs above the keens,
      because of the tighter application of the diaper. The male
      meatus is peculiarly exposed to such contact, and the
      delicate mucous membrane is the most vulnerable spot; the
      female meatus is well protected and is rarely if ever
      involved. The effect of contact was well illustrated in the
      first case cited above. For several nights the child did not
      wet the diaper and the ulcer healed. A few days later he was
      again unable to urinate because of a new ulceration of the
      meatus. Without any questioning the mother said that he had
      wet his underclothing over a small spot with urine and that
      contact with this spot had apparently brought the trouble on
      again. The favorable effect that follows dispensing with the
      diaper at night further confirms this view.</p>

      <p class="section">AGE INCIDENCE</p>

      <p class="text">The age incidence of this condition is of
      special interest. &lsquo;It is almost unknown in the nursing
      baby, though I have seen it in a baby on mixed feeding; it is
      relatively rare in the first six months, and is only
      exceptionally encounted before the third or fourth month. It
      is much more common in the latter half of the first year;
      probably attains its maximum frequency and severity during
      the second year; becomes less common during the third year,
      and vanishes soon after this. The lesser incidence after the
      third year is probably due to the greater infrequency of bed
      wetting without which it would not be recognizable.</p>

      <p class="section">TREATMENT</p>

      <p class="text">The treatment of this condition naturally is
      directed to the lesion itself if it is present, and to the
      prophylaxis and treatment of the ammoniacal diaper.</p>

      <p class="text">If the meatus is ulcerated or crusted over to
      some extent, and there is no obstruction, the proper therapy
      would seem to consist in applying thickly some substance like
      petrolatum that would coat over the involved area so that
      urination may be less painful and so that there will be
      protection on contact with the diaper. When the meatus is
      acutely inflamed, the opening narrowed and covered with an
      obstructing scab, and urination is difficult and particularly
      painful because of the inflammatory condition, a wet boric
      acid dressing has always quickly relieved the urgent
      indications. Gauze wet with the solution is fluffed over and
      about the penis, this is covered with a thick layer of cotton
      extending beyond the gauze to keep it in place, and over this
      the diaper is pinned snugly. The gauze is kept wet with the
      solution and is changed after each urination. The relief from
      this procedure has been unfailing and almost instantaneous.
      Dispensing with the diaper at night often has a favorable
      effect in preventing new lesions and in allowing old ones to
      heal. Mechanical dilatation has never been necessary. Neither
      has catherization, whih would be strongly contraindicated
      unless absolutely unavoidable.</p>

      <p class="text">If the scab itself is causing obstruction, or
      if it can be removed without injury to the adjacent tissues,
      this should be done. This is facilitated by the previous
      application of petrolatum or a wet dressing.</p>

      <p class="text">The cautious application of a very weak
      solution of cocain to the ulcerated area in case the child
      will not urinate because of pain would seem rational and
      unobjectionable, although the remembrance of a former attempt
      to urinate might lessen its usefulness.</p>

      <p class="text">The prophylaxis of the ammoniacal diaper
      presupposes a knowledge of its pathogenesis. To my mind we do
      not possess this knowledge at the present time with complete
      clarity.</p>

      <p class="text">The more inviting theory is that based on the
      work of Keller and others that in certain nutritional
      disturbances due to the ingestion of cow&rsquo;s milk fat
      beyond the infant&rsquo;s tolerance there is produced a
      relative acidosis of enteric origin which manifests itself in
      the urine in the excretion of a hypernormal amount of
      ammonium salts. This view has been formally championed by
      Southworth,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> who reported a
      number of cases presenting the clinical picture and the
      patients were relieved of this symptom when the fat was
      reduced to an adequate degree. He also reported a similar
      result from the administration of alkalies, favoring
      potassium, calcium and magnesium bases over those of sodium.
      The cases described by Southworth were nearly all in younger
      infants in whom there was a definite clinical picture of
      overfeeding with fat or with milk and the therapeutic results
      would seem to leave little doubt as to the nature of the
      primary condition that produced the ammoniacal diaper in
      these cases.</p>

      <p class="text">I am inclined to believe that this
      explanation may be accepted as one factor in the case of
      younger infants fed exclusively on the bottle. This might
      further explain the greater frequency of this condition in my
      own cases for it has been my practice in recent years to give
      more milk and less carbohydrate in the bottle feeding than
      formerly. In fact, the condition has been so frequent in my
      own cases that I have assumed it to be in the range of normal
      and have used no measures to relieve it unless there was a
      definite skin irritation. Even in those cases, however, where
      a dietetic relationship seems most evident I have been struck
      by the frequency with which neither reduction of the fat by
      lessening the milk or by taking off the cream nor the use of
      alkalies to an appreciable therapeutic effect.</p>

      <p class="text">It seems to me, however, quite impossible on
      this hypothesis alone to explain the occurrence of the
      ammoniacal diaper in a very large number of cases. It is, for
      example, a well known fact that the ammoniacal diaper occurs
      with greater frequency when dried milk is used than with
      almost any other food. In my own experience, the severer
      manifestations, such as vesication and ulceration, occur more
      frequently in older children who are on a liberal diet and
      are getting very little milk. One of the most severe and
      protracted cases I have seen with extensive ulceration of the
      meatus, scrotum, and, in fact, of the whole diaper region,
      was in a child, aged 2&frac12; years, that was on a general
      diet and getting only a pint of skimmed milk. In some cases
      the mothers have stated that these older children were
      getting practically no milk at all. Cutting down on the milk
      or removing the cream, even to a marked degree, has in the
      case of older children been quite disappointing from a
      therapeutic standpoint. The use of alkalies has given the
      same impression.</p>

      <p class="section">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text">It is interesting in this connection to note
      that the ammoniacal diaper occurs less frequently and less
      severely with cream mixtures than with simple whole milk
      mixtures, or even, as has been pointed out, with dried
      skimmed milk mixtures. If this observation is correct, then
      the fat content alone cannot account for this condition. This
      is further borne out by the relative freedom from this
      symptom when albumin milk is given in spite of its high fat
      content. It will be recalled that Czerny and Keller&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;milchn&auml;hrschaden,&rdquo; which is apparently due
      to an excess of fat in the infant&rsquo;s food and in which
      there is a heightened urinary excretion of ammonium salt, is
      produced when when whole milk is fed in excess of tolerance.
      Certainly, it does not occur as definitely with cream
      mixtures, in spite of the fact that fat is assumed to be the
      factor that causes it. It will be recalled further that
      Czerny and Keller state that the soap stool does not occur
      with cream mixtures and they offer the ingenuous explanation
      that this is due to the fact that it is difficult to get
      cream that is not &ldquo;zersetzt,&rdquo; that is,
      unfavorably influenced by bacteria.</p>

      <p class="text">To me it seems more reasonable that while the
      symptom under discussion may be due to the fat, at least in
      that class of cases where there is clinical evidence of
      overfeeding with fat, that fat will cause it only in certain
      combinations, and only if certain other food elements are
      represented in certain relative ratios to the fat. Thus, in a
      milk mixture, it occurs less frequently if the fat is
      relatively higher than the protein and the salts as compared
      with their normal relative representation in whole milk; and
      more frequently if the normal portion is maintained, or even
      if the fat is relatively lower than the protein and the
      salts. The fact is not sufficiently emphasized that the
      different food elements cannot be considerd as isolated
      factors but must always be considered in relation to the
      other food elements in the causation of clinical
      pictures.</p>

      <p class="text">While the fat within these limitations may
      account for an increased excretion of ammonium salts in a
      certain proportion of these cases, and may thus supply one
      factor in the pathogenesis of the ammoniacal diaper, I do not
      believe that it accounts for all or most of them. Even in
      those cases where the fat would seem most clearly to be the
      causal agent, it is impossible to exclude the protein, or
      even the salts as a factor. I have gained the impression
      that, in the production both of the clinical picture of
      &ldquo;milchn&auml;hrschaden,&rdquo; and of the ammoniacal
      diaper, it is not so much a matter of fat as of the amount of
      milk even if it is partly skimmed. The protein and the salts,
      if this observation is correct, would command attention and
      especially, of course, the protein. This would explain many
      phenomena that cannot be accounted for on the assumption that
      the fat is the main factor. It would explain the frequency of
      the ammoniacal diaper when Dryco Milk is used in spite of its
      low fat content because as commonly used the amount of
      protein is relatively considerably higher than with ordinary
      fresh milk mixtures. Assuming that a milk from which two
      thirds of the fat has been removed is reduced to about one
      eighth or one ninth of its volume in the process of
      dissication, and that eight level tablespoons of the dried
      produce represent one ounce by weight, then one level
      tablespoon would equal approximately one ounce of fresh milk,
      skimmed to a nearly equal extent. In giving two and one-half
      or even three tablespoons of the dried milk to each pound of
      baby, as is commonly done, one would give the protein and
      salt equivalent of at least from 1&frac12; to 3 ounces of
      milk to the pound of baby which would represent a much larger
      amount than is ever used in feeding fresh milk. This might
      explain the greater frequency of the occurrence of the
      ammoniacal diaper in my own experience in more recent years
      during which I have been feeding more milk, that is, more
      protein and less carbohydrate. On this basis, too, one might
      find a satisfactory explanation for those cases in older
      children that are on a nearly general, almost, fat free,
      diet.</p>

      <p class="text">The failure of ammonuria to occur, except in
      connection with the wet diaper in situ, together with the
      peculiar behavior of the ammoniacal diaper would suggest a
      further non-dietetic factor residing in the diaper itself. A
      hyper-excretion of ammonium salts cannot alone be assumed to
      account for the ammoniacal diaper. We have here not combined
      but free ammonia. The ammonium salts that would be present in
      this condition are fairly stable, and it is very doubtful
      whether the evaporation of the urine would be carried to a
      point where ammonia would be liberated to the extent found in
      these diapers. It is well known that certain alkalies break
      up ammonium salts and liberate free ammonia. On this basis
      Zahorsky,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> after failure to
      combat the condition by lessening the fat in the food and by
      the use of alkalies therapeutically, came to the conclusion
      that the &ldquo;immediate cause of the ammonical diaper is
      the presence of an alkali in the diaper or in the
      bedding.&rdquo; This alkali he traced to &ldquo;strong
      alkaline soap that had not been rinsed thoroughly from the
      diapers, or bedding, or to the presence of an alkaline stool,
      or to the possible presence of lime in the dried diaper in
      locations like St. Louis where the lime content of the water
      is high.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text">Zahorsky&rsquo;s explanation was distinctly
      appealing in that it alone, apparently, could account for the
      mysterious vagaries of the ammoniacal diaper; the startling
      appearance and sudden disappearance without known change in
      food or in health; the invariable association with the wet
      diaper in situ only; the failure of dietetic and alkaline
      treatment in many cases; and the greater incidence and
      severity of the symptom in older children which he also
      noted. Unfortunately he contented himself with saying:
      &ldquo;It is not necessary to give the details&rdquo; and
      presented no evidence. That soap, lime, and an alkaline stool
      do not explain the condition in a great many cases can easily
      be demonstrated by excluding these factors
      experimentally.</p>

      <p class="text">Other agents, however, may produce the same
      result and the action of bacteria naturally suggests itself.
      This in a recent personal communication Zahorsky says:
      &ldquo;The diaper or the bedding, infected by an enormous
      number of bacteria, not boiled daily, must also be
      considered.&rdquo; The thought would suggest itself further
      that bacteria might liberate ammonia, not directly or
      indirectly from the ammonium salts in the urine, but from
      urea. It is well known, for example, that <i>Micrococcus
      ureae</i>, and probably other organisms in the urine, act on
      urea with the liberation of ammonia. These considerations
      would lead us back again to the clinical impression already
      recorded that the determining factor in those cases in which
      the dietetic factors are easily grasped is the amount of milk
      given even if skimmed; that is, of protein, rather than, say,
      the amount of fat. More milk carries with it more protein and
      an increased excretion of urea for bacteria to act upon.</p>

      <p class="text">The further question would naturally arise
      whether a hyperexcretion of ammonium salts, or of urea, due
      to an excess of either the fat or the protein in the diet, is
      a prerequisite to the production of the ammoniacal diaper; or
      whether something in the diaper itself is sufficient to
      elicit the condition in normal urine. So far as I know, the
      answer to that question is not at hand. The fact that free
      ammonia occurs with such regularity with certain foods, and
      an excessive amount of fresh milk such as Dryco milk, would
      point to the conclusion that the diaper alone is sufficient
      to bring out this symptom unless there is an abnormal urinary
      condition. The occurrence in older children on a general diet
      makes it hard to assume an abnormal urinary factor and would
      suggest that the diaper can cause it even if the urine is
      normal. The invariable association of this symptom with the
      diaper would again suggest the diaper as the important factor
      and especially in these cases where the symptom appears
      erratically. Some further observation made by Zahorsky are
      interesting but inconclusive in this connection. He found
      that &ldquo;the ammoniacal content of the urine was
      relatively higher in older children than in infants,&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;while rather high in children presenting with this
      symptom (ammoniacal diaper) not higher than in many who did
      not present it.&rdquo; He found further that &ldquo;all but
      one of the patients so examined,&rdquo; that is, those having
      ammoniacal diapers, &ldquo;showed the ammonia nitrogen higher
      in the morning after the night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo; The fact
      that the ammoniacal diaper is rare in hospital cases as
      compared with those in private practice can be accounted for
      on either basis. In hospitals all diapers are thoroughly
      sterilized for obvious reasons, while in homes this is
      commonly omitted. On the other hand, it is also true that
      hospital babies, as a rule, can stand less milk than babies
      in private practice and so the dietetic factor is reduced to
      a minimum.</p>

      <p class="text">While our knowledge of the whole subject
      lacks precision and finality, nevertheless it gives us a
      definite line of treatment. The prophylaxis of the ammoniacal
      diaper and so of the ulcerated meatus, in accordance with our
      present state of knowledge, would consist then, in the
      avoidance of an excess of milk in the diet and a compensating
      use of the more tolerable carbohydrates, the dextrin-maltose
      preparations in younger infants, and those together with the
      starches in older infants. The treatment would consist in the
      reduction of the amount of milk; the increase, if permissible
      of the carbohydrates; together with the use of such alkalies
      as milk of magnesia, lime water, or potassium salts. In
      selected cases malt soup best meets all of these indications.
      In older children on a general, nearly milk free diet the
      dietetic treatment is still baffling in my own experience.
      The indications on the part of the diaper would be met by
      thorough rinsing and thorough boiling daily of all diapers
      and night clothes, possibly even the bedding.</p>

      <p class="section">CONCLUSIONS</p>

      <p class="text">1. An ulcerated meatus in <span
      class="yellow">the circumcised child only</span> is a
      frequent symptom.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The
      &ldquo;ammoniacal diaper&rdquo; is the cause of this
      lesion.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The etiology of the
      &ldquo;ammoniacal diaper&rdquo; is still obscure but seems
      due to one or both of two factors: a dietic error that
      increases the ammonium or urea content of the urine, and the
      presence of an alkali or of certain bacteria in the
      diaper.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The treatment
      consists in correcting, if possible, the dietetic error and
      in thorough rinsing and boiling of diapers, night clothes and
      bedding.</p>
