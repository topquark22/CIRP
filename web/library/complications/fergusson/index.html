      <p><b>ABSTRACT.</b> The prevalence of penile problems was
      examined in a birth cohort of more han 500 New Zealand
      children studied from birth to 8 years of age. By 8 years,
      circumcised children had a rate of 11.1 problems per 100
      children, and uncircumcised children had a rate of 18.8 per
      100. The majority of these problems were for penile
      inflammation including balanitis, meatitis, and inflammation
      of the prepuce. However, the relationship between risks of
      penile problems and circumcision status varied with the
      child's age. During infancy, circumcised children had a
      significantly higher risk of problems than uncircumcised
      children, but after infancy the rate of penile problems was
      significantly higher among the uncircumcised. These
      associations were not changed when the results were adjusted
      statistically for the effects of a series of potentially
      confounding factors. <i>Pediatrics</i> 1988;81:537-541;

      <p class="text2">During the last two decades there has been
      mounting opposition to the practice of routine neonatal
      circumcision. The extent of the opposition is well
      illustrated by the joint statement from the American Academy
      of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists which concluded that "there is no absolute
      medical indication for routine circumcision."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> However, this strong conclusion has
      been challenged by recent evidence that has suggested that
      there is a higher rate of urinary tract infection among
      uncircumcised male infants<sup><a href="#n2">2-4</a></sup>
      and that uncircumcised children are more susceptible to
      penile problems.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Although the
      evidence for a possible link between circumcision and reduced
      rates of urinary tract infection in infancy is
      controversial,<sup><a href="#n6">6-9</a></sup> the general
      trends in the research evidence suggest that circumcised and
      uncircumcised children may differ with respect to their
      medical history.</p>

      <p class="text2">To cast further light on this issue, we
      studied longitudinally a birth cohort of more than 500 New
      Zealand boys from birth to 8 years of age. The aims of this
      research were twofold: (1) to examine the association between
      the child's neonatal circumcision status and risks of penile
      problems during early and middle childhood and (2) to adjust
      any apparent correlation between neonatal circumcision status
      and risks of penile problems for the potentially confounding
      effects of a number of social and perinatal factors.</p>

      <p class="section">METHODS</p>

      <p class="text2">The data were collected during the first
      nine stages of the <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2671961&amp;dopt=Abstract"
       target="_blank">Christchurch Child Development Study</a> in
      which a birth cohort of 1,265 children born in the
      Christchurch (New Zealand) urban region was studied at birth,
      4 months, and annual intervals until the age of 8 years. At
      each time, information about the health, family conditions,
      and social background of the children was collected by a
      structured interview with the child's mother and supplemental
      information was obtained from other sources including
      hospital medical records, general practitioner notes, and a
      diary record of the child's medical attendances kept by the
      mother. The method of data collection and quality control of
      the data has been described in previous papers.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,11</a></sup> The following measures were used
      in the analysis.</p>

      <p class="text2">When the child was 4 months of age,
      information concerning his circumcision status was collected
      by maternal report and from existing records.</p>

      <p class="text2">During the period from birth to 8 years,
      information about the child's history of medical attendance
      for penile problems was collected routinely from maternal
      reports, supplemented by information from a diary record kept
      by the mother and from medical records. From this
      information, the child's history of medical attendance was
      reconstructed and the following measures of penile problems
      were obtained: (1) the number of episodes of inflammation of
      the penis experienced by the child. Penile inflammation
      included balanitis, meatitis, inflammation of the prepuce,
      and conditions in which the penis was described as sore or
      inflammed without any further diagnostic elaboration; (2) the
      number of episodes of phimosis experienced by the child.
      These episodes included all times the child sought medical
      attention for phimosis and associated symptoms. However,
      episodes for which the child was brought to medical attention
      for "tight" or "nonretractable" foreskin but was not treated
      were not classified as phimosis because it was likely that
      most of these attendances were the result of parental anxiety
      or uncertainty about the development of the foreskin rather
      than any pathologic condition in the child; (3) inadequate
      circumcision requiring repair or recircumcision; and (4)
      postoperative infection following circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is important to recognize that the data
      on medical attendance for penile problems was collected as
      part of a much larger longitudinal study of child health and
      development in which the primary concern was not with the
      issue of the longterm consequences of circumcision. This
      feature of the data collection process places a number of
      restrictions on the quality of the collected data.
      Specifically, data relating to immediate postcircumcision
      problems and penile problems that were treated at home
      without medical attention were not available. Also,
      diagnostic details of medical attendances for penile problems
      were limited. The net result of these imprecisions in the
      data collection process is that the incidence and prevalence
      of penile problems probably underestimated and the problems
      can only be described in terms of broad diagnostic
      categories. Nonetheless, we believe that the trends that
      emerge from the analysis are likely to reflect general
      differences in the medical histories of circumcised and
      uncircumcised children.</p>

      <p class="section">Family Social Background</p>

      <p class="text2">Information was available about the
      following aspects of the child's family social background:
      (1) maternal age; (2) maternal education - this was
      classified as mother lacked formal educational
      qualifications, mother had secondary school qualifications
      (New Zealand school certificate, university entrance) or,
      mother had tertiary qualifications (university degree,
      professional qualifications); (3) ethnicity children were
      classified as Polynesian (ie, Maori or Pacific Islander) or
      white; (4) family socioeconomic status - this was based on
      the Elley and Irving'<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> scale
      of socioeconomic status for New Zealand. This divides the
      population into six social classes on the basis of male
      occupation. Children whose parents were unemployed or whose
      family depended on social welfare benefits for their major
      support were defined as having "unclassified" socioeconomic
      status level.</p>

      <p class="section">Perinatal History</p>

      <p class="text2">Measures of the child's birth weight and
      gestational age were obtained from medical records of the
      birth.</p>

      <p class="section">Sample Size</p>

      <p class="text2">The present analysis is based on all male
      children observed at each year during the period from birth
      to 8 years. All children studied at each year were used so
      that all available data could be used and the analysis could
      have the maximum statistical sensitivity.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Sample numbers varied from 591 for
      the group of boys studied at 1 year to 553 for the group of
      boys studied at 8 years. The sample studied at 8 years
      represented 87% of the 635 boys who entered the study at
      birth and 93% of those boys who were resident in New Zealand
      at 8 years.</p>

      <p class="section">Results</p>

      <p class="text2">The rates of penile problems per 100
      children 0 to 8 years of age related to the child's
      circumcision status are given in Table 1. The majority of
      these problems related to various forms of penile
      inflammation (75%) with phimosis (16%), inadequate
      circumcision (4%), and postcircumcision infections (4%)
      accounting for the remaining problems. (A number of children
      who were not circumcised during the neonatal period are shown
      as having postcircumcision infections. These were children
      who were circumcised after the age of 1 year and thus were at
      risk for post circumcision infection.) By 8 years of age, the
      uncircumcised boys had a higher rate of penile problems (18.8
      per 100) than the circumcised boys (11.1 per 100). This
      difference was marginally statistically significant (&chi;2/2
      = 5.75, <i>P</i> &gt; .10).</p>

      <p class="text2">The comparisons given in Table 1 do not take
      into account the age at which penile problems occurred. This
      is shown in Table 2, where annual rates of penile problems
      related to neonatal circumcision status are given. During
      infancy, circumcised children were at greater risk for penile
      problems: the circumcised group had a rate of 5.5 problems
      per 100 children, in contrast to 1.1 problems per 100 for the
      uncircumcised group (&chi;2/1 = 9.70, <i>P</i> &lt; .01).
      After infancy, uncircumcised children were at greater risk
      for penile problems: the circumcised group had a rate of 5.6
      problems per 100 children, in contrast to 17.7 problems per
      100 for the uncircumcised boys (&chi;2/2 = 9.97, <i>P</i>
      &lt; .01).</p>

      <p class="text2">Collectively, these findings suggest that
      during infancy circumcision was associated with increased
      risks of penile problems but after infancy with a reduction
      in these risks. However, the comparisons given in Table 2 do
      not take into account the potentially confounding social or
      perinatal factors that may have influenced both the child's
      neonatal circumcision status and risks of penile problems. To
      account for these factors the data were reanalyzed using
      logistic regression methods<sup><a

      <p class="section">Discussion</p>

      <p class="text2">The findings of this 8-year longitudinal
      study suggest the presence of an interactive relationship
      among the child's neonatal circumcision status, age, and
      risks of penile problems. During infancy circumcised children
      had a significantly higher risk of penile problems, whereas
      after infancy these problems were significantly higher among
      the uncircumcised boys. The net effects of these trends were
      that by 8 years of age the uncircumcised boys had experienced
      more than 1.5 times the rate of penile problems. The apparent
      correlations between the child's neonatal circumcision status
      and risks of penile problems could not be explained by the
      confounding effects of a range of social and perinatal
      factors.</p>

      <p class="text2">The higher rate of problems among
      circumcised children during infancy may reflect the effects
      of exposure of the glans to irritation by wet diapers. This
      has been noted previously and Kaplan<sup><a
      href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> argues that meatitis and meatal
      ulcers occur almost exclusively in circumcised boys for this
      reason.</p>

      <p class="text2">The higher rate of problems in uncircumcised
      children after infancy is consistent with the findings of
      Herzog and Alvarez<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> who reported
      a higher rate of problems among uncircumcised boys in a
      sample of boys 4 months to 12 years of age. These authors did
      not report higher rates of problems among circumcised infants
      younger than 1 year of age. However, this difference may be
      explained by the fact that Herzog and Alvarez's data were
      collected cross-sectionally and on a sample of children aged
      4 months to 12 years and thus may have failed to provide
      adequate longitudinal data concerning the prevalence of
      penile problems during infancy. In common with Herzog and
      Alvarez's findings, the great majority of penile problems
      occurring in our sample were relatively minor and most (64%)
      were resolved after a single medical consulation.</p>

      <p class="text2">These findings and recent evidence<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-4</a></sup> suggesting a link between urinary
      tract infection during infancy and circumcision status
      inevitably resurrect the controversy about whether neonatal
      circumcision is a justifiable procedure. On the one hand, it
      may be argued that the possible link between urinary tract
      infection and circumcision and the greater rates of penile
      problems among uncircumcised boys after infancy justify
      circumcision. <span class="yellow">On the other hand, it may
      be suggested that the higher rates of penile problems among
      circumcised children during infancy coupled with the
      complications of circumcision including the small risks of
      death and mutilation do not justify the alleged benefits of
      circumcision.</span><sup><a href="#n1">1,17-19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This issue has been complicated by the
      suggestions that circumcision reduces risks of penile cancer
      and genital herpes.<sup><a href="#n19">19-21</a></sup>
      However, it has also been argued that the apparent
      correlations between circumcision status and these conditions
      could be due to confounding genetic or environmental
      factors.<sup><a href="#n17">17,22</a></sup> Additionally, it
      is unclear whether good hygiene can offer the alleged
      benefits of neonatal circumcision.<sup><a href="#n1">1,
      22-25</a></sup></p>

      <div class="cirp">
        <p class="text1">[CIRP Comment: This report by Fergusson
        <i>et al.</i> has received considerable attention as it has
        been cited by several medical societies in their position
        statements on male circumcision. It is, therefore, worthy
        of careful examination.</p>

        <p class="text1">[Fergusson <i>et al.</i> find that
        circumcised boys have 1) more penile problems in the first
        year of life, while 2) uncircumcised boys have more penile
        problems in the span from 1 to 8 year of age. The first
        finding is well supported by the medical literature. The
        foreskin is protective<sup><a href="#c1">1</a></sup> and
        the removal of the foreskin is well documented to cause
        meatitis, meatal ulcers, and meatal stenosis.<sup><a
        href="#c2">2,3</a></sup></p>

        <p class="text1">[The second finding, however, is worthy of
        careful examination as it is counterintuitive. Fergusson
        <i>et al.</i> reported more inflammation, more phimosis,
        and, most curiously, an equal amount of post-circumcision
        infection in uncircumcised boys.</p>

        <p class="text1">[The reported increase in inflammation in
        uncircumcised boys is especially problematical. It is not
        clear whether the inflammation is inherent in the prepuce
        or is caused by confounding environmental factors for which
        Fergusson <i>et al.</i> did not control. For example,
        forcible premature retraction of the prepuce or excesive
        washing<sup><a href="#c4">4</a></sup> is known to cause
        inflammation. The authors do not tell us what sort of
        hygenic care was practiced in New Zealand in those years.
        The prepuce of prepubertal boys should be left alone and
        only the outside should be washed.<sup><a
        href="#c5">5</a></sup> Improper hygienic care may have
        caused the reported high rates of inflammation in
        uncircumcised boys.</p>

        <p class="text1">[The reported high rates of phimosis are
        also deserving of some scrutiny. Most boys are born with
        non-retractile foreskins,<sup><a href="#c6">6</a></sup>
        which only gradually become retractable over a period of
        many years. Most boys in the 1-8 year-age-range have
        normal, healthy, non-retractile foreskins.<sup><a
        href="#c8">7,8</a></sup>. Confusion by medical doctors of
        the normal non-retractile developing prepuce with the
        pathological condition of phimosis has been and remains a
        problem.<sup><a href="#c9">9,10</a></sup> In many cases,
        pathological phimosis cannot properly be diagnosed until
        after puberty. Fergusson <i>et al.</i> do not report the
        diagnostic standards used to diagnose phimosis among the
        boys in the New Zealand birth cohort. Therefore, it is
        unclear whether the reported incidence of phimosis was
        truly phimosis or misdiagnosis of a normal condition.</p>

        <p class="text1">[A later study of boys from birth to age
        18 by Van Howe found substantially more penile problems in
        circumcised boys.<sup><a href="#c11">11</a></sup></p>

        <p class="text1">[The authors' failure to control for
        confounding environmental factors leave unclear whether the
        reported problems with the foreskin actually were caused by
        the simple presence of the foreskin or were the result of
        environmental problems such as improper hygenic care and
        the misdiagnosis of phimosis. In any case, the reported
        problems (inflammation and phimosis) were minor and so are
        easily and effectively treated with conservative
        therapy.<sup><a href="#c12">12,13</a></sup> They do not
        support non-therapeutic circumcision of the newborn.</p>
