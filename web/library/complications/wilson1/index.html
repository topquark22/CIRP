      <p class="title">Plastic Repair of the Denuded Penis*</p>

      <p class="authors">CARL L. WILSON, M.D., MORTON C. WILSON,
      M.D.,&dagger; <i>Fort Smith, Ark.</i></p>

      <p class="text1">P<span class="sc1">RIOR</span> <span
      class="sc1">TO</span> <span class="sc1">THE</span> <span
      class="sc1">ERA</span> of sulfonamide and antibiotic therapy,
      most cases of necrosis and sloughing of genital skin resulted
      from infection. In this mechanical age the most common loss
      of penile skin is avulsion by moving parts of machinery.
      Technical faults in circumcision, of course, can produce a
      similar result. Years ago a common method of circumcision was
      removal of excess skin by electrocautery. The redundant skin
      was pulled forward, a clamp applied, and the distal portion
      removed with the electrosurgical blade. This procedure is
      quick and simple. It controls bleeding, but it may
      occasionally result in interesting complications. Excessive
      traction on the foreskin may lead to removal of too much
      skin, varying amounts of glans may be included in the clamp
      or excessive current may energize the clamp, charring the
      skin proximal to it and producing gangrene with slough. We
      have recently treated such a case.</p>

      <p class="text2">Repair of genital injuries must strive for
      cosmetic restoration as well as functional result, since the
      psychologic injury may be quite as severe and the physical
      destruction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Surgery must usually be limited to skin
      grafting, since replacement of glandular or cavernosal
      substance cannot be accomplished. The ideal result should
      supply integument extensive enough to cover the denuded area
      and elastic enough to accommodate to erection, making
      allowance for growth in the infant and prepubertal boy. If
      possible, it is desirable to employ skin free of hair and of
      good tactile quality. The simplest, but least satisfactory,
      method is to utilize split thickness grafts from a relatively
      hairless donor sites such as the arm, thigh, or upper
      abdomen. Although employed successfully by Thorek,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>, Brown<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      and others, this procedure supplies relatively inelastic
      skin, and it is technically difficult to graft skin over a
      rounded surface.</p>

      <p class="text2">Full thickness pedicle grafts from the thigh
      or adjacent portions involve complicated multistage plastic
      procedures, and the skin so obtained is often too thick,
      lacking the necessary elasticity. Profuse sweating of the
      grafted skin may also be disturbing to the patient.</p>

      <p class="text2">The ideal solution is to employ a full
      thickness graft of scrotal skin which is particularly
      suitable due to its elasticity, redundancy, and abundant drug
      supply. Like penile skin, scrotal integument is sparsely
      covered with hair and rich in sebaceous glands.</p>

      <p class="text2">Repair can be accomplished either by the
      &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; method (Byars<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup>) of dissecting up flaps of scrotal
      skin which are approximated over the penis, or by undermining
      a cuff of scrotal skin and burying the naked penis in this
      subcutaneous tunnel (Veseen<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>).
      The covered penis is freed from this bed at a second stage.
      In those injuries to the penis which are accompanied by loss
      of scrotal skin, the same technic may be applied to utilize
      the adjacent skin in the thigh or abdomen.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sexually active patients who undergo partial
      amputation of the penis for carcinoma of the glans usually
      are able to maintain satisfactory sexual relationships. Thus,
      attempts to reconstuct a penis using rib cartilege or an
      acrylic prothesis should be reserved for virtually complete
      amputations.</p>

      <p class="section1">Case History</p>

      <p class="text3">We saw this patient 3 weeks after birth. The
      child had bene circumcised one day after delivery. The
      guillotine method of circumcision had been used and the
      electrocautery employed. Mother and child left the hospital
      on the 6th postpartum day. One week later another physician
      examined the child and found the entire penis to be black and
      gangrenous. Two days later it had apparently sloughed off
      completely and there remained only a small scarred area at
      the base.</p>

      <p class="text3">On physical examination at 3 weeks the penis
      appeared to have been amputated at its base. All that
      remained was an area of scarring the size of a five cent
      piece (Fig.1, a) The patient could void a stream about the
      caliber of a #23 hypodermic needle through a hairlike orifice
      in this scar. Cavernosal tissue could be palpated under the
      scar.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text3">At the age of 3 weeks a first stage
      procedure was performed under whiskey anesthesia. Scar tissue
      was excised and after removing dense adhesions, a completely
      denuded penis was exposed. There was complete loss of the
      glans, but about two-thirds of the penile shaft was intact.
      Two horizontal incisions were made an inch apart in the
      scrotum and the intervening skin undermined to create a
      subcutaneous tunnel (Fig. 2, b). The penis was inserted under
      this bridge of full thickness skin and the distal end sutured
      around the end of the penis leaving the amputated end
      exposed. (Fig. 1, c). The proximal, horizontal incision was
      closed vertically, utilizing the Heineke-Mikulitz principle
      to created increased skin length. (Fig. 1, d). A Furacin
      dressing was applied. Recovery was uneventful, healing
      complete and the patient discharged 12 days later.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text3">The second stage was performed six weeks
      later under open-drop ether. By this time scrotal skin was
      adherent over the entire penis and the cut distal end
      completely epithelialized (Fig 1, e). The penis was freed
      from its subcutaneous bed along with adequate flaps of
      scrotal skin adherent to the sides and distal end (Fig. 1,
      f). These three flaps were approximated without tension, over
      the naked ventral surface and the scrotal incision closed
      vertically (Fig. 1, e) The penis was freed from its
      subcutaneous bed along with adequate flaps of scrotal skin
      adherent to the sides and distal end (Fig. 1, f). These three
      flaps were approximated, without tension, over the naked
      ventral surface and the scrotal incision closed vertically
      (Fig. 1, g). A meatotomy was performed to insure an adequate
      urethral orifice. Recovery for this second procedure was also
      uneventful.</p>

      <p class="text3">The child is now four and one-half years
      after the operation, with a good functional and cosmetic
      result (Fig 2 a and b). He is voiding with a large stream
      (Fig 2, c).</p>

      <p class="section2">Summary</p>

      <p class="text2">(1) A case of partial amputation and
      complete denudation of the penis resulted from use of the
      electrocautery to perform a circumcision is reported.</p>

      <p class="text2">(2) A technic of full thickness skin
      grafting utilizing a subcutaneous tunnel of scrotal skin is
      described.</p>
