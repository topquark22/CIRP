      <p class="title">PENILE DENUDATION INJURIES AFTER
      CIRCUMCISION</p>

      <p class="authors">JOSE R. SOTOLONGO, JR., SAUL HOFFMAN AND
      MICHAEL E. GRIBETZ</p>

      <p class="source"><i>From the Departments of Plastic Surgery
      and Urology, Division of Pediatric Urology, Mount Sinai
      Medical Center, New York, New York</i></p>

      <p class="section">ABSTRACT</p>

      <p class="abstract">We present 3 cases of iatrogenic phallic
      denudation that were managed successfully nonoperatively. The
      concept of conservative, nonoperative management should be
      considered in denudation injuries.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Despite current doubts
      about its advisability neonatal circumcision still is
      performed almost routinely in many hospitals. Circumcision is
      not a completely benign procedure.</span> Iatrogenic injuries
      vary, and the management should be tailored according to the
      age of the patient and type of injury. We present 3 cases of
      iatrogenic penile denudation after circumcision. Modes of
      therapy are discussed.</p>

      <p class="section">CASE REPORTS</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Case 1.</i> A white male newborn was seen
      within hours after denudation of the penis secondary to
      ritual neonatal circumcision by a mohel. The injury consisted
      of sloughing of most of the skin of the penis (part A of
      figure). Treatment consisted of saline dressing 3 times a
      day. Complete regeneration of the penile skin occurred within
      6 weeks of initiation of treatment. Cosmetic results 3 years
      later were excellent (part B of figure).</p>

            circumcision. <i>B</i>. result 3 years later</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2"><i>Case 2.</i> A white male newborn was seen
      for necrosis of the shaft of the penis secondary to localized
      infection 1 day after circumcision by a mohel. Treatment
      consisted of proper systemic antibiotics and local wound
      care, that is saline dressing 3 times daily. Cosmetic results
      were excellent.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Case 3.</i> A 32-year-old Hispanic
      diabetic man under went circumcision. Postoperatively,
      infection at the suture line caused dehiscence and denudation
      of a third of the phallus. (a distance of 3 cm.) Wet to dry
      saline dressings were the sole treatment. The skin
      regenerated in 4 weeks with satisfactory cosmetic
      results.</p>

      <p class="section">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text2">The concept of skin regeneration in the
      denuded phallus is valid and is not limited to children as
      illustrated by case 3. Before resorting to complicated
      reconstructive procedures, conservative management should be
      considered a satisfactory option in select cases.</p>

      <p class="text2">A review of the literature revealed
      relatively few reports of iatrogenic injuries, given the high
      rate of circumcision. Of the reports available in the
      literature only two described a denudation injury. In 1 case
      the injury was treated with surgical burial of the penis in
      the thigh.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Two reports have
      alluded to successful conservative management, although the
      defects mentioned in one were ulcerations of the penile skin
      and not true denudations.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> In
      another report a 5 mm. band of denuded phallus was treated
      conservatively in a newborn, and denudation of the phallus
      and tesies were closed primarily.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Others studies focus on
      gangrene,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> necrotizining
      fasciitis,<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> necrosis of the
      glans,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> traumatic partial
      amputation of the glans,<sup><a href="#n8">8,9</a></sup>
      necrosis of part of the penile shaft skin<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> and iatrogenic burn of the penis,
      requiring reconstruction with a pedicle scrotal skin
      flap.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Septicemia also has
      been reported as a complication of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Our cases exemplify 3 general principles of
      denudation injuries: 1) In the newbonrn period even complete
      sloughing of the skin with superficial necrosis or total
      surgical degloving of the shaft (not affecting the corpora,
      urethra or glans) can be managed conservatively with
      excellent cosmetic results, 2) denudation of the penile shaft
      can be managed conservatively in adults only if the defect is
      less than half the of the total penile skin and 3) complete
      denudation in the adult should be managed with
      split-thickness skin grafting for optimal cosmetic and
      functional results. It is important to remember that a
      denudation injury resulting from circumcision does not
      dictate necessarily the need for skin grafting or a second
      operative procedure for repair.</p>
