[ABSTRACT]

Objectives   To present the most serious complications
   from circumcision and to compare the complications
   caused during mass and single circumcisions per-
   formed by medically trained or untrained operators.
Patients and Methods   The study comprised both a retro-
   spective and prospective analysis of 220 cases of
   complications from circumcisions occurring during
   the last decade and a comparison of the frequency
   and distribution of complications in mass (n=700)
   and single (n=600) circumcisions.
Results   Traditional (medically untrained) circumcisers
   were responsible for 85% of the complications and
   almost all the disastrous ones. The frequency of compli-
   cations from mass circumcisions was statistically sig-
   nificantly higher than that from circumcisions
   performed singly in operating room conditions (rela-
   tive ratio 3.05 and P<0.001).
Conclusion   Circumcision can have serious life-
   threatening and prolonged complications.  It should
   only be performed in medical institutions by suitably
   trained surgeons.   Mass circumcisions organized for
   any purpose carry significant risk and should be prevented.

Keywords  Circumcision complications, traditional,
   medical, ritual circumcision.
