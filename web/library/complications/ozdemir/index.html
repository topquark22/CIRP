      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision, the oldest and most prevalent
      surgical procedure in boys, is performed throughout the world
      for ritual, traditional or medical reasons. It is not so
      simple that It can be performed by anyone devoid of
      appropriate medical training [<a href="#n1">1-7</a>]. Most
      Turkish boys are circumcised at some time from the eighth day
      after birth to the age of puberty. Children with penile
      malformations. e.g. hypospadias, epispadias or medical
      contraindications, are not circumcised; if more than half of
      the glans can be clearly seen, the child is accepted as
      having been born with a circumcision and circumcision or
      traditional blood-letting are forbidden is not performed
      unless the prepuce covers more than half the glans. Female
      circumcision is not performed among Turkish tribes [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">The focus of this investigation was to
      evaluate the status of circumcision in Turkey (where the
      prevalence of circumcision reaches 99%) and to compare the
      most serious complications between circumcisions performed
      within and outside medical institutions. The latter were also
      analysed to compare mass and single circumcisions.</p>

      <p><b>Patients and methods</b></p>

      <p><i>Group 1</i></p>

      <p class="text1">During the last decade, 220 cases with
      complications from circumcision attended through emergency or
      outpatient departments at our hospital. Those patients with
      minimal bleeding that stopped immediately on compression and
      those with minor penile infection and no systemic symptoms
      who were cured by topical antibiotic administration were
      excluded. Patients requiring oral or parenteral antibiotic
      administration were included. Analyses were performed
      retrospectively for the first 6 years and prospectively for
      the last 4.</p>

      <p><i>Group 2</i></p>

      <p class="text1">A mass circumcision was organized in our
      hospital whereby, 700 children were circumcised during a
      5-day period; all the boys were registered and examined in
      the hospital. After local preparation with antiseptic
      solution and adequate draping and dressing, a penile
      anaesthetic block was applied using lidocaine. After 3-5 min.
      the circumcision was performed, with the help of a nurse.
      using a traditional clamping technique. The prepuce was
      gently retracted over the glans and detached until the
      coronal sulcus was apparent and if present, any smegma was
      removed. The coronal sulcus was marked over the prepucial
      skin and grasped by two mosquito clamps from the frenulum and
      opposite to it, and pulled distally without tension. By using
      a slightly larger straight clamp, the prepuce was grasped
      from the previous mark in the angle of coronal sulcus while
      pushing the glans proximally. Care was taken to avoid
      grasping the glans and frenulum during this procedure; the
      prepuce distal to the clamp was then cut using a scalpel.
      After providing sufficient haemostasis with 410 plain catgut,
      the edges of the skin and mucosa were sutured with 5/0
      chromic catgut. The wound was closed with an overlying sponge
      containing antibiotic cream. The mean operative duration was
      10 min. Paracetamol was used for analgesia in the first few
      days. After observation for 30 min the children were returned
      to their parents. The dressings were removed after 72 h and
      the first followup examination carried out. If forceful
      retraction was required, patients were prescribed a neutral
      ointment to prevent glanular desiccation. A second follow-up
      examination was made a week later and the last after 3
      months.</p>
      <i>Group 3</i><br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text1">Six hundred male children circumcised in the
      operating theatre during the last decade were evaluated for
      complications. The analyses were retrospective for the first
      6 years and prospective for the last 4 years. The indications
      for surgery were mainly phimosis and rarely paraphimosis.
      Ritual circumcision is not performed routinely in hospitals
      in Turkey. The clamp technique described above was preferred
      routinely although the sleeve resection technique was
      occasionally used for educational purposes. The latter
      provides better cosmetic results and is safer because the
      glans can be seen completely during procedure, but it takes
      longer to perform.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p><i>Group 1</i></p>

      <p class="text1">The frequency distribution of complications
      is given in Table 1. The bleeding was mild in 48 cases (49%),
      moderate in 40 (40%) and profuse in 10 (10%). Two children
      with profuse bleeding circumcised by the same non-medical
      professional required blood transfusion and one of them, a
      2-year-old, died. All of the cases with secondary phimosis
      were caused by inadequate circumcision and fibrosis, and were
      re-circumcised. Cysts were caused by silk sutures placed for
      haemostasis and were excised. Examples of severe complication
      are shown in Figs 1 and 2.</p>

      reconstructive surgery for scrotal skin loss was

      <p class="text1">The frequency distribution of complications
      is given in Table 2. At the pre-operative examination, five
      children with hypospadias, three with undescended testes, one
      with an inguinal hernia and three with hydrocele were not
      circumcised. Another 15-year-old boy with acute urethral
      discharge was not circumcised and appropriate therapy was
      prescribed. Most of the boys in this group was from either
      the frenulum or dorsally; sutures were needed in three cases
      and the others stopped bleeding with simple compression.
      Minimal tissue loss s were mostly from the glans, frenulum or
      penile skin d conservative therapy succeeded in all
      cases.</p>

      <p><i>Group 3</i></p>

      <p class="text1">The frequency distribution of complications
      is given in Table 2. Bleeding was mostly simple oozing and
      occurred within 24 h. All infections were noticed 3 days
      after the circumcision. The frequency of complications from
      circumcision was statistically significantly greater than
      that from circumcisions performed in operating room
      conditions (relative risk 3.05, P&lt;0.001).</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Unfortunately, most circumcisions throughout
      the world are performed by traditional circumcisers rather
      than by medically-trained professionals. In those patients
      with complications, only 5% of the circumcisions were
      performed by doctors, 10% by health technicians and the
      remaining 85% by traditional circumcisers. The traditional
      circumcisers in Turkey are commonly devoid of any medical
      training and belong to other professions such as barbers,
      traditional drummers and male servants of health
      institutions. They usually perform circumcision with
      self-made devices similar to the Mogen clamp.</p>

      <p class="text2">The present analysis emphasizes that the
      most serious complications are caused by traditional
      circumcisers this potentially dangerous traditional practice
      should be prevented. Furthermore, mass circumcisions become
      widespread and used by many sociopolitical relief
      organizations in Turkey as a method of advertisement. The
      present results suggest that even when performed at medical
      institutions, it is difficult to; provide enough sterile
      equipment and conditions for a safe mass circumcision.
      Moreover, mass circumcisions performed outside medical
      institutions are also becoming widespread and are mostly
      performed by health technicians or traditional
      circumcisers.</p>

      <p class="text2">In conclusion, circumcision is an important
      surgical procedure which has life-long effects and should be
      performed singly at medical institutions by trained medical
      staff. Mass circumcisions commonly organized for
      self-advertisement or for propaganda cause significant risk
      and should be stopped as soon as possible.</p>
