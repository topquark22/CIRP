      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> This study was devised to determine the
      prevalence of urinary symptoms among men living in the
      Australian cities of Melbourne, Sydney or Perth, and to
      identify factors associated with the presence of
      moderate-to-severe urinary symptoms.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> The study comprised a population-based
      sample of 1,216 men, aged 40-69 years, whose names were
      obtained through electoral rolls and who participated as
      controls in a case-control study of risk factors for prostate
      cancer. As part of a structured face-to-face interview, the
      men completed the International Prostate Symptom Score
      (IPSS). Men with moderate (IPSS = 8-19) or severe (IPSS &gt;
      or = 20) urinary symptoms were compared with those with mild
      or no symptoms (IPSS &lt; 8) using unconditional logistic
      regression.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> The age-specific prevalence of
      moderate-to-severe urinary symptoms (IPSS &gt; or = 8) in men
      aged 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 years was 16%, 23% and 28%,
      respectively. Compared with men with no or mild urinary
      symptoms (IPSS &lt; 8), men with moderate-to-severe symptoms
      were more likely to report not currently living as married
      [odds ratio (OR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.0]
      and being circumcised (OR = 1.5; 95% Cl 1.2-2.0). The
      increased likelihood associated with drinking an average of
      &gt; 60g per day of alcohol in the 2 years before interview
      was of marginal statistical significance (OR = 1.6; 1.0-2.6).
      There were no significant differences between men with IPSS
      &gt; or = 8 and those with IPSS &lt; 8 with respect to body
      mass index, education level, having had a vasectomy, or
      cigarette smoking.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> <span class="yellow">Among Australian
      men, being circumcised, or not currently living as married,
      were associated with increased prevalence of urinary
      symptoms.</span></p>

      to prostate problems, such as difficulty in urinating caused
      by benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate).]</p>
