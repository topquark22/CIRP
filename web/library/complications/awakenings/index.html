<H3>The following extract is from from <I>Awakenings: A Preliminary Poll of Circumcised Men</I>.</H3>
<P>
The following inherent risks are iatrogenic (doctor induced), and result 
directly from the neonatal circumcision surgery.(1)(2) As noted earlier, 
Williams and Kapila estimate that a realistic rate of complications from 
neonatal circumcision ranges from 2% to 10%. To many men who become aware 
of the function and value of the prepuce, the fact that this genital 
sensory organ was amputated from them at birth is itself a complication 
of circumcision; in which case, the actual complication rate is 100%.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Hemorrhage: Considering that a 6.5 pound infant has a total blood
volume of less than 8 ounces, bleeding from the frenular artery can
quickly cause shock and sometimes death. Serious hemorrhage occurs in
about 2% of infants. While death is a rare complication of circumcision,
it does occur and represents an unnecessary risk at which to place a
newborn. 
<P>
2. Infections: Localized or systemic (e.g., bacteremia, meningitis, 
osteomyelitis, lung abscess, diptheria, tuberculosis, tetanus and 
necrosis of the perineum). [The same study by Williams cited earlier 
reports that a realistic infection rate is probably as high as 10%.] 
Serious infections can cause irreparable and lifelong harm.
<P>
3. Urinary Retention: Swelling from the trauma of the surgery, pain 
associated with attempts at urination, and sometimes the Plastibell 
device (if used) can cause the infant to retain his urine. 
<P>
4. Laceration of penile and scrotal skin: to varying degrees.
<P>
5. Excessive penile skin loss: This occurs when the prepuce is drawn 
forward so much so that the entire penile skin sheath is removed. From 
puberty and beyond, penile bowing and pain occurs at the time of 
erection. Skin grafts are sometimes required.
<P>
6. Beveling deformities of the glans: Varying amounts of the glans are 
shaved off, leaving a scarred beveled surface, and at times the entire 
glans has been amputated.
<P>
7. Hypospadias: While this is more frequently a congenital defect, it can 
also result from circumcision. When the frenular area is drawn forward 
too far, the crushing bell may injure the urethra at the time the foreskin 
is removed, resulting in a urethral opening on the underside of the shaft.
<P>
8. Epispadias: When one limb of the crushing clamp inadvertently is 
passed into the urethra and is closed, it crushes the upper portion of 
the urethra and the glans, creating a urethral opening on the dorsum 
(top) of the glans.
<P>
9. Retention of the Plastibell Ring: The Plastibell, which normally falls 
off in 10 days, may be buried under the skin, causing ulceration and/or 
necrosis. Loss of the glans has also been reported.
<P>
10. Chordee: This is often congenital, but can also result from 
circumcision. Dense scarring at the frenular area causes penile bowing 
upon erection; may require Z-plasty surgery to release the bowing.
<P>
11. Keloid Formation: Prominent scars can occur where the skin-mucous 
membrane has been incised, crushed or sutured.
<P>
12. Lymphedema: Chronic swelling of the glans due to infection or 
surgical trauma which can block lymphatic return.
<P>
13. Concealed Penis: The circumcised penis becomes hidden in the fat pad 
of the pubic area.
<P>
14. Skin Bridges: This is a common complication that consists of one or 
more thick areas of scar tissue that form bridges between the coronal 
edge of the raw glans penis (head) and the raw circumcision would on the 
shaft. For some men these can be quite painful during erection, 
restricting the free movement of shaft skin and pulling on the glans.
<P>
15. Phimosis of Remaining Foreskin: When only a segment of the foreskin is
removed, the remaining tip sometimes becomes tight and nonretractable,
often subjecting the child to a second surgery. 
<P>
16. Preputial Cysts: Cysts caused by infection or mechanical distortion 
blocking the sebaceous glands.
<P>
17. Skin Tags: Can occur at the circumcision line, representing an uneven 
removal of foreskin.
<P>
18. Loss of Penis: This can be caused by constricting rings such as the 
Plastibell or by the use of an electrocautery device. More frequently the 
loss is the result of infection, with the penis becoming increasingly 
necrotic until finally the entire organ sloughs. The proposed solution in 
many cases is gender reassignment.
<P>
19. Meatitis: Inflammation of the urethra, from loss of protective 
foreskin, which can lead to ulceration and meatal stenosis. Many infants 
and children suffer this after their loss of the protective foreskin.
<P>
20. Meatal Ulceration: Caused by meatitis and/or abrasions from dry 
diapers and from diapers soiled with urine and feces. Meatal ulceration 
does not occur in the intact male and occurs in up to 50% of circumcised 
infants.
<P>
21. Meatal Stenosis: In advanced meatal ulceration, scar tissue can 
constrict the urethral opening causing urinary obstruction. Meatal 
stenosis is usually not apparent for several years, occurring in about 
one-third of all circumcised infants and not at all in intact males.
<P>
22. Death
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Of particular note here is that while these complications can be apparent 
immediately or over the short-term, almost every one of these affects the 
male to some degree for a lifetime and can therefore be classified as 
long-term harm as well.
<P>
This list of complications may be of little immediate concern to the 
reader or even to the circumcisers who perform such surgeries. Given the 
number of circumcisions performed just in the past 50 years however, and 
from the view of men whose genitals bear evidence of these complications, 
the impact is enormous. As was acknowledged earlier in this report, 
penile complications resulting from neonatal circumcision are 
underreported and ignored. As stated earlier in this report, a 
conservative estimate of the incidence of physical complications among 
males born from 1940 to 1990 ranges from 1.3 million to almost 6.6 
million. It must also be reiterated that these figures do not include 
subsequent sexual or psychological complications manifesting later in life.
<P>
Additionally, the most common complications of serious hemorrhage (2%) 
and infection (up to 10%) can have mild to severe long-term effects when 
they lead to secondary blood, brain, and nervous system disorders that 
are rarely reported as complications resulting from infant circumcision.
<P>
The consequences of hemorrhage were dramatically highlighted in the 1993 
case of Demetrius Manker, a 6-month old Carol City, FL boy. As reported 
in the June 26, 1993 edition of "The Miami Herald", Demetrius was 
circumcised by pediatrician Robert D. Young and sent home. Demetrius' 
mother, Louse Manker, later noticed he was bleeding from the incision and 
called the doctor several times and a hospital once. "She followed the 
doctor's instructions to the letter," according to her attorney Patrick 
Cordero. The bleeding continued and paramedics were called, but Demetrius 
was pronounced dead at the hospital. "I can't express the way it has 
affected me emotionally," said the child's mother. "It's something I'll 
never get over."(3)
<P>
The serious consequences of infection were highlighted in a recent case, 
which is still ongoing. "John Doe" was born in Alaska in 1986. He was 
circumcised at birth and developed complications. The parents assert that 
the non-necessity of circumcision was never explained to them, nor were 
the surgical risks detailed. For "John Doe" the resulting damage from the 
"small risk of infection," as many physicians typically phrase it, has 
become a life-long ordeal, an ordeal brought into his young life by a 
surgery that was not necessary and to which he did not consent.
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court for the State of Alaska, August 
28, 1987, parents claim that circumcision constitutes an assault and 
battery upon their son's body. The baby's wound became infected by 
bacteria while he was in the hospital. He was returned to the hospital 
for treatment of the acute infection, developed toxic shock, which led to 
seizures, and was improperly treated. The baby sustained profound brain 
damage, retardation, palsy, lack of brain growth, damage to his vision 
and other related damages. To add to the horror of the story, the boy was 
born with a condition that requires circumcision not be done. The parents 
say he would not have been circumcised had they been told the surgery is 
not necessary, causes pain, and has risks.(5)
<P>
The hospital where this tragedy occurred claims to have "lost" the 
medical records for the child. The suit in Superior Court was 
subsequently lost and no damages were awarded to the family. In a 
follow-up letter to NOCIRC dated June 25, 1989, one of the parents of 
"John Doe" wrote: 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
  It's so hard for me to put my thoughts down, just tell your readers the
  truth. Our son will grow up to be a man in a wheelchair, he is blind,
  he may never speak, he may never say "Mommy, Daddy," or "I Love you."(6)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
"John Doe" is now eight years old. Oral arguments were heard in January 
of 1994 in the Supreme Court of Alaska to appeal the earlier Superior 
Court ruling. A decision is expected within a year.
<P>
In 1993, just prior to Demetrius Manker's death of circumcision-related 
hemorrhage, another unidentified boy from California suffered 
circumcision complications. Little is known about this case because 
neonatal circumcision complications are rarely covered by the media and 
are most likely settled out of court in favor of the child and his 
parents. What is known is that in May of 1993 a newborn lost the tip of 
his penis while being circumcised at Marin General Hospital, north of San 
Francisco, and that the child was rushed to the University of 
California/San Francisco Medical Center for reattachment surgery. 
According to a July 8, 1993 article in the "Bay Area Reporter" by David 
O'Connor, "Hospital spokesperson Nancy Nickel said there was a 
circumcision complication and it is under review but she would not 
comment further. UCSF Medical Center spokesperson Andy Evangelista said 
he could not confirm whether the infant was treated at the hospital. He 
said it is common for the hospital to perform operations on infants' 
genitalia, including operations to correct botched circumcisions."
<P>
Whether the complication is death from serious hemorrhage, an 
infection-related tragedy, or mutilation to various degrees, all of these 
are long-term effects. For males fortunate enough to survive the surgery 
without immediate complications, there is a growing awareness among men 
of other delayed, long-term consequences of neonatal circumcision, which 
are only now beginning to be documented. In addition to a host of 
psychological effects documented later in this report, preliminary 
findings from the "Awakenings" survey indicate the following physical 
effects:
<P>
- Progressive loss of glans sensitivity (this is the most common 
complaint, whereby some men report stimulation needed to the point of 
pain to achieve orgasm)
<P>
- Sexual dysfunction, including impotence
<P>
- Increased incidence of nonspecific urethritis (NSU)
<P>
- Skin tags (small pieces of remaining prepuce)
<P>
- Skin bridges (shaft skin fused to the corona of the glans during 
healing, creating a "bridge")
<P>
- Prominent scarring
<P>
- Skin tone varience (between shaft skin and remaining dried membrane of 
inner prepuce)
<P>
- Bowing/curvature of the penis (from a tight, uneven circumcision)
<P>
- Painful erection (results from too much skin being removed during 
circumcision)
<P>
- Pubic hair on penile shaft (from a tight circumcision)
<P>
- Bleeding during sex (from being circumcised too tightly that shaft skin 
tears during erection and/or coitus)
