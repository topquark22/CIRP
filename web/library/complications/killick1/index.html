      <p class="text1">Congenital factor XIII deficiency is a
      severe bleeding disorder that is inherited as an autosomal
      recessive trait. The condition is commonly due to absence of
      the factor XIII-A subunit protein in the plasma. The case of
      a baby is reported who showed typical clinical features of
      factor XIII-A deficiency, including recurrent bleeding from
      the umbilical stump and <span class="yellow">a life
      threatening haemorrhage after circumcision</span>. Family
      studies were performed and molecular analysis, using a Short
      Tandem Repeat (STR) marker closely linked to the A subunit
      gene, allowed antenatal exclusion diagnosis to be undertaken
      in a subsequent pregnancy. The case highlights the importance
      of seeking a family history of bleeding disorders before
      surgery in the neonatal period, particularly if the parents
      are consanguineous.</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Congenital factor XIII deficiency is a rare
      inherited bleeding disorder that commonly occurs in
      neonates.1 We report a case of a baby with this disorder who
      developed a large sub-aponeurotic haemorrhage when 2 days
      old, with recurrent bleeding from the umbilical stump <span
      class="yellow">and a life-threatening haemorrhage after a
      circumcision on day 28.</span> After the coagulation defect
      had been diagnosed, genetic studies were undertaken which
      ensured that a successful prenatal diagnosis was performed in
      a subsequent pregnancy.</p>
