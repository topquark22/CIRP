        CIRCUMCISION</b></font>
      </center>

      <p>This patient came to our notice at the Vanderbilt Clinic
      on November 11, 1916, when he was nine weeks old. He had been
      circumcised on the eighth day by a mohel who aspirated the
      wound by means of a glass tube. Within a week the entire
      wound of the circumcision had healed. Five weeks after the
      circumcision had been performed the mother noticed a swelling
      in the right groin and it was for treatment of this swelling
      that the infant was brought to the clinic. The same mohel who
      circumcised the patient had circumcised two other boys in the
      same family; these are respectively seven and five years of
      age and are both well.</p>

      <p>Physical examination of the patient was entirely negative;
      the spleen was not enlarged; the lungs were negative. The
      inguinal glands on the right side was enlarged; the whole
      mass being about the size of the little finger. There was
      also swelling of the left inguinal glands but not to the same
      extent as on the right side. Examination of the penis on
      casual observation, presented nothing abnormal; the
      circumcision wound had completely healed; there was no
      ulceration. On closer inspection we could see four small
      tubercular masses, each one separate and distinct and about
      one-eighth of an inch in diameter, on the anterior surface of
      the circumcision scar; the frenum was entirely free of any
      infiltration. On palpation of these little masses, not unlike
      that of buckshot under the skin, they felt hard and
      indurated. We excised the largest of these masses and
      microscopical examination by Dr. Wilensky showed that the
      tissue was infiltrated with numerous tubercles and diffuse
      tuberculous inflammatory tissue. The von Pirquet reaction of
      the infant was positive. Examination of the mohel showed that
      he was suffering from advanced tuberculosis and his sputum
      was loaded with tubercle bacilli. In the two weeks after we
      had first seen the infant it had gained about one pound in
      weight (10 pounds 11 ounces to 11 pounds, 9 ounces) and never
      had any fever. Excision of the tuberculous tissue of the
      penis and the inguinal glands on both sides was advised and
      will soon be carried out. Tuberculides of the skin were never
      present though they were looked for.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">In the literature there are reported
      forty-two cases of tuberculous infection following ritual
      circumcision; of these twelve recovered and sixteen died, and
      of fourteen the results are not known.</span> The most common
      cause of death in these cases is tuberculous meningitis or
      general miliary tuberculosis; those that die usually do so in
      six to twelve months after infection. The most rapid course
      was observed in a <a
      href="/library/complications/holt1/">case</a> of Holt's, in
      which the child died three and one-half months after
      infection. Those that recover invariably show other
      tuberculous manifestations in later life.</p>

      <p>The course of the disease may be described as follows:
      From fourteen days after circumcision, the wound, which in
      the majority of cases does not heal, ulcerates and begins to
      discharge pus; from two and one-half to eight weeks after the
      circumcision the inguinal glands become enlarged on one side
      usually more than on the other. In the majority of these
      cases the glands suppurate and break down. The majority of
      these infants die in from three and one-half months to three
      years after infection, from tuberculous meningitis or general
      miliary tuberculosis. Those that recover invariably present
      other manifestations of tuberculosis in later life
      (tuberculosis of bones, glands, cold abscesses). The
      treatment of these cases is early excision of the tuberculous
      tissue of the penis and the inguinal glands on both
      sides.</p>
