      <h2>Complications of traditional male circumcision</h2>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>

      <p>The complications of traditional male circumcision were
      studied in 48 boys seen between January 1981 and December
      1995. Their ages ranged from 3 days to 7 years (mean: 4
      years). Haemorrhage, the commonest complication, was seen in
      25 (52%) and infection in ten; one child had amputation of
      the penis. Other complications included meatal stenosis and
      urethro-cutaneous fistula. Sixty-four per cent of those with
      haemorrhage were neonates and their haemoglobin levels ranged
      between 6 and 15 g/dl. Three required blood transfusion,
      seven ligation of bleeding vessels and two required both.
      Overall, 21 patients required surgery and the average
      duration of hospital stay was 2-8 days. Most complications
      were seen between 1991 and 1995 when surgical fees had been
      introduced and the number of boys circumcised in our hospital
      decreased. We advocate the provision of adequate and safe
      facilities to cope with the increasing demand for
      circumcision in our society.</p>
