      <p><b>Aim:</b> Satisfaction after primary circumcision is
      hard to reach. It could be due to incomplete circumcision,
      other medical causes should be considered. <span
      class="yellow">A concealed or buried penis is one of the
      reasons for dissatisfaction.</span> Although circumcision
      could be one of the causes of concealed penis, it isn't the
      main one. It is manly due to: Retraction of the penis by
      excessive penile facia; insufficient attachment of the penile
      at the base of the penis; excessive pre-pubic fat. The
      condition varies in severity and the treatment is always
      surgical.</p>

      <p><b>Materials and methods:</b> The authors report on their
      experience in 28 cases (1998-2001) 15 cases type I,
      congenital which was operated electively with circumcision at
      6 months of age, <span class="yellow">11 type II concealed
      penis due to scarring from previous circumcision.</span> Two
      cases type III (complex cases) involving excessive obesity.
      Age at surgery ranged from 6 months to 12 years. All patients
      underwent complete penile degloving anchoring of the deep
      face of the dermis or the dermis to the proximal part of the
      penile facia at the base of the penis was used in all
      patients.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 4 years.
      Good cosmetic results were achieved with good parents and
      patient satisfaction.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Concealed penis has varied etiology,
      <span class="yellow">circumcision could be the initial cause
      or an aggravating factor</span> and early recognition of this
      problem can avoid the child circumcision causes the risk of
      eliminating the skin necessary for reconstruction.</p>
