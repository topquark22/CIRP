          <b>ABSTRACT</b>
        </center>

        <p><i>A penile or prepuce adhesion can occur after a
        circumcision if the remaining skin is not retracted after
        the circumcision has healed. When a circumcision is done,
        tissue which would normally be intact is split. Unless
        proper care is taken, the epithelium of the inner prepuce
        at the point where the foreskin was removed can reattach to
        the epithelium of the glans. The result of this is a penile
        adhesion. Usually the adhesions can be released by simple
        retraction. Sometimes, however, the fusion is so complete
        that simple retraction will not work, and the child must be
        referred to a urologist. Another problem is that smegma or
        bacteria can collect under the adhesion if it covers the
        preputial cavity and cause infection. Professionals must
        look for this problem, and parents must be taught how to
        care for the normal circumcised penis so that penile
        adhesions do not develop. This article discusses the
        formation and identification of penile adhesions, the
        process by which adhesions can be released, when a referral
        to a urologist is necessary and the proper care for the
        circumcised penis.</i></p>

      <p>The decision of whether or not to circumcise a male infant
      is controversial. The Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics issued a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#1971">statement
      in 1971</a> that there were no valid medical indications for
      circumcision in the neonatal period. The Ad Hoc Task Force on
      Circumcision of the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirmed
      that <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#1975">statement
      in 1975</a>.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> The purpose of this article is
      not to argue for or against circumcision, but to discuss the
      care of the penis after circumcision and a complication which
      can arise -- the penile or prepuce adhesion.</p>

      <center>

      </center>

      <p>When a circumcision is done, regardless of the method
      used, tissue which would normally be intact is split "much
      like skinning a squirrel."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> This tissue develops during
      embryonic life when the epithelial skin of the glans and the
      inner epithelium of the prepuce (foreskin) fuse. By the sixth
      month of gestation, these two stratified squamous layers
      begin to separate from each other by the process of
      keratinization (development of the horny layer) or
      desquamation (scaling).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> This process produces areas of
      separation which eventually all join to form a complete
      separation. (See Figure 1.)<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#3">3</a></sup></font> This separation usually occurs
      later in the child's life. At birth, only four percent of
      newborn males have completed this process and have fully
      retractable foreskins; by 6 months, 20 percent; by 3 years,
      90 percent; and by 17 years, 99 percent.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> A
      circumcision, however, separates this epithelium prematurely,
      and unless proper care is taken, the epithelium of the inner
      prepuce at the point where the foreskin was removed (i.e. the
      top of the shaft) can reattach to the epithelium of the
      glans. The result of this is a penile adhesion. The skin that
      can reattach is confusingly referred to in the medical
      literature as foreskin. In this article it will be referred
      to as the shaft skin. A diagram of a penile adhesion can be
      seen in Figure 2.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="figure2.gif" alt="Figure2" />
      </center>

      <p>Penile adhesions can be found in many forms. Some can be
      attached laterally, medially, circumferentially, as a bridge
      of tissue from the shaft to the glans, or as a combination of
      all of the above. Adhesions can also be found at the
      preputial cavity where the mucosal folds join.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> The preputial
      cavity is the space directly below the corona where the shaft
      meets the glans. (See Figure 2) "When adhesions are present
      proximal to the corona, the preputial cavity may be
      obliterated. This type may be easily overlooked if the
      foreskin is retracted, exposing just the glans and without
      unfolding the entire preputial cavity."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>A penile adhesion can cause problems. The major one is
      that it can completely fuse, causing total reattachment of
      the shaft skin, and require surgical release or
      "recircumcision." Usually the adhesions can be released by
      simple retraction, done either by the practitioner or the
      parents. Sometimes, however, the fusion is so complete that
      simple retraction will not work, and the child must be
      referred to a urologist. Another problem is that smegma or
      bacteria can accumulate under the adhesion if it covers the
      preputial cavity and can cause infection.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font> Also, if a
      bridge-like adhesion is present, it can produce a tethering
      of the erect penis which can cause pain, penile curvature or
      both.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7-8</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>To prevent the occurrence of penile adhesions, nurses and
      parents must be shown the proper technique of caring for the
      penis following a circumcision. Most nursing textbooks
      discuss the procedure and the initial care following a
      circumcision, which involves observation for bleeding and the
      application of Vaseline gauze or a lubricant and sterile
      gauze for 24 to 48 hours but do not discuss later retraction
      of the shaft skin.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9-13</a></sup></font> but usually this is all that
      they are taught. The penis looks different immediately
      following a circumcision than it does a few days later (at
      which time most babies are home from the hospital). With the
      swelling that occurs after a circumcision, the natural
      appearance of the shaft skin cannot be appreciated. The skin
      must heal after the circumcision and should not be retracted
      for approximately 10 to 14 days. However, the mother and the
      father must learn to pull back the shaft skin every day after
      the circumcision is healed so that the corona is free from
      any adherent skin. Another reason to retract the skin is to
      clean around the base of the glans, being certain to remove
      smegma and any other debris. Then the shaft skin should be
      returned to its original position, or a paraphimosis
      (constriction of the penis by the shaft skin) could
      occur.</p>

      <p>The technique of retraction can be taught to the parents
      while they are in the hospital. When the shaft skin is fully
      retracted, the glans should look like the top of a mushroom,
      with the corona and preputial cavity plainly visible.
      Oftentimes the edge of the corona has a purplish hue, and the
      parents can be told to look for this. Even though they cannot
      practice on their own child immediately following a
      circumcision, parents can practice the technique by any means
      the nurse finds helpful. One way might be to use two finger
      cots, one with the bottom removed and placed low on the
      finger, and the other rolled up and placed on the tip of that
      same finger. The lower cot can represent the shaft skin and
      the top can represent the glans and the corona. (To the
      authors knowledge, a practical model is not available.)</p>

      <p>The author conducted an informal survey in her clinical
      practice to discover the incidence of penile adhesions. Of
      the 150 males seen over the past year at their first visit
      (to the author), 23 or 15 percent, of the circumcised males
      had penile adhesions and 5, or three percent, had to have
      surgical correction. Since on statistics could be found in
      the literature on the occurrence of penile adhesions in the
      United States, there is no way to tell how this compares to
      national norms.</p>

      <p>When the mothers (who were the ones bringing the children
      to the clinic) were shown the adhesions, many were unaware
      that the adhesions were present. Many mothers did not know
      that they were supposed to retract the shaft skin. Others did
      not know how far the shaft skin could be retracted, were
      afraid of hurting their child or did not like to touch their
      child's penis. This lack of knowledge on the parents' part
      illustrates the importance of proper teaching by
      professionals to mothers and fathers while in the hospital
      and in the ambulatory setting. Subsequent to the discovering
      of the adhesions, the parents were taught how to release
      them.</p>
      <hr size="2" />
      <b>Releasing an adhesion</b> 
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>When an adhesion is found, it can be released by a process
      similar to smoothing out air bubbles under adhesive paper or
      tape; however with an adhesion, one is pulling in opposite
      directions from a central point. The penis is gently held in
      both hands with one thumb at the point of the adhesion and
      other on the glans just next to it. The index fingers are
      placed under the thumbs and penis, supporting the penis. The
      thumbs are simultaneously brought outward from the adhesion,
      putting slight pressure on the skin. The thumb on the glans
      offers resistance to the pulling of the thumb on the
      adhesion. If the skin is loosely attached, it will separate
      easily. An excellent solution is to have the parents slowly
      release the adhesion by gently retracting the skin daily
      after the bath, when the skin is softened. Parents can be
      shown how to do this in the clinic and then be asked to
      demonstrate it for the nurse. This way it is evident if the
      parent has an aversion to touching the penis and if an honest
      attempt will be made to release the adhesion. One mother did
      successfully release here son's adhesion, but she said that
      she hated doing it. If the parent cannot release the adhesion
      after two to your weeks, then the practitioner should attempt
      to do so. If the practitioner is unsuccessful, the child
      should be referred to a urologist.</p>
      <hr size="2" />
      <b>Summary</b> 
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>A penile adhesion is an unnecessary and preventable
      complication in the circumcised male child. Since
      approximately 1.5 million males are circumcised every year in
      the United States according to the Hospital Record Study of
      the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> the
      possibility for penile adhesions is great. Practitioners,
      nurses and physicians must carefully examine male children
      for this problem and be adamant in teaching parents how to
      prevent or remedy this condition. With proper instruction,
      this problem can easily be prevented.</p>
