        <p class="cirp">[CIRP Update: The incidence of circumcision
        in the United Kingdom has dropped dramatically in the
        decade since the date of publication of this article. The
        most recent reported annual circumcision rate was 12,200
        procedures. See <a
        href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7264/792"
        target="_blank">Towards evidence based circumcision of
        English boys: survey of trends in practice</a> for more
        information.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision is probably one of the oldest
      of all surgical procedures. Although the origin of the
      practice is not entirely clear, it almost certainly began as
      a religious rite. That it was practised by the Egyptians is
      evident as the earliest mummies were found to be circumcised.
      In the Jewish community circumcision remains a religious
      ritual and is usually performed on the child's eighth day of
      life by a <i>Mohel</i>. Religious circumcision is also
      practiced by Muslims; the procedure is performed between the
      ages of 4 and 13 years. Curiously the Koran contains no
      specific ordinance on this subject. Currently approximately
      one-sixth of the world's male population is circumcised
      mostly on religious grounds. In Western society circumcision
      is performed for medical reasons, the commonest of which is
      phimosis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1-3</a></sup></font>. There is however, enormous
      variation between the circumcision rate in the UK (5-6 per
      cent<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1,4</a></sup></font>)
      and that in the USA (80-90 per cent<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5-7</a></sup></font>). This large discrepancy
      exists despite recommendations from both the <a
      href="/library/general/BMJ/">British Medical
      Association</a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8,9</a></sup></font> and the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">American Association
      (sic) of Pediatricians</a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> that circumcision should be
      performed only for medical reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">The aim of circumcision is to excise
      sufficient foreskin (both penile shaft and inner preputial
      epithelium) to leave the glans uncovered. As an alternative
      to circumcision some advocate the technique of 'preputial
      plasty' where a longitudinal incision of the phimosis
      constricting band is followed by a transverse suture<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></font>. Apparently
      more popular in Europe, it is a method that has yet to find
      favour among surgeons in the UK. There are many types of
      circumcision but they can be broadly classified into four
      types: dorsal slit, shield, clamp and excision<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></font>. All of
      these techniques have their strengths and their limitations
      together with their protagonists and critics. More often than
      not, however, complications arise as a result of operator
      inexperience rather than the method employed. All techniques
      aim to provide the best cosmetic result together with the
      lowest possible morbidity rate; in this respect the key
      factors to be observed are attention to asepsis, adequate but
      not excessive excision of the inner and outer preputial
      layers, haemostatis and cosmesis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></font>. Some authors have reported a
      complication rate as low as 0.06 per cent<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></font>, while at
      the other extreme rates of up to 55 per cent<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> have been
      quoted. This reflects the differing and varying diagnostic
      criteria employed; a realistic figure is 2-10 per cent<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3,12,15</a></sup></font>. <span
      class="yellow">Although haemorrhage and sepsis are the main
      causes of morbidity, the variety of complications is
      enormous. The literature abounds with reports of morbidity
      and even death as a result of circumcision.</span></p>

      <h4>Operative complications</h4>

      <p class="text1">Haemorrhage and sepsis are the commonest
      complications and are considered in greater detail below. The
      nature of circumcision dictates that errors of omission and
      commission, i.e. too little or too much, is assessing how
      much foreskin to remove are likely to happen, and one of the
      commonest complaints is of an unsatisfactory cosmetic result.
      If insufficient foreskin is removed the cosmetic appearance
      is such that the penis does not appear to be circumcised;
      phimosis may still subsequently develop. In a series of
      consecutive circumcisions in Australia, Leitch found that in
      9.5 per cent of patients the operation had to be repeated
      because of inadequate skin excision at the initial procedure.
      MacCarthy et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> reported this figure to be 1
      per cent in a study from the UK. In a more recent series from
      Israel, where religious circumcision is widespread, of 60
      children referred following potentially inadequate
      circumcision 42 required recircumcision; the majority of
      these children were operated on before 4 years of age<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></font>. The rest
      were treated conservatively and had a satisfactory cosmetic
      follow-up to 10 years of age. Insufficient excision of the
      foreskin and inner preputial epithelium may result in wound
      contraction and cicatrization of the distal foreskin. The
      fibrotic ring so produced may result in true phimosis, an
      event observed in 2 per cent of cases in one UK series<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></font>. In severe
      cases urinary obstruction may ensue<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Removal of too much skin from the penile
      shaft may be caused by pulling it over the glans during
      operation. After foreskin excision the remaining skin slides
      back, leaving a denuded shaft. Others suggest that such
      penile denudation injuries occur as a result of failure to
      break down the ventral foreskin adhesions to the glans penis
      completely<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12,20</a></sup></font>. It is therefore essential
      that, before any incision is made, the inner preputial
      epithelium be completely free from the glans such that the
      entire coronal sulcus can be visualized. Penile denudation
      injuries may occur as a result of sepsis<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></font>, from
      diathermy injury<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></font> or from injected substances
      mistaken for anaesthetic solutions<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></font>. The majority of cases can
      usually be managed conservatively with a satisfactory
      cosmetic and functional outcome<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21,23-25</a></sup></font>. Such injuries in
      adults may be managed conservatively if the defect is less
      than half of the total penile skin. Complete denudation in
      the adult is managed by split-thickness skin grafting for
      optimum cosmetic and functional results<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21,23,26</a></sup></font>. Of three cases
      encountered by Gee and Ansell<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></font>, one child with complete
      denudation had initial treatment by burial of the penis in a
      tunnel of scrotal skin, no follow-up was available on this
      patient. Use of a pedicled scotal skin flap has recently been
      described for the reconstruction of penile shaft skin<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">A rare consequence of excision of excess
      preputial skin is the so-called 'concealed penis' <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23,25,28,29</a></sup></font>. <a
      href="/library/complications/kaplan/">Kaplan</a> maintains
      that, although an excess of skin is removed, not enough inner
      preputial epithelium is excised. The new preputial orifice is
      therefore, distal to the glans, and as healing and fibrosis
      occur the penile shaft is forced into the suprapubic fat,
      with resulting preputial ring at the level of the skin of the
      mons pubis. Other suggestions about the aetiology of this
      complication include a tendency of the penis to retract into
      the mons pubis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup></font> and the possibility that the
      penile shaft is forced into a subcutaneous position by wound
      con- traction<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font>. Subsequent fibrosis of the
      circumcision wound leads to stenosis of the preputial
      orifice, which then traps the penile shaft
      subcutaneously<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23,29</a></sup></font>. Treatment of this
      condition is surgical correction. In the presence of
      phimosis, Kaplan<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> recommends a circumferential
      incision at the preputial ring to avoid the need for skin
      grafts to achieve coverage of the penile shaft. A vertical
      incision caudal to the circular scar was used by Kon<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup></font> to expose
      the glans and penile shaft which was in a subcutaneous
      position, tightly adherent to the surrounding tissue. Nearly
      complete direct skin coverage was achieved, apart from a
      small ventral defect which was covered by rotation of the
      scrotal skin. A vertical incision was used also by Byars and
      Trier<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></font>,
      and while Shulman et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> did not state the incision
      employed, both required the use of skin grafts for coverage
      of the penile shaft. More recently, Radhakrishnan and
      Reyes<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></font>
      chose to use opposing U shaped incisions and so doing were
      able to obtain skin coverage with vascularized flaps; they
      contend that the functional and cosmetic results are superior
      to those of reconstruction with split-thickness grafts, which
      may result in comparatively inelastic skin on the penile
      shaft.</p>

      <p class="text2">Many other forms of surgical mishap have
      been reported. Laceration to the penile skin and scrotum
      resulting in exposure of both testes as reported by Shulman
      et al.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></font>
      was managed by primary suturing. Laceration of the penile
      shaft with resultant partial amputation has also been
      described<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font>. Total ablation of the penis
      may occur as a result of diathermy injury<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> and loss of
      the penis from the use of a rubber band as a tourniquet has
      been reported<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></font>. injury to the glans may
      result from inadequate separation of preputial adhesions.
      Glandular injury may be of varying severity and cases of
      complete surgical amputation of the glans have occurred<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></font>. <a
      href="/library/complications/mcgowan/">McGowan</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></font> described a
      case in which inadvertent placement of scissors into the
      urethra while attempting a dorsal slit resulted in surgical
      bivalving of the glans.</p>

      <h4>Non-Operative Complications</h4>

      <p class="text1">Ruff et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></font> described a case of
      myocardial injury following immediate postnatal circumcision.
      This was confirmed by a raised lever of type MB creatine
      kinase and by left ventricular posterior wall hypokinesis on
      echocardiography. It was concluded that exposure of the child
      to cold stress as a result of circumcision resulted in a
      persistent fetal circulation and hypothermia. The neonate had
      a satisfactory outcome on medical management. A case of
      recurrent pneumothorax following circumcision was reported by
      Auerbach and Scanlon<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup></font> in a neonate. The
      circumcision was complicated by moderate bleeding and the
      baby's distress was sufficient to produce circumoral cyanosis
      and persistent tachycardia. It was concluded that crying
      induced by many dressing changes need to obtain haemostasis,
      resulted in raised intrapulmonary pressure sufficient to
      rupture a weak spot and cause pneumothorax. Although the
      child was managed successfully, this required a further
      hospital stay of 19 days.</p>

      <h4>Bleeding</h4>

      <p class="text1">Bleeding remains the commonest complication
      encountered during and after circumcision. Because varying
      criteria have been used when recording this complication and
      because of inadequacies in documentation, the reported
      incidence ranges from 0&middot;1 to 35 per cent<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3,12,24,25</a></sup></font>. In
      the majority of cases bleeding is minor and all that is
      required to achieve haemostasis is gentle pressure on the
      area. Excessive bleeding may be due to anomalous vessels<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> or to the
      presence of a bleeding disorder<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></font>. After 13 000 circumcisions
      reported in two large series, no patient required blood
      transfusion for bleeding<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24,25</a></sup></font>. In the event of a
      bleeding disorder, appropriate clotting factors may have to
      be administered<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></font>. The authors are not aware of
      any reported cases of exsanguination following
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In some instances the application of
      pressure alone is insufficient to control local haemorrhage
      and other methods of haemostasis must be employed. In the UK
      the commonest aid to haemostasis is the eletrosurgical
      diathermy for coagulating vessels. While in the majority of
      cases the judicious use of this device is safe and effective,
      the potential for damage exists if it is deployed over
      zealously. When used in monopolar form, an electrical current
      flows from the indifferent electrode (plate) to the active
      electrode (forceps) and the tissue surrounding the forceps is
      heated, resulting in coagulation. However, this coagulation
      process may spread proximally in small vessels (a phenomenon
      commonly observed in everyday practice) and the extent of
      vessel coagulation may be far greater than anticipated or
      intended. It is predominantly for this reason that the
      present authors uso only bipolar diathermy during
      circumcision. Although there are probably many undocumented
      cases of minor diathermy burns and sloughing of the affected
      penile skin, more severe injuries such as glans and major
      penile skin necrosis have been reported<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22,27</a></sup></font>. At its most severe, the
      use of diathermy may result in total ablation of the penis.
      Gearhart and Rock<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> described four such cases in
      which damage was so severe that plastic surgical
      reconstruction was deemed impossible. In all cases the
      children were managed by gender reassignment and feminizing
      genitoplasty.</p>

      <p class="text2">If simple application of pressure is
      unsuccessful, a type of circumferential bandage may be used
      to aid haemostasis. This appears to be popular among the
      practitioners of religious circumcision in Jewish
      communities. It may cause a degree of urethral obstruction
      which in severe cases, leads to urinary retention<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup></font> and may
      dispose thus dispose to urinary tract infection<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup></font>. Horowitz et
      al<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup></font>
      described such an event in which an 18-day-old infant
      presented shocked, dehydrated and with a hugely distended
      abdomen 2 days after circumcision. The tip of the penis,
      which was still covered by a circular bandage appeared red
      and necrotic. After the bandage was removed the child voided
      a large volume of urine and the abdominal distension
      disappeared. The cause of systemic upset was an Escherichia
      coli urinary tract infection and subsequent septicaemia.
      Frand et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup></font> described an infant about who
      the parents were concerned because of a bluish discoloration
      of the legs 1 day after circumcision; a circular bandage was
      seen around the penis. After this was removed a large volume
      of urine was voided and the lower-limb cyanosis rapidly
      disappeared. It is presumed the extended bladder compressed
      the iliac veins and so impeded venous return from the legs.
      Acute urinary retention may be caused by the devices used for
      circumcision; in one case where the Plastibell device (Abbott
      Laboratories, Queensborough, UK) was employed, rupture of the
      bladder was a consequence of acute urinary retention<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup></font>. As well as
      compressing he urethra the blood flow to the distal penis and
      glans may also be compromised by the tourniquet action of a
      circumferential dressing, which in severe cases may result in
      necrosis of the distal penis and glans<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Pharmacological agents may also be used to
      stop minor troublesome bleeding and in this respect the
      application of a 1:100 000 adrenaline solution is not
      uncommon. Although there is a slight danger from systemic
      absorption, at this low concentration complications are
      unlikely. If a more concentrated solution is used, however,
      there is greater systemic absorption with its attendant
      problems. Mor et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup></font> described four such cases in
      which a sponge-soaked solution of 1:1000 adrenaline was
      sprayed on the the bleeding area of the frenulum after
      circumcision. The patient developed tachycardia, acrocyanosis
      and local pallor of the penis. After subcutaneous injection
      of phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist) at
      the base, shaft and corona of the penis, all penile pallor
      disappeared and the systemic signs abated.</p>

      <p class="text2">As an alternative to diathermy, obvious
      bleeding vessels may be ligated with a fine suture. One of
      the commonest sites for persistent bleeding is at the
      frenulum, and in this area it is not uncommon to insert a
      haemostatic suture. However, because of the close proximity
      of the underlying urethra, it is easy for such a haemostatic
      stitch to be placed in the urethra itself. The result is
      development of a urinary fistula<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n44">44,45</a></sup></font>. Avoidance of this
      complication depends on meticulous technique when suturing
      around the frenulum and in taking superficial tissue only in
      the stitch.</p>

      <h4>Sepsis</h4>

      <p class="text1">Infection occurs after circumcision in up to
      10 per cent of patients<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3,15</a></sup></font>. In the majority of cases
      this is usually mild and manifested by local inflammatory
      changes, but occasionally there is ulceration and
      suppuration. Most infections are of little consequence and
      settle with local treatment, Occasionally, however, sepsis
      may have a more alarming consequences and may even cause
      death<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n46">46-48</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The perineal skin is heavily colonized by
      both normal skin saprophytes and by bowel flora, and it is
      surprising that significant septic complications do not occur
      more frequently. Woodside<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n49">49,50</a></sup></font> reported a case of
      necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum after Plastibell
      circumcision of a neonate. The child was sepicaemic and there
      was also bacterial contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid.
      Extensive surgical debridement of the perineum with multiple
      fasciotomy was necessary and parenteral antibiotics were
      administered. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis,
      diphtheroids, alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and Clostridium
      perfringens were cultured from the excised perineal and
      penile skin. The child survived and had a satisfactory
      cosmetic and functional result some years later.</p>

      <p class="text2">Gangrene of the penis has also been reported
      following circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup></font> and the scope of microbial
      contamination of the perineal skin can be further appreciated
      from the report of Sussman et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup></font> of two cases of Fournier's
      syndrome of the perineum and scrotum following the operation.
      Both patients survived after adequate antibiotic management,
      although extensive surgical debridement was necessary in one
      child. Annunziato and Goldblum<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font> presented three cases of
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome all of which occurred
      after circumcision and similarly cases of impetigo have been
      documented<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup></font>. In 1935, Gosden<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></font> reported a
      series of 23 boys from Cyprus circumcised by an unqualified
      practitioner in 13 of whom tetanus developed; five died.
      Diphtheria may develop in a circumcision wound<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup></font> and
      infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been
      documented<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font>. The circumcision site has
      been observed to be the portal of entry in many other cases
      of sepsis, and Cleary and Kohl<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup></font> reported a fatal case of
      septicaemia with group B beta-haemolytic streptococcus in a
      6-week-old child. Kirkpatrick and Eitzman<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup></font> highlighted
      the significance and occurrence of septicaemia following the
      circumcision with the Plastibell device. Metastatic infection
      from the circumcision site has been reported as a cause of
      neonatal meningitis in five children<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n58">58,59</a></sup></font>, three of whom were
      treated successfully with no long-term sequallae. However,
      one child subsequently developed cerebral palsy and one died.
      Osteomyelitis of the femur<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> and a fatal case of
      staphylococcal bronchopneumonia<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n60">60</a></sup></font> have also been reported
      following circumcision. Recently, Crowley and Kesner<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></font> reported a 9
      per cent mortality rate in a series of 45 consecutive
      admissions for septic complications following ritual
      circumcision in young adults. Septic embolization and
      polyarthritis were among the documented complications of
      septic circumcision in this series. Despite its apparently
      low incidence, sepsis following circumcision has the
      potential to cause significant morbidity and in some cases
      death.</p>

      <h4>Fistula</h4>

      <p class="text1">Urethrocutaneous fistula following
      circumcision may occur for a variety of reasons but,
      fortunately the reported incidence of this complication is
      low. Perhaps the commonest cause is a poorly placed suture at
      the frenulum in an attempt to obtain haemostasis<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n44">44,45</a></sup></font>. This
      results in strangulation and necrosis of part of the urethral
      wall, with resultant subglandular fistulation not dissimilar
      to glandular hypospadias. Fistulation may also occur as a
      result of sepsis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></font> or unrecognized rare penile
      anomaly, such as megalourethra<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup></font>. However, many other fistulas
      arise from using the Plastibell device or Gomco clamp<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12,44</a></sup></font>. Although
      the mechanism of injury is not clear it is probable that
      urethral injury results from crushing by the device. Most of
      these fistulas open on to the dorsum of the penis but they
      may open to the ventral surface), an anatomical arrangement
      not dissimilar to that seen in epispadias. Such a case was
      reported following surgical bivalving of the glans<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></font>. Although
      there are many approaches to the management of such a
      urethral fistula<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></font>, appraisal of the techniques
      employed is beyond the scope of this review.</p>

      <h4>Meatal stenosis</h4>

      <p class="text1">Meatal stenosis is generally a direct
      consequence of circumcision that is seldom encountered in
      uncircumcised men; meatal calibre is know to be greater in
      uncircumcised individuals. The incidence of meatal ulceration
      following circumcision is from 8 to 20 per cent<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14,46,64</a></sup></font>. The
      aetiology is thought to be irritation of the external
      urethral meatus by ammoniacal substances present in wet
      sodden nappies. Such irritation is unlikely in the presence
      of a normal prepuce, which serves to protect the glans from
      these irritant substances<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></font>. In a prospective study of
      140 consecutive neonatal circumcisions, Mackenzie<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> found a 20
      per cent incidence of meatal ulceration within the first 2-3
      weeks after circumcision. It is thought that meatal
      ulceration after circumcision is the initiating event in a
      vicious cycle of stenosis and ulceration, followed by more
      stenosis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font>. Meatal stenosis following
      circumcision has been advanced as a cause of recurrent
      pyelonephitis and obstructive uropathy, for which meatotomy
      is curative<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64,65</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>Miscellaneous complications</h4>

      <p class="text1">The glandular epithelium may be denuded by a
      less than gentle technique when separating the preputial
      adhesions and this may be exacerbated if the glans is held
      firmly by a gauze swab. The glans may then be more prone to
      local sepsis with the resulting formation of a scab.
      Fortunately, most settle spontaneously with attention to
      hygiene. A skin bridge may develop between the glans and the
      penile shaft. This may tether the erect penis so producing
      pain and deformity. The aetiology of this condition remains
      unknown, although injury to the glans at the time of
      circumcision or incomplete separation of the inner preputial
      skin have been advanced as possible factors<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12,66</a></sup></font>.
      Inclusion cysts following circumcision have been described.
      That reported by Shulman et al.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> was found histologically to
      be an epidermal cyst. It is possible that cysts also arise as
      a result of peroperative implantation of smegma. The use of
      silica talc on surgical gloves has been associated with the
      formation of granulomas and such a lesion was described in a
      circumcision wound 15 years after the original surgical
      procedure<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup></font>. Although penile lymphoedema
      following circumcision has been reported, there is a paucity
      of information regarding the aetiology and management of such
      a problem and accounts in the literature are anecdotal<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12,25</a></sup></font>. The
      degree of penile oedema may be greater with the Plastibell
      device<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></font>.
      Impotence has been observed following circumcision<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></font>. <a
      href="/library/complications/palmer/">Palmer and
      Link</a><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup></font> described two cases both of
      which were associated with injection of 1 per cent lignocaine
      directly into the corpora after application of a rubber band
      at the base of the penis to act as a tourniquet. As 10 - 15
      ml anaesthetic was used this perhaps resulted in a 50 per
      cent mixture of lignocaine and blood in direct contact with
      the vascular endothelium of the penis. It is postulated that
      this high concentration irreversibly damaged the endothelium
      of the corpora cavernosum with resulting impotence. Impotence
      followed partial amputation of the penis at circumcision,
      despite plastic reconstruction, in a case reported by
      Hanash<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup></font>.
      Hypospadias remains a contraindication to circumcision, as
      surgical reconstruction may require the use of all available
      penile skin. However circumcision in unrecognized hypospadias
      was performed in six children in one series and, in the same,
      series, although hypospadias was recognized circumcision was
      performed anyway.</p>

      <h4>Carcinoma</h4>

      <p class="text1">Of 1103 patients with carcinoma of the penis
      reviewed by Wolbarst<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup></font>, none had been circumcised.
      It was therefore concluded that squamous carcinoma of the
      penis only ever occurs in uncircumcised men and that the
      circumcised state is protective against its development.
      However, squamous cell carcinoma of the uncircumcised penis
      has since been reported<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n73">73,74</a></sup></font> and so the original
      contention of a protective effect is not convincing. Indeed,
      when one compares the incidence of carcinoma of the penis in
      the USA (0-2&middot;1 per 100 000) where most of the men have
      been circumcised at birth, with that in Denmark (1&middot;1
      per 100 000) and Japan (0&middot;3 per 100 000), where
      circumcision is rarely performed, the original contention
      seems doubtful<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5,75</a></sup></font>. It is likely that several
      factors other than circumcision are implicated in the genesis
      of carcinoma of the penis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Carcinoma of the penis following
      circumcision appears to have a different natural history from
      cancer in uncircumcised men. Whereas penile cancer in the
      uncircumcised tends to arise on the glans or prepuce, after
      circumcision the tumour is likely to develop in the surgical
      scar. Such tumours occur mostly on the penile shaft and tend
      to spread locally with distant metastasis as an infrequent or
      late occurrence<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></font>. Surgical excision is the
      treatment of choice, as neither radiotherapy nor chemotherapy
      appears to be effective<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></font>. Nearly all of these cases
      have been reported from Saudi Arabia, where there existed a
      radical form of circumcision that was practised by the tribes
      in the southern regions. The circumcision included excision
      of the skin in the suprapubic region with a longitudinal
      incision extending between the anterior iliac spines<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup></font>. This
      practice is now prohibited.</p>

      <h4><a id="psych" name="psych"></a>Psychological
      considerations</h4>

      <p class="text1">According to Freudian theory, by the fourth
      or fifth year of like the genital concentration of all sexual
      excitement is achieved and the boy's interest in the genitals
      attains a dominant significance, the phallic stage. <a
      href="/library/psych/freud/">Anna Freud</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup></font> wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`any surgical interference with the
          child's body may serve as a focal point for the
          activation, reactivation, grouping, and rationalisation
          of ideas of being attacked, overwhelmed and (or)
          castrated.'</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">For a child at the phallic stage this fear
      that something might happen to his prized organ is called
      'castration anxiety'. According to the psychological
      literature. operations performed on the penis, such as
      circumcision, may arouse such castration fears. In a study on
      circumcision, and the problems of bisexuality, Nunberg<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup></font> highlighted
      the point that injury to the penis may intimidate the child
      and impair his development to full virility. However in the
      same paper he also proposed that circumcision may stimulate
      the masculine striving of the child by encouraging
      identification with the father. After a detailed study of 12
      boys aged 4-7 years undergoing circumcision in Turkey, <a
      href="/library/psych/cansever/">Cansever</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup></font> found that
      following surgery there was a significant fall in
      intelligence quotient and that body image showed a tendency
      to contract. She concluded that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`circumcision is perceived by the child
          as an aggressive attack upon his body, which, damaged,
          mutilated, and in some cases destroyed him. The feeling
          of "I am now castrated" seems to prevail in the psychic
          world of the child. As a result he feels inadequate,
          helpless and functions less efficiently.'</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Such psychological sequalae are not confined
      to the young child. Circumcision performed in the neonatal
      period is associated with marked behavioural changes<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n82">82,83</a></sup></font> that may
      last up to 24 h; supporting this observation is the finding
      of a rise in both serum cortisol and cortisone levels after
      neonatal circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n84">84</a></sup></font>. Circumcision in the neonate
      has been noted to increase both respiration and heart rate.
      and is associated with a significant fall in transcutaneous
      oxygen tension<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n85">85</a></sup></font>. Allied to this is as change
      in sleep pattern with prolonged non-rapid eye movement sleep.
      This change has been interpreted as 'being consistent with a
      theory of conservation - withdrawal to stressful
      stimulation'<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n86">86</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision can cause dysmorphophobia, and
      <a href="/library/psych/walter/">Walter and Streimer</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup></font> reported a
      case of genital self-mutilation in a non-psychotic patient
      who attempted to reconstruct the foreskin himself. Two groups
      of men seeking restoration of the foreskin have been
      identified. First is a group of Jewish men who sought to
      disguise their religious identity during times of political
      crisis<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup></font>.
      Second is a group of homosexuals whose circumcised status is
      associated with unwanted masculinity and anger over having no
      choice over their circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n89">89</a></sup></font>. Genital mutilation by
      attempted circumcision has been reported after paternal death
      in two patients, both of whom exhibited features of acute
      psychosis<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n90">90</a></sup></font>. Schizophrenia following
      elective circumcision has also been reported.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n91">91</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In societies in which circumcision is
      intricately linked to tradition and culture, the
      uncircumcised individual is likely to be an outcast. This
      prejudice may be great enough for uncircumcised men not only
      to be ostracized by their peers but even to be attacked and
      beaten for their lack of conformity. Such beatings in men
      refusing to be circumcised have occurred in the Xhosa tribe
      of South Africa and, in one instance, the attack was violent
      enough to result in the development of 'crush syndrome'<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></font>.</p>

      <h4>Sexual Complications</h4>

      <p class="text1"><a
      href="/library/general/morgan/">Morgan</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup></font> asserts
      that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">`penetration in the circumcised man has
          been compared to thrusting the foot into a sock held open
          at the top while, on the other hand, in the intact
          counterpart it has been likened to slipping the foot into
          a sock that has been previously rolled up'.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">He also suggests that 'coitus without a
      foreskin is comparable to viewing a Renoir while colour
      blind'<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n93">93</a></sup></font>.
      While it is impossible to reach an objective conclusion in
      his matter, some have risen to the challenge and have
      attempted to answer the question. Although <a
      href="/library/general/harnes/">Harnes</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup></font> concluded
      the question remains unanswered at the end of his study, the
      description of his methodology and findings make for
      compulsive reading.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Many medical practitioners regard
      circumcision as a relatively minor procedure and, as such, it
      is likely to be delegated to a junior surgeon. It has been
      observed that the complication rate is directly related to
      operator inexperience<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font>. Delegation to a junior
      colleague should occur only after the surgeon in training is
      fully instructed in the operative procedure. Heightened
      awareness of the scope and potential for complications will
      of itself result in a reduced complication rate.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the warnings of the British Medical
      Association that circumcision should be performed only for
      medical reasons, controversy still exists over whether too
      many procedures are being carried out. <span
      class="yellow">It is hoped that greater awareness of the
      incidence and scope of associated complications will
      encourage a more carefully considered decision on whether or
      not to circumcise.</span></p>
