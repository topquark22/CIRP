      <p class="abs"><b>Two premature infants developed septicemia
      after an elective circumcision employing a plastic bell
      apparatus. The causative organisms were <i>Proteus</i> and
      <i>Staphlococcus Aureus</i>, respectively. Both patients
      responded to proper systemic antibiotic therapy. Physicians
      are cautioned against circumcising newborn infants who are
      ill or otherwise at risk.</b></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">C</span>OMPLICATIONS of
      elective circumcision, one of the most commonly performed
      procedures in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> have been reviewed
      extensively.<sup><a href="#n3">3,4</a></sup> The purpose of
      this report is to alert physicians to the possibility of
      systemic infection after circumcision in ill or premature
      infants.</p>

      <p class="text2">We previously encountered two instances in
      premature infants who were circumcised with the disposable
      plastic apparatus currently in use in many hospitals. For
      those unfamiliar with it, the device consists of a plastic
      cone or bell which is fitted over the glans. The foreskin is
      stretched over the bell and a ligature is applied just above
      the bell. The distal foreskin is then excised, and the cone
      removed. A plastic ring on the base of the bell is left <i>in
      situ</i> to fall off in five to seven days.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,5</a></sup> Complications with this device have
      included retention of the plastic ring, causing various
      degrees of indentation to the penile shaft;<sup><a
      href="#n6">6&ndash;9</a></sup> localized infections;
      edema;<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> necrosis of the distal
      penis; and the production of a condition known as
      &ldquo;concealed penis.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="section">Report of Cases</span><br />
       Our two cases were encountered within 11 months of each
      other. Both infants were low birth weight. Each was
      circumcised electively in the hospital of birth, using
      standard surgical technique. Patient 2 was circumcised
      immediately after delivery while having some respiratory
      difficulty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cases">
      <p class="case"><i>Case 1.</i> This 2.0 kg boy was born by
      normal vaginal delivery on January 23, 1972 to a 17-year-old
      gravida 2 mother. Membranes were intact until 1&frac12; hours
      prior to delivery and were ruptured artificially. The Apgar
      score was 10 at one minute. At age two days, he was
      circumcised, using a disposable plastic circumcision kit. The
      procedure was without incident and the infant received
      routine nursery care. Jaundice was noted the following day
      (total bilirubin 12.4 mg/100 ml); he ate poorly and was
      hypothermic. Petechiae and hypotonia appeared A blood smear
      showedh adequate platelets, and lumbar puncture yielded
      normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The circumcision site had
      frank pus around the plastic ring; necrotic tissue was
      present in this area with induration of the glans and
      ulceration at the meatus. Cultures of CSF, blood, the wound,
      and of a voided urine were obtained. The area was
      debrided.</p>

      <p class="case">Because sepsis was suspected, antibiotic
      therapy was begun. Eight hours later, the platelet count was
      11,000, but vital signs were stable and infant appeared more
      alert. Both the urine and the circumcision site grew out
      Proteus organisms (greater than 100,000 organisms per ml in
      the urine and a 4 plus or &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; growth from the
      circumcision site). Sensitivity studies were identical from
      the other two sites. The other cultures failed to grow
      organisms. The infant improved after treatment, and he was
      discharged two weeks later. An excretory urogram at the time
      was normal, and urine cultures failed to grow any organisms.
      The circumcision site had healed well.</p>

      <p class="case"><i>Case 2.</i> This 1.9 kg infant was born
      December 1, 1972 at a nearby community hospital after 34
      weeks&rsquo; gestation to a 24-year-old primaparous mother.
      She had an uneventful pregnancy, labor, and delivery. The
      Apgar score was reported to be 10 at one minute. Immediately
      following birth, circumcision was performed using the
      disposable plastic apparatus. Grunting respirations with
      intercostal retractions were noted soon after delivery. At 19
      hours of age, because of no improvement in his respiratory
      condition, he was transferred to the University of Florida
      Shands Teaching Hospital.</p>

      <p class="case">At admission, the patient was an alert
      premature in mild respiratory distress. Systolic blood
      pressure with a Doppler device was 68 mm Hg; the respiratory
      rate was 70 breaths/minute, and the pulse 160 beats/minute.
      The circumcision site was slightly indurated and the plastic
      ring with ligature was in place. Within 12 hours, the
      patient&rsquo;s respiratory status had become stable and the
      respiratory rate was 45 breaths/minute.</p>

      <p class="case">The next day the infant was pale, jaundiced,
      lethargic, and breathing rapidly again. Cultures from the
      blood and urine from a suprapubic tap were obtained.
      Antibiotics (ampicillin and kanamycin) were begun because of
      suspected sepsis. Suppuration was noted at the base of the
      glans adjacent to the plastic ring; the area was surgically
      debrided. In the blood smear there were numerous fragmented
      and irregular erythrocytes. Gross hematuria was present. The
      prothrombin time was more than 90 seconds (control 12.4
      sec.); the partial thromboplastin time was more than 90
      seconds (control 30 sec.); and the thrombin time was longer
      than 60 seconds (control 12.4 sec.) Lumbar puncture yielded
      CSF containing 110 mm<sup>3</sup> ethrocytes and 81
      mm<sup>3</sup> leukocytes, 64 per cent of which were
      monocytes and 36 per cent polymorphonuclear cells. The
      glucose and protein of the CSF were normal. The hematcrit
      fell from 55 to 43 per cent, and systolic blood pressure by
      Doppler was now 40 mm HG.</p>

      <p class="case">On the fourth day, the patient was given
      fresh whole heparinized blood and parenteral fluids, adjusted
      to increase his urinary output. Blood cultures and the urine
      culture were now reported to be positive for Staphylococcus
      aureus, coagulase positive. The antibiotics were changed to
      methicicillin and gentamycin. His condition remained critical
      until age two weeks, when urinary output increased and the
      vital signs became more stable. Bilateral pneumonia and
      congestive heart failure which were major problems during the
      recover period responded to medical management.. An excretory
      urogram prior to discharge was normal and cultures of urine
      were sterile. The circumcision site was now well healed.</p>

      <p><span class="section">Comment</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Both of these small
      immature infants had life-threatening infections from which
      they almost died.</span> It appears that the sites of
      infection were the open wounds of the circumcision. In
      Patient 1, this led either to an ascending urinary tract
      infection by Proteus, or directly to bacteremia. In Patient
      2, who was at risk also, because of mild repiratory distress,
      Staphylococci were recovered from the urine and blood; the
      infection may have been ascending in nature or led directly
      to bacteremia.</p>

      <p class="text2">These cases emphasize the basic rule that no
      procedure, however, minor, should be considered free from
      danger. Though it is not clear that the circumcision device
      used without two cases is particularly prone to induce
      infectious complications, it is our feeling that early
      circumcision, regardless of the methods employed is
      contraindicated in a baby who is ill or otherwise at
      risk.</p>
