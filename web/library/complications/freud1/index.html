      <p class="title">THE ULCERATED URETHRAL MEATUS IN MALE
      CHILDREN</p>

      <p class="author">P<span class="sc1">AUL</span> F<span
      class="sc1">REUD</span>, M.D.<br />
       N<span class="sc1">EW</span> Y<span class="sc1">ORK</span>,
      N. Y.</p>

      <p class="text1">SUPERFICIAL ulceration of the urethral
      meatus is a definite entity occurring in male infants and
      young boys, which is spite of its frequent incidence, is but
      little known. <span class="yellow">It occurs chiefly in
      circumcised children but may be found in the noncircumcised
      as well if the prepuce leaves the tip of the glans free to
      irritation.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">This peculiar lesion consists of a
      superficial ulcer affecting the periphery of the meatus and
      cracking its labia to a width up to 3mm. and its depth to
      about the same extent. The ulcer always remains superficial
      and localized and never involves the deeper parts of the
      urethra. Urethral discharge never occurs and there is no
      fever. The inguinal lymph nodes are sometimes swollen and
      tender. Crusts may form rapidly on the surface of the ulcer
      and may partially or completely obstruct the meatus. This
      leads to difficulty in voiding and therefore is followed by
      urinary retention.</p>

      <p class="text2">In many of these cases the children are
      unable to urinate before the obstructing crust has been
      removed either by pressure of overflowing urine or
      mechanically by parent, nurse, or physician. Voiding may be
      deferred for ten to twelve hours.</p>

      <p class="text2">If the orifice is obstructed by scabs, the
      bladder will be only incompletely emptied by a divided stream
      or dribbling. When the crusts come off, the first drop of
      urine that touches the surface of the ulcer irritates and
      causes intense pain. The children, therefore refuse to
      urinate until an overflowing bladder forces voiding.
      Following the passage of a few drops of urine, pain
      diminishes and enables the children to urinate. As soon as a
      scab comes off, bleeding occurs from the ulcer and bright
      bloody spots on the diapers or pants are frequently the first
      sign that alarms the parents.</p>

      <p class="text2">Secretion on the surface of the ulcer soon
      starts again after the scabs have come off and new crusts are
      formed, causing the same difficulties and bleeding when they
      are removed. This vicious cycle may repeat itself many times.
      Eventually the ulcer heals spontaneously with resulting small
      constricting scars. After an interval of some time the
      disorder recurs and, if not treated, heals spontaneously, but
      again with the formation of scars and an increase of the
      superficial stricture. Any stricture of the urethra located
      in the orifice or at higher parts will eventually lead to
      retrograde pressure and distension with all its
      after-consequences of infection and pressure damage.</p>

      <p class="text2">The disorder was first seen by J. von Bokay,
      Sr.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> in 1878 in twenty-three
      boys that were all Jewish and all circumcised. He called the
      lesion &lsquo;&lsquo;urethritis orificii
      externi.&rsquo;&rsquo; He believed that the condition was due
      to poor hygiene but expressed the opinion that it may also be
      due to certain irritating qualities of the urine. F.R.
      Sturgis<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> gave the first
      description of the entity in American literature in 1890. H.
      Goldenberg,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> in 1910, presented
      one case describing the lesion in detail, but without
      consideration of etiology and treatment. T. S.
      Southworth<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> believes trauma and
      ammoniacal urine to be etiologic factors. J. Zahorsky,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> in a paper on diaper rash, mentions
      the disorder and believes the skin condition to be the
      essential etiologic factor. J. V. Cooke <sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a> <a href="#n16">16</a></sup> describes the
      condition in an article on ammonia dermatitis, and in his
      chapter on the same subject in Brennemann&rsquo;s <i>Practice
      of Pediatrics</i>. A very thorough paper on the condition was
      published by Brennemann<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> in
      1921. He believed at first that the lesion was due to the
      most accessible and vulnerable parts of the glans rubbing
      against clothing but he could not explain the extension of
      the ulcer into the urethra by trauma alone. Since he observed
      similar lesions appearing simultaneously about the diaper
      region in many of these cases, he agreed with Zahorsky that
      &ldquo;ammonia dermatitis&rdquo; (diaper rash) should be
      considered the etiologic factor. In 1922, J. von Bokay,
      Jr.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> reported a case in which a
      13-year-old noncircumcised boy, and thought that the lesion
      in the boy was brought about by masturbation. He also gave a
      list of 166 cases that were observed during a period of
      thirty-seven years at his hospital. Of these, thirty-eight
      were up to 1 year of age, ninety-four from 1 to 3 years,
      twenty-five from 3 to 7 years, and nine from 7 to 14 years.
      A. L. Wolbarst,<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> in his article
      on stenosed urinary meatus an its treatment, saw the disorder
      occur when infections and inflammatory swelling further
      diminished an already tight meatus. He recommends meatotomy
      and stresses that even this operation has to be followed by
      dilatations for several weeks to prevent the possibility of
      recontraction. In 1932 M. F. Campbell<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> published a case of congenital
      atresia of the meatus in a 7-year-old boy with pyuria and
      hematuria, and presented the x-ray pictures showing marked
      dilatation of the urethra and a hypertrophic bladder. The
      same author,<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> in his book on
      pediatric urology in 1937, and in his chapter on the male
      reproductive system in Brennemann&rsquo;s <i>Practice of
      Pediatrics</i> states that he never observed a case where
      diaper rash alone was responsible for the condition but that
      only boys with a congenitally tight meatus developed the
      lesion. An article on coarctation of the meatus was published
      by B. S. Abeshouse and D. E. Bogorad<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> in 1938. <span class="yellow">These
      authors presented thirteen cases of patients from 7 months to
      7 years of age, twelve of them circumcised and mostly Jewish;
      one with a long pendulous foreskin leaving the tip of the
      glans free to irritation.</span> They consider the ammonical
      urine, discussing metabolic disturbances as its reason and
      gastrointestinal upsets as possible etiologic agenst and are
      not in accord with Campbell&rsquo;s contention that a
      congenitally small meatus is the chief disposing factor. W.
      Hofmann,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> in 1940, described a
      case of ulcerated meatus in a circumcised infant. In this
      case, however, the stenosis was not congenital but due to
      post-operative adhesions following the circumcision. In his
      paper on stenosis of the external urethral meatus, M. F.
      Campbell<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> states, in 1943,
      that 98 percent of the stenosed cases are congenital. As a
      complication of this stenosis, ulceration occurs when and if
      inflammatory swelling narrows the stenosed orifice still
      more. After a description of the clinical criteria, he
      stresses the fact that, in spite of the generally accepted
      opinion, this disorder should not be considered as benign
      since urinary back pressure damages the proximal urinary
      tract and particularly the kidney. In sixty-three out of his
      152 patients that ranged in age from 7 weeks to 16 years,
      urographic findings were abnormal. He recommends liberal
      meatotomy followed by &lsquo;&lsquo;periodic progressive
      dilatation&rsquo;&rsquo; of the stenosed meatus and treats
      coexisting infections with urinary antiseptics.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is astonishing how few articles on this
      frequent and important disorder have been written and how
      little the condition is known. Apart from the discussion in
      Brennemann&rsquo;s <i>Pediatrics</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> the subject is hardly mentioned in
      pediatric textbooks. J. P. C. Griffith and A. G.
      Mitchell<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> speak about an
      inflammation of the external orifice probably due to
      ammonical urine. C. Noeggerat and A. Eckstein,<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> in Pfaundler and Schlossmann&rsquo;s
      Handbuch Der Kinderheilkunde, give a short description of the
      disorder.</p>

      <p class="section">CASE REPORTS</p>

      <p class="text2">Twenty-two of the twenty-five cases listed
      in the table were observed in the pediatric clinics of the
      Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals and the Metropolitan
      Hospital in New York, at regular intervals for a period of at
      least one and a half years. The infants were of Jewish,
      Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican, and Negro extraction. Three of
      them were breast fed (Cases 3, 10, and 18). Since relapses of
      the condition may occur after 5 to 8 months of symptom-free
      intervals, it is only possible to regard a patient as cured
      after a long period of observation. Therefore, sixteen more
      patients, ranging in age from 5&frac12; months to 7 years,
      with ulcerated meatus, seen at these clinics, are not listed
      in this table because the mothers failed to bring them back
      for regular check-ups.</p>

      <p class="text2">All of the tabled and thirteen of the
      non-listed cases showed a shortening of the
      anterior-posterior diameter of the urethral orifice to 3 mm.
      or less. In severe cases, only a pin-point opening could be
      seen. Several patients (Cases 15, 16, and 19) were seen first
      only with a congenital shortening of the anterior-posterior
      diameter and no other pathognomic signs, and later on came
      back to the clinic with the typical picture of an ulcerated
      meatus. There was first an erythema involving the tip of the
      glans, then small vesicles appeared at the margin of the
      external meatus. Their rupture left small ulcerations that
      eventually became confluent. They were situate at the
      mucocutaneous border surrounding the meatus for a diameter of
      2 to 4 mm. These ulcerations were covered by a gray scrab
      that was so firmly adherent that its removal caused pain and
      bleeding. Due to these scabs, the adjacent labia of the
      meatus became firmly attached and obstruction was produced.
      Only after a certain time of obstruction the mucous membrane
      of the urethra became inflamed and superficial ulcerations
      occurred that extended to a depth of up to 3 mm.</p>

      <p class="text2">The healing of the ulcers was rather rapid,
      with the formation of scars. These scars, appearing as small
      rhagades at the lateral urethral labia of the meatus, were
      readily seen later on when there was no ulceration or
      inflammation.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the majority of the tabled cases and in
      eleven of the cases not listed, the anterior posterior
      diameter was not shorter than 3 mm. [Cases 1, 2, 2, 5, 6
      (Fig. 5), 7 (Fig. 7), 8 Fig. 6), 9, 10, 12, 13 (Fig 3), 14
      (Fig. 1), 20 (Fig. 2), 21 and 22]. In Cases 4, 15, 16, and
      18, the anterior-posterior diameter of the orifice was so
      short that the babies had to be referred to the Urological
      Clinic, where successful dilatation by bougie was done. In
      Cases 11 (Fig. 4), 17, 19, 23, 24, and 25 (the last three
      observed in 1946), there was only a pinpoint opening. These
      cases had to undergo meatotomy.</p>

      the ulcerated meatus and dermatitis localized to the glans,
      leaving thighs and scrotum entirely free. B, Case 14, showing
      ulceration coarctation.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The lesion occurred
      usually in circumcised boys.</span> In cases 6, 9, 10, and 24
      the glans was left free to irritation by a wide pendulous
      foreskin. Case 9 was a boy with hypospadias and ulcerated
      meatus. This combination has frequently been seen by M. F.
      Campbell.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the majority of the cases, ammonia
      dermatitis was seen as an etiologic skin factor (Cases 1, 4,
      5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 24). Twelve
      of the fifteen cases not listed showed the same condition.
      Faulty diet as a probable cause this dermatitis (too much
      orange juice, too much cream, butter, or milk) was reported
      by the mothers of Cases 1, 8, 15, 21, 23, and 24. Ammonia
      smell and high pH factors of the urine were found in a number
      of these cases of diaper rash.</p>

      <p class="text2">Six patients presented a peculiar
      dermatitis, which affected only the surroundings of the
      meatus and part of the glans. This dermatitis left the skin
      of the scrotum, thighs, and abdomen entirely free. It
      consisted of reddened areas that were slightly raised and
      showed a roughened surface. In none of these cases could
      ammonia smell from the urine ever be detected, nor was the
      urine pH increased. Whether a fungus or allergy was
      responsible for this peculiar dermatitis or whether it was
      due to other unknown factors could not be determined. In
      cases 2, 6, and 11, a typical herpes simplex of the penis was
      found to be the skin factor. Cultures from this orifice
      frequently showed <i>Staphlyococcus albus</i> or
      <i>aureus</i>, but this should not be considered in any way
      conclusive, since it is almost impossible to avoid
      contamination of the cultures in this area. The patients
      ranged in age from 3 months to 7 years. Ulceration, crust
      formation, difficulty and pain in voiding, and bleeding were
      the constant signs and symptoms.</p>

      <p class="section">TREATMENT</p>

      <p class="text2">The acute condition with difficulty and pain
      in voiding is best treated according to Brennemann&rsquo;s
      proposal, by a drop of 2 per cent novacain solution on the
      surface of the ulcers, which immediately relieves pain and
      enables the children to urinate. The mothers are told to
      place the children in a warm bath which stimulates voiding
      and relieves pain by diluting the escaping urine. The
      formation of crusts after the removal of a scab can best be
      prevented by the frequent application of petrolatum or a 5
      per cent boric acid lanolin ointment. This is, however, not
      sufficient in cases where reddening and swelling indicate an
      acute infection. Here, 5 per cent sulfathiazole ointment in
      lanolin base or a 5 per cent penicillin ointment have done
      well.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">The cure of the contributing skin factor
      alone is insufficient as long as the anterior posterior
      diameter is not lengthened to its normal extent, which in
      children is 3 mm. or somewhat more. Wherever this has not
      been attained the condition will recur. In these recurring
      cases, especially if there are any signs of infection of the
      genitourinary tract, urography should be done.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;A, Case 11. A. C., first
      attack, Multiple fissures around orifice. Small ulcer near
      dorsal end of opening. B, second attack, contriction of
      orifice. Blister on right labium (arrow). About two and
      one-half times normal size.</p>

      <p class="text2">The majority the presented cases showed only
      a moderate shortening of this diameter and ammonia
      dermatitis. A method which is effective in these cases is to
      insert, once daily, &lsquo;&lsquo;microcuetips.&rsquo;&rsquo;
      (toothpicks prepared in the manner of ear swabs with cotton
      projecting one-half inch beyond the tip of the tooth-pick.).
      The mothers were told to put the cotton end into the
      prescribed ointment and to insert it into the meatus to a
      depth of about 5 mm. once daily for a period of three months.
      In these cases, this treatment was sufficient to extend the
      anterior-posterior diameter to its normal physiological
      length of about 3mm. or more. In any case of ammonia
      dermatitis it is just as important to cure this condition and
      to prevent its recurrence. The diapers should be treated with
      a non-volatile antiseptic. This will prevent the occurrence
      of ammonia dermatitis. In greater degrees of shortening,
      bougie dilatation was done in the urological clinic and in
      the relatively rare cases where there was only a pinpoint
      opening, meatotomy had to be performed.</p>

      constricted orifice due to many small labial scars. Ulcer on

      and one-half times normal size.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the majority of the cases where a skin
      factor was ammonia dermatitis, the following steps were
      suggested. The diapers were washed in saturated boric acid
      solution instead of soap were not rinsed to obtain the best
      possible change of the pH from alkaline to acid. Wherever the
      mothers could afford it, modern neutral soaps were
      recommended for bathing the children. Otherwise, only boric
      acid solution was used for this purpose. One to two percent
      tar in zinc oxide paste was recommended as a protective film
      for the diaper regions.</p>

      <p class="text2">As diet corrections, fruit juices were
      substituted by 50 mg. of ascorbic acid per day and skimmed
      milk was given. In the cases where the dermatitis described
      above involved only the periphery of the meatus or the glans
      and where the skin of the scrotum and thighs were intact, a
      protecting film with zinc oxide paste containing 3 per cent
      cod liver oil was found most successful. Herpes simplex dried
      up quickly after the application of zinc state powder as

      <p class="section">COMMENT</p>

      <p class="text2">Ulceration and coartation of the urethral
      meatus is frequently observed in clinics and private
      practice. Its etiology, however, is still regarded as
      uncertain, as the following quotations from
      Brennemann&rsquo;s textbook of pediatrics will show.
      Campbell, in his chapter on this subject writes:
      &lsquo;&lsquo;I believe that in most instances the atresia is
      congenital and the important predisposing
      factor.&rsquo;&rsquo; Later on he states:
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Moreover, I have seen cases treated by local
      hygiene and ointments which finally required meatotomy for
      cure.&rsquo;&rsquo; Brennemann, the author of this book, adds
      in parenthesis, &lsquo;&lsquo;It is evident that the
      urologist sees the ulcerated meatus under conditions that
      differ from those of the pediatrician. . . . Ulceration of
      the meatus in circumcised infants of the diaper age is very
      common. It is practically restricted to artificially fed
      infants from 5 to 18 months of age, and it is caused by free
      ammonia on the night diaper. The narrowed meatus is, here,
      clearly a result and not a cause of the ulceration, and in my
      experience has never seemed to need
      meatotomy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">In order to approach this problem, the
      urethral orifices of circumcised babies and young boys
      visiting the clinics was carefully checked and their
      anterior-posterior diameters measured. The first question
      that had to be answered was; What is a congenital small
      meatus? H. Gray,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> in his
      textbook on Anatomy, states that the external urethral
      orifice is a vertical slit bounded on either side by two
      small labia, its length in adults being 6 mm. The definition
      of a stenosis concerning this split-shaped opening is simple
      because it can occur in only one direction and consists of a
      shortening of the anterior-posterior diameter.</p>

      <p class="text2">Careful observation of the presented cases
      shows that a congenital shortening of this diameter can well
      be differentiated for secondary constriction of the orifice,
      which occurs due to inflammatory scarring. The lateral labia
      are completely intact in congenital stenosis, and the
      split-shaped opening is well preserved. In secondary
      stenosis, there are fissures or rhagades, and in many of them
      there is an irregularly deformed orifice.</p>

      <p class="text2">In none of the tabled cases was the lesion
      seen where the anterior-posterior diameter of the urethral
      opening was more than 3 mm. In one of the tabled cases (20)
      and in three of the non-listed children, brothers had been
      seen at the clinic with the same lesion. This family
      occurrence supports the opinion that the congenitally small
      meatus may be a predisposing factor of the disorder. Two
      patients out of the fifteen not listed, one of them 5 months,
      the other 8 months of age, showed a normally sized urethral
      orifice with an anterior-posterior diameter of more than 3mm.
      In these two cases the ulceration was brought about by an
      enormous inflammatory swelling due to ammonia dermatitis
      without predisposing stenosis of the meatus. The other
      patients not listed had diameters measuring up to 3 mm.
      except for two patients with a pin-point opening who had to
      undergo meatotomy. If, in cases of congenital stenosis, the
      diameter is further shortened by swelling caused by
      dermatitis, the disorder is likely to occur. In fifteen of
      the twenty-six tabled cases and in ten of the sixteen not
      listed, the meatus showed only a moderate degree of narrowing
      (1 to 3 mm. anterior-posterio diameter length). This series
      probably contains borderline cases of stenosis not definitely
      proved. However, it seems likely that even moderate stenosis
      constitutes a predisposing factor. Further investigations or
      a larger scale will be necessary to decide whether stenosis
      is an essential cause, or whether inflammation around the
      urethra, as seen in ammonia dermatitis may be the only
      etiologic factor.</p>

      <p class="section">SUMMARY</p>

      <p>1. Supeficial ulceration and coarctation of the urethral
      orifice has bene observed in forty-one cases.<br />
       2. Its etiology has been discussed, and in all cases but
      two, congenital shortening of the anterior-posterior diameter
      of the external meatus has been found.<br />
       3. Contributing skin factors are: (a) most frequently,
      ammonia dermatitis, (b) a dermatitis of unknown origin
      affecting only glans and the periphery of the meatus, (c)
      herpes simplex.<br />
       4. The dangers of obstructive uropathy caused by the
      disorder have been stressed.<br />
       5. Treatment of the disorder has been suggested.</p>

      <p class="cirp">{CIRP Comment: American medical editors for
      decades observed an unwritten rule that prevented printing
      material directly critical of the common practice of male
      circumcision. This 1948 article is an outstanding example of
      that practice. It is clear from the text that the loss of the
      protective foreskin by circumcision is part of the etiology
      of meatal ulcers. The author, it appears, was unable to
      include circumcision in his discussion of the etiology of
      meatal ulcers. <a href="/library/general/gairdner/"
      target="_blank">Gairdner (1949)</a>, publishing in the United
      Kingdom, was under no such contraint and stated the correct
      and obvious conclusion.]</p>
