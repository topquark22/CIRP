      <p>We report a rare complication of ritual circumcision in an
      8-week-old boy. He presented 1 week after the procedure with
      reduced urine output, a grossly distended bladder and marked
      bilateral hydroureteronephrosis on ultrasonography. The acute
      partial urinary obstruction was due to the dressing which was
      applied after surgical removal of the foreskin and to oedema
      of the glans. He had abnormal renal function (creatinine 85
      mumol/l, urea 8.5 mmol/l) and a hyperkalaemic metabolic
      acidosis with hyponatraemia (Na 127 mmol/l, K 6.9 mmol/l,
      HCO3 16 mmol/l), which were attributed to obstructive
      uropathy. Because of prolonged secondary bladder dysfunction
      he required urinary catheterisation for 1 week. There was
      significant post obstructive diuresis and parenteral fluid
      therapy was given for 7 days. <span class="yellow">Whilst
      urinary retention is a well recognized complication of
      circumcision, this is the first report of significant
      obstructive uropathy and renal impairment due to surgical
      excision of the foreskin.</span></p>
