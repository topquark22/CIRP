            <p class="text1"><span class="init">W</span>OUND
            diphtheria is not an uncommon postoperative
            complication. Grossman and Radice,<sup><a
            href="#n5">5</a></sup> taking 700 smears from 400
            wounds, found the diphtheria bacillus twenty times. It
            was most common in wounds with a tendency to poor
            healing. In fact, the diphtheria bacillus was found
            when it was least expected. Fresh wounds apparently
            favor the growth of diphtheria bacilli.</p>

            <p class="text2">Frankenthal<sup><a
            href="#n4">4</a></sup> states that, in the
            investigations of 186 nonsuspicious wounds, diphtheria
            bacilli were found in twenty cases (10.7 per cent).
            These were, however, secondarily infected operative
            wounds. These cases had gray-yellow exudates with very
            poor tendency to healing. In some cases erysipelas
            played an exceedingly important role, since it preceded
            the bacillus infection. Other bacteria, such as
            streptococci, staphylococci, and pyocyaneus, have been
            found in mixed infections.</p>

            <p class="text2">The case of a child, 21 months of age,
            who, after having been vaccinated against smallpox,
            developed wound diphtheria in the thigh, is reported by
            De Haas and Wolff.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The
            diagnosis was confirmed both bacteriologically and by
            animal experiment. Recovery followed the use of
            antitoxin.</p>

            <p class="text2">Linde<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> in
            1934 reported a case of a 74-year-old woman who had
            diphtheritic or diphtheroid infection of the wound
            flowing appendectomy with fatal termination.</p>

            <p class="text2">In 1932 Nigam,<sup><a
            href="#n8">8</a></sup> subsequent to the removal of a
            rib for tuberculous caries, found the diphtheria
            bacillus in the exudates around the sinus. The glands
            in the axilla and groin were enlarged and painful.
            Prompt treatment with antitoxin and antiseptic
            dressings locally brought rapid relief.</p>

            <p class="text2">Wound diphtheria following
            circumcision is reported by Hasbrouck<sup><a
            href="#n6">6</a></sup> in a 3-year-old child. The
            indication for circumcision was a tight prepuce with
            very little opening. Following the circumcision, 2 per
            cent carbolized oil was applied. About forty hours
            later an exudates was observed covering the wound area,
            and erysipelas was spreading rapidly to the abdominal
            wall. Cultures from the throat and wound proved to be
            diphtheria. <span class="yellow">The patient died on
            the eighth day.</span></p>

            <p class="text2">Another case of diphtheria of the
            penis is reported by Bailey.<sup><a
            href="#n1">1</a></sup> In this instance, the patient, a
            barber, aged 26 years, consulted the physician for the
            complaint of a swollen penis. A foul-smelling exudates
            was noted within the sulcus. The culture proved
            positive for Klebs-L&ouml;ffler bacillus. Antitoxin was
            administered, and the patient made an uneventful
            recovery.</p>

            <p class="heading">REPORT OF CASE</p>

            <div class="report">
              <p class="text2">E.P. was born on June 11, 1940. He
              was a first child and delivery was normal. His weight
              was 3,430 Gms. His general condition was good. The
              genitals were normal and the skin was clean.</p>

              <p class="text2">The parents requested circumcision,
              and this was performed on June 19 by the family
              physician who delivered the infant.</p>

              <p class="text2">The following day, June 20, 1940,
              the infant was sent home with the notation on the
              chart that the circumcision was healing and that the
              baby was in good condition.</p>

              <p class="text2">On July 30 the infant was brought to
              my office because there was a tendency to poor
              healing of the circumcised area. Examination was
              negative except for related findings.</p>

              <p class="text2">To the right of the umbilicus, about
              1 cm away, a small area of denuded skin with an
              exudates was noted. At the frenal area of the penis
              was an exudates about 1 cm in diameter and very
              adherent. It was impossible to remove this exudates
              entirely. The skin surrounding the corona and shaft
              was edematous, swollen, and painful. The inguinal
              glands were somewhat enlarged.</p>

              <p class="text2">A small amount of the removed
              exudates was sent to the laboratory for culture. The
              following day the report came back as positive for
              Klebs-L&ouml;ffler bacillus.</p>

              <p class="text2"><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Ten thousand
              unites of diphtheria antitoxin were injected into the
              right gluteal region, and local wet antiseptic
              dressing was applied. On August 3 definite separation
              of the exudates around the edges of the wound was
              noted. The exudates to the right of the umbilicus
              also was separating. By August 8 the wounds were
              clean and practically healed. Recovery was
              complete.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="heading">COMMENT</p>

            <p class="text2">The source of this Klebs-L&ouml;ffler
            infection could not be traced. Examinations of parents
            and aunt of this newborn infant were found to be
            negative. At the hospital, all the nurses have periodic
            throat cultures taken and any nurse who complains of
            any soreness of the pharynx is immediately removed from
            the nursery. The setup for circumcision is ideal, since
            all dressings, instruments are sterilized in a
            container and kept sterile. The physician who performs
            the circumcision is required to prepare as for a major
            operation. <span class="yellow">The belief is that the
            wound became infected at home, perhaps from clothes,
            dressings, or the hands of persons who changed the
            daily dressings.</span></p>

            <p class="heading">SUMMARY</p>

            <p class="text2">A case of wound diphtheria following
            circumcision is reported.</p>

            <p class="text2">The infection occurred in a breast-fed
            baby in the newborn period of life, an unusual time.
            After six weeks of non-healing, complete cure was
            effected by the administration of diphtheria
            antitoxin.</p>
