      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> We review our experience with the
      management of iatrogenic penile injuries. Apart from <span
      class="yellow">circumcision</span>, serious damage to the
      penis can occur following hypospadias repair, surgery for
      priapism or total loss of the penis following surgical repair
      of bladder exstrophy.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> A retrospective analysis of
      patients with iatrogenic penile amputation referred to us
      between 1980 and 2000 was undertaken. Causes of injury and
      choice of management were reviewed.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Of the 13 cases treated during the 20-year
      period <span class="yellow">mechanism of primary injury was
      circumcision in 4</span>, hypospadias repair in 6, priapism
      in 1, bladder exstrophy repair in 1 and penile carcinoma in
      1. A variety of techniques were used for phallic
      reconstruction. Penile degloving, division of suspensory
      ligament and rotational skin flaps achieved penile
      augmentation and enhancement. Reasonable cosmesis and penile
      length were achieved in all cases. In indicated cases
      microsurgical phalloplasty was technically feasible. However
      long-term followup showed various complications including
      erosions from the use of a penile stiffener.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The ultimate goal of reconstructive
      surgery is to have a penis with normal function and
      appearance. The management of penile injury requires a wide
      variety of surgical techniques that are tailored to the
      individual patient. Expedient penile reconstruction is
      successful and therapeutic delay is associated with
      complications.</p>
