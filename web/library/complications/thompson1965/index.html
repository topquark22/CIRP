      <p class="text2">Colonization by <i>S. aureus</i> during the
      hospital stay and staphylococcal disease during the first
      month of life of newborn infants were both shown to be
      related to the sex of the infant, males being at greater
      risk. This excess risk begins at birth and continues
      throughout the neonatal period. Colonization excess in males
      was present in the nose, umbilicus, groin, and rectum. Males
      became positive earlier and in more body sites and with
      greater intensity than females. In roughly equivalent
      positivity classes of infants, males developed disease at a
      greater rate. This excess disease risk was not limited to a
      single or a few phage types but appeared to be present for
      all. The males with disease tended to have more lesions than
      their female counterparts and the anterior abdomen and groin
      were the most frequent sites of the excess lesions. Possible
      explanations for the difference in the two sexes are
      suggested.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: This long and careful report
      investigated the higher incidence of <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i> infection and disease in newborn males as compared
      with females. Much of the information is not relevant to
      circumcision and will not be presented here. In this study,
      which was carried out in five Pittsburgh hospital nurseries
      from 1959 through 1965, 97 percent of the newborn boys were
      circumcised. The small size of the non-circumcised group
      limited the statistical comparison of the circumcised boys
      with the non-circumcised boys. The authors, however, reported
      that the infection rate among the circumcised boys was 26
      percent as compared with 13 percent among the non-circumcised
      intact boys. (p.323)]</p>
