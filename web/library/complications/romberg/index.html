    <h3>CIRCUMCISION: THE PAINFUL DILEMMA, (1985).</h3>

    <div class="corpus">
      <h2>The Complications of Circumcision</h2>

      <p class="cirp">Excerpts from "The Complications of
      Circumcision," Chapter Eleven of Circumcision: The Painful
      Dilemma, by Rosemary Romberg, Bergin &amp; Garvey Publishers,
      1985 (Quoted with permission of the author.)</p>

      <p>"The risks are many and can be devastating."</p>

      <p>1. Meatal Ulceration -- "ammoniacal urine burns on the
      unprotected glans . . . Possibly over half of all circumcised
      infants develop this." (p. 200)</p>

      <p>2. Meatal Stricture -- "results from prolonged or repeated
      episodes of meatal ulceration. The repeatedly irritated
      meatus becomes narrowed. . . . pain and difficulty with
      urination. . . . can result in infections and kidney
      problems." (p. 204)</p>

      <p>3. Hemorrhage -- "excessive bleeding. . . . a fairly
      common complication of circumcision." (p. 206)</p>

      <p>4. Retention of Plastic Bell Ring -- "the ring fails to
      fall off and instead becomes buried under the skin along the
      shaft of the penis [and has to be surgically removed]. . . .
      leaves . . . a permanent ridge or groove along the shaft of
      the penis." (p. 210)</p>

      <p>5. Concealed Penis -- "the penile shaft, following
      circumcision, retreats into the surrounding skin and fatty
      area and cannot be seen." [Must be corrected surgically.] (p.
      211)</p>

      <p>6. Urethral Fistula -- "a hole going from the side of the
      male urethra to the outside of the penis. . . . results
      either from accidental crushing of the urethra by the
      circumcision clamp, an abnormality in the urethra, or from a
      stitch placed in the underside of the penis to control
      excessive bleeding at the site of the frenulum." (p. 214)</p>

      <p>7. Phimosis of Remaining Foreskin -- "occasionally the
      remaining piece of foreskin becomes tightly attached to the
      sides of the glans . . ." (p. 215)</p>

      <p>8. Urinary Retention -- "Occasionally a baby will not
      urinate for several hours following circumcision. Sometimes
      the cause is an overly tight bandage wrapped around the
      wound. In other instances the cause is less clear." (p.
      217)</p>

      <p>9. Glans Necrosis -- "the death of body tissue. . . . has
      happened to the glans following circumcision due to an overly
      tight bandage or a Plasti-bell ring that is too small." (p.
      218)</p>

      <p>10. Injury and Loss of Glans -- "Occasionally the glans
      can be injured or entirely cut off during circumcision. . . .
      Usually a permanent deformity results." (p. 219)</p>

      <p>11. Excessive Skin Loss -- "devastating complications
      result from cutting off too much skin. . . . Excessive skin
      loss can result from the operator severing too much foreskin,
      from infection of the wound resulting in tissue death, or
      from a burn caused by an electrocautery device. Sometimes the
      entire penile shaft becomes denuded and skin grafting is
      necessary. . . . as the individual grows older his penile
      skin becomes too tight, causing discomfort on erection." (p.
      219)</p>

      <p>12. Skin Bridge -- "a complication in healing of the
      [circumcision] wound, by which a piece of skin from the shaft
      of the penis has become attached to the glans, or another
      point along the shaft, forming a 'bridge' that must be
      surgically corrected." (p. 221)</p>

      <p>13. Vomiting, Apneic Spells -- "cessation of breathing,
      usually for a short period of time. . . . can be
      life-threatening." [Baby cries from pain. Mother nurses baby.
      Baby vomits and inhales vomit.] (p. 222)</p>

      <p>14. Sewing of Penile Skin to Glans -- "'Sewing the skin
      edge to the glans, with consequent burying of the corona.'"
      (p. 223)</p>

      <p>15. Laceration of Penile or Scrotal Skin -- "Accidental
      laceration of the penile skin and scrotum following
      circumcision has been seen." (p. 223)</p>

      <p>16. Undetected Hypospadias -- "a congenital deformity in
      which a fistula naturally occurs in the underside of the
      penis. . . . corrected by plastic surgery. The foreskin
      provides an easily available piece of tissue for use in skin
      grafting. . . . If an infant with hypospadias is . . .
      circumcised, this potentially useful piece of skin has been
      destroyed and the operator must resort to more complicated
      types of skin grafts to reconstruct the penis." (p. 223)</p>

      <p>17. Preputial Cysts -- "an abnormal, closed pocket of body
      tissue which contains fluid or solid material. Occasionally
      cysts develop along the remaining edges of foreskin at the
      site where the skin was severed." (p. 223)</p>

      <p>18. Complications of Anesthesia -- "Complications can
      ensue from use of any type of anesthesia for any medical
      procedure, including circumcision." (p. 224)</p>

      <p>19. Tuberculosis and other Diseases from Mezizah --
      "Mezizah [rarely done today] is the third step of the Jewish
      ritual circumcision ceremony, in which the mohel applies his
      mouth to the fresh circumcision wound. Diseases have been
      spread due to this practice." (p. 225)</p>

      <p>20. Strangulation of the Glans by Hair -- "long strands of
      human hair wrapped around the coronal sulcus." (p. 225)</p>

      <p>21. Recurrence of Pneumothorax -- "a collection of air or
      gas in the membranes that surround the lungs or pleural
      cavity. . . . an infant developed a pneumothorax as a result
      of mechanical assistance with breathing for severe
      respiratory distress at birth. . . . [then] the infant was
      circumcised. His excessive crying from the pain of the
      operation caused the pneumothorax to recur . . ." (p.
      225)</p>

      <p>22. Pulmonary Embolism -- "a clot of blood which travels
      through the circulatory system and becomes lodged in one of
      the blood vessels in the lungs. This causes severe breathing
      difficulties and can result in death." (p. 226)</p>

      <p>23. Keloid Formation -- "an abnormal development
      consisting of a raised, firm, thickened, red piece of scar
      tissue. Such a formation at the site of circumcision creates
      a grotesque deformation of the organ, with obstruction of its
      function." (p. 226)</p>

      <p>24. Lymphedema or Elephantiasis of Skin -- "swelling or
      obstruction of the lymph vessels. . . . can result from
      circumcision." (p. 226)</p>

      <p>25. Reaction of Older Sibling -- "'her two-year-old son
      had tried to amputate his [own] penis and was bleeding
      profusely. . . . had witnessed his baby brother's ritual
      circumcision . . .'" (p. 227)</p>

      <p>26. Cosmetic Problems -- "The Gomco clamp and Plasti-bell
      devices . . . if applied crookedly can . . . result in
      cosmetic problems. Older methods such as smashing the skin
      with a hemostat and slicing it off present greater risk that
      an uneven cut will result." (p. 228)</p>

      <p>27. Loss of Penis -- "There have been cases in which the
      penis has been lost due to circumcision. . . . In some cases
      enough penile shaft remained so that after extensive
      operations a functional penis could be reconstructed. In
      other cases the child has been surgically made into a
      'girl.'" (p. 228)</p>

      <p>28. Death [Death as a result of circumcision is discussed
      on pages viii, 68, 198, 207, 208, 209-210, 224 and 299.]</p>
