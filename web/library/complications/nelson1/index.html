      <h2>A prolonged nursery epidemic associated with a newly
      recognized type of group A streptococcus.</h2>

      <p><b>Nelson JD, Dillon HC Jr, Howard JB.</b></p>

      <p>During a six-month period 69 infants in a newborn nursery
      were colonized with group A streptococci. Fifty-one had
      omphalitis, <span class="yellow">two infected circumcision
      wounds</span>, and one each had meningitis, primary
      peritonitis, and conjunctivitis. Thirteen infants were
      asymptomatically colonized. Control of the epidemic was
      difficult. Benzathine penicillin prophylaxis to all infants
      suppressed active infection but did not eradicate
      asymptomatic colonization of the umbilical cord. Triple dye
      treatment of the umbilical cord plus benzathine penicillin
      prophylaxis eradicated the infection from the nursery. The
      epidemic streptococcus was a newly recognized ""skin
      strain,'' provisional type strain 5656-S, not previously
      known to cause epidemic disease or serious systemic
      infections.</p>
