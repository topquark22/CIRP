      <h1>Chilling of Newborn Infants:</h1>

      <h2>Its Relation to Circumcision Immediately Following
      Birth</h2>

      <h3>GEORGE R. SPENCE, MD,<sup>&dagger;</sup> <i>Silver
      Spring, Md</i></h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The author has shown that the delay of holding a newborn
        in the delivery room for circumcision before his removal to
        the nursery results in chilling. He recommends postponement
        of the operation to later in the neonatal period.</p>
