      <p class="title">Necrotizing fasciitis after neonatal
      circumcision</p>

      <p><b>Jeffrey R. Woodside, MD</b></p>

      <p class="abstract">&bull; A 6-day-old infant had extensive
      necrotizing fasciitis involving most of the abdominal wall
      develop <span class="yellow">after circumcision with a
      Plastibell device</span> (Hollister, Inc). He survived this
      life-threatening infection after vigorous cardiovascular
      support, antibiotic therapy, and aggressive surgical
      debridement. The diagnosis, bacteriology, and management of
      necrotizing fasciitis are briefly discussed. The technical
      aspects and complications of Gomco (Gomco Surgical
      Manufacturing Corp) and Plastibell circumcision are compared.
      Strangulation and devitalization of the prepuce is invariably
      associated with Plastibell circumcision, and it may render
      neonates circumcised by this technique more susceptible to
      serious wound infection.<br />

      1980)</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">N</span>eonatal
      circumcision is the most commonly performed surgical
      procedure in the United States today. Although considered a
      minor operation, reported complications include infection,
      hemorrhage, loss of penile skin, laceration of penile or
      scrotal skin, injury to the glans, urethral fistula, urinary
      retention, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, concealed
      penis, and retained Plastibell risgs (Hollister, Inc).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-6</a></sup> The experience with a newborn who
      had extensive necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall
      develop after circumcision is the subject of this report.
      Necrotizing fasciitis has seldom been described in children,
      and to my knowledge, it has been reported only twice in
      neonates.<sup><a href="#n7">7-8</a></sup></p>

      <p align="center"><b>REPORT OF A CASE</b></p>

      <div class="report">
        <p class="text1">A 2.6-kg male infant was born by normal
        vaginal delivery after 39 weeks gestation. He was
        circumcised without incident by the Plastibell technique at
        age 3 days. Two days later, his mother noticed slight
        penile swelling and a small amount of blood and pus on the
        diapers. Later in the day, the penis and scrotum turned
        black-purple in color. The Plastibell was removed at
        another hospital and he was transferred to our
        institution.</p>

        <p class="text2">He was lethargic, and he appeared acutely
        ill. His rectal temperature was 35.3 &deg;C, his heart rate
        was 132 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 40/min,
        and his systolic blood pressure was 40 mm Hg. Petechiae and
        multiple, 5-mm, flat black-purple lesions covered the
        trunk, arms, and legs. The skin of the shaft of the penis
        and part of the scrotum was necrotic. Induration and slight
        erythema of the skin of the abdominal wall extended from
        the inguinal areas to th elevel of the umbilicus. The
        hemoglobin level was 14 g/dL; hematocrit, 42%; platelet
        count, 7,500/cu mm; and WBC count, 26, 700/cu mm; with 38%
        neutrophils, 19% band forms, 39% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes,
        and 2% eosinophils. The prothrombin time was 14 s (control
        11 s); partial thromboplastin time, 40 s; fibrinogen level,
        86 mg/dL. Lumbar puncture yielded normal CSF. Gram&rsquo;s
        stain of the contents from several of the skin lesions
        showed Gram-positive cocci.</p>

        <p class="text2">His condition was treated with parenteral
        fluids, fresh frozen plasma, human antihemophilic factor
        (cryoprecipitate) and platelet concentrates. Parenteral
        nafcillin sodium, penicillin G potassium, chloramphenicol
        sodium succnate, and kanamycin sulfate were given.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>COMMENT</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Necrotizing fasciitis
      is a rapidly spreading bacterial infection producing edema,
      necrosis, and partial liquifaction of the subcutaneous fat,
      superficial fascia, and superficial layer of the deep
      fascia.</span> It most frequently involves the extremities
      and abdominal wall, and it may occur after surgery or after
      relatively minor trauma such as abrasions, cuts or insect
      bites.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Meleny<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> first described 20 patients with
      this entity and cultured a hemolytic streptococcus from each.
      Culture results in more recent reports have demonstrated a
      combination of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic
      bacteria.<sup><a href="#n9">9,11</a></sup> Successful culture
      of these bacteria requires meticulous technique, and failure
      of the organisms to grow is not unusual. <span
      class="yellow">Patients with necrotizing fasciitis commonly
      have sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and
      hypotension, as in this patient.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Consideration of this disease in the
      appropriate clinical setting and a high degree of suspicion
      are required to detect the early skin changes of minimal
      erythema and poorly demarcated induration. Initial treatment
      must consist of cardiovascular stabilization and parenteral
      antibiotics effective against a broad spectrum of aerobic and
      anaerobic organisms. Guliano and associates<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> recommend initial antibiotic
      treatment with penicillin, a penicillinase-resistant
      penicillin, gentamicin or tobramycin, and clindamycin or
      chloramphenicol. The most important aspect of therapy is
      surgical debridement and excision of all involved fascia and
      subcutaneous tissue. The reported mortality for necrotizing
      fasciitis ranges from 13% to 60%, with better survival after
      more radical surgical treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcision is usually performed
      with either the Plastibell device or the Gomco circumcision
      clamp (Gomco Surgical Manufacturing Corp). The Gomco seals
      together the skin and mucosal surfaces of the prepuce by
      briefly applied extrinsic pressure. The Plastibell technique
      crushes the prepuce between a suture and an underlying bell,
      which drops off in five to eight days.</p>

      <p class="text2">Gee and Ansell<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> reviewed the complications of 5,521
      neonatal circumcisions performed during a ten-day period. The
      Gomco and Plastibell techniques were each used in
      approximately one half of the patients. The cumulative
      complication rate was 0.2%, with no significant differences
      between the two techniques for the various compications,
      except for infection. Wound infections occurred in 0.14% of
      the patients circumcised with the Gomco and 0.72% with the
      Plastibell. All infections were initially managed with local
      cleansing, and each infection after the Gomco resolved
      promptly. However, 20% of those infected after Plastibell
      circumcision had fever and irritability, which resolved only
      after antibiotic therapy. The Plastibell technique
      strangulates the prepuce and produces devitalized tissue that
      might be more susceptible to serious infection. The more
      loosely approximated prepuce after the Gomco technique would
      seem to permit ready egress of any purulence from between
      preputial layers. Thus, a wound infection of the circumcision
      site would tend to be locally contained.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that there are no
      valid medical indications for circumcision in the neonatal
      period. Nevertheless, many parents will still desire to have
      their male infants circumcised. Therefore, each physician
      performing circumcisions should be mindful that
      &ldquo;circumcision is a surgical technique that requires
      careful aseptic technique, systematized postoperative
      observation, and evaluation after discharge from the
      hospital.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Serious and
      potentially life-threatening infections after circumcision of
      the newborn occur more frequently after Plastibell
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n12">12,14</a></sup> This
      evidence suggests that Gomco circumcision is the preferred
      technique.</p>
