      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <b>Purpose:</b> <span class="yellow">The 2 types of urethral
      injury that can occur during circumcision are
      urethrocutaneous fistula and urethral distortion secondary to
      partial glans amputation.</span> We report the surgical
      repair of these rare injuries. 

      <p><b>Materials and Methods:</b> In 8 patients
      urethrocutaneous fistulas located on the distal penile shaft
      or at the coronal margin were managed by splitting the glans
      and using a Mathieu style skin flap in 4 or vascularized
      penile skin flap in 4 to bridge the urethral defect. Three
      patients underwent repair of a hypospadiac deviated urethra
      secondary to partial glans amputation by 1 cm. of urethral
      mobilization and repositioning the meatus into a terminal
      position within the remaining glans tissue.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> The 8 patients with urethrocutaneous
      fistulas voided via a terminal meatus without fistula
      recurrence at a mean followup of 3.2 years (range 1 to 6).
      The 3 patients with partial glans amputation and urethral
      deviation repaired by short urethral advancement had
      functionally acceptable results, defined as a normal urinary
      stream, although 1 required meatal dilation
      postoperatively.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> The 2 types of urethral injuries that
      can occur during circumcision are a subcoronal
      urethrocutaneous fistula and scarred abnormal urethra from
      partial glans amputation. The urethrocutaneous fistula can be
      successfully repaired by splitting the glans and forming a
      neourethra from a vascularized pedicle flap of penile skin.
      The abnormal urethra after partial glans amputation is more
      difficult to repair but repositioning the urethra in a more
      cosmetic location has restored function. [References: 12]</p>
