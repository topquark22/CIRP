      <p class="abstract"><i>The hospital environment has been
      shown to play a particularly important role in the incidence
      of neonatal staphylococcal colonization.</i><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> <i>The infant who becomes colonized
      with</i> staphylococci <i>within the immediate newborn period
      is more likely to develop neonatal staphylococcal infection
      than the uncolonized newborn.</i><sup><a
      href="#n2">2-6</a></sup> <i>Consequently, staphylococcal
      colonization surveillance has become a technique used
      increasingly to detect and control staphylococcal
      colonization in the newborn.</i><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="text2">Brown suggested that infants having
      quantitatively higher colony counts on direct agar-skin
      contact plates might be at higher risk of developing
      staphylococcal skin disease.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A prospective birth-cohort study was
      designed to determine the value of semiquantitative
      colonization of <i>S. aureus</i> as a predictor of eventual
      staphylococcal pyoderma. This study also was designed to
      evaluate gender-related differences in staphylococcal
      colonization and subsequent staphylococcal disease in the
      newborn.</p>

      <h4>Materials and Methods</h4>

      <p class="text2">A birth-cohort of newborn infants born at
      Tripler Army Medical Center after Oct. 22. 1979, and
      discharged before April 2, 1980, were included in the study.
      Only those babies who were admitted to the
      &ldquo;well-baby&rdquo; nursery and routinely discharged from
      &ldquo;rooming-in&rdquo; were included.</p>

      <p class="text2">Excluded were all infants who were born
      outside the hospital and later admitted to the
      &ldquo;well-baby&rdquo; nursery and any infants who were
      first admitted to the &ldquo;sick-baby&rdquo; nursery for
      observation but later transferred to the
      &ldquo;well-baby&rdquo; nursery. Infants who were first
      admitted to the &ldquo;well-baby&rdquo; nursery and later
      transferred to the &ldquo;sick-baby&rdquo; nursery also were
      excluded.</p>

      <p class="text2">Cultures were made of 1,343 infants: 591
      circumcized males (males-C), 99 uncircumcized males
      (males-UC), and 653 females by direct agar-skin contact plate
      (Rodac) technique twice before the infants were discharged
      from the hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the
      parents for this study before the infants were admitted to
      the newborn nursery.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mean age of infants at the time of
      culture was one day and 2 days, corresponding to release from
      the nursery to rooming-in, and discharge to home,
      respectively.</p>

      <p class="text2">A culture was taken at 72 hours on all
      infants not ready for discharge. At the time of the second
      culture, parents were assigned a return appointment at 10 to
      14 days of age (mean time for follow-up culture, 12.5 days).
      The infants who completed the entire protocol numbered 1,134:
      486 males-C, 73 males-UC, and 575 females.</p>

      <h4>Cultures</h4>

      <p class="text2">Direct application of agar plates to skin is
      an effective method of detecting skin colonization.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8-11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Direct-contact plates: The first and second
      nursery cultures were obtained by the direct agar-skin
      contact method using Rodac plates containing mannitol salt
      agar. This selective medium has been shown to enhance the
      recovery of <i>S. aureus</i> by inhibiting gram-negative
      organisms.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The agar surface of the plate was applied
      directly to the skin surface just to the right of the
      umbilicus The agar surface was pressed down with even
      pressure and slight rocking motion to ensure even
      distribution of agar-skin contact. Care was taken not to
      twist or slip the agar to prevent smudging the culture
      inocula or the agar surface.</p>

      <p class="text2">Follow-up swabs: Cultures were obtained from
      infants returning to the follow-up clinic using dry cotton
      swabs to sample the skin just to the right of the umbilicus.
      Swab cultures were plated on blood agar and mannitol salt
      agar. Any disease lesions detected during this period were
      cultured by the same swab method. Swabs were used, rather
      than Rodac plates, since qualitative and not quantitative
      cultures were desired.</p>

      <h4>Staphylococcal Isolates</h4>

      <p class="text2">Organisms were identified on plates by
      colony morphology and confirmed microscopically.
      Direct-contact plates were counted after 24 hours and 48
      hours. Colony counts were recorded as exact numbers up to 99
      colonies. Plentiful overgrowth of staphylococcal isolates,
      precluding exact colony counts, were recorded as
      &ldquo;greater than&rdquo; 99 colonies.</p>

      <p class="text2">All staphylococcal isolates were tested for
      catalase, coagulase, and DNAase. All coagulate-positive
      staphylococci, whether isolated from surveillance skin
      cultures or disease lesions, were phage-typed by the
      Department of Health, State of Hawaii,</p>

      <p class="text2">During the study, the names of the patients
      were not known to the laboratory. All laborory evaluations
      were done by culture numbers and reported to the physician by
      number.</p>

      <p class="text2">The follow-up examinations were performed by
      physicians in the well-baby clinic or by the staff
      pediatricians when infants had skin infections before their
      scheduled appointments. The physicians performing these
      examinations were unaware of previous culture findings.</p>

      <p class="text2">Statistical significance was determined
      using the chi-squared distribution with one degree of
      freedom.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text2">There was no association between
      quantitative colony counts of positive nursery cultures and
      subsequent staphylococcal skin disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Results of the first culture established an
      overall 10.2% colonization rate (10.3% females. 10.1%
      males-C, and 11 .0% males-UC, See Table 1 .) Overall
      colonization rate after the second culture was 17.5% (15.6%
      females, 20.6% males-C, and 12.3% males-UC). The nursery
      colonization rate determined by an infant having at least one
      positive nursery culture was 22.8% (20.9% females 25.3%
      males-C, and 20.5% males-UC).</p>

      <p class="text2">Staphylococcal colonization at follow-up,
      without overt disease, was 7.4% overall (2.4% females, 13.4%
      males-C, and 6.8% males-UC). Interestingly, staphylococcal
      colonization in thc nursery did not correlate with
      colonization at the follow-up examination when infants with
      overt disease are excluded. (See Table 2.)</p>

      <p class="text2">Skin disease occurred in 7.8% (N = 116) of
      first culture-positive infants (CPI), compared to 3.6% (N =
      1,018) of first culture-negative infants (CNI) (0.05 &lt; p
      &lt; 0.1). Disease was noted in 10.1% of second CPI versus
      2.8% (N = 935) of second CNI (p &lt; 0.005).</p>

      <p class="text2">Skin disease was documented in 8.5% (N =
      258) of first <i>or</i> second CPI (defined as the nursery
      colonization rate) vs. 2.7% (N = 876) of the first <i>and</i>
      second CNI (p &lt; 0.005) (Table 3).</p>

      <h4>Results by Gender</h4>

      <p class="text2">Of the 1,134 (84%) infants who completed the
      protocol, having a follow-up exam at two weeks of age, 575
      were female and 559 were male (486 male-C and 73
      male-UC).</p>

      <p class="text2">Staphylococcal colonization rates during
      hospitalization (first nursery culture, second nursery
      culture, and first or second nursery culture positive) were
      not statistically different among females, males-C, or
      males-UC (p&lt; 0.10).</p>

      <p class="text2">Males exceeded females for staphylococcal
      colonization without disease at the follow-up examination
      (p&lt; 0.005), and also for skin disease (p&lt; 0.005).</p>

      <p class="text2">Staphylococcal colonization at followup and
      skin disease rates among uncircumcized males were more
      similar to the rates of the females than to their circumcized
      counterparts.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Circumcized males had
      rates of follow-up colonization and skin disease that were
      twice those of uncircumcized males.</span> However, these
      differences were not statistically significant (p &lt; 0.10),
      perhaps due to the relatively small number of males-UC
      compared to males-C in the study population.</p>

      <h4>Phage-Type Results</h4>

      <p class="text2">The <i>staphylococci</i> isolated during the
      study represented 58 different phage types, some nontypable.
      The most common phage types, in order, were (95),
      (nontypable), (96), (94/96), and (29). These phage types
      accounted for 71.4% of nursery isolates and 70.6% of
      follow-up isolates. Phage type (95) represented 40% of all
      nursery and 39.4% of all follow-up isolates. Twenty percent
      of infants with positive follow-up cultures were previously
      colonized with the identical phage type in the nursery.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text2">Most newborn infants are sterile at birth,
      unless the delivery is complicated by prolonged rupture of
      membranes. Colonization of newborn infants by potentia
      pathogens logically must precede the development of invasive
      disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Most infants become staphylococcal carriers
      during the first days of life while in the newborn
      nursery.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Generally, the umbilicus and groin are
      colonized first, and the nose and neck much less
      rapidly.<sup><a href="#n2">2,13</a></sup> the primary
      reservoir of <i>staphylococci</i> apparently is the infants
      themselves,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> The umbilicus ls
      thought to be the most important reservoir.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The earlier and more widely that an infant
      becomes colonized with <i>staphylococci</i>, the more likely
      he is to develop infection with <i>staphylococci</i>
      later.</p>

      <p class="text2">Infants with positive cultures at discharge
      have had higher rates of disease than those with negative
      cultures at discharge.<sup><a href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> Our
      results unequivocally confirm these earlier observations.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is tempting to suggest that babies differ
      in their susceptibility to <i>staphylococci</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> Many investigators have noted that
      males are particularly prone to both staphylococcal
      colonization and later development of staphylococcal
      infection,<sup><a href="#n3">3, 4, 6, 17</a></sup>
      particularly in the diaper area.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Curran and Al-Salihi described a
      massive outbreak of Staphylococcal Scalded-Skin Syndrome
      (SSSS), and remarked that the preponderance of males with
      generalized exfoliative skin disease suggests that the
      circumcision wound may provide a site of colonization for
      staphylococci resulting in an increased incidence of SS in
      males They did not document male preponderance for bullous
      impetigo;<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> however, their
      investigation was retrospective.</p>

      <p class="text2">Our study prospectively confirms the male
      predilection for neonatal staphylococcal skin disease. During
      hospitalization, males and females have similar colonization
      rates, but males have greater colonization and eventual
      staphylococcal skin disease thereafter.</p>

      <p class="text2">This study did not confirm any superiority
      of quantitative culture over simple qualitative swab methods
      for predicting eventual staphylococcal skin disease. However,
      the more selective media resulted in identifying most twice
      as many infants colonized with <i>S. aureus</i> as did a
      similar smaller study done previously at our
      institution.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The increased incidence
      of staphylococcal colonization and pyoderma in males may be
      associated with circumcision performed after the first 24
      hours of life in the nursery.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is performed on approximately
      90% of the male infants born at our hospital.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> In our study population, 87% of the
      males were circumcized.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision, by its very nature, requires
      more staff-patient &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; contact. The
      infants are all lined up and tbeir stomachs lavaged clear in
      preparation for the procedure. The circumcisions are done
      daily, as a group, in a small area, using reusable
      circumcision restraints.</p>

      <p class="text2">Postoperatively, there is also more handling
      of the diaper area in caring for the fresh, hemorrhagic
      wound.</p>

      <p class="text2">A larger study, involving more infants, is
      required to validate the hypothesis that circumcision is the
      culprit responsible for the increased rate of staphylococcal
      colonization and infection in newborn males. This may be due
      to the remarkably high rate of neonatal circumcision done in
      the United States. A much smaller study would be satisfactory
      if it were performed in Great Britain or one of the developed
      countries of Europe, where the incidence of noncircumcision
      is more equal to the rate of circumcision in the U.S.</p>

      <p class="text2">Gellis eloquently indicted circumcision,
      noting that the infant &ldquo;has enough portals of entry for
      organisms as it is,&rdquo; referring to the infant's nose,
      mouth, conjunctiva, and the cut end of his umbilicus.
      &ldquo;It seems totally unnecessary to aid and abet lurking
      bacteria by adding a raw wound to his
      genitalia.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>
