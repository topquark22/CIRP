      <b>PURPOSE:</b> The appropriate management of penile
      adhesions in circumcised boys is unclear. An important
      consideration is whether adhesions resolve spontaneously. We
      studied the incidence of penile adhesions as a function of
      patient age to assess the natural history. 

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> We evaluated all circumcised
      boys presenting to our pediatric urology clinic. A standard
      form was used to classify adhesions as grade 0-no adhesions,
      1-fine adhesions to the corona, 2-adhesions covering less
      than 50% of the glans and 3-adhesions covering greater than
      50% of the glans. All boys were evaluated by 1 of 2 pediatric
      urologists. Previous treatment of adhesions was assessed and
      skin bridges were also noted.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> We enrolled in our study 254 boys 1 month
      to 19 years 8 months old. Only 7 patients had a history of
      treatment of adhesion, of whom 3 had recurrent adhesions at
      evaluation. Patients were divided into groups based on age,
      including younger than 12 months (61), 13 to 60 (78), 61 to
      108 (51) and 109 months old or older (64). In these groups we
      noted an adhesion rate of 71%, 28%, 8% and 2%, respectively.
      The rate of adhesions more severe than grade 1 was 30%, 10%
      and 0% in boys 12 months old or younger, 13 to 60 and 61
      months old or older, respectively. The oldest patient with
      grade 3 adhesions was 31 months old. Skin bridges in 6 cases
      involved the circumcision line in 4.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Penile adhesions
      develop after circumcision</span> and the incidence decreases
      with patient age. Although there is debate on whether to lyse
      these adhesions manually, our findings suggest that adhesions
      resolve without treatment. Based on our results we do not
      recommend lysing penile adhesions, except perhaps those
      involving the circumcision line.</p>
