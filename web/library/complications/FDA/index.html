    Clamps<br />
     <small>(You are encouraged to copy and distribute this
    information)</small></h2>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Dear Colleague:</p>

      <p>This letter is to alert you to the potential for injury
      from two commonly used circumcision clamps, the
      Gomco&reg;/gomco-type and Mogen&reg;/mogen-type clamps. Both
      are widely used during circumcision to remove the foreskin
      while protecting the glans penis.</p>

      <p>Although research suggests that circumcision is generally
      a safe procedure, we are concerned that some serious
      device-related complications have occurred. We received 105
      reports of injuries involving circumcision clamps between
      July 1996 and January 2000<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>.
      These have included laceration, hemorrhage, penile
      amputation, and urethral damage.</p>

      <p>We are providing recommendations below that can help avoid
      these complications.</p>

      <p align="center"><u><b>Nature of the Problem</b></u></p>

      <p><b>Gomco&reg; and Gomco-type Clamps</b></p>

      <p>The use of Gomco&reg; and gomco-type clamps that have been
      reassembled by users with parts from different manufacturers,
      or that have bent parts or mismatched components, has led to
      clamps breaking, slipping, falling off during use, tearing
      penile tissue or failing to make a tight seal. Please note
      that although Gomco- and gomco-type clamps may appear to have
      interchangeable parts, these parts may not always be safely
      interchanged because they may vary slightly in
      dimensions.</p>

      <p><u><b>Mogen&reg; and Mogen-type Clamps</b></u></p>

      <p>The use of Mogen&reg; and mogen-type clamps that have jaw
      gap dimensions greater than those in the manufacturer's
      specifications, or use of clamps inappropriately sized for
      patients, has led to patient injuries. In such cases, the
      clamp may allow too much tissue to be drawn through the
      opening of the device, thus facilitating the removal of an
      excessive amount of foreskin and in some cases, a portion of
      the glans penis.</p>
       

      <p align="center"><u><b>Recommendations</b></u></p>

      <p><b>General:</b></p>

      <p>Before performing a circumcision procedure, examine the
      clamp to determine that all parts are available, undamaged,
      and within the manufacturer's specification.</p>

      <p><b>Gomco&reg; and Gomco-type clamps:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you cannot be certain that a clamp component is part
        of the original clamp or if the clamp has stripped threads,
        a warped or bent base plate, a bent arm, twisted forks, or
        a scored or nicked bell, either contact the device
        manufacturer to obtain replacement parts<sup><a
        href="#n2">2</a></sup> or <i>discard the clamp</i>.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>When requesting a replacement part, obtain the
        assurance of the manufacturer or supplier that the part
        ordered is compatible with the other components of your
        device. Do not substitute parts from different clamp
        manufacturers.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure that you reassemble a clamp from <i>only its
        own parts.</i> Do not mix up parts from different clamps,
        even from the same manufacturer, unless the manufacturer
        has assured you that the parts are interchangeable.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>If you choose to mark clamp parts to assure that you
        correctly reassemble them, ask the manufacturer about the
        best way to do this, because some marking methods may
        weaken the device or compromise your ability to sterilize
        it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Mogen&reg; and Mogen-type clamps:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the clamp being used is appropriate for the
        patient size. Some manufacturers have two sizes of clamps,
        one for adults and the other for infants.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Periodically measure the gap between the device?s
        clamping jaws to ensure that it is within the
        manufacturer?s specification.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
        Using a device with an inappropriate jaw gap could allow
        the tip of the penis to be drawn through the clamp with the
        foreskin and inadvertently severed or injured.</li>
      </ul>

      <p align="center"><u><b>Reporting Adverse Events to
      FDA</b></u></p>

      <p>The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) requires
      hospitals and other user facilities to report deaths and
      serious injuries associated with the use of medical devices.
      This means that if the use of a Gomco/gomco-type clamp or a
      Mogen/mogen-type clamp result in a death or serious injury,
      you must report that event. We request that you follow the
      procedures established by your facility for such mandatory
      reporting.</p>

      <p>If a circumcision clamp malfunctions, you can report this
      directly to the manufacturer. Alternatively, you can report
      directly to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary reporting program.
      You may submit reports to MedWatch four ways: online to <a
      href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/"
      target="_blank">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/</a>
      by telephone at 1-800-FDA-1088; by FAX at 1-800-FDA-0178, or
      by mail to MedWatch, Food and Drug Administration, HF-2, 5600
      Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</p>
