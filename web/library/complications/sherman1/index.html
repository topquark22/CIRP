      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> Circumcision remains the most common
      operation performed on male individuals in the United States.
      Unfortunately various complications may occur during
      circumcision ranging from trivial to tragic. We report 7
      cases of traumatic amputation of the glans penis and/or
      urethra during circumcision. In addition, errors in
      circumcision technique as probable mechanisms of injury,
      principles of repair and limits of tissue viability are
      discussed.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> The medical records of 7
      patients who underwent traumatic circumcision amputation of
      the glans penis and/or urethra were reviewed. Glanular
      amputation occurred in 6, 8-day-old neonates during ritual
      circumcision and in 1, 5-month-old infant circumcised by a
      physician.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Excised glanular tissue remained viable up
      to 8 hours after injury. Followup ranged from 8.5 to 108
      months. All patients had an acceptable cosmetic result. No
      long-term complications developed in the 8-day-old group but
      a distal urethral fistula formed in the 5-month-old
      patient.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Careful selection of technique and
      device as well as strict attention to detail at circumcision
      should eliminate most injuries. On the basis of our results
      we recommend reanastomosis of the glans and/or urethra
      following distal amputation even when there is a delay in
      surgical repair of up to 8 hours.</p>
