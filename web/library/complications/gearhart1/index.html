      <p>Four patients who had traumatic loss of the penis were
      managed after the initial injury with a feminizing
      genitoplasty. Patient reconstruction ranged from 6 months to
      3 years. The technique of feminizing genitoplasty is
      described. There were no instances of flap necrosis, urinary
      tract infection or urinary incontinence. Immediate results
      were considered to be cosmetically satisfactory in all
      patients. Followup ranged from 8 months to 23 years, with a
      median of 10.5 years. The long-term results have been
      particularly gratifying in 2 individuals who have been
      observed for more than 18 years. Early feminizing
      genitoplasty offers an excellent method of reconstruction of
      the external genitalia in the child with traumatic loss of
      the penis who is assigned a female sex of rearing.</p>
