      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p>Penile trauma is rare because the penis is mobile and
      largely protected by its position, although in the erect
      state, in adults the penis is more prone to trauma in the
      form of penile fracture [<a href="#n1">1,2</a>]. However,
      paediatric penile trauma has different underlying causes and
      forms of trauma, being rarely reported. It may be iatrogenic
      during circumcision [<a href="#n3">3&ndash;8</a>] or caused
      by domestic animal attack [<a href="#n9">9&ndash;11</a>],
      child abuse, motor vehicle accidents [10] or trapping in a
      zipper [<a href="#n12">12</a>]; penile strangulation by hair or
      thread has also been reported [<a href="#n13">13&ndash;19</a>].
      We report 64 cases of paediatric penile trauma, their causes,
      methods of management and the results of a long-term
      follow-up.</p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p><b>Patients and methods</b></p>

      <p>Sixty-four boys (mean age 7.5 years, SD 4, range
      1&ndash;18) with acute penile trauma or history of such
      trauma were admitted to our hospital between 1981 and 2000.
      Table 1 lists the different causes of penile trauma.
      Circumcision-related injuries were the most common and most
      were in the form of urethrocutaneous fistulae. Partial or
      complete glans amputations were unusual, as were skin or
      meatal trauma (Table 1). Human hair-tie strangulation injury
      was less common and in four boys resulted in a
      urethro-cutaneous fistula. Of the four cases caused by animal
      attack, three were from a dog bite and one from a buffalo
      kick. The first boy lost his glans completely, another lost
      his penis and scrotum, the third had a large mid-shaft
      urethral defect and the fourth had a split glans with a
      disrupted glanular urethra. Two of the boys involved in
      accidents had partially amputated glans and two had
      urethrocutaneous fistulae. Of the zipper injuries the first
      resulted in penile skin injury while the second caused a
      urethrocutaneous fistula. One child in the series was
      subjected to repeated attacks of electrical burning of his
      glans which resulted in meatal stenosis complicated by
      urinary retention.</p>

      <p class="text">Patients were managed according to the
      severity of injury (Table 1). Forty patients (62%) presented
      late after the injury with established urethrocutaneous
      fistulae and underwent a delayed repair. Table 1 shows the
      different methods of repair for urethrocutaneous fistulae,
      with a simple repair in most by circumferential incision
      around the fistula, trimming of the edges with subsequent
      closure in unopposing layers. In the five patients with a
      glans hanging on a thin pedicle after hair-tie strangulation,
      the tie was released and the glans and urethra reconstructed.
      Figure 1 shows the stages of repair for these advanced cases
      of hair-tie. Partial or complete amputation of the glans
      occurred in 10 patients (16%). Primary treatment consisted of
      haemostasis and meatoplasty; a delayed penile lengthening
      procedure was carried out in one. The most severe case, with
      complete avulsion of the penis and scrotum, underwent
      perineal urethrostomy and skin closure. During the follow-up
      we assessed the cosmetic appearance and voiding function;
      patients who became adults were asked about their erectile
      function.</p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p>The mean (SD, range) hospital stay was 9 (4, 2&ndash;21)
      days; 54 patients (84%) were followed for a mean (SD, range)
      of 5.7 (4, 0.5&ndash;18.3) years and Table 1 shows the
      results. Excellent cosmetic and functional results were seen
      in 40 patients (74%), with fair results in five (9%),
      includ-ing three with a normal appearance but with minute
      fistulae and two with no glans but with good functioning
      penile length and a wide urethral meatus. The pro-cedures
      failed in nine boys (17%), with emasculation in one,
      insufficient penile length in two and persist-ent
      urethrocutaneous fistulae with insufficient local skin in
      six.</p>

      <p class="text">Fifteen patients are currently adults, seven
      in their third decade, while eight are teenagers; 13 reported
      normal sexual function. Sexual dysfunction in the remaining
      two patients was related to insufficient penile length in one
      and severe penile curvature complicating multiple attempts at
      repair of a large urethrocutaneous fistula in one.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Of the 40 patients with
      circumcision-related injuries who were followed, six (15%)
      had functional disability (Table 1);</span> of the 10 with
      hair-tie strangulation injury, none lost his glans. Of the
      four injuries caused by animal attacks, three boys had poor
      results (one each with complete emasculation, short penis and
      severe ventral curvature). There was no functional disability
      in the remaining forms of trauma.</p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p>Reports of trauma to the external genitalia in children
      are sporadic; the cause and type of penile trauma varies in
      severity from entrapment in a zipper to more serious injuries
      and total emasculation [<a href="#n3">3&ndash;11</a>]. Most
      children with zipper injuries are managed in the emergency
      department with no general anaesthesia [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>], although in the present two cases a
      general anaesthetic was required.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Penile trauma
      complicating circumcision has been reported more frequently,
      with varying degrees of severity ranging from skin or meatal
      injury, partial glanular amputation to total penile
      amputation [<a href="#n3">3&ndash;7</a>]. Total penile
      ablation by electrocautery during circumcision was also
      reported [<a href="#n8">8</a>] but the most common
      circumcision complications are haemorrhage and primary
      infection [<a href="#n3">3&ndash;5</a>]. Wiswell and Geschke
      [<a href="#n3">3</a>] reviewed the records of 136 086
      circumcised boys and reported an overall complication rate of
      0.19%, while the rate of associated injuries was 0.025%. Gee
      and Ansell [<a href="#n4">4</a>] reported similar
      complication rates for circumcision. However, others have
      reported higher rates (1.6%) with more serious complications,
      including death (in five cases) when circumcision was carried
      out by unqualified village barbers [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>].</span></p>

      <p class="text">In the present series, circumcision-related
      trauma was the most common form of penile injury (67%); such
      a high incidence is not unusual in a country where
      circumcision is routine among all Moslems and most Egyptian
      Christians. Three-quarters of circumcision-related trauma was
      in the form of urethrocutaneous fistulae (32 cases), usually
      inflicted during circumcision through inadvertent entrapment
      of excess ventral skin, including the urethra, into the
      bone-cutting clamp (or similar device) during excision of the
      preputial skin. Of the 32 urethrocutaneous fistulae, 27 (85%)
      were successfully repaired.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">More serious
      circumcision-related complications include glanular
      amputation [<a href="#n5">5</a>]. Ozkan and Gurpinar [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>] reported successful re-attachment of the
      glans after amputation during circumcision but in the present
      series such patients were less fortunate. They were referred
      after a significant delay, precluding attempts at
      re-attachment. Tank et al. [<a href="#n9">9</a>] described a
      method for penile reconstruction after penile amputation and
      a similar technique was used successfully in one patient with
      such amputation in the present series. An additional patient
      with no glans and an unacceptably short penile stump is
      scheduled for the same procedure.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Penile strangulation caused by various
      objects, from wedding rings to rubber bands, has been
      reported, but none as insidious as entrapment by human hair
      [<a href="#n13">13&ndash;19</a>]. The rings and bands are
      usually used in adults to improve erection, while
      strangulation by hair or thread is more common in children.
      In most such cases it is hard to believe that the trauma is
      purely accidental and not deliberate. The role of the mother
      in some of these episodes remains suspect [<a
      href="#n15">15</a>]. The human hair-tie causes gradual
      chronic ischaemia, resulting in little dis-comfort to the
      child. Initially the hair-tie causes gradual swelling of the
      glans, infection, then skin ulceration. Removal of the
      constricting agent at this stage usually results in no
      long-term complications. One of the present patients was
      saved at this stage, but delayed recognition may lead to more
      serious consequences. The hair may cut dorsally through the
      neurovascular bundle, sparing the urethra but resulting in
      the loss of glanular sensation, or cut through the spongiosa
      and the urethra, resulting in a urethrocutaneous fistula. The
      hair tie may eventually transect the cavernosa, leading to
      partial or complete glanular amputation. The largest series
      was reported by Harouchi et al. [<a href="#n19">19</a>] (38
      cases) from Morocco; they classified the severity of lesions
      as type I to IV. A staged repair for the severe degrees of
      tourniquet injury was suggested [<a href="#n15">15,18</a>].
      In the present five boys with severe hair-tie injury
      (resulting in a glans attached by a thin pedicle to the
      penis), a one-stage repair was success-ful in four, while in
      the other the glans was re-attached in one stage and the
      urethra repaired after a delay.</p>

      <p class="text">Domestic animal attack was reported by
      different authors to produce severe forms of penile trauma,
      up to total emasculation [<a href="#n9">9&ndash;11</a>]. In
      this study, compared with other types of penile trauma,
      animal attack injuries had the worst results cosmetically and
      functionally. Of the four such injuries three had poor
      results. Urethral and penile injuries in the setting of an
      animal bite are at high risk of complications because of
      tissue destruction and contamination, and the consequent
      requirement of a more liberal debridement.</p>

      <p class="text">In conclusion, in our region, <span
      class="yellow">ritual circumcision and hair-tie strangulation
      injuries are the most common causes of penile trauma in
      children.</span> Good functional and cosmetic results are
      possible in most cases but animal attacks are associated with
      the highest rate of long-term functional and cosmetic
      disability, and represent the greatest surgical
      challenge.</p>
