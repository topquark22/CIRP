      <h2>[Iatrogenic stenosis of the male urethra. 50 cases
      (author's transl)]</h2>

      <p>[Article in French]</p>

      <p><b>Viville C, Weltzer J.</b></p>

      <p>The iatrogenic aetiology of urethral stenosis now plays a
      considerable role : 40.6% of stenoses seen between 1966 and
      1980. It would appear to be increasing in frequency : 10 new
      cases per year during the past 4 years. The role of the
      indwelling urethral catheter is particularly troublesome
      despite the constant improvement in the material used. With
      the exception improvement in the material used. With the
      exception of <span class="yellow">11 meatal stenosis after
      circumcision,</span> 2 apparently post-radiotherapy stenosis
      and 3 strictures after cytoscopy, a urethral catheter was
      alone responsible in 14 cases and apparently the principal
      factor in 20 others (i.e. 34/50). The treatment of iatrogenic
      stenosis of the urethra involves all methods, with a marked
      preference for internal urethrotomy. Finally, prevention is
      based essentially upon more caution in the use of indwelling
      urethral catheters.</p>
