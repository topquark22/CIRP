      <h2>Hepatitis C among child transfusion and adult renal
      dialysis patients in Indonesia.</h2>

       Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>

      <p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence among high-risk
      pediatric and adult patients was evaluated. The study
      included 269 adults and 150 children in a case-control
      research design. Risk factors of HCV exposure in Indonesia
      were assessed among adult renal dialysis patients and
      pediatric patients who received multiple blood transfusions.
      A high prevalence of anti-HCV was found among the adult renal
      dialysis patients, measured by second-generation
      electroimmunoassay tests. Family members of dialysis
      patients, who served as a comparison group for dialysis
      patients, were found to have a 9.0% seroprevalence. The
      prevalence of anti-HCV among pediatric patients with
      hematological disorders was found to be 39.0%. The comparison
      group seroprevalence (pediatric patients and family members)
      was 4.3% among sera available for confirmatory testing.
      Patients with history of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] =
      7.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.06-15.51, P = 0.0001),
      blood transfusion (OR = 6.85, 95% CI: 3.95-11.88, P =
      0.0001), <span class="yellow">circumcision (OR = 2.39, 95%
      CI: 1.43-3.99, P = 0.0001)</span>, or marital partner/family
      member history of jaundice (OR = 3.62, 95% CI: 1.97-6.62, P =
      0.0001) were found to have an increased odds of HCV exposure
      compared with individuals without similar histories.</p>
