      <h3><a id="PDR" name="PDR"></a>1996 PHYSICIANS' DESK
      REFERENCE, 545-547.</h3>

      <p>The 1996 Physicans' Desk reference says in the listing for
      EMLA Cream which is manufactured by Astra:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "EMLA Cream is not recommended for use on mucous membranes
        because limited studies show much greater absortion of
        lidocaine and prilocaine than through intact skin. Safe
        dosing recommendations for use on mucous membranes cannot
        be made because it has not been studied accurately."
      </blockquote>
      It also states: 

      <blockquote>
        "EMLA Cream should not be used in infants under the age of
        one month, nor in infants under the age of twelve months,
        who are receiving treatment with methemoglobin-inducing
        agents (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS).

      <p>This would appear to contraindicate its use as an

      <p><b>Dear Doctor,</b></p>

      <p>The Department of Paediatrics at Prince George Regional
      Hospital recently discussed the unfortunate case of a
      21-day-old male child who was circumcised using Prilocaine as
      a local anesthetic agent. A few hours after the circumcision
      the baby developed significant Methaemoglobinaemia
      <i>[reaction with the blood]</i> due to the Prilocaine
      anesthetic.</p>

      <p>The department of Paediatrics is issuing a strong warning
      to all physicians who perform circumcisions. We strongly
      advise that Prilocaine local anesthetic <b>not be used under
      any circumstances for neonatal circumcision.</b> It is also
      interesting to note that EMLA cream contains 2.5% Prilocaine.
      It also therefore should not be used on the mucous membranes
      of newborns when they are circumcised.</p>

      <p><b>It is the Department of Paediatrics' recommendation</b>
      that no infant under the age of 3 months gets Prilocaine or
      EMLA cream in any form because of the serious risk of
      Methaemoglobinaemia.</p>

      <p>I understand from speaking with an Intensivist at B.C.
      Children's Hospital that two other cases of
      Methaemoglobinaemia due to Prilocaine have also been noted
      in B.C. in the past recent months. <b>As you know
      Methaemoglobinaemia can cause brain damage and death in small
      infants.</b></p>

      <p><i>Abstract:</i></p>

      <p>EMLA (eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine) cream
      is currently not recommended for use in infants &lt; 1 month
      of age because of the potential risk of methemoglobinemia as
      a result of the o-toluidine metabolite of prilocaine. We
      studied bioavailablitiy and changes in methemoglobin levels
      following topical penile exposure to 1 g of EMLA cream for 1
      hour in piglets. Lidocaine, prilocaine, and o-toluidine
      concentrations were measured simultaneously using a
      high-performance liquid chromatography method. The systemic
      bioavailability of EMLA was low: 4.0 +/- (SD) 4.7% for
      lidocaine (range 0-13.6; n=8) and 7.2 +/- 5.7% for prilocaine
      (range 0-14.5; n=8). The ratio between exposure to
      o-toluidine with EMLA versus intravenous administration (i.e.
      AUC EMLA/ AUC IV; see text) was also low: 4.2 +/- 9.3% (range
      0-28.6; n=9). The mean maximum methemaglobin value after
      intravenous administration was 1.23 +/- 0.64% (range 0.5-3.0;
      n=12) and after penile application 0.99 +/- 0.36% (range
      0.5-2.0; n=12). The methemoglobin value was elevated
      significantly above baseline after intravenous administration
      (p=0.03), but not after penile application of EMLA. These
      findings suggest that penile administration of 1 g or EMLA
      may be safe for neonatal circumcision, but further study is
      required.</p>

      </b></p>

      <p><i>Conclusion:</i></p>

      <p>There are insufficient data to support the use of EMLA
      cream for circumcision in newborn infants at this time. There
      are no studies that adequately address safety or efficacy.
      Before efficacy studies can be evaluated, pharmacodynamic
      stidies need to be completed. These studies are in progress
      and are closed (personal communication, Vivian Broach etc).
      Subsequent studies should be performed within the first 72
      hours of birth and assess the following parameters: 1) serum
      concentrations of metHb, lidocaine, and prilocaine and its
      metabolites from time zero to at least 24 hours after
      application of the cream; 2) application time and dose
      applied should be varied to assess differences in absorption,
      as well as onset and duration of analgesia; 3) application
      technique could be varied to assess the depth of analgesia,
      that is, application to the inner and outer surface of the
      prepuce versus the outer surface only. Until these studies
      are completed, routine use of EMLA cream for local anesthesia
      during circumcision cannot be recommended.</p>

FROM <a href="http://www.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/EMLA.pdf"
target="_blank">ASTRA/HOSPITAL DIVISION</a> (Makers of Emla):

Contraindications:  "EMLA is contraindicated in patients...who are less
than 6 months of age or younger, until further clinical data are
available."

Precautions:  "EMLA cream is not sterile.  Therefore it should not be
applied to open wounds or used as an analgesic dressing following
cannulation or venipuncture.  EMLA cream is presently not recommended
for use on genital skin or mucosa."

Dosage and Administration:  "Use in infants under the age of 6 months:
Not recommended"

"DO NOT APPLY EYES OR ON OPEN WOUNDS.  Not for use in children under 6
months of age."
