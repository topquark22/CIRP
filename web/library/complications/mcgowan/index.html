      <p><b>A Complication of Circumcision</b></p>

      <p class="text1">To the editor: &ndash; a serious
      complication of circumcision unmentioned in the reference
      given by Lackey et al. (206:2318, 1968) is the surgical
      bivalving either by the dorsal or the ventral half of the
      glans penis. This is caused by inadequate placement of one
      limb of the scissors into the urethra rather than between the
      foreskin and the glans prior to performing either the dorsal
      or ventral slit. in the prepuce. These fortunately rare cases
      those with pinpoint openings in the phimotic foreskin with
      the glandular meatus just beneath the adhesions of the inner
      surface of the foreskin and glans penis are not reduced, the
      line of least resistance to placement of instrument is the
      urethra itself. Once the incision is made the glans penis is
      bivalved and the urethra laid open. In effect a second degree
      hypospadius has been produced.</p>

      <p class="text2">While avoidance of this complication may
      seem quite elementary, it is true that circumcision is often
      performed by the most inexperienced physician. For this
      reason, we caution that the foreskin slit always be performed
      with the inner surface of the prepuce or the glandular meatus
      under direct vision.</p>
