      <h2>Partial Amputation of Glans Penis During Mogen Clamp
      Circumcision</h2>

      <p class="text2">Although no numerical data are available,
      the most common techniques for performing newborn
      circumcision in the United States involve the use of the
      Plastibell, the Gomco clamp, and the Mogen clamp, likely in
      that order. The Mogen clamp (see Fig 1 and 2) is the least
      familiar to most pediatricians. It has a number of advantages
      when compared with the other techniques:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>1 . the one size of the Mogen fits all;</li>

        <li>2. it is the most rapid;</li>

        <li>3. the Mogen instrument allows full visualization of
        exactly how much prepuce to remove.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text2">In Mogen circumcision, however, the glans is
      not visualized before removal of the prepuce. The Plastibell
      and Gomco differ from the Mogen in that the glans is
      visualized before removal of the foreskin, and each of these
      devices utilizes a bell made of either plastic or metal that
      is placed over the glans and serves to protect it and the
      urethra/urethral meatus during the procedure. Although
      literature distributed with the Mogen clamp claims "no injury
      to glans possible," this is a case report of the amputation
      of the distal 2 mm of the glans penis during a routine
      circumcision by a pediatrician who had extensive experience
      performing this procedure. Despite anecdotal reports of
      similar occurrences, no similar reports appear in the
      literature.</p>

      <h4>CASE REPORT</h4>

      <p class="case">This 3450-g term infant underwent
      circumcision with a Mogen clamp on his first day of life at
      his parent's request. His genital anatomy was notable only in
      that he had a relatively small penis, a scrotum that inserted
      about halfway up the penile shaft, and a considerable but not
      abnormal amount of redundancy of his foreskin. The procedure
      was performed by a pediatrician with 21 years in practice who
      had performed over 2000 previous circumcisions, over 250
      using the Mogen clamp. These had been accompushed without
      serious or unusual complications. Following a dorsal penile
      nerve block, the Mogen clamp was applied in the usual manner.
      When the clamp was removed it was obvious that the distal 2
      mm (or tip) of the penis, including the urethral opening, had
      been amputated. This was immediately retrieved along with the
      foreskin remnant and placed in a medicine cup containing 10
      mL of saline, which was then placed on ice. Pressure was
      applied to the tip of the penis to prevent bleeding. A
      urologist was notified, the child was taken to the operating
      room, and with the assistance of a plastic surgeon, the
      severed tip was reattached, including end-to-end anastomosis
      of the urethra using a microsurgical technique, which was
      performed within an hour of the amputation. The
      re-anastomosis was totally successful (see photograph (Fig 3)
      taken 2 weeks postsurgery). Follow-up at 2 years of age by a
      pediatric urologist revealed a minimal cosmetic defect with
      entirely normal function and the prognosis for normal growth
      and function in the future.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">Although there are references in the
      literature to possible injury to the glans as a complication
      of circumcision, there are no specific reports of an injury
      of this nature from a Mogen clamp.' <sup>3</sup> The company
      producing this clamp refused to accept a report of this
      occurrence or reveal whether they had knowledge of similar
      occurrences. The insert accompanying the new clamp states "no
      injury to glans possible, because of beveled underedge and
      narrow aperture." The clamp used was less than 2 years old
      and not different in aperture from new clamps arriving from
      the manufacturer.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although circumcision with a Mogen clamp has
      been reported as easy, quick, and safe, and is being taught
      in a number of centers, it may be that some children,
      particularly those with smaller organs or those with
      redundant foreskin, should not be considered as candidates
      for the use of this device. <span class="yellow">Although
      this may be an isolated event, as there is a reluctance to
      report adverse occurrences, the true risks of this device are
      not known.</span></p>

      knowledge of similar occurrences to contact me. Your
      confidentiality will be honored.</p>
