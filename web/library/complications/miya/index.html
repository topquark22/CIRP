                   BOTCHED CIRCUMCISIONS

                     By Pamela A. Miya

--------
ABSTRACT
--------

A nurse seeks advice on what to do about the frequent
occurrence of badly performed circumcisions at the
hospital.  The formal approach of recording the problem
systematically and directing it through official channels is
one option.  Alternatively, nurses and supervisor could try
to resolve the problem by discussing it in a
nonconfrontational manner with individual physicians.
Written discharge instructions about circumcision care and
when to seek medical attention could also be given to
mothers.
