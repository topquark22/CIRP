        <p>TUBERCULOSIS FOLLOWING RITUAL CIRCUMCISION*</p>

        <p class="author">BY MARK S. REUBEN, M.D.</p>

        <p class="location">New York</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Milton H. came to our notice at the
      Vanderbilt Clinic on November 1, 1916 at the age of nine
      weeks. On the eighth day he was circumcised by a mohel, who
      aspirated the wound by means of a glass tube; within a week
      the entire wound of the circumcision had healed. Five weeks
      after the circumcision had been performed, the mother noticed
      a swelling in the right groin, and it was for treatment of
      this swelling that the infant was brought to the clinic. The
      same mohel who circumcised the patient had previously
      circumcised 2 other boys in the same family ; the boys are
      respectively seven and five years of age are both well.</p>

      <p class="text2">Physical examination of the child was
      entirely negative; the spleen was not enlarged; the lungs
      were negative; the inginal glands in the right groin were
      enlarged; the whole mass being about the size of the small
      finger; there was also swelling of the left inguinal glands
      but not to the same extent as on the right side; examination
      of the penis, on casual observation, presented nothing
      abnormal; the circumcision wound had completely healed; there
      was no ulceration; on closer scrutiny we could see four small
      tubercular masses (each separate and distinct&mdash;about
      one-eight inch in diameter) on the anterior surface of the
      circumcision scar; the frenum was entirely free of any
      infiltration; on palpation of these little masses one
      obtained the feeling not unlike that of shot under the skin;
      they felt hard and indurated. We excised the largest of these
      tubercular masses, and microscopic examination by Dr.
      Willensky showed that the tissue was infiltrated with
      numerous tubercles and diffuse tuberculous inflammatory
      tissue; the von Pirquet reaction of the infant was positive;
      examination of the mohel showed that he was suffering from
      advanced tuberculosis and his sputum was loaded with tubercle
      bacilli. In the two weeks after we had first seen the infant
      it had gained about one pound (from 1011&mdash;119) and never
      had any fever. Excision of the tuberculous tissue of the
      penis and the inguinal glands on both sides was recommended.
      Tuberculides of the skin were not present.</p>

      <p class="text2">A review of the literature shows that there
      are reported 42 cases (including our case) of tuberculous
      infection following ritual circumcision. The incidence of
      such infection must have been greater and many cases have
      probably not been reported. It seems reasonable to suppose
      that the same operator (mohel) would probably infect a
      majority of the infants on whom he performed circumcision;
      because the tubercle bacilli is found fairly constantly in
      the mouths of tuberculous patients. We were anxious to follow
      up every infant who was circumcised by the mohel in the last
      year, but on inquiry we learned that our patient was the only
      one operated on by him in the last eighteen months; and this
      was done only at the urgent request of the mother.</p>

      <p class="text2">In 37 cases the wound was sucked in the
      usual way; in 3 the wound was sprinkled with wine from the
      mouth of the operator; in one a dressing was applied to the
      wound on which wine from the mouth of the operator was poured
      on; in our case the wound was aspirated through a glass
      tube.</p>

      <p class="text2">In two of the cases there was a history of
      tuberculosis in the family (mother and grandfather
      respectively); however, <span class="yellow">in every case
      the mohel presented evidence, clinical or bacteriological, of
      tuberculous infection.</span> Tubercle bacilli were found in
      the sputa of four operators (cases of Elserberg, Debrovitz,
      Holt, Reuben).</p>

      <p class="text2">The first symptom is infiltration and
      ulceration of the wound area; in the majority of cases
      ulceration and infiltration had developed after the
      circumcision wound had completely healed (Lehmann, Eve,
      Reuben). The infiltration takes place from seven to fourteen
      days after the operation in the form of small, hard,
      indurated tubercular masses, which gradually ulcerate; the
      ulceration usually begins at the frenum and is progressive;
      it may extend to the abdomen; in one case it led to total
      gangrene and destruction of the glans. The earliest
      ulceration was observed in the case of Holt (on the seventh
      day).</p>

      <p class="text2">From two to eight weeks after operation,
      enlargement of the inguinal lymph glands takes place; the
      enlargement is usually greater on one side than the other;
      gradually these glands enlarge and soften; suppuration due to
      mixed infection takes place and in the majority of cases
      within two or three months after infection they break
      down.</p>

      <p class="text2">Systemic infection rarely occurs before the
      fourth month after the circumcision. Without a single
      exception every case, whether it recovered or died showed
      tuberculous involvement of other tissues, glands or organs.
      The systemic manifestations of tuberculous infection
      infection were in the form of tuberculous spondylitis
      dorsalis, tuberculosis of radius, tuberculosis of hip and
      pelvis, tuberculous mastoiditis, pelvic abscess (cold),
      tuberculous cervical adenitis, cold abscess of abdomen, cold
      gluteal abscess, tuberculosis of knee, etc.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of the 42 cases reported, 11 recovered, 16
      died and of 15 the final outcome is not known. <span
      class="yellow">Death usually takes place at about one year of
      age; the earliest death reported is in the case of Holt, at
      the age of three and one-half months; the oldest death
      reported was at 3 years from a tuberculous spondylitis
      complicated by a compression myelitis.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">The cases that apparently recover invariably
      show tuberculous manifestations of bones or glands in later
      life; in these cases the ulceration on the penis and the
      suppuration of the inguinal gland usually continue and do not
      heal for from four months to four years after
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The prognosis is best in those cases in
      which early suppuration of the inguinal glands takes place
      and which are operated on by curetting or excision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the days before the tubercle bacillus was
      isolated, the diagnosis was made on a clinical basis. In the
      cases of Elsenberg, Debrovitz, Meyer, Hofmokl, Ware, Kakles,
      Finney, Arluck, Holt and Reuben, sections or smears from
      involved tissues showed the tuberculous nature of the
      disease. In the case of Eve, pus from the wound was injected
      into a guinea pig which promptly died of tuberculosis. The
      von Pirquet reaction of the infant was positive in the cases
      of Kakles, Holt and Reuben; the von Pirquet reaction was
      negative in the case of Arluck (due to exhaustion of infant).
      Tubercle bacilli were isolated from tuberculides of the skin
      only in one case. (Holt).</p>

      <p class="text2">Autopsies were performed on the cases of
      Arluck and Holt. In both cases general miliary tuberculosis
      of all the organs was found. There were found tuberculosis of
      the lungs, bronchial glands, the liver, the spleen, the
      mesenteric glands, tuberculous ulcers of the intestine,
      tuberculosis of the brain, mediastinal glands of the heart,
      of the coronary artery, of the peritoneum, of the bladder,
      etc.</p>

      <p class="text2">The course of the disease may be described
      as follows: From seven to fourteen days after circumcision,
      the wound which in the majority of cases does not heal
      ulcerates and begins to discharge pus; from two and one-half
      to eight weeks after the circumcision the inguinal glands
      become enlarged; on one side usually more than the other; in
      the majority of cases these glands suppurate and break down.
      The majority of cases these infants die at from three and
      one-half months to three years after the infection; the most
      common causes of death are tuberculous meningitis or general
      miliary tuberculosis; those who recover invariably present
      other manifestations of tuberculosis in later life
      (tuberculosis of bones, lymph gland, cold abscesses). The
      treatment of these cases is early excision of the tuberculous
      tissue of the penis and the inguinal glands on both
      sides.</p>
