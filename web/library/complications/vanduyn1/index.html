      <h1>EXCESSIVE PENILE SKIN LOSS FROM CIRCUMCISION</h1>

      <p class="author">John Van Duyn, M.D., and William S. Warr,
      M.D. <i>Columbus</i></p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>&bull; <i>A case is reported in which
      a cylindrical area of excess skin nearly a centimeter in
      length was inadvertently removed from the shaft of the
      penis.</i></b></p>

      <p class="text1">REPORTS OF MAJOR LOSSES OF PENILE SKIN as a
      complication of circumcision are fairly common; the causes of
      such loss being usually either a complicating
      infection,<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> the use of the
      electrocautery,<sup><a href="#n3">3,4</a></sup> or improper
      surgical technic.<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> Minor
      degrees of excessive skin loss appear to have attracted less
      attention in the literature,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      but we believe that they are also important for two reasons.
      One, is that considering the many circumcisions performed
      daily in this country by relatively inexperienced operators,
      these minor losses are perhaps, after all, quite common.</p>

      <p class="text2">The other is that when these defects are
      allowed to heal without grafting, there may be
      &ldquo;discomfort&rdquo; during adulthood,<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> and a shortening of the future
      erectile length of the organ. Theoretically, even a minor
      inadequacy of penile skin in the shaft would tend to result
      in a holding back of the subcutaneous part of the penis
      against the abdominal wall.</p>

      <p class="text2">An actual, if extreme, example of such a
      situation is found in a case reported by Byars in which so
      much excess skin was removed at circumcision that contraction
      of the remaining skin almost completely
      &ldquo;concealed&rdquo; the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The subcutaneous part of the shaft was
      so crowded back against the fatty mons pubis that no organ
      projected. The opening in the contracted skin at the end of
      he penis barely permitted the passage of urine.</p>

      <p class="text2">We have recently followed a case in which a
      minor excess of skin loss occurred during the routine
      circumcision of a newborn. We believe that although the
      length of the cylindrical skin loss in this case averaged
      less than a centimeter, replacement by a split skin graft was
      indicated. This decision and its carrying out resulted in a
      penis which is now normal in appearance and in which we
      anticipate a fully normal adult length and function.</p>

      <p class="section1">Case Report</p>

      <p class="text2">B. K. A., white male, the result of a full
      term pregnancy, was born on 11/15/60. Birth weight was six
      pounds, ten and one quarter ounces. There was no difficulty
      with resuscitation of the child, and after delivery he was in
      good condition in the nursery. Physical examination revealed
      no abnormalities.</p>

              </center>

              <p align="justify">Condition of penis three days
              after circumcision. The cylindrical defect measured 1
              cm in length inferiorly (on the left in the
              photograph) and 0.7 cm., superiorly (on the right in
              the photograph).</p>

      <p class="text2">On the third day of life, 11/27/60, a
      circumcision was performed using a Gomco clamp and the infant
      returned to his bed with the result supposedly satisfactory.
      The next morning, however, the wound was found pulled apart,
      and it was apparent that an excess of penile skin had been
      inadvertently removed. Measurement of the cylindrical defect
      showed a gap of 1.0 cm. inferiorly and 0.7 cm. superiorly.
      (see Fig. 1). On 11/28/60, the infant was transferred to the
      plastic surgical service and intermittent warm saline packs
      started.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Operation:</i> On 11/30/60 under light
      general anesthesia, a split graft was cut from the left lower
      abdomen at 0.009 of an inch and wrapped around the defect in
      the penis. No sutures were used. The graft was covered with
      fine mesh gauze (Owen&rsquo;s rayon) and supported bya few
      turns of a narrow Gelocast bandage (Duke Laboratories, Inc.).
      Postoperatively, an effort was made to keep the infant on his
      side to avoid softening of the dressing with urine, and the
      hands and feet restrained.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the fourth postoperative day (12/4/60),
      all dressings were removed and left off, but restraints were
      continued for three more days. On the same day (12/4/60), the
      patient was discharged from the hospital.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Follow-Up:</i> On 2/15/61, two and
      one-half months postoperatively, the patient was seen in the
      outpatient department. There was no complaints from the
      mother. The graft was found to be normally loose and to have
      blended nicely with the surrounding skin. There was no
      evidence of constricting scar tissue at the junction lines.
      (see Figs. 3 and 4).</p>

              resembles the surrounding skin and the suture lines
              can only be barely made out.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Eleven months post operatively a second
      follow-up visit was made, and the same satisfactory situation
      was found to exist. The mother was reminded that she should
      return with the child if any evidence of constricting bands
      should appear as the organ grew larger.</p>

      <p class="section1">Discussion</p>

      <p class="text2">While scrotal flaps are occasionally
      preferred for resurfacing the denuded penis, and especially
      where the injury involves the corpora cavernosa,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,9,10,11</a></sup> and in one case an abdominal
      flap;<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> the treatment of choice
      generally is considered to be by means of a split graft for
      adult at about 0.018 of an inch.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,4,13,14,15,16,17</a></sup> Such a graft, when
      placed on Buck&rsquo;s fascia, contracts very little and
      appears to blend in rapidly with the surrounding skin.</p>

      <p class="text2">Davis and Berner explain the success of
      split grafts on the penis as due to two factors: the frequent
      stretching of the grafts and the fact that the bed is loose
      fascia and not thick granulation tissue.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In the case of our infant the graft was cut
      at 0.009 of an inch and taken from the left lower quandrant
      of the abdomen. In this area the skin is hairless and the
      donor site can be closed by suture if desirable.</p>

      <center>
        <table width="352" summary="figure one">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <center>
                <img src="vanduyn1-fig4.gif" width="350"
                height="478" alt="Figure four." /><br />
                 Figure 4
              </center>

              <p align="justify">Same as figure 3, but showing skin
              pulled out inferiorly to demonstrate looseness. Note
              that there is no evidence of constriction at the
              juncture lines of the splitgraft and normal skin.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Although the eleven month follow up in our
      case revealed no evidence of tightness in the suture lines of
      the graft, it is still possible that as the penis increases
      in size such a complication might occur. If and when this
      should happen, the constricting bands could be dealt with by
      multiple Z-plasties, much in the manner of the treatment of
      congenital bands of the extremities.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="section1">Summary</p>

      <p class="text2">A case of routine circumcision in a newborn
      is reported in which a cylindrical area of excess skin
      measuring nearly a centimeter in length was inadvertently
      removed from the shaft of the penis. The defect was
      splitgrafted two days later with an apparently excellent
      result.</p>

      <p class="text2">We believe that these minor excesses of skin
      loss following circucision must be more common than indicated
      by the literature, and that many of them should be split
      grafted to avoid the possibility of a future scarred and/or
      shortened penile shaft.</p>
