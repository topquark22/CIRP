      <p class="text1">Tuberculosis by direct wound inoculation
      while not a frequent method of contracting the disease has
      yet occurred often enough to demonstrate the fact that this
      is a real danger. In 1887 Willy Meyer collected reports of a
      number of such instances and added a report of a case of his
      own of tuberculosis acquired through ritual circumcision.
      Since that time many additional observations on this subject
      have been published but only two, so far as I am
      aware&mdash;one by Ware and one by Sara Welk-Kakels&mdash;in
      this country. From inquiries, however, I am led to the
      opinion that many cases occur which do not find their way
      into print.</p>

      <p class="head2">REPORT OF CASE</p>

      <p class="text1">The report herewith presented is of more
      than ordinary interest by reason of the virulence of the
      infection as shown by the wide-spread lesions and the fact
      that the death occurred at an earlier age than in any case of
      which I have found a record.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>History</i>.-On February 24 of this year
      there was admitted to the <a
      href="http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/babies/"
      target="_blank">Babies&rsquo; Hospital</a> an infant 3 mos of
      age with an extensive ulceration of the penis. The child was
      one of seven, four of whom were dead from various acute
      diseases. The parents were healthy as were the other living
      children. There was no evidence of syphilis or tuberculosis
      in the family. The infant at birth was a large child,
      reported to have weighed 11 pounds, and had been breast-fed
      up to the date of admission. When eight days old the
      operation of ritual circumcision had been performed, the
      blood being sucked up in the usual manner. The wound did not
      heal properly and at the end of a week suppuration was
      present and ulceration followed which began in the prepuce
      and gradually extended, up to the time the child was brought
      into the hospital. About two weeks after operation swellings
      of lymph-nodes in the groin were observed and these also had
      steadily increased in size although showing no tendency to
      suppuration. The digestion had been good and the nutrition
      well preserved until the last three weeks, during which there
      had apparently been a steady loss in weight, refusal of food,
      and slight fever and cough. There was also a discharge from
      one ear and from the nose. Four or five days previously a
      scanty maculovesicular eruption had been observed over the
      trunk and extremities.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Examination</i>.-A well nourished,
      normally developed infant was found, weighing 11 &frac12;
      pounds, who did not appear acutely ill. Scattered over the
      body there were fifteen or twenty lesions which closely
      resembled those of varicella. Two or three were found on the
      scalp and several over the neck, shoulders, trunk and thighs.
      None were seen on the hands or feet and none on the mucous
      membranes. They were all very similar in character, from 3 to
      4 mm. in diameter, vesicular at the periphery and crusted at
      the center, giving a somewhat umbilicated appearance. A very
      narrow zone of redness surrounded the lesions. Apparently
      there was no itching as they had not been injured by
      scratching. Elsewhere the skin, including that of the palms
      and soles was quite normal. Many r&acirc;les were present
      over both lungs, but there was no signs of consolidation
      present. The heart was normal. The abdomen was moderately
      distended. The spleen was much enlarged, reaching fully two
      inches below the costal margin. The liver was also markedly
      enlarged, its lower border being three inches below the
      costal margin. In the inguinal region, both sides, was a
      chain of large nodular swelling about the size of the last
      phalanx of the little finger. No signs of suppuration were
      present. The penis showed complete destruction of the skin by
      ulceration quite to the abdominal wall and to the base from
      which pus was freely discharging. At the meatus was quite a
      deep ulceration producing an appearance resembling a slight
      hypospadias. The tuberculin skin test gave a strongly
      positive reaction. Tubercle bacilli were found in the
      discharge from the penis, in the sputum and in scrapings from
      the cutaneous lesions described. The bacilli from the ulcers
      of the penis were carefully differentiated from smegma
      bacilli.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Course of Disease</i>.-The child lived
      sixteen days after admission. During this period there was a
      constant temperature usually varying between 99 and 101 F.
      but occasionally going to 102 or 103. There was progressive
      weakness, steadily increasing cough and r&acirc;les
      throughout the chest. The glandular swellings in the groin
      became larger but did not soften. The other external
      lymph-nodes were not enlarged. The blood examination at date
      of admission showed a leukocytosis of 16,000.;
      polymorphonuclears 85 per cent.; lymphocytes 14 per cent.;
      hemoglobin 65 percent. Just before death the leukocytes
      increased to 24,000 and the polymorphonuclears to 92 per
      cent. No cerebral symptoms were present, but there was
      considerable restlessness and lumbar puncture was made two
      days before death. A clear fluid under normal pressure was
      obtained which gave a faint globulin reaction and showed an
      excess of cells-twenty to the cubic millimeter. The skin
      lesions present on admission dried up slightly during the
      period of observation but no new ones appeared. <span
      class="yellow">Death occurred from exhaustion.</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Necropsy</i>.-Body well nourished, the
      lesions on the skin still showing.</p>

      <p class="text2">Brain: Three or four military tubercles were
      seen over the base and a few over the convexity, but the
      ventricles were not distended and no evidences of meningitis
      were present.</p>

      <p class="text2">Lungs: The pleura was not adherent; both
      lungs were everywhere studded with military tubercles and
      small tuberculous nodules. Considerable bronchitis but very
      little pneumonia was present. The lungs looked much as if
      they had been infected by a syringeful of tubercle bacilli
      injected into the trachea. No part of the lungs had escaped.
      The bronchial and mediastinal lymph-nodes were caseous but
      not very large, none being over 1&frac14; cm. in diameter,
      and none showed softening.</p>

      <p class="text2">Heart: A small yellow tubercle was seen on
      the coronary artery about its center. A tuberculous nodule, 2
      mm in diameter, was found in the wall of the right ventricle,
      and another smaller one in the wall of the right auricle near
      the entrance of the superior vena cava. This involved the
      pericardium, endocardium and cardiac muscle and was
      cheesy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Abdomen: The parietal peritoneum was studded
      with military tubercles and tuberculous nodules, especially
      over the diaphragm. The spleen measured 8 by 4.5 cm., and on
      the surface showed many tuberculous nodules in moderate
      numbers, chiefly in the cortex. Both adrenals containeld
      tuberculous nodules, one of which was caseous. Two similar
      ones were found in the pancreas. The stomach and duodenum
      were normal, but throughout the rest of the small intestine
      were great numbers of tuberculous ulcers some of which
      extended quite to the peritoneal coat. There were large
      tuberculous ulcers in the cecum nad throughout the colon,
      even in the rectum.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mesenteric lymph-nodes were 3cm. in
      length and 1.5 cm in breadth. They were caseous but not
      softened. Extending upward from these was a chain of large
      caseous retroperitoneal lymph-nodes which followed the iliac
      arteries and then the aorta. One of the iliac arteries
      contained a cheesy lymph-node in its adventitia. The
      tuberculous character of this lesion was confirmed by
      microscopic examination. Three tubercles were seen on the
      mucous membrane of the bladder near its base. Both middle
      ears contained pus.</p>

      <p class="text1">An opportunity was given to examine the man
      who had performed the operation. He was a pale, thin, almost
      emaciated individual, who looked decidedly tuberculous
      although no physical signs of the disease in his lungs could
      be detected. In his sputum two acid-fast bacilli were found
      which looked like tubercle bacilli.</p>

      <p class="text1">This case seems complete and the evidence of
      infection through the circumcision wound, conclusive. A
      healthy child, born of healthy parents, breast-fed, developed
      local symptoms of infection within a few days after the
      operation and these persisted, being followed after a few
      weeks by signs of general infection which continued until
      death. The lesions found at necropsy point strongly to a
      spreading of the infection through the lymphatic system
      beginning from the wound, and afterward to a general blood
      infection. At death, which occurred when the child was 3
      &frac12; months old, practically every organ in the body was
      involved. Specially worthy of note in the lesions are the
      myocardium; the latter lesion I have seen but once before;
      also the tuberculides of the skin, a lesion which I believe
      is often overlooked; it has been observed at the hospital in
      two other cases during the present season, both patients
      being young infants.</p>

      <p class="text1">A search through the medical literature
      brings to light a considerable number of examples of
      tuberculosis spread by means of ritual circumcision. In all I
      have collected with the assistance of Doctors Alan Brown and
      Stafford McLean, references or reports more or less detailed
      of forty other cases. These are of sufficient interest to
      make brief summary desirable.</p>

      degeneration of the inguinal lymph-nodes. Ages of children
      are not given; the operator died two months after performing
      the operation, presumably of tuberculosis.</p>

      subsequently died of tuberculosis. The wound was sucked in
      the usual manner. The early signs were similar-irregular,
      grayish preputial ulcers which gradually extended. After two
      or three weeks there was swelling of the inguinal lymph-nodes
      which is most cases suppurated. No microscopic examinations
      were made, the diagnosis resting on the clinical
      symptoms.</p>

      swellings were noticed, which steadily increased. Abscesses
      weer opened and curetted. Sinuses followed which still were
      present at 8 months. At 10 months the child was well. Pus
      from inguinal glandular lymph-nodes injected into guinea pigs
      produced tuberculosis. Operator died from tuberculosis seven
      and a half months after the circumcision. He did not suck the

      bacilli in large numbers were obtained from the scrapings.
      Ulcerated areas were curetted. Inguinal lymph-nodes were
      excised, both sides. Bacilli were found in the lymph-nodes.
      Subsequently tuberculosis of the one knee developed. The
      patient was under observation many years and is reported
      never to have any other evidence of tuberculosis.
      Investigation by the family revealed the facto that
      &ldquo;several other children,&rdquo; all of whom had been
      circumcised by the same man, had been similarly infected. He
      is stated to have been definitely tuberculous. The parents
      reported that he spat on a clothe which was used as a
      dressing for the wound after operation.</p>

      healthy. Circumcision on eighth day. Wound was sucked by
      local ulceration, swelling and breaking down of inguinal
      lymph-nodes. The child wasted with signs of generalized
      tuberculosis. The entire penis ulcerated quite to the
      scrotum. There was great enlargement of inguinal lymph-nodes.
      Wassemann was negative; also the von Pirquet test, the latter
      thought to be due to the wide-spread infection. One tubercle
      bacillus was found in scrapings from the preputial ulcer.
      Death occurred four days later. Necropsy showed general
      tuberculosis involving lungs, intestines, spleen, mesenteric
      and inguinal lymph-nodes. The infection was believed
      throughout the lymphatic system.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">Of the forty-one
      patients, including my own, sixteen are known to have
      died;</span> seven are reported as having partially recovered
      or being scrofulous; in twelve the final results are not
      given; and only six are stated in the histories to have
      recovered. The youngest fatal case is that of the patient
      whose history I have reported. In several cases death has
      occurred as late as 11 months from tuberculous meningitis.
      The usual cause of death has been general tuberculosis. In
      many of the reports several children have been infected by a
      single operator. Thus, in Lehmann&rsquo;s cases, all ten of
      the children were thus infected; Gescheit reports four
      infants infected by the same operator; Lindmann, two
      patients, Debrovitz, four patients. In nearly all the reports
      the fact is stated that the families were free from
      tuberculosis. As a rule the earliest symptoms of infection
      have been observed in about a week after the operation. The
      wound does not heal, but suppuration occurs and ulceration
      soon follows. The early ulcer may be anywhere on the prepuce
      but is often on the frenum. It may remain as a localized
      process or be general. At the end of a second or third week
      inguinal adenitis develops. In a considerable number of cases
      it is reported that the lymph-nodes broke down and abscess
      formed, usually in two or three months after the initial
      infection. The cases in which early suppuration of the
      inguinal lymph-nodes took place and which were operated on,
      either by removal or curetting, were among those in which the
      results were the best. The symptoms of a wide-spread general
      infection rarely occurred earlier than the third or fourth
      month.</p>

      <p class="text1">The diagnosis has been made in many of the
      cases by the clinical symptoms and history alone. Some of
      these were reported before systematic search for the tubercle
      bacillus in wounds was practiced or modern tuberculin tests
      were employed. In nearly all of the later cases reported, the
      diagnosis has been established by the discovery of the
      bacilli in the inguinal abscesses, sometimes from the
      preputial ulcers. In the latter situation they must be
      carefully differentiated from smegma bacilli. That the
      infection spreads through the lymphatic system seems certain
      and early removal of the inguinal lymph-nodes would therefore
      appear to be the most important measure to be employed in
      checking the extension of the infection. To be successful
      this must of course be done early.</p>

      <p class="text1">In a very large proportion of the cases
      reported the first diagnosis made was syphilis, and the
      patients were treated for weeks and months by antisyphilitic
      measures without benefit and with loss of valuable time. It
      is my own belief that syphilis is less frequently acquired in
      this manner than is tuberculosis and the latter disease
      should be first suspected. With the modern means of diagnosis
      in tuberculosis the early recognition of these cases ought
      not to be difficult. While the number of reported instances
      of tuberculosis acquired through circumcision is considerable
      there must be a much larger number that have never found
      their way into literature. It is certain also that syphilis
      has been spread in this manner. <span class="yellow">These
      facts lead me to emphasize the statement made by the late
      Professor Maas, the German surgeon, that &ldquo;it is the
      duty of physician to raise his protest against the
      performance of ritualistic circumcision in every
      case.&rdquo;</span></p>
