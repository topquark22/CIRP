      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">C<span class="sc2">IRCUMCISION</span> is a
      very common procedure, called by some a &ldquo;social
      ritual&rdquo;,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> carried out on
      the male neonate in the Australian community. Doctors for
      some years have been discussing the advantages and
      disadvantages of this procedure. In the literature,
      especially in Australia, the various complications listed are
      haemorrhage, meatal ulcer, meatal stenosis, urethral fistula,
      phimosis, (if there is incomplete removal of the prepuce),
      and infection (mainly local). In the past four years at
      Princess Margaret Hospital, there have been four patients
      admitted for fulminating neonatal sepsis with meningitis
      after circumcision. (Three of the circumcisions were carried
      out in the hospital of delivery, and one was done in a
      general practitioner&rsquo;s surgery.) In all cases there was
      evidence of infected circumcision wounds with the same
      organism found in the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

      <h4>CASE 1</h4>

      <p class="text2">A male infant was circumcised on the fourth
      day of life. On admission to the hospital on the sixth day,
      he had three episodes of apnoea and stiffness consistent with
      a tonic convulsion. On examination, he was a pale irritable
      infant, his temperature was 38&middot;4&deg;C, his pulse rate
      was 160/min, and his respiration was 72/min. He had
      &ldquo;twitching&rdquo; movements and increased tone in all
      limbs. The circumcision site looked infected. A lumbar
      puncture yielded turbid cerebrospinal fluid, of which the
      white cell count was 25,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (polymorphs, 100%)
      the protein level was 5&middot;28 g/l. and the sugar level
      was zero. Gram-positive cocci were present on a smear. Later,
      beta haemolytic streptococcus Group B was grown from the
      cerebrospinal fluid. This organism was also cultured from the
      blood, the circumcision site and the umbilicus. Penicillin,
      chloramphenicol and sulphadimidine were administered. The
      infant had seizures for the next three days and was given
      anticonvulsants, phenobarb and paraldehyde. At follow-up, at
      the age of 31/2 years, his development was with normal
      limits.</p>

      <h4>CASE 2</h4>

      <p class="text2">At the age of five days, a male infant was
      circumcised. The next day he was pale and not feeding. On the
      seventh day of life he presented febrile, fitting and with a
      poor peripheral circulation. On admission to hospital he was
      a desperately ill infant with a temperature of more than
      45&deg;C, convulsions and cyanosis, a pulse rate of 180/min,
      and a respiration rate of 100/min. He was given diazepam
      (Valium) intravenously and cooled. His temperature fell to
      38.5&deg;C After the fits had ceased the child had prolonged
      apnoea, and required assisted ventilation. A lumbar puncture
      yielded turbid cerebrospinal fluid, whose protein level was 7
      g/l., glucose level was 1&middot;4 g/l., white cell count was
      9,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Gram-negative bacilli were seen and
      culture yielded <i>Escherichia coli</i>. <i>E. coli</i> was
      also was also isolated from penile, nasal and umbilical
      swabs. Despite gentamicin administered intrathecally and
      parenteral administration of ampicillin, gentamicin and
      anticonvulsants, the child continued to have fits. <span
      class="yellow">His condition deteriorated, and he died three
      days after admission to hospital.</span></p>

      <h4>CASE 3</h4>

      <p class="text2">A male infant was circumcised on the eighth
      day of life. Within 48 hours, he was lethargic and had
      increasing feeding problems. On the day of admission to
      hospital he was irritable and his mother had noticed a
      bulging fontanelle. On examination, he was found to be a
      slightly irritable infant, with a very full fontanelle, and
      the sutures were all splayed. The circumcision site was not
      healed and looked infected. A lumbar puncture yielded cloudy,
      cerebrospinal fluid of which the protein level was 1&middot;2
      g/l., the glucose level was 2&middot;1 mmol/l., the white
      cell count was 3,600/mm<sup>3</sup>, of which 84% were
      polymorphs) the red cell count was 20/mm<sup>3</sup>, and the
      culture yielded <i>Escherichia coli</i>. A urine speciment
      taken soon after treatment was commenced, revealed a white
      cell count of 3,700/mm<sup>3</sup>, and a red cell count of
      10/mm<sup>3</sup>. Gram-negative rods were seen, but the
      culture did not yield any growth. Gentamicin was administered
      both intrathecally and intramuscularly and ampicillin was
      administered intravenously. The infant made good progress.
      When he was last reviewed at the age of seven months, his
      development was normal.</p>

      <h4>CASE 4</h4>

      <p class="text2">A male infant was circumcised on the
      eleventh day of life, and the next day his parents noticed he
      was febrile, not feeding and crying. When he was examined, no
      abnormality was detected and no treatment was given. On the
      fourteenth day the infant presented with a persistence of
      poor feeding, held his head back and had a strange cry. On
      examination he was found to be an irritable staring child,
      with a high-pitched cry and full fontanelle, lying stiffly
      with head retracted. The circumcision site was swollen and
      red and looked infected. A lumbar puncture yielded cloudy
      cerebrospinal fluid of which the white cell count was
      312/mm<sup>3</sup> (of which 38% were polymorphs), the red
      cell count was 235/mm<sup>3</sup>, the protein count was
      4&middot;8 g/l. and the sugar level was 0.3 mmol/l.
      Gram-positive cocci were present on a smear. Counter immune
      electrophoresis of the cerebrospinal fluid, urine, throat,
      umbilicus and circumcision site yielded beta haemolytic
      streptococcus Group B. The infant was treated initially with
      penicillin and gentamicin and then just penicillin. On the
      evening of admission to hospital he had tonic and focal
      convulsions. Despite administration of phenobarb and diazepam
      (Valium), he had fits for four days. <span
      class="yellow">When he was reviewed at the age of five
      months, he was found to be an irritable baby with severe
      feeding problems, and showed signs of cerebral
      palsy.</span></p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text1">These four cases demonstrate a close
      association between the event of circumcision followed by
      local clinical infection resulting in septicaemia, and
      meningitis. In Case 3, although no organism was grown from
      the urine and peripheral sites, on microscopy examination the
      urine had a white cell count of 3,800-mm<sup>3</sup>, ad
      Gram-negative rods were seen. We believe this is
      circumstantial evidence that <i>E. coli</i> was present at
      the circumcision site which on admission to hospital was
      clinically infected. Although infection is a complication of
      circumcision, there is poor documentation in the literature
      of this topic. Most general practitioners are familiar with
      local infection, but not with the severe septicaemia that can
      result. Two cases of septicaemia associated with circumcision
      were reported by Birrell<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> in
      1965. Fredman<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> states, from the
      commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics and the
      Victorian Department of Health&rsquo;s neonatal death survey,
      that two babies in a 10-year period had died as a direct
      result of neonatal circumcision with post operative infection
      and septicaemia.</p>

      <p class="text1">In Melbourne, in 1969, Fredman found that
      about 70% of the male infants were circumcised. In Perth we
      checked with infant health centres to try to determine the
      frequency of circumcision. One survey was carried out in a
      suburb of relative socioeconomic affluence, and the other was
      of poorer socio-economic standing. Over the past two years
      about 60% and 30% respectively of the male infants were found
      to be circumcised. In view of the large number of infants
      circumcised, infection is therefore a rare complication.
      However, any elective procedure that may have such severe
      complications should be carefully considered. Of our cases,
      one infant died, one infant shows evidence of psychomotor
      retardation, and two infants appear normal, the elder being 3
      &frac12; years old.</p>

      <p class="text1">At various times it has been stated that
      circumcision prevents penile and cervical carcinoma. However,
      it appears that as long as adequate penile hygiene is carried
      out circumcision confers little protection. <sup><a
      href="#n3">3 4 5</a></sup> The report of the Ad-Hoc Task
      Force on Circumcision in the U.S.A. states:
      &ldquo;Circumcision is a surgical procedure that requires
      careful aseptic techniques, systematized postoperative
      observation and evaluation after discharge from the hospital.
      Prematurity, neonatal illness, any congenital anomaly
      (especially hypospadias) or bleeding problems are absolute
      contraindications to neonatal circumcision.&rdquo; These are
      principles with which we would concur.</p>

      <p class="text1">The late James Spence<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> wrote to a colleague: &ldquo;The
      anatomists have not studied the form and evolution of the
      preputial orifice . . . They do not understand that Nature
      does not intend it to be stretched or retracted. What looks
      like a pin point opening at 7 months will become a wide
      channel of communication at 17 . . . Nature is a possessive
      mistress and whatever mistakes she makes about the structure
      of the less essential organs such as the brain and stomach in
      which she is not much interested, you can be sure she knows
      best of the genital organs.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">Circumcision should not
      be the routine normal management for male newborn
      infants.</span> Our cases demonstrate one of the rare, but
      severe problems that may result.</p>
