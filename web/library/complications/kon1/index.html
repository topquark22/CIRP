      <p class="title">A RARE COMPLICATION FOLLOWING CIRCUMCISION:
      THE CONCEALED PENIS</p>

      <p class="source"><i>From the Department of Plastic and
      Reconstructive Surgery, <a href="http://www.vumc.nl/"
      target="_blank">Free University Hospital</a>, Amsterdam, The
      Netherlands</i></p>

      <p class="section">ABSTRACT</p>

      <p class="abstract">A case is reported of a concealed penis,
      a rare complication of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Serious complications of circumcision are
      unusual considering the frequency with which this operation
      is performed. The reported complication rate is 0.2 per cent.
      Hemorrhage and infections are encountered most frequently,
      followed by loss of penile skin, injury to the glans or
      penis, circumcision of unrecognized hypospadias, urethral
      fistula, necrosis of the glans or penis, laceration of penile
      or scrotal skin, preputial cysts, urinary retention and
      lymphedema or elephantiasis of the penile skin.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-12</a></sup> The case reported herein represents
      a rare complication following circumcision.</p>

      <p class="section">CASE REPORT</p>

      <p class="text2">A two year old Moroccan boy was referred to
      us because of a penile deformity and difficulty in urination.
      Circumcision had been done 2 months previously by a Moslem
      layman, specially &ldquo;trained&rdquo; in performing the
      operation. Soon thereafter the parents noticed that the penis
      had disappeared, although they were certain that it was not
      amputated during circumcision.</p>

      <center>
        <table width="302" summary="Figure one">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="kon1-fig1.gif" width="300" height="240"
            alt="Figure one." /><br />
             Fig. 1. Photograph 8 weeks after circumcision shows
            only thick hypertrophic ring of scar tissue and small
            central sinus.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Physical examination revealed a healthy,
      slightly adipose normal boy except for the external
      genitalia. The penis was not visible but palpation of the
      pubic area disclosed what appeared to be the shaft of the
      penis in the subcutaneous tissue. A thick hypertrophic ring
      of scar tissue surrounded a small sinus, making it impossible
      to find the urethral meatus (fig.1). The scrotum was normal
      and contained both testicles.</p>

      <center>
        <table width="302" summary="Figure two">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="kon1-fig2.gif" width="300" height="422"
            alt="Figure two." /><br />
             Fig. 2. <i>A</i>, after liberation of penis, penile
            shaft was covered by preputial skin. <i>B</i>, ventral
            surface of penis. Skin defect was closed using rotation
            flap (dotted line shows flap planning.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">With the patient under general anesthesia a
      vertical incision was made at the caudal side of the circular
      scar. The glans and penile shaft were found subcutaneously
      and were tightly adherent to the surrounding tissue. After
      excision of the hypertrophic scar and repositioning of the
      penis, sufficient skin was available to cover the penile
      shaft, except of a small area on the undersurface, which was
      closed by rotation of scrotal skin (fig. 2). Meatotomy was
      then performed for correction of a pinpoint meatus.</p>

      <p class="section">DISCUSSION</p>

      <p class="text2">Complications of circumcision are often
      overlooked or unreported. Probably the most ancient and
      widely performed operation for religious and medical reasons,
      circumcision is not only restricted to the medical
      profession. It is practiced by laymen in Jews, Moslems and
      different tribes in Africa, America and Australia. Due to a
      large community of foreign Moslems laborers in The
      Netherlands several Moslem laymen are practicing circumcision
      while traveling. Postoperative care is often minimal.</p>

      <p class="text2">During reconstruction in this case a
      combination of factors was noted to be involved. Removal of
      too much preputial skin and the tendency of the penis to
      retract in the fatty mons pubis, combined with contraction of
      the circular circumcision wound, forced the penis into a
      submerged position. The hypertrophic scar formation
      contributed to secure the glans during circumcision resulted
      in meatal stenosis. The concealed penis is a rather uncommon
      complication of circumcision, which is mainly due to poor
      technique and lack of experience.</p>
