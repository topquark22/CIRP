      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision is
      unquestionably the operation most frequently performed on
      males in the United States. The exact prevalence of the
      circumcised state in this country is unknown but must exceed
      90 per cent of males based on the incidence of circumcision
      reported in some newborn series and on the fact that some
      circumcisions are medically required during childhood and in
      adult life.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5,29,50</a></sup></font>. It is of interest that
      neonatal or prophylactic circumcision is much less common in
      other well-developed Western countries.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22,39,43</a></sup></font> Inasmuch as there is
      little difference in medical practice in these various
      countries, one must assume that there are some cultural
      differences that cause these disparities. It has been
      suggested that economic factors may affect the practice of
      circumcision, but recent studies on parental attitudes would
      tend to refute this hypothesis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n27">27,54</a></sup></font></p>

      <h3 align="center">PENILE DEVELOPMENT</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to
      review the normal development of the phallus to better
      understand both the circumcised and uncircumcised state.
      During the third month of intrauterine development (when the
      fetus is about 65 mm in size), a fold of skin develops at the
      base of the glans and begins to grow distally. This fold
      eventually becomes the prepuce. The dorsal aspect of the fold
      grows more rapidly than the ventral, so initially only the
      dorsum is covered. As the glanular urethra closes, so does
      the ventral prepuce. The resultant ventral fusion of the
      prepuce is marked by the frenulum. Preputial formation is
      usually complete by the fifth month of intrauterine life
      (fetus about 100mm).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> Once the glans is completely
      covered, the inner surface of the prepuce and epithelium of
      the glans itself, both of which are stratified squamous in
      type, fuse. Later in gestation, presumably under the presence
      of androgens,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> the squamous cells begin to
      keratinize and to arrange themselves in whorls.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> The whorled
      cells then degenerate so that clefts appear between the
      prepuce and the glans. These clefts increase in size and fuse
      with each other, as a result of which the inner preputial
      epithelium and the epithelium of the glans eventually are
      separated one from the other. This separation is usually
      incomplete at birth and continues through childhood.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> In infants
      and toddlers a mild, transient inflammatory reaction may
      occur at some stages of this separation process.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At birth the prepuce
      is retractable in only 4 per cent of boys. In almost half of
      newborn boys it cannot be retracted sufficiently to permit
      one to visualize even the external urethral meatus. By six
      months of age, the prepuce can be retracted in only 20 per
      cent of boys; by three years of age 10 per cent of boys still
      have an unretractable foreskin.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> However, the foreskin is
      completely retractable in almost all boys by 17 years of age.
      Complete separation of the foreskin from the underlying
      glans, even if the prepuce is partially retractable, has
      occurred in only 37 per cent of six-year-old boys.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></font> Smegma can
      be found in the preputial cavity in one per cent of
      uncircumcised six-year-old boys, but the presence of smegma
      increases so that it is demonstrable in about 8 per cent of
      uncircumcised 16-year-old boys.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because most males in
      the United States are circumcised, there is little
      opportunity to observe the natural history of the
      uncircumcised penis; several errors have crept into American
      medical practice as a result. For example, if one defines
      phimosis as only the inability to retract the foreskin, then
      obviously almost all males have phimosis. However, phimosis
      as so defined is a physiologic entity is of no pathologic
      consequence. If instead one were to redefine phimosis as the
      inability to retract the foreskin which result is
      balanoposthitis or obstructive uropathy, the incidence of
      phimosis at birth would be practically nil. Another error
      occurs when one attempts to examine the uncircumcised penis
      by drawing the skin of the shaft proximally (toward the
      penile base; a pinpoint opening is frequently noted, which
      would lead one to think that there was a true pathologic
      phimosis. However, if one were to draw the prepuce distally
      instead, one would see that the preputial opening is quite
      wide and could in no way interfere with voiding.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some physicians who
      have been denied the opportunity to observe the development
      of the uncircumcised penis are convince that the prepuce must
      be retractable at an early age. This leads to another error
      whereby the prepuce is forcibly freed from the glans in
      infancy.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup></font> This maneuver usually results
      in pain and bleeding, and occasionally in paraphimosis.
      Forcibly retraction is completely unnecessary because
      separation will occur physiologically without such maneuvers.
      In addition, these manipulations usually are fruitless unless
      they are repeated because the glans and the prepuce will
      rapidly adhere to each other if the glans is not sufficiently
      epithelialized. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that no
      special care is required for the uncircumcised penis. It is
      not necessary to retract the prepuce on any routine basis to
      promote retractability or to hasten physiologic separation.
      Once the prepuce has separated from the glans, the child
      should be encouraged to cleanse the area under his prepuce
      just as he is encouraged to wash behind his ears.</p>

      <h3 align="center">INDICATIONS</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are definite
      indications for circumcision but none of these are present in
      the newborn. True phimosis or paraphimosis are both
      indications for circumcision;<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup></font> however, the physiologic
      phimosis seen in the newborn and in the infant is not.
      Recurrent episodes of balanitis, one again, are an indication
      for circumcision, but posthitis alone is only a relative
      indication. Mild episodes of posthitis are often seen in
      infants and toddlers. While the child is in diapers, the
      prepuce may actually protect the glans from inflammation. In
      adults, the uncircumcised state is thought to promote the
      presence of cutaneous yeast but a recent study refutes
      this.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carcinoma of the
      penis can be largely prevented by neonatal circumcision;<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup></font> however the
      incidence of penile carcinoma in uncircumcised males is
      extremely low in most Western countries.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup></font> Using a
      life-table analysis Kochen and McCurdy have estimated the
      risk in uncircumcised males to be 1 in 600,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></font> Certainly
      neonatal circumcision is not totally protective as penile
      carcinoma has been reported in men who have been known to
      have been circumcised as infants.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9,40</a></sup></font> Because circumcision in the
      newborn is a prophylactic procedure, as one examines the
      arguments favoring circumcision one must conclude, as did the
      <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a>, that "there are no valid medical indications
      for circumcision in the neonate."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some
      definite contraindications to newborn circumcision. Any
      abnormality of the penis, in my opinion, is a definite
      contraindication until plans for treatment of the abnormality
      have been formulated. Such abnormalities would include
      hypospadias, epispadias, megalourethra, webbed penis, and any
      other condition in which prior circumcision renders treatment
      more difficult. Despite this, 36 per cent of newborn males
      with hypospadias were inadvertantly circumcised according to
      one recent study.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> Another contra-indication is
      any other illness in the newborn in which good medical
      judgement indicates that circumcision should be delayed, e.g.
      prematurity, bleeding diathesis, myelomeningocele, or
      imperforate anus.</p>

      <h3 align="center">METHODS OF CIRCUMCISION</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many
      methods of circumcision employed in modern practice. the goal
      of each is the same: to remove enough shaft skin and inner
      preputial epithelium that the glans is sufficiently uncovered
      to prevent or treat phimosis and to render the development of
      paraphimosis impossible. It is important to understand the
      principles common to all forms of circumcision in order to
      prevent complications, regardless of the method employed.
      Additionally, it is important to recognize the pitfalls of
      each individual method. Although many of the methods are not
      employed in urologic practice, I describe them herein because
      the urologist often will be faced with their
      complications.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are four
      principles common to all forms of circumcision, and it is the
      compliance with these principles that allows for circumcision
      without complications. These principles are asepsis, adequate
      but not excessive excision of outer and inner preputial
      layers, hemostasis, and cosmesis. Strict asepsis is a
      principle that is almost uniformly adhered to in theory.
      However in practice it probably is violated frequently,
      especially in neonatal circumcision. Because inoculated
      wounds only occasionally become frankly infected, violation
      of this principle often results in no harm. The likelihood
      that adequate amounts of outer and inner preputial layers
      will be excised varies according to the method chosen.
      Circumcision methods can be classified into one of four types
      or combinations thereof: dorsal slit, shield, clamp, and
      excision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dorsal slit is common
      to many techniques and occasionally is used alone, especially
      in the presence of acute inflammation. Dorsal slit prevents
      both phimosis and paraphimosis but usually is cosmetically
      unacceptable.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shield is used
      routinely in ritual circumcision. In this technique the glans
      is forced down by a grooved shield that is placed over the
      stretched prepuce. The excess prepuce is excised and
      hemostasis is secured. The inner preputial layer must then be
      folded back off the glans to ensure full exposure of the
      glans after healing. The Mogen clamp uses this principle.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other clamps have
      been developed primarily for use in neonatal
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></font> The <a
      href="/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco clamp</a> and the <a
      href="/library/procedure/plastibell/">Plastibell</a> are the
      most widely used. When such clamps are employed, a dorsal
      slit usually is performed and the glans is freed from the
      inner preputial lining. A bell is placed over the glans and
      the prepuce is drawn through a ring. Hemostasis is secured by
      pressure between the ring and the bell. Excess prepuce is
      excised and the bell is removed.</p>

      <p>Surgical excision can be accomplished either by dorsal
      slit and excision of all tissue distal to the coronal sulcus
      or by a sleeve technique in which a sleeve of tissue is
      removed distal to the corona. These methods are the only ones
      in which sutures are routinely used to coapt skin edges and
      ensure primary wound healing.</p>

      <h3 align="center">COMPLICATIONS</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact incidence
      of complications is unknown. In one series of consecutive
      circumcisions, 9.5 per cent of patients had repeated
      circumcisions for inadequately performed initial
      operations.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup></font> In that same series, 38 per
      cent of patients sustained complications.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup></font> In three
      series surveyed retrospectively, the incidence of
      complications ranged from 1.5 per cent to 5 per cent.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n21">21,43</a></sup></font> and some
      patients required readmission to hospital for treatment of
      their complications or for repeat operations. One per cent of
      all circumcisions in McCarthy's series required repetition
      because they were inadequate.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup></font> Additionally, Fredman
      mentions two deaths as a direct result of sepsis from
      neonatal circumcision during a 10-year period.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup></font> Deaths under
      similar circumstances have been noted as isolated case
      reports elsewhere in the literature<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12,37,60</a></sup></font>. Suffice to say that
      circumcision, like any other surgical procedure, is
      accompanied by both morbidity and mortality that should be
      considered when risks and benefits of the operation are
      discussed.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Intraoperative Complications</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Bleeding.</b> A
      complication inherent in any surgical procedure is bleeding.
      The reported incidence of bleeding after circumcision varies
      from 0.1 per cent to 35 per cent.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21-23,29,55,62</a></sup></font> It is most
      unusual for bleeding to be of significant magnitude to
      require transfusion. Ancillary pharmacologic means that have
      been utilized to control bleeding after circumcision include
      the topical application of thrombin, silver nitrate, or
      epinephrine,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> as well as the injection of
      epinephrine into the wound. Epinephrine, if used should be in
      an extremely dilute solution (e.g., 1:100,000) as it can be
      absorbed from the open wound and produce marked
      cardiovascular effects: additionally, more concentrated
      solutions of epinephrine may produce local tissue
      ischemia.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Removal of
      Tissue.</b> Circumcision lends itself to errors of omission
      and commission in that both insufficient and excess tissue
      can be removed. Several different problems may result
      depending on which combination of circumstances is extant.
      The simplest problem is cosmetic only. When insufficient skin
      and inner preputial epithelium are removed and the new
      preputial orifice does not fibrose, the cosmetic appearance
      is such that the penis does not appear to have been
      circumcised.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup></font> Although this result poses no
      medical threat, the affected individuals parents often are
      quite upset with the result. In one study, 39 per cent of men
      who stated that they were circumcised, on examination had
      had, in the opinion of the examiners, an incomplete
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If insufficient skin
      and insufficient inner preputial epithelium have been
      removed, and in addition, there is contraction or fibrosis of
      the preputial ring, true phimosis can be produced. This
      occurred in 2 per cent of patients in one series.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></font> This
      complication often can be severe and may result in urinary
      obstruction.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another variation of
      these complications of omission and commission is the
      concealed penis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11,41,62,66,69</a></sup></font> In this instance,
      an excess of skin is removed from the penile shaft while not
      enough of the inner preputial epithelium has been removed.
      The new preputial orifice is distal to the tip of the penis
      and it fibroses so that as healing occurs, the penile shaft
      is forced into the suprapubic fat and the stenotic preputial
      ring that results lies at, or just above, the abdominal skin
      level. If excess skin is excised from the shaft and a proper
      amount of inner preputial epithelium is excised, the
      resultant penis may be foreshortened and require skin
      grafting at a later date.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> If there is sufficient
      tension on the wound, it may separate.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> In my opinion, the wound is
      best left to heal by secondary intent as the result usually
      is cosmetically and functionally normal. However, a short
      penis may result and, if so, skin grafting may be required as
      as a secondary procedure.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevention of all of
      these errors of omission and commission is best achieved by
      marking the site of the corona on the skin surface prior to
      any incision and by completely freeing the inner preputial
      epithelium from the glans and thereby visualizing completely
      the coronal sulcus before before applying any clamp or
      excising any tissue. Treatment of any problems that result
      because insufficient prepuce has been excised requires repeat
      circumcision. When phimosis exists with a concealed penis,
      the initial incision for this circumcision should be
      circumferential and at the preputial ring so that the excess
      inner preputial epithelium can be used in the repair. By
      using this type of incision rather than a dorsal slit, one
      may be able to avoid the need to use skin grafts for coverage
      of the penile shaft.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> In the treatment of those
      cases in which excess skin has been excised and skin grafts
      are necessary, the use of free full thickness grafts of
      hairless skin or split thickness skin grafts<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></font> is
      preferable to burying the penile shaft in the scrotum or
      under the abdominal wall with delayed removal<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup></font> and use of
      scrotal skin because the former technique produces superior
      cosmesis.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Postoperative Complications</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Skin Bridge.</b>
      Another adverse result of circumcision is the formation of a
      skin bridge between the penile shaft and the glans.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup></font> Smegma often
      accumulates under those skin bridges. Additionally these
      bridges may either tether the erect penis, with resultant
      pain or penile curvature. The treatment of such bridges is
      simple surgical division. How such problems arise is not
      completely clear. Some investigators have suggested that
      injury to the glans at time of circumcision, with resultant
      fusion to the circumcision wound is the genesis of this
      problem. In my opinion there must be, in addition, incomplete
      separation of the inner preputial epithelium at the time of
      circumcision so that there is firm fusion of skin, inner
      preputial epithelium, and glans at one point. Later, there is
      spontaneous separation of the inner preputial epithelium from
      the glans as normally occurs in the uncircumcised penis, but
      because one point is fixed to the glans, a skin bridge
      results. If this thesis is correct, this complication could
      be avoided by completely freeing the inner preputial
      epithelium from the glans at the time of circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Infection.</b>
      Infections occur after circumcision, as in any surgical
      procedure. The incidence of infection in one series of
      neonatal circumcisions was 0.4 per cent,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> while in a
      series of older boys it was as high as 10 per cent.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></font> Presumably,
      most of these infections are minor and of no consequence.
      However, major morbidity has been reported, including major
      skin loss,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup></font> necrotizing fascitis,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup></font>
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> Fournier's gangrene,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup></font> generalized
      sepsis,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></font>
      and meningitis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup></font> Some of these complications
      have resulted in severe permanent disability or death.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12,60</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Urinary
      retention.</b> Urinary retention has been reported following
      circumcision, usually secondary to a tight circular bandage,
      and obviously is best treated by removal of the bandage.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7,20,23,28,62</a></sup></font> In
      addition, urinary retention secondary to a tight bandage
      presumably sets the stage for urosepsis in some of the
      reported cases of systemic infection following
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28,47</a></sup></font>. When tincture of benzoin
      is used in or as a dressing for circumcision, it may occlude
      the urethral meatus and produce urinary retention.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> Hesitancy
      and dysuria are seen following circumcision in as many as 60
      percent of older boys.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Meatitis.</b>
      Meatitis or meatal ulcer is a consequence of circumcision
      that may be considered a complication. The reported incidence
      of meatitis with or without ulcer varies between 8 and 31 per
      cent<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13,37,44,55</a></sup></font> and usually occurs
      later in the first year of life, but while the child is still
      in diapers.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meatitis and meatal
      ulcer are rarely, if ever, seen in the uncircumcised boy.
      Meatal stenosis is far more common in circumcised adult men
      than in uncircumcised adult men<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> and is believed to result from
      meatitis in infancy.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Chordee.</b>
      Chordee can be produced by circumcision, especially if the
      procedure is performed at the time of acute
      inflammation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> This chordee usually is
      produced by a dense scar on the ventrum of the penis, and a
      Z-plasty often suffices for its resolution.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Cysts.</b>
      Inclusion cysts in the circumcision line have been
      reported.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31,62</a></sup></font> These presumably are
      produced by the rolling in of epidermis at the time of
      circumcision or perhaps by the implantation of smegma in the
      circumcision wound. Some of these cysts may grow to rather
      large proportions. Even small cysts can become infected and
      prove a source of morbidity. The treatment is obviously
      surgical excision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Lymphedema.</b>
      Penile lymphedema may occur following circumcision especially
      if the wound separates or becomes infected.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></font> The
      treatment of this complication must be individualized, but
      skin grafting may be required for resolution.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fistulas.</b>
      Urethrocutaneous fistulas have been reported following
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11,36,38,42,62</a></sup></font> Most have
      occurred with a clamp or a Plastibell type of circumcision,
      but in many such instances sutures were also utilized in the
      area of the frenulum for control of hemorrhage. Presumably,
      these fistulas occur either because the urethra is actually
      pulled into and crushed by the circumcision clamp or because
      the urethra is actually incised either with a knife or as
      suture placed for hemostasis. The prevention of this
      complication lies in the operators visualizing exactly what
      is being done in the course of a circumcision. In a few
      patients an unrecognized congenital megalourethra has been
      directly incised resulting in fistula.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></font> Obviously, as was stated
      earlier, any penile abnormality is reason to delay
      circumcision; by heeding this caveat one can avoid creating a
      fistula in the patient with megolourethra.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Necrosis.</b>
      Necrosis and slough of the glans or even entire penis has
      been reported following circumcision. Distal ischemia
      producing such tissue loss may result from infection,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> from the use
      of solutions containing epinephine, from vigorous attempts at
      hemostasis with suture or cautery,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></font> from the prolonged use of a
      tourniquet, or from a tight bandage.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></font> Necrosis is particularly
      likely to result if cautery is applied directly to a
      circumcision clamp (e.g., the Gomco). When the entire penis
      is lost following such a misadventure, it usually is best to
      change the child's sex of rearing to female. Such changes are
      particularly successful when accomplished before 18 months of
      age.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup></font>
      Surgical reconstruction along female lines is far simpler and
      eminently more satisfactory in such circumstances than is
      reconstruction of a phallus.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Hypospadias and
      Epispadias.</b> Both hypospadias and epispadias have
      inadvertently been produced during circumcision by splitting
      the glans penis at the time of dorsal or ventral split
      preparatory to actual excision of the prepuce.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup></font> The operator
      can prevent this complication by visualizing what is done
      rather than by performing some aspect of the procedure
      blindly. On rare occasions the penile or scrotal skin has
      been inadvertently lacerated.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23,47</a></sup></font> These lacerations probably
      result from carelessness but rarely are of any consequence.
      On occasion, the tip of the glans has been excised, usually
      when the operator was using a blind technique.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Complications of
      Plastibell.</b> When the Plastibell is utilized, the ring of
      the bell may migrate and by pressure necrosis produce a set
      of problems unique to this technique. If the ring may migrate
      and by pressure necrosis produce a set of problems unique to
      this technique. If the ring is too large it may migrate
      proximally and produce a groove in the shaft itself.<font
      size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n14">14,23,30,45,59,73</a></sup></font> To avoid such
      complications, any retained Plastibell ring should be removed
      after several days if it has not fallen off
      spontaneously.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Impotence.</b>
      Impotence has been reported following circumcision in
      adults.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n26">26,64</a></sup></font>. In two instances this
      complication was caused by injection of anesthetic agent into
      the corpora.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psychosocial
      issues.</b> Circumcision in the adult may precipitate, or be
      a part of, psychotic delusional behavior.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4,19</a></sup></font> One may
      detect such psychiatric problems preoperatively by carefully
      scrutinizing the motives leading the a.symptomatic adult to
      seek circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It recently has been
      reported that a subset of the homosexual male population is
      greatly disturbed by the state of being circumcised, to the
      extent that they have requested and actually have undergone,
      uncircumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></font> Just as with undiversion, the
      trend away from routine neonatal circumcision may result in
      even fewer uncircumcisions than are currently performed.
      Uncircumcision is not a new operation but has been present
      since antiquity, its purpose usually being to obliterate
      signs of religious identifications.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Anesthetic
      Complications.</b> Lastly, the anesthetic or lack thereof,
      may produce complications. General anesthesia led to deaths
      related to circumcision in at least one study.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></font> Caudal
      anesthesia is currently being employed in some centers,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></font> and its use,
      like the use of all regional anesthetics has its own inherent
      complications. When local anesthetic agents are injected into
      the corpora cavernosa, they can injure the tissues, producing
      impotence as previously noted.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font> Additionally, idiosyncratic
      reactions and overdosages can occur. Solutions containing
      epinephrine may produce local tissue problems or systemic
      toxicity.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font>
      The performance of neonatal circumcision without anesthesia
      produces decreased Po<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup></font> increased
      serum cortisol, and withdrawal,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> all indirect evidence of
      pain. Additionally, circumcision without anesthesia in a
      newborn has precipitated a pneumothorax.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></font></p>

      <h3 align="center">SUMMARY</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, there are
      multiple complications that can occur following circumcision,
      ranging from the insignificant to the tragic. Virtually all
      of these complications are preventable with only a modicum of
      care. Unfortunately, most such complications occur at the
      hands of inexperienced operators who are neither urologists
      nor surgeons. However, it usually will fall to the urologist
      to consult in the management of these complications and to
      repair such problems as they arise.</p>
