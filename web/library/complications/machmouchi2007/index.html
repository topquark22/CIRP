      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p><b>Background:</b> Circumcision is the most frequently
      performed procedure in male children. Aim: The aim of the
      study was to compare the outcome of circumcision performed in
      the early neonatal period and circumcision performed at 5
      months of age. Setting of the study was the King Faisal
      Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Jeddah, Saudi
      Arabia.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> The study was performed as a prospective
      cohort study.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> A total of 350 infants were enrolled. 250
      neonates were circumcised at the age of 1 to 4 days (early
      group) and 100 infants underwent circumcision at the age of 5
      months (late group). A bone cutter was used for 50 neonates,
      a Gomco clamp in another 50 neonates, and a Plastibell in the
      remaining 250 cases (150 in the early group and 100 in the
      late group). Complications including meatal deformities,
      meatal stenosis, adhesions and infection were more frequent
      and more significant in the neonatal circumcision group.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> From our study, circumcision at 5
      months results in significantly fewer serious complications
      than circumcision in the neonatal period, irrespective of the
      method used. Therefore, neonatal circumcision should not be
      recommended.</p>
