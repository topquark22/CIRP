      <h1>Necrotizing fasciitis after Plastibell circumcision</h1>

      <p><b><i>David P. Bliss, Jr., MD, Patrick J. Healey, MD, and
      John H. T. Waldhausen, MD</i></b></p>

      <blockquote>
        Necrotizing fasciitis is a potentially life-threatening
        infection of subcutaneous tissues and Scarpa's fascia that
        rarely affect neonates. We report the occurrence of this
        devastating infection in two neonates after routine
        Plastibell circumcision. These case reports highlight the
        presentation and management of this complication after a
        relatively routine and frequently performed operation. This
        report also emphasizes the differences between cellulitis
        and necrotizing fasciitis and suggests strategies for
        management. (J Pediatr 1997;131:459-462)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical
      emergency resulting from infection of the subcutaneous tissue
      and superficial fascia by a variety of bacteria. In the
      neonatal age group it may have a mortality rate greater than
      70%<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Successful treatment
      requires accurate diagnosis with early and aggressive
      debridement of the involved tissue, broad-spectrum
      intravenous antibiotic coverage, and intensive support care.
      We report two cases in newborn male infants in whom
      necrotizing fasciitis developed after Plastibell (Hollister,
      Libertyville, Ill.) circumcision. These cases illustrate the
      devastating nature of this type of infection and show how
      aggressive treatment can lead to a satisfactory outcome.</p>

      <h4><i>Case 1</i></h4>

      <p class="text2">A term, 10-day-old infant was brought to the
      hospital for evaluation of tenderness and swelling involving
      his penis, scrotum, and lower abdomen 2 days after he had
      undergone Plastibell circumcision. The baby was febrile with
      erythema, edema, and tenderness involving the lower abdomen,
      genitalia, and perineum. The leukocyte count was 27,000
      cells/cm<sup>3</sup>. He was hospitalized with the diagnosis
      of cellulitis and received intravenous ampicillin and
      gentamicin therapy. Despite antibiotic treatment there was
      little change in his condition during the subsequent 24
      hours. The patient was transferred to Children's Hospital and
      Medical Center (CHMC) the following day because of his
      worsening clinical course and uncertainty about the
      diagnosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">On arrival at CHMC, the baby appeared to be
      in stable condition hemodynamically. His axillary temperature
      was 36.0&deg; C with a heart rate of 170 beats/min and a
      blood pressure of 80/60 mm Hg. An examination revealed
      induration, erythema, and exquisite tenderness involving the
      lower abdomen, inner thighs, penis, scrotum, and remainder of
      the perineum (Fig. 1). Intravenous administration of
      clindamycin was added to the antibiotic regimen and he was
      taken immediately to the operating room with the diagnosis of
      necrotizing fasciitis. Radical debridement of the infected
      tissues was required, including the skin and Scarpa's fascia
      of the lower abdominal wall, inferior to the umbilicus, both
      inguinal areas, the entire scrotum, and skin of the penile
      shaft to the corona. The glans and corpora were not affected.
      The dissection left the spermatic cords and testicles
      exposed, but the tunica vaginalis remained intact (Fig. 2).
      The wound was treated with wet to dry dressings in the infant
      ICU. Two additional operative debridements were required to
      remove all infected tissue. The extent of the resection was
      guided by presence of tissue edema and the demonstration of
      polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and necrosis on frozen
      section examination. Seven hyperbaric oxygen treatments
      supplemented the surgical debridement. <span

      <i>Staphyloccus</i> and tissue cultures yielded
      <i>Klesiella</i> spp. and coagulase-negative
      <i>Staphylococcus</i>.</span> The antibiotic regiment was
      altered to vancomycin, gentamycin and clindamycin and
      continued for 14 days.</p>

      <p class="text2">Five days after the final debridement,
      sterilized pigskin allograft coverage was applied and changed
      every 3 to 5 days for 2 weeks, when split-thickness grafts
      were performed. The spermatic cords had become foreshortened
      with the testes lying atop the abdominal wall at the level of
      the external inguinal rings. The patient initially did not
      receive oral food and was maintained by parenteral
      alimentation because of the concern of fecal contamination of
      the graft bed. After resuming an enteral diet. The patient
      was discharged approximately 1 month after admission to
      CHMC.</p>

      <h4><i>Case 2</i></h4>

      <p class="text2">A term, newborn male infant underwent
      Plastibell circumcision on day 1 of life and was noted to
      have a pustule on the scrotum 2 days later. This area became
      hemorrhagic and the erythema and induration then rapidly
      spread to the lower abdominal wall (Fig. 3). Because of the
      concern of the necrotizing soft tissue infection, the child
      received ampicillin and clindamycin and was transferred to
      CHMC. On presentation at CHMC, the child was in
      hemodynamically stable condition, but had a platelet count of
      only 30,000 cells cm<sup>3</sup> and a leukocyte count of
      26,700 cells cm<sup>3</sup>. His heart rate was 120 beats
      min, blood pressure was 84/48 mm. Hg. and his temperature was
      36.1&deg; C. He had induration extending into the inguinal
      area and medial thigh on the right, with an erythematous
      swollen scrotum and penile shaft. The circumcision site was
      swollen with areas of necrosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Necrotizing fasciitis was diagnosed and the
      patient was taken immediately to the operating room where he
      underwent debridement of the involved tissue. <span
      class="yellow">Tissue cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus,
      Staphylococcus epiderm, and gram negative rods.</span> He was
      treated with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin for 10
      days in the infant ICU. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was
      administered four times and the child received
      split-thickness skin grafts 6 days after the initial surgical
      debridement. He was discharged from the hospital 14 days
      after admission.</p>

      <h3>D<span class="scsection">ISCUSSION</span></h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision has few significant
      complications.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Gee and
      Ansell<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> published 10-year review
      of more than 5500 circumcisions, comparing the Gomco clamp
      (Allied Health Products, Gomco Division, St. Louis, Mo) with
      the Plastibell device. They observed that infection was the
      second most common complication after bleeding. All of these
      infections responded to the use of topical or intravenous
      antibiotics and none was diagnosed as necrotizing fasciitis.
      The reason for the increased rate of infection with the
      Plastibell device is unclear,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      but may be related to the necrosis and sloughing of tissue
      required with this type of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Necrotizing fasciitis is in the neonate is
      uncommon and may resemble cellulitis at presentation. The
      diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is often delayed but the
      infection can be devastating if not treated promptly and
      appropriately.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Necrotizing
      fasciitis of the genitalia (Fournier gangrene) is even more
      rare. In 1980 Woodside<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      described a patient who underwent Plastibell circumcision and
      experienced necrotizing fasciitis but in the 15 years since
      that report no other similar complications have been cited in
      the literature. Since then however various types of
      necrotizing soft tissue infections have become more commonly
      recognized in the pediatric age group,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> and it is essential for physicians who
      perform any type of surgical procedure to be able to
      recognize this life-threatening infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Necrotizing fasciitis and simple cellulitis
      usually may be differentiated on the basis of clinical signs
      and symptoms.<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup>. Both simple
      cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis may present with
      erythema and induration; however, any surgical wound
      occurring with these symptoms should be evaluated carefully
      for evidence of necrotizing soft tissue infection. Changes to
      the soft tissues such as edema, skin blistering, or frank
      necrosis are late changes. The proper diagnosis should be
      suspected and often recognized before these findings. The
      pain caused by necrotizing fasciitis is very severe, out of
      proportion to the apparent physical findings. Although it is
      not specific, tachycardia is a sensitive indicator and should
      prompt an urgent evaluation for necrotizing soft tissue
      infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">An elevated leukocyte count may be noted in
      both necrotizing fasciitis and simple cellulitis. In a larger
      study of 18 patients with necrotizing fasciitis caused by
      chickenpox, we determined that an elevated band count of
      greater than 5% is a more specific indicator of necrotizing
      fasciitis.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Any patient who
      has wound erethema, induration, and pain in conjunction with
      tachycardia and an elevated leukocyte or band count should
      have immediate surgical evaluation because of the possibility
      of necrotizing fasciitis and the need for operative
      debridement.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The treatment for necrotizing fasciitis must
      include broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and surgical
      debridement. Because these patients may become extremely ill,
      they frequently require ICU care. Broad spectrum antibiotics
      because necrotizing fasciitis is often a mixed infection, as
      illustrated by these case reports in which tissue cultures
      grow both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The
      initial therapeutic plan generally should presume involvement
      of a mixed infection and the antibiotic coverage should
      include coverage for gram-positive, gram-negative, and
      anaerobic organisms. We have chosen to treat patients with
      suspected or confirmed necrotizing fasciitis with an
      aminoglycoside for gram-negative coverage. Clindamycin is
      used for anaerobic coverage because in addition to its
      anaerobic spectrum, it has additive benefits in the coverage
      of group A <i>Streptococcus</i>, which in the past decade has
      become a more prevalent cause of necrotizing soft tissue
      infections.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Once the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis
      is suspected, a surgical evaluation should be obtained and
      surgical exploration performed. If operative evidence of
      necrotizing fasciitis exists, immediate surgical debridement
      of all involved tissue is required. Postoperatively, these
      patients should be monitored for possible extension of
      disease and the need for further debridement. In cases that
      are not clear, close and frequent reexamination of the wound
      is needed. Frozen section biopsy at the bedside or in the
      operating theater may be used for a diagnostic
      adjunct.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> The efficacy of
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy is uncertain. <span
      class="yellow">Aggressive surgical debridement and intensive
      ICU support may afford survival in these patients, although
      the mortality rate in the neonatal age group remains high.
      Early diagnosis and rapid, aggressive treatment are keys to a
      successful outcome.</span></p>
