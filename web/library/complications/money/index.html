        <h2>ADULT PENILE CIRCUMCISION: EROTOSEXUAL<br />
         AND COSMETIC SEQUELAE</h2>
        <b>John Money and Jackie Davison</b><br />
      </center>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Five men underwent circumcision in
        adulthood for reasons of infection, inflammation, or
        phimosis. Several years later, they reported on the
        erotosexual sequalae. All reported a prolongation of the
        period prior to ejaculation, though none had been genuine
        premature ejaculators. Other variable sequalae were
        diminished penile sensitivity, less penile gratification,
        more penile pain, and cosmetic deformity. Orgasm frequency
        was the same or less, and there was not postsurgical
        impotence. Loss of stretch receptors and reflexes might
        explain the major erotosexual changes. In most instances, a
        dorsal cut and/or antibiotic treatment achieves the same
        effect as circumcision, and is less risky in terms of
        possible pathological sequelae.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision, though a surgical
      procedure possessed of its own morbidity and mortality
      statistics, is as widely taken for granted as a haircut. Even
      in the current era of criticism of health costs, failure to
      get a second surgical opinion, routine hysterectomy and other
      unnecessary operations, scarcely a criticism is leveled at
      routine circumcision which, in almost 100% of cases, serves
      no health purpose. (Wallerstein, 1980). Until a little more
      than a century ago, American males kept their foreskins. The
      change in favor of circumcision had its origin in the 18th
      medical theory of degeneracy (de'ge'ne'rescence) which
      replaced demonic possession theory. Masturbation was decreed
      to be the prime cause of degeneracy both it oneself and ones
      pedigree - the sin of the father visited upon the children
      for generations to come. As the masturbation heresy escalated
      into a disease, it became fashionable to prescribe
      circumcision (and also clitoridectomy in girls) as the cure,
      and then as a prevention.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since a heresy needs no proof, no data were
      assembled on the effects of circumcision on either
      masturbation or other variables of erotosexual function.
      Instead as the 20th century progressed, non-sexual
      rationalizations of the practice of circumcision, such as the
      prevention of cervical cancer in wives, were propounded - and
      still quoted despite evidence to the contrary (Wallerstein,
      1980, Wiener, Note 1). In consequence, there continues to be
      a gap in knowledge concerning what circumcision does to the
      erotosexual function of the penis. It is a gap that becomes
      increasingly difficult to close, for there are relatively few
      adult men with a foreskin who underwent circumcision and who
      are prepared to give a before-and-after report on how it
      affected them erotosexually.</p>

      <p class="text2">The purpose of this paper is to present data
      on five men who were circumcised in adulthood for reasons of
      infection, inflammation, or phimosis. Five is a small number
      on which to base a research publication, but it is better
      than none at all, since the topic is of sexological
      importance, and funding for enlargement of the sample
      unlikely.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Method</b></p>

      <p class="text2">The sample is one of convenience; hence, the
      preliminary nature of this report. The five men ranged in age
      from 19 to 41 years when circumcised, and from 32 to 47 years
      when interviewed. A schedule of inquiry was designed
      specifically for this interview. It was administered orally,
      tape recorded, and transcribed. The transcript was indexed,
      and the data abstracted and coded as required for the
      findings, below.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Results</b></p>

      <p class="text2">In all five cases, the man was able, after
      circumcision, to hold back longer before having an orgasm. As
      a corollary, if formerly he might have had a problem with
      "coming too soon," it was less. These changes were regarded
      by none of the men as a disadvantage, by one a positive
      improvement, and by the other four as no major consequence.
      Since none of the four had a clinical history of premature
      ejaculation, it is evident that these findings neither
      support nor refute circumcision as a treatment for premature
      ejaculation. However, the majority of American premature
      ejaculators were circumcised in infancy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Penis sensitivity was rated as diminished by
      four of the men and the fifth regarded his penis as more
      sensitive to abrasive as well as erotic stimuli. Penile pain
      increase (2 cases) in one case was attributed by the patient
      as his physician to the removal of too much foreskin, and in
      the other to scar tissue near the corona.</p>

      <p class="text2">The self-rating of gratification was
      consistent across all modes of erotic stimulation. Individual
      variation could not be attributed to any variable beyond
      subjective experience. Orgasm frequency remained unchanged
      except for the one man who had the most severe side effects,
      including pain, consequent upon the removal of too much
      foreskin. There were no cases of impotence prior to
      circumcision and no development of impotence
      subsequently.</p>

      <p class="text2">In four of the cases, it would be more
      accurate to say that the foreskin had been shortened rather
      than totally removed. In the fifth case, not only was the
      foreskin taken, but the upper part of the penile shaft was
      denuded also, not leaving enough loose skin to cover the
      penis in erection. In consequence, the hair bearing skin from
      the mons pubis, above, and from the scotal junction below,
      was dragged along the shaft of the penis about two-thirds of
      the way toward the glans.</p>

      <p class="text2">Partial foreskin removal may heal with a
      ragged edge. There were three such cases, in one of which the
      man was cosmetically offended by the appearance of his penis.
      The cosmetic problem was a serious one also for the man whose
      penis may be too much denuded.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Removal of the entire foreskin, or even part
      of it, may require a change in masturbatory technique,
      insofar as there is less or no redundant skin to be stretched
      forward or backward. Thus, there needs to be more reliance on
      some other surface, for example, the lubricated skin of the
      fingers or palm, to provide ether rotary or longitudinal
      friction directly to the shaft of the penis. <span
      class="yellow">What has been lost in circumcision is the
      stretch effect and hypothetically, receptors that provide
      proprioceptive stretch sensation from the foreskin. Inside
      the vagina, the penis must move in and out in the fashion of
      a finger, rather than being sometimes able, like the head of
      a turtle to pull in and out of the carapuce of its own
      foreskin, while the pubococcygeal muscles at the vaginal
      entrance grip the lower part of the shaft.</span> Stretch
      sensations may be additionally altered if the frenulum is
      severed in the circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Cosmetics becomes a
      problem when the body image is involved, and that may affect
      the entire sense of wellbeing, work capability included, as
      well as erotosexual bonding and family life.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">The erotosexual gains of circumcision, if
      any, are restricted to taking longer to achieve orgasm which
      is, hypothetically, secondary to diminished sensory input
      from stretch receptors in the less mobile skin of the shaft
      of the penis, as well as loss of foreskin stretch receptors.
      For those who find this change an improvement, it is possible
      that it could be achieved by masturbatory and/or coital
      training in coital delay, instead. The same effect could be
      achieved also, if requested, by more conservative penile
      surgery, namely the dorsal slit. According to the urologist,
      Rainer Engel (personal communication), the dorsal slit
      procedure would achieve the same effect as circumcision in
      almost all cases requiring surgical intervention. Some cases
      of infection could be treated by antibiotics alone.</p>

      <p class="text2">Either method avoids the hazards of
      circumcision which are indicated in even so few as five
      cases, none of which was selected because of adverse
      post-surgical effects. In one case, the adverse effects were
      very serious and will require additional surgery to attempt
      correction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is an operation that needs to
      be resorted to rarely. It should be done with specific
      attention to cosmetic and erotosexual outcome, neither of
      which were so much as mentioned to the five men of this
      study, so that they had not chance to give their truly
      informed consent to the risk of negative cosmetic and
      erotosexual results and the possibility of mutilation.
      Erotosexually and cosmetically, the operation is, for the
      most part, contraindicated, and it should always be evaluated
      in terms of possible pathological sequelae.</p>
