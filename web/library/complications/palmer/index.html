      <h2>Impotence Following Anesthesia for Elective
      Circumcision</h2>

      <p class="2">John M. Palmer, MD, Daniel Link, MD</p>

      <p>SEXUAL impotence is a distressing problem in any age
      group. Acquired impotence occurs rarely after massive pelvic
      trauma but otherwise results from extirpative surgery for a
      malignant neoplasm. In the young, sexually active male,
      unexpected impotence is catastrophic. We recently observed
      two young men, both of whom were rendered impotent apparently
      by local anesthesia for elective circumcision.</p>

      <p class="3"><b>Patients and Methods</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Case 1.</b> -- In
      November 1976 a 24-year-old man was seen who had a loss of
      sexual potency since an elective circumcision performed 18
      months previously. His erections were normal at the base and
      the glans but flaccid in the distal part of the shaft and of
      insufficient quality to allow penetration. There were no
      abnormalities diagnosed by examination of the phallus.
      Photographs taken by the patient at the time of sexual
      excitement were consistent with his description. Findings
      remainder of the physical examination were normal. Corpus
      cavernography was obtained, which demonstrated total
      obstruction to filling at the distal penile shaft bilaterally
      (Fig 1). Fibrosis and contracture of the distal corpera were
      surgically confirmed.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Case 2.</b> -- A
      robust 23-year-old construction worker was first seen in June
      1977 for impotence of three months duration. Immediately
      after elective circumcision, this patient noted a hard
      painless lump in the distal right penile shaft. This
      abnormality had remained constant in size despite sitz baths,
      attempts at needle aspiration, and finally steroid
      injections. The mass was firm, painless, easily palpable, and
      about 2 cm in diameter. The patient had been impotent because
      of incomplete erection since the surgery While the penile
      base grew normally turgid with sexual excitement and orgasm
      was unimpaired, the penile shaft distal to this lump was soft
      and did not support the glans sufficiently for penetration.
      When erect the penis was noted to deviate to the right side.
      Penile plethysmography confirmed erectile activity at the
      base but absence at the distal shaft. A corpus cavernography
      (Fig 2) showed a rounded filling defect in the midpenile
      shaft, with impaired filling of both corpora distal to the
      lesion.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further questioning
      of these patients disclosed that an identical surgical
      technique had been used in each case. Each had subsequently
      been treated with local injections of steroids, with no
      effect. Both dated their impotence from the time of the
      surgical procedure.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Procedure.</b> --
      The method was as follows:</p>

      <p>A soft rubber tourniquet was firmly applied at the base of
      the penile shaft. Five milliliters of 1% lidocaine
      hydrocloride (without epinephrine hydrocloride was injected
      into the base of each corpus cavernosum just distal to the
      tourniquet. A routine circumcision was then performed. When
      the foreskin had been completely excised, the tourniquet was
      removed, and individual bleeding points were controlled.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The skin margins were
      then reapproximated, and a soft sterile dressing was applied.
      The same technique was reported to have been used by this
      physician in more than 100 cases without complication.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tourniquet was
      usually applied only for a matter of minutes, and no
      prolonged tourniquet application was remembered in either
      case.</p>

      <p class="3"><b>Comment</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lidocaine, which was
      introduced in 1948, is one of the most widely used synthetic
      local anesthetics. Package inserts proscribe against use of
      lidocaine with epinephine in finger blocks or for
      circumcisions because of reports of skin necrosis. However,
      thousands of circumcisions must be performed daily under
      subcoronal local anesthesia without mishap. In these two
      cases, the lidocaine was injected directly into the corpora
      distal to a tourniquet, which was left in place for an
      estimated five- to ten-minute period. The flaccid penis has
      an estimated vascular volume of 10 to 15 mL, to which 10 mL
      of 1% lidocaine was added. This resulted in perhaps a 50%
      mixture of lidocaine and blood that remained in contact with
      the vascular endothelium for the duration of tourniquet
      application. It is postulated that this relatively high
      concentration of lidocaine irreversibly damaged the
      endothelium of the corpus cavernosum--bilaterally in case 1
      and locally in case 2--resulting in obstruction of the
      corpora and interfering with the normal erectile process. In
      both cases, corpus cavernography proved a lesion to be
      present and showed the site and extent of the corporal block.
      Cavernography was essential in evaluating these two cases and
      should be considered in all patients with a localized
      flaccidity on erection.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the eventual
      outcome in each case in unknown, their clinical importance as
      a complication of this type of regional anesthesia warrants
      their early presentation.</p>
