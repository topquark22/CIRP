      <p>Registration of cavernous electrical activity was shown to
      be a possible method for the evaluation of cavernous
      autonomic innervation. Recent studies in patients with normal
      erectile function showed that cavernous electrical activity
      is synchronous throughout the entire cavernous bodies.
      Therefore, we examined the feasibility of transcutaneous
      registration of cavernous electrical activity in 8 normal and
      62 impotent patients. In the sitting patient cavernous
      electrical activity was recorded with a 2-channel
      electrophysiological unit. Recording was done with a coaxial
      needle electrode in the proximal left cavernous body and with
      surface electrodes bilaterally on the penile shaft. <span
      class="yellow">In 7 of 8 normal patients swelling of the
      penile shaft after circumcision resulted in a dramatically
      decreased amplitude of the potentials. In 41 of 62 impotent
      patients recordings were similar.</span> In 10 of 62 patients
      no recording or markedly decreased amplitudes were noted with
      the surface electrodes and in these patients a small penis or
      penile retraction with consecutive electrode displacement was
      found. Careful repositioning of the surface electrodes with
      the patient in the supine position resulted in similar
      recordings in 9, inconsistently in 4. In 11 of the 62
      patients more information was obtained with the surface than
      with the needle electrode. Our results show that recording of
      cavernous electrical activity can be done in a completely
      noninvasive manner using surface electrodes with similar or
      even better information obtained than with needle
      electrodes.</p>
