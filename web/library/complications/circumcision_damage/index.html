    <h2><font face="arial">Routine Circumcisions: Not Always
    Routine,<br />
    Not Always Safe</font></h2>

    <p>To help parents make an informed decision about infant
    circumcision, Dr. Mervyn Lander, an Australian physician, has
    provided the <a href="circumcision_damage_1.html">following
    photos</a> of circumcision side effects.</p>

    <p>Doctors sometimes claim that infant circumcision is simple
    and safe. Some say they've done "thousands" and "thousands"
    with nary a problem. Undoubtedly, that's what the parents of
    these boys were told beforehand.</p>

    <p>What's the chance of your baby suffering one or more of
    these mishaps? Unfortunately, reliable statistics are in short
    supply.</p>

    <p>Some circumcisers routinely perform only <a
    href="04_radical_circumcision.jpg" target="blank">"radical"</a>
    circumcisions in which very little foreskin is preserved, so
    that the great majority of boys that are cut this way will
    experience tight, uncomfortable erections as adults.</p>

    <p>Some cirumcisers routinely <a href="05_missing_frenulum.jpg"
    target="blank">destroy the frenulum</a> (the tight connection
    between the head of the penis and the shaft). For many men, the
    frenulum provides intense sexual pleasure.</p>

    <p>It's unknown how often circumcision causes death or other
    medical catastrophes, because these disasters typically result
    from massive bacterial infection that migrates from the
    circumcision wound and causes life-threatening conditions
    including; septicemia (blood poisoning) liver abcess, kidney
    abcess, joint abcess, and meningitis. Circumcision as the real
    cause of these disasters may never be determined nor, if fatal,
    recorded on the death certificate.</p>

    <p>Because routine circumcision is not medically necessary,
    issues of liability for medical malpractice may make some
    hospitals less than enthusiastic about identifying circumcision
    as the root cause of infant death or other catastrophic
    outcome.</p>
