        <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To describe the clinical presentation
        and pathophysiology of meatal stenosis occurring after
        circumcision.</p>

        <p><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b> The clinical presentation
        and operative findings are reported in 12 children who
        presented with meatal stenosis over a period of 3
        years.</p>

        <p>The cardinal symptoms of meatal stenosis were penile
        pain at the initiation of micturition (12 of 12), narrow,
        high velocity stream (8 of 12) and the need to sit or stand
        back from the toilet bowl to urinate (6 of 12). Following
        surgical correction with meatotomy there was no recurrence
        of stenosis after a mean follow-up of 13 months. Traumatic
        meatitis of the unprotected post-circumcision urethral
        meatus and/or meatal ischaemia following damage to the
        frenular artery at circumcision are suggested as possible
        causes of meatal stenosis.</p>

        <p>Preservation of the frenular artery at circumcision, or
        the use of an alternative procedure (preputial plasty), may
        be advisable when foreskin surgery is required, to avoid
        meatal stenosis after circumcision.</p>

      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

      <p>Meatal stenosis is reported by some <sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> to be the commonest complication of
      circumcision, although its incidence is unclear. Some major
      series analysing the results of circumcision <sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> have even failed to recognize meatal
      stenosis as a possible complication. The clinical
      presentation of 12 patients with meatal stenosis following
      circumcision is discussed, together with the pathophysiology
      of this condition.</p>

      <h3>PATIENTS AND METHODS</h3>

      <p>Over a period of 3 years (1991-1993), 12 children whose
      ages at circumcision ranged from 2 to 10 years (mean 4.5)
      presented subsequently with meatal stenosis. All had
      undergone circumcisions and none had had preputial plasty.
      The original indications for circumcision were recurrent
      balanitis (five patients), tight and scarred foreskin (five)
      and cultural reasons (two). In no patient was balanitis
      xerotica obliterans the indication for surgery.</p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <p>Acute penile or glanular pain at initiation of micturition
      was found in all 12 patients. A narrow high velocity urinary
      stream was noted by the parents is eight cases and was
      associated with urine spillage around the bowl in six,
      forcing the child to sit or stand back from the toilet bowl
      to avoid spillage (six or eight patients). One child had
      recurrent minimal urethal bleeding. The interval to onset of
      symptoms after circumcision varied from 4 months to 8 years
      (mean 25.3 months).</p>

      <p>Clinical examination in all 12 children showed a normal
      glanular mucosa (with no macroscopic evidence of balanitis
      xerotica obliterans) and a pinhole meatus, the lower margins
      of which were bridged by a thin filmy membrane (Fig. 1) No
      sign of meatal infection was noted. No paraclinical
      investigations were performed (in particular no urethogram
      and no ultrasound scan of the urinary tract).</p>

      <p>All patients were treated by meatotomy with complete
      resolution of all symptoms. No recurrence of meatal stenosis
      has been found after a mean follow-up of 13 months (range
      5-33).</p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h3>

      <p>Meatal stenosis as a complication is often missed by the
      clinician because children do not usually have late follow-up
      after circumcision. The symptoms of pain are often mistaken
      for symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection and symptoms
      of distal urethral impairment of urinary flow are usually
      ignored for many months until parents witness the child's
      voiding habit.</p>

      <p>No meatal stenosis was reported by Thomas et al.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> in a series of 100157 circumcisions
      performed before 1 month of age, although these children were
      not followed up on a long term basis. Therefore it is
      difficult to evaluate the incidence of this complication. 88
      circumcisions (and 91 preputial plasties) were performed at
      this institution: seven of these patients (8%) presented with
      meatal stenosis. The other five children with meatal stenosis
      were circumcised before this period by other surgeons.</p>

      <p>The pathophysiology of post-circumcision meatal stenosis
      is debatable. Two possible causes are discussed: meatitis and
      meatal ischaemia.</p>

      <p>Meatitis</p>

      <p>Non-specific inflammation of the meatus is the commonest
      explanation reported in the literature <sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. Careful examination of all normal
      male children shows that there is always a physiological
      eversion of the distal urethral mucosa through the urethral
      meatus (`lips' of the meatus), and this mucosal eversion
      varies in magnitude between children (Fig. 2). Excision of
      the foreskin exposes this everted mucosa to the constant
      forces of friction and trauma from the children's underwear.
      This could support the suggestion that meatitis is the
      underlying aetiology of this complication.</p>

        which<br />
         carries the frenular artery from the penile shaft to
        the<br />
         penile core. The frenulum is often damaged at
        circumcision.<br />

      <h4>Ischaemia</h4>

      <p>Another explanation of post-circumcision meatal stenosis
      could be ischaemia of the meatal mucosa, as several
      techniques of circumcision involve damage to the frenular
      artery. The area of vascularization supplied by the frenular
      artery has not been clearly described to date. However, the
      frenular artery is possibly the vascular supply to the
      urethral meatus and perhaps to a larger area of the distal
      male urethra. The frenular artery is always absent in
      hypospadiac patients even when the foreskin is complete,
      possibly indicating its important role in the development of
      the distal male urethra. The frenulum could be considered the
      `mesoartery' which links the vascularization of the penile
      shaft to that of the penile core (Fig.,3)</p>

      <p>Balanitis xerotica obliterans <sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> is unlikely to have been an
      aetiological agent in the series of patients under
      consideration as none of them had the macroscopic changes of
      balanitis xerotica obliterans at the time of circumcision. In
      addition, no recurrence of meatal stenosis following
      meatotomy has been found, although this might have been
      expected if any of the patients had had balanitis xerotica
      obliterans.</p>

      <p>Although none of these pathophysiological hypotheses has
      been verified, it may be advisable either to preserve the
      frenular artery at circumcision or to choose an alternative
      procedure (such as preputial plasty) <sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> when foreskin surgery is required.</p>
