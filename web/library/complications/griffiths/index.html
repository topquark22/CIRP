      Key Words. Circumcision - Indications - Morbidity 

      <p>Abstract</p>

      <blockquote>
        Both the British Medical Association and the American
        Academy of Pediatrics recommend that circumcision should
        only be performed for medical reasons. No one has ever
        described which reasons are actually used, nor measured the
        morbidity of the procedure. Of 140 boys coming to day-case
        elective circumcision between the ages of 3 months and 14
        years (mean 4.3 years), the commonest cause was a
        congenital phimosis<i>[*]</i> (42.8%). Four (2.8%) patients
        required acute readmission postoperatively, and a further 4
        developed meatal stenosis, requiring a formal meatotomy. Of
        99 patients followed up in detail, 46% vomited, 36% oozed,
        19% did not pass urine for more than 12 h and 26% could not
        wear pants for more than 7 days. <span
        class="yellow">Childhood circumcision has an appreciable
        morbidity, and should not be recommended without a medical
        reason.</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="cirp">[* CIRP note: So called "Congenital phimosis"
      actually is a normal condition in the newborn and young child
      that requires no treatment. See the article of <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> for more
      information.]</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The <a href="/library/general/BMJ/">British Medical
      Association</a> (BMA) <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and the
      <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> (AAP) <sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> deplore
      neonatal circumcision and only recommend circumcision on
      medical grounds. There is no account of the indications and
      only a single report of the morbidity of the operation
      <sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>. However, in the North
      American literature, the advantages and disadvantages of
      neonatal circumcision have often been reviewed <sup><a
      href="#n4">4,5</a></sup>. The indications and morbidity of
      circumcision in infants and children in Southampton was
      prospectively reviewed between February 1st and July 1st,
      1983.</p>

      <h3>Patients and Methods</h3>

      <p>140 boys were admitted to the Paediatric Day Care Unit for
      circumcision. After suitable pre-medication, the children
      were anaesthetised and, if over 12 months, had a
      pre-operative Marcain (bupivicaine 0.5%) caudal anaesthetic.
      A routine dissection circumcision was performed. Some
      children had no formal dressing, while others had a more
      complex dressing with tulle gras, 2.5 cm cotton tape and
      micropore, which was expected to stay on for 7 days.
      Postoperatively, the children were kept on the ward until
      they were fully awake and then allowed home. They were not
      required to pass urine before discharge.</p>

      <p>The Paediatric Home Nursing Team visited each child in
      their area on the following morning, and as often as was
      necessary until the penis was healed and the parents and
      child happy. The nurses filled in a standard sheet on each
      visit. This asked if there had been any delay in micturition
      postoperatively, or any vomiting or bleeding at any time. The
      discomfort of the child was assessed, not by the amount of
      analgesia used, but by whether the child was prepared to wear
      pants. The state of the penis was assessed - redness,
      presence of pus, blisters. or scab formation. Although the
      indications and results of circumcision were documented for
      all 140, the details of the morbidity were only assessed in
      the 99 (70.7%) who lived within the range of our nurses. All
      the children were seen as out-patients at 3-5 weeks
      postoperatively, by which time no scabs were present, and all
      the children had been discharged by the district nurse. The
      penis was said to be healed when the family no longer
      required the services of the nurse, even if there were still
      scabs present, as this is a good measure of the medical and
      psychological healing of the child and his family after the
      operation.</p>

      <p>The mean age at operation was 4.3 years (range 3 months to
      14 years; fig. 1).</p>

      <h3>Definition</h3>

      <p>Phimosis: This was defined as a foreskin that could not be
      retracted over the glans due to a tight band. In some
      patients, if it could be retracted, a paraphimosis would be
      the likely result. Obstruction to urinary flow may occur in
      severe examples of congenital or acquired phimosis. If the
      foreskin could not be retracted because of normal preputial
      adhesions, then it was termed non-retractile.</p>

      <p>The commonest reason for circumcision was phimosis - 112
      Patients (80%). Pure congenital phimosis was present in 60
      patients (42.8%). 14 patients (10%) had a tendency to
      paraphimosis, and 38 (27.1%) had an acquired phimosis, 7 boys
      (5%) had balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO). In addition,
      there were 15 (10.7%) religious and 6 (4.2%) miscellaneous
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p>39 children were circumcised when aged less than 3 years.
      Only 11 of 39 patients (28.2%) were circumcised purely for
      congenital phimosis, confirming that the diagnosis is
      unusual. 8 of 39 patients (20%) had a tendency to
      paraphimosis.</p>

      <p>6 children aged less than 12 months were circumcised. 4
      were religious circumcisions, of which 2 were initially
      inadequate. All the religious circumcisions were for Muslims
      and the foreskins were clinically and histologically normal.
      Only 7 of 15 (46%) circumcisions were performed when the
      child was out of nappies, despite medical advice to this
      end.</p>

      <p>The 6 miscellaneous circumcisions comprised 1 severe
      balanitis, 1 true paraphimosis, 1 foreskin caught in a zip,
      and 3 inadequate circumcisions, 2 religious, and 1
      medical.</p>

      <p>Although there were 21 (15%) children with a history of
      ballooning, 12 (8.5%) with a history of dysuria and 56 (40%)
      with a history of balanitis, all of these children also had
      phimosis as the indication for operation.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Update: Ballooning now is regarded as a
      normal condition in boys; it requires no treatment. Phimosis
      now is treated medically with topical steroid ointment.]</p>

      <h3>Complications</h3>

      <p>4 children developed meatal stenosis requiring formal
      meatotomy under general anaesthetic. 2 had BXO, while the
      other 2 had normal foreskins histologically. 1 child had a
      repeat circumcision for an initially inadequate religious
      circumcision.</p>

      <h3>Morbidity of the Local Children (99 of 140)</h3>

      <h4>Vomiting</h4>

      <p>None of the children under 2 vomited post-operatively. 46
      children vomited either in hospital or within the first 24 h,
      and 1 child required re-admission for profuse vomiting.</p>

      <h4>Delay till Micturition</h4>

      <p>All the bovs were allowed home on the day of operation
      whether they had passed urine or not. 19 did not pass urine
      in the 12 h following surgery. 5 children had episodes of
      `hanging on' for several days (maximum: 3 days) before
      passing urine, 1 child was re-admitted for retention of
      urine, but then passed urine spontaneously 16 h
      post-operatively.</p>

      <h4>Significant Bleeding</h4>

      <p>36 circumcisions were noted to ooze at some time, though
      only 2 patients required re-admission for continued bleeding.
      In 9 boys, the post-operative bleeding was due to accidental
      trauma. Removal of the more complex dressing at 7 days,
      sometimes resulted in oozing from scabs which were
      inadvertently removed (5 of 23 = 21.3%).</p>

      <h4>Comfort of the Child</h4>

      <p>38 children were able to wear pants within the first 4
      days, but 26 avoided wearing pants for 7 days or more. 12
      children were in nappies which were replaced
      post-operatively.</p>

      <h4>Infection</h4>

      <p>22 children had persistent hyperaemia, but there was no
      case of proven infection. 12 of 140 (8.5%) children were
      prescribed antibiotics. 6 children had wounds which were
      noted to be 'infected' and so were started on antibiotics by
      their general practitioner. 3 children were seen on the ward
      and given antibiotics. 2 children had antibiotics for an
      intercurrent otitis media and 1 had a chest infection.</p>

      <h4>Healing</h4>

      <p>The mean length of time for healing after circumcision was
      10.4 days. 76 patients were fully healed 14 days after
      operation. None of those with a complex dressing were healed
      in less than 8 days, because the dressing was not taken off
      till 7 days post-operatively. A few of the others were healed
      earlier than that, as the parents were confident and the
      glans was dry. Scab formation was normal, and they usually
      took from 2 to 3 weeks to fall off. Many of the children had
      scabs on the penis at the time of discharge, but this did not
      prevent the child and his mother from leading an otherwise
      normal life. Of the 7 children with BXO, only 4 were visited
      by our district nurses. They took 11-18 days to heal (mean
      14.2) and 3 of them developed large scabs on the glans,
      especially around the meatus. 2 of the 7 boys developed
      meatal stenosis requiring meatotomy (28.5%).</p>

      <h4>Re-Admissions</h4>

      <p>Four children required re-admission: 1 for difficulty with
      micturition; 2 for bleeding, and 1 for vomiting (4 of 140,
      2.7%). The boy with retention of urine was admitted after 12
      h, but passed urine spontaneously at 16 h. The boys who bled
      had both sustained accidental trauma, and settled on bed rest
      and analgesia. I boy began vomiting profusely at home and was
      re-admitted. He required intravenous fluids for 24 h and was
      discharged home within 2 days.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>The proponents of routine neonatal circumcision <sup><a
      href="#n4">4, 5</a></sup> extol the advantages of preventing
      cancer of the penis <sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>,
      facilitating penile hygiene <sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>,
      decreasing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases
      (specifically genital herpes) <sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      and a reduction in the incidence of cancer of the cervix
      <sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>. Circumcision in adult life is
      painful <sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>, and is often
      indicated for difficulties with intercourse <sup><a
      href="#n10">10-13</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>Following neonatal circumcision there is an appreciable
      morbidity of 0.06 <sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> to 55%
      <sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>. This discrepancy reflects
      differences in the definition of terms in the various
      studies. Haemorrhage is the most common complication and
      occurs in about 1% of cases <sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>.
      Infection is more common with the Plastibell device than with
      the Gomco Clamp <sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>. Major
      complications like septicaemia, life-threatening haemorrhage,
      denudation of the penile shaft, circumcision of hypospadiacs,
      osteomyelitis and lung abscess have all been reported <sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup>. There is a negligible mortality of 1
      in 1,000,000 <sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>. Thus neither
      the <a href="/library/general/BMJ/">BMA</a><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> nor the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">AAP</a><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> support neonatal circumcision and both
      recommend delay until circumcision is required for medical
      reasons.</p>

      <p>As one might expect, 80% of children in Southampton
      requiring circumcision had phimosis, and the majority of
      these were congenital. 17 patients (11%) had circumcision for
      non-medical reasons (15 religious + 2 cosmetic). No child was
      circumcised if it had a non-retractile foreskin due to
      preputial adhesions. Over the same period, freeing of
      preputial adhesions was performed 36 times under both general
      and local anaesthetic.</p>

      <p>Contrary to <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood/">Rickwood et
      al</a>.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>, who suggested that
      95% of phimoses were caused by BXO, we found that only 7 of
      140 patients (5%) had this confirmed by histological
      examination of the excised prepuce.</p>

      <p>The average age of circumcision (4.3 years) is in line
      with the recommendation of the BMA that circumcision should
      be performed between the ages of 3 and 5 as the child is
      usually out of nappies by this age and the psychological
      trauma of the operation is decreased <sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. The HIPA for 1979 <sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> shows that only 30% of circumcisions
      in England and Wales are performed under 5 years of age. The
      average stay in hospital is 1.7 days for those under 4 years,
      and 1.9 days for children up to 14 years old. Day surgery is
      of value in reducing the psychological trauma of circumcision
      and should be the system of choice.</p>

      <p>Only children who had had omnopon (Papaveretum) as a part
      of the pre-medication vomited post-operatively.</p>

      <p>In view of this, a separate survey of vomiting was started
      omitting omnopon from the pre-medication, and we expect to be
      able to eliminate post-operative vomiting.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">The overall major morbidity of the
      140 circumcisions comprising admission to hospital or further
      surgery, was 6.4%.</span> In addition. closer study of 99
      boys by our district nurses showed that 46% vomited, 36%
      oozed, 74% were wearing normal clothes within 7 days and the
      mean time to healing was 10.4 days. <span
      class="yellow">Healing was delayed for longer than 14 days in
      23%.</span> All the operations were performed by an
      experienced surgeon: either the consultant, senior registrar,
      or post-fellowship registrar. One might expect the morbidity
      to be higher in more junior hands.</p>

      <p>In Southampton, 200 circumcisions a year are performed in
      adult life for paraphimosis, intractable balanitis and sexual
      problems. It seems likely that most of these adults should
      have been circumcised as children, thus avoiding an extremely
      painful experience.</p>
