       <i>Streptococcus</i> Associated with Circumcision</h2>

      <p class="text1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The lack of valid medical indications has caused routine
      neonatal circumcision to fall into disrepute in recent
      years.<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> However, despite the
      substantial arguments against continuation of this therapy,
      it ranks as one of the most common surgical
      procedures.<sup><a href="#n3">3,4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Significant infection is rarely solely attributed to
      circumcision because a clear-cut cause and effect
      relationship is difficult to establish. There have been
      reports of newborns<sup><a href="#n5">5-7</a></sup> who have
      been circumcised and then developed life threatening
      infection within several days of this procedure. However, the
      fact that in these infants infection has occurred at an age
      when the incidence of infection is high due to other factors
      complicates interpretation of these reports.</p>

      <p class="text1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      We report a 6-week-old infant in whom the relationship
      between circumcision and sepsis was unequivocal.</p>

      <p class="section"><b>CASE REPORT</b></p>

      <p class="text1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On admission T. H. was the 6-week-old product of a 32-week
      twin gestation born to a 26-year-old multiparous mother.
      Birth weight was 2,160 gm (4 lb, 12 oz). His early course was
      complicated by transient tachypnea requiring oxygen therapy
      for 2 1/2 days and hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy
      for four days. He was discharged from the nursery at 12 days
      of age with appropriate weight gain. At 6 weeks of age he was
      circumcised in the office of the mother's physician. Within
      24 hours he became irritable and anorectic. The scrotum
      developed a purpuric discoloration and the base of the penile
      shaft became red and firm. There was no fever, however, and
      the mother telephoned her physician who recommended aspirin
      therapy. When marked lethargy developed, the infant was taken
      to a local hospital where he was noted to be moribund. After
      intubation and stabilization he was transferred to Hermann
      Hospital, University of Texas Medical School at Houston.
      Initial physical exam revealed an ashen gray, hypotonic
      infant with a pulse rate of 178 beats a minute, temperature
      of 34.7 C (rectally), and blood pressure of 103/58 mm Hg. He
      required a respirator to maintain ventilation. He was
      obtunded with occasional spontaneous limb movements. The only
      other pertinent findings were the genitalia. The shaft of the
      penis and surrounding tissue were firm and erythematous and
      the scrotum had a bluish discoloration (figure). Ampicillin,
      methicillin, and gentamycin were begun. Initial laboratory
      data showed: hemoglobin, 8.6 gm/dl; hematocrit, 25.7%; white
      blood cell count 5,000/cu mm with 94% lymphocytes, 2%
      segmented neutrophils, 2% stab cells, 1% myelocytes, 1%
      eosinophils (the infant subsequently developed a brisk
      neutrophilic leukocytosis). The platelet count was 166,000/
      cu mm. The urinalysis showed proteinuria, hematuria, and
      pyuria. An initial arterial blood gas determination while the
      infant was receiving 100% oxygen revealed a pH of 6.87,
      Po<sub>2</sub> of 53 mm Hg. CSF contained 105 leukocytes/cu
      mm, all of which were mononuclear. CSF glucose was 2 mg/dl,
      CSF protein was 1,210 mg/dl. The Gram strain showed bacteria.
      The infant's subsequent hospital course was complicated by
      shock, generalized seizures, hypocalcemia, renal failure,
      disseminated intravascular coagulation, arrhythmias, and
      <span class="yellow">death.</span> Blood, urine, and CSF
      cultures grew group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus.</p>

      <p class="section"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>

      <p class="text1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Because circumcision was delayed in this child until 6 weeks
      of age, the relationship between the operation and his
      subsequent infection were clear-cut, unlike the situation in
      some previous reports. Estimates of the frequency of
      infection vary widely although it is generally stated that
      serious infection is a rare event. The interpretation of what
      constitutes an infected circumcision is problematic because
      the wound often has some exudate and erythema without other
      definite signs of infection. Even if the wound looks
      uninfected, it is possible that it may serve as a portal of
      entry for bacteria. Tooth brushing, proctoscopy, and a
      variety of other "innocuous" procedures causing a break in
      the epithelial barriers have been documented to cause
      bacteremia. It would not be surprising if circumcision also
      caused bacteremia. This, coupled with the natural tendency of
      physicians not to ascribe a poor outcome to an elective
      procedure, may have led to gross underestimates of the
      frequency of life threatening infectious complications. In
      one retrospective series of more than 900,000 male births,
      there were no deaths attributed to infection.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> The incidence of neonatal sepsis is
      estimated at 1:300 to 1:1,600 live births. With the usual
      male predominance (approximately 2:1), one might have
      expected between 700 and 3,900 in this large study. Since the
      rate of circumcision during the years of study was 61%, there
      must have been many males who were circumcised and who became
      septic but in whom the two events were not judged to have
      been related.</p>

      <p class="text1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Despite the marked male predominance, few reviews of neonatal
      sepsis mention how many infants were circumcised. Although
      one series suggests that circumcision is a major cause of
      sepsis in newborn male infants<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      most make no conclusion regarding a relationship. The marked
      excess of sepsis in male infants has been assumed to reflect
      the biologic inferiority of a single dose X chromosome. It
      has been noted that two X chromosomes cause greater genetic
      heterogeneity for X-linked genes involved in immunoglobulin
      synthesis,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> thymic function,
      and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase related phagocytic cell
      formation.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> Although
      differences in infection susceptibility do exist in both man
      and experimental animals,<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      seldom is the female advantage more exaggerated than in the
      neonatal period. <span class="yellow">It would seem that a
      reasonable explanation for some of these infections in male
      infants is that they routinely have the integrity of their
      integument violated in a moist, warm, contaminated area. Much
      has been made of the umbilicus as a portal of entry for
      bacteria, partly because of its proximity to the perineum.
      However, few fears have been voiced that an iatrogenic
      perineal wound may pose a risk of potentially greater
      importance.</span></p>
