      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> Circumcision is one of the commonly
      performed procedures on males in the United States, Canada,
      Australia, and the United Kingdom. The association of minor
      anatomic variations of the newborn genitalia in patients with
      minor circumcision complications has not been previously
      examined. In this study, we looked for an association between
      subtle genital anatomic variations and newborn circumcision
      complications.</p>

      <p><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> Over an 18-month period,
      children presenting for circumcision revision were examined
      for minor variations in genital anatomy. Children referred
      for other urological problems during the same period
      comprised the control group. The same physician evaluated all
      of the children.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> During this period, 68 children were
      evaluated for possible circumcision complications. <span
      class="yellow">A confirmed complication was present in 57
      infants.</span> Patients with a minor circumcision
      complication were found to have a 9-fold higher incidence of
      a prominent suprapubic fat pad, penoscrotal webbing, or being
      a premature infant as compared to the control group.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Subtle anatomic variations may be
      associated with a higher incidence of circumcision
      complications. Physicians performing newborn circumcisions
      should thoroughly examine the genitalia for these anatomic
      variations prior to the procedure in order to reduce
      potential complications.</p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: This article shows that 57 boys in
      a group of 68 suffered a complication of circumcision. This
      is a complication incidence of 84 percent in this prospective
      study, which necessitated further corrective surgery.</p>
