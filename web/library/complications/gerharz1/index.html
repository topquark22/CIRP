      <p><b>Abstract</b> We report on the long-term followup of a
      mixed dissociative (conversion) disorder after circumcision
      in childhood.</p>

      <p><b>Keywords</b> Circumcision - Conversion - Dissociative
      disorder - Hysteria - Posterior urethral valves - Urinary
      retention</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Several patterns of somatic dysfunction may
      present in the absence of known organic disease. The up to
      date rather confusing terminology in the description of these
      often impressive phenomena clearly reflects a limited
      understanding of the complex interaction between physical and
      psychological factors. The Austrian physician Sigmund Freud
      (Figure 1) provided the first conceptual framework for
      hysteria as a disease entity.</p>

      <p class="text2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has
      meanwhile provided a simpler nomenclature based upon the
      nature of the bodily functions that are impaired.</p>

      <p class="text2">The case reported herein fulfills all three
      criteria (Table 1) for the definite diagnosis of a mixed
      dissociative (conversion) disorder.</p>

      <h4>Case report</h4>

      <p class="text1">In 1979, an infant boy underwent temporary
      bilateral ring ureterostomy and transurethral valve resection
      for classical posterior urethral valves. He had early
      recovery and stabilisation of renal function. <span
      class="yellow">In April 1990, the boy, now aged 11 years was
      circumcised. The procedure was completely uneventful, but the
      boy was highly distressed by the procedure.</span> In
      addition (although not known to his doctors) his mother was
      diagnosed with breast cancer at the same time. While he was
      able to void normally immediately postsurgery, he reported
      progressive dificulty in passing urine during the next two
      days. Complete painless retention followed and required
      catheterisation. After several days, a supra-pubic catheter
      was inserted. Clean intermittent selfcatheterisation was
      started 18 months later. Although he developed well during
      puberty with good genital growth, he experienced gradual
      fading of erections and a condom-form anaesthesia of the
      penis as a teenager. A complete urodynamic and
      neurophysiological workup of the pelvic floor were performed
      without pathological findings. Detrusor muscle biopsies
      showed normal innervation pattern and morphology. Nitrous
      oxide synthesis de.ciency was excluded.</p>
      <i>Table 1.</i> Diagnostic guidelines for a definite
      diagnosis of dissociative (conversion) disorders (ICD-10,
      WHO, 1993) 
      <hr size="1" color="black" />
      The following should be present:<br />
       (a) the clinical features as specified for the individual
      disorders in F44;<br />
       (b) no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain
      the symptoms;<br />
       (c) evidence for psychological causation, in the form of
      clear association in time with stressful events and problems
      or disturbed relationship (even if denied by the individual).
      
      <hr size="1" color="black" />

      <p class="text2">Since the boy complained of alternating
      diarrhoea and constipation, barium meal and follow through,
      barium enema, colonoscopy, oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy and
      duodenal biopsies were performed to exclude coeliac and
      in.ammatory bowel diseases. All studies were normal and
      irritable bowel syndrome was assumed.</p>

      <p class="text2">When the patient was 18 years old, his
      mother died of metastatic breast cancer. He immediately
      started to void spontaneously with a good stream. Three years
      later, he describes normal erections and has a steady sexual
      relationship.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">His case fulfils all three WHO criteria
      (Table 1, (a&ndash;c)) for the definite diagnosis of a mixed
      dissociative (conversion) disorder (F44.7) [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. <span class="yellow">The patient presented
      with the distinct clinical features of urinary retention and
      erectile dysfunction (dissociative motor disorder) and penile
      anaesthesia (dissociative sensory loss)</span> (a). No
      evidence of a physical condition existed that might explain
      the symptoms (b). Other physical illnesses had been ruled out
      appropriately by exhaustive urological and neurological
      evaluation. Exclusion of organic disease is a compulsory
      diagnostic criterion for mixed dissociative disorder and must
      be completed before psychiatric opinion and psychological
      management. Most authors recommend limiting investigations to
      an essential minimum [<a href="#n2">2</a>], which seems
      unrealistic. The clear association in time of symptom onset
      and cessation with apparently highly stressful events
      (circumcision; mother&rsquo;s death) seems acceptable as
      evidence for psychological causation (c).</p>

      <p class="text2">An early history of a physical or
      psychological trauma relating to the urogenital tract (e.g.
      repeated infections, operations, excessive attention on
      urinary functions) may predispose a child to later expression
      of psychological problems through urinary retention [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>]. Although posterior urethral valves can be
      associated with significant long-term morbidity requiring
      close surveillance well beyond puberty, neither reversible
      urinary retention nor impotence have yet been documented as
      sequelae of this rare anomaly [<a href="#n4">4</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">While uncomplicated circumcision does not
      explain the symptoms from a strictly technical point of view
      some authors suggest that circumcision is perceived by the
      child as an act of aggression and castration [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. Although the latter is perfectly
      symbolised by erectile dysfunction and penile anaesthesia in
      our patient, that may well be an over-interpretation. The
      additional trauma of the mother&rsquo;s initial diagnosis
      with breast cancer may be relevant. As psychiatric evaluation
      was rejected, denying a psychogenic aetiology prevented a
      professional assessment of potentially abnormal patterns of
      family function.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the treatment of somatic symptoms, most
      authorities advocate active rehabilitation and attempts to
      help the child and family understand why abnormal illness
      behaviour has developed [<a href="#n2">2</a>]. Suggestion and
      encouragement towards a gradual resumption of normal function
      are often useful. However, trials of therapy and good
      systematic descriptions of the disorder are lacking.</p>
