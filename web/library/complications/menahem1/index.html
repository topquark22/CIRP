      <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT. Over a period of six years,
      five seriously ill infants were referred with complications
      arising from ritual circumcision performed by non-physicians.
      Four infants developed systemic infections; in three of them,
      including one with early meningitis, there was septicemia.
      The common predisposing factor was an excessively tight
      dressing over an infected penile wound, leading to <span
      class="yellow">urinary retention, urinary tract infection and
      septicemia.</span> In the fifth infant, the <span
      class="yellow">glans had been partially amputated</span> and
      required a suture; a second dressing tightly applied to
      control the bleeding was removed without subsequent problems.
      To prevent the above complications careful attention should
      be paid to the baby&rsquo;s voiding within the first 6 to 8 h
      after circumcision. In addition it is suggested that all
      dressings should be removed, or at least replaced, on the day
      following circumcision, whene the likelihood of primary
      hemorrhage has passed. These two simple maneuvers may avoid
      the above-mentioned complications. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      <p class="text1">Much has been written about circumcision (<a
      href="#n1">1--4</a>). An increasing awareness of the
      complications and possible mortality following the procedure
      has contributed to a decline in its frequency in Western
      society. Nevertheless, Jewish infants all over the world
      continue to be circumcised. The biblical instruction
      (<i>mitzvah</i>) concerning circumcision on the eighth day of
      life is faithfully observed by most Jews (<a
      href="#n5">5</a>, <a href="#n6">6</a>). The circumcision is
      usually performed by a ritual circumciser (<i>mohel</i>) who
      is not a physician; if complications occur, they are often
      ignored or just accepted. Death following circumcision (<a
      href="#n7">7</a>) was discussed in Talmudic times and let to
      codification of specific laws in the code of Jewish Law
      (<i>Shulhan Arch</i>) (<a href="#n8">8</a>). Problems
      associated with ritual circumcision (brit milah) continue to
      be reported in medical (<a href="#n5">5</a>, <a
      href="#n6">6</a>, <a href="#n9">9-13</a>) and nonmedical (<a
      href="#n7">7</a>) literature. Complications may be due to
      technique (<a href="#n6">6</a>, <a href="#n7">7</a>, <a
      href="#n9">9</a>), or to a lack of awareness of problems that
      may arise.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this report, four of five infants
      referred over a six-year period with complications following
      ritual circumcision are described. Three had systemic
      infections and in one, the glans was partially amputated,
      leading to hemorrhage. The infants were all health at the
      time of circumcision, and were being cared for in a maternity
      hospital.</p>

      <p class="text3">CASE REPORTS<br />
       <b>Case 1.</b> This baby was born after a normal pregnancy
      (birthweight, 2,830 g) and was circumcised on the eighth day
      of life. After the procedure, there was some oozing and over
      the next 24 h the infant became increasingly lethargic and
      fed poorly. When the baby was referred on the 10th day, he
      was unresponsive and would not eat. He was desperately ill,
      in shock, febrile and more than 5% dehydrated. There was a
      tight dressing on his glans, which was swollen, inflamed and
      almost black. The bladder was distended and percussible (<a
      href="#n12">12</a>). Removal of the dressing was followed by
      a free flow of urine (<a href="#n11">11</a>), which was
      probably the first urine passed for 48 h. <i>Escherichia
      coli</i> was isolated from the urine, blood and infected site
      of circumcision. Administration of i.v. fluids and parenteral
      penicillin and kanamycin was begun, together with antiseptic
      dressings to the penis. The infant had some difficulity
      voiding for a few days because of a scab over the urethral
      orifice, but the subsequent course was satisfactory and at
      six-week follow-up, he was healthy.</p>

      <p class="text3"><b>Case 2.</b> This baby was born after a
      normal pregnancy and delivery (birthweight 3,830 g). He had a
      cleft lip and palette, but was other wise normal and was
      circumcised on the eighth day of life. The nex day, he fed
      slowly and was rather sleepy and lethargic, developed
      diarrhea, and had a temperature of 38 C and some tachypnea.
      The infant was pale and mildly jaundiced, with abdominal
      distension and excoriated perineum. The tip of the penis was
      almost gangrenous and the penile shaft was elongated by a
      tight dressing. When this was removed, an infected offensive
      wound was seen. The bladder was full on percussion but not
      palpable and after the dressing was removed, the infant
      voided. Multiple organisms were cultured from the
      circumcision and <i>Proteus</i> was grown from the blood and
      urine. A lumbar puncture showed early signs of meningitis and
      a chest X-ray revealed patchy consolidation at the bases of
      both lungs. Treatment with i.v. fluids and parenteral
      penicillin and kanamycin, together with antiseptic dressings,
      led to rapid improvement and recovery over the next few
      days.</p>

      <p class="text3"><b>Case 3.</b> This baby, delivered by
      cesarean section, was born after a normal pregnancy
      (birthweight 3,180 g). Mild jaundice appeared on the third
      day of life but, decreased spontaneously by the fifth. He was
      circumcised on the eighth day and the next day developed a
      mild fever and the jaundice worsened. The penile shaft was
      elongated by a tight dressing. When the bandage was removed,
      an offensive, infected wound was observed and the infant
      voided. Multiple organisms were isolated from the penis, but
      not from the blood and urine. The infant was treated with
      parenteral penicillin and kanamycin and antiseptic dressings.
      Recovery was uneventful.</p>

      <p class="text3"><b>Case 4.</b> This baby was born one week
      post term (birthweight, 3, 400 g). He was circumcised on the
      eighth day of life and continued to bleed over next few hours
      despite application of a second dressing by the mohel.
      Examination 6 h after circumcision revealed a somewhat pale,
      irritable infant. The penis was tightly bound and both the
      shaft and the glans were elongated. Despite severe
      compression, blood oozed continuously. When the dressing was
      removed, the glans was found to be partially lacerated. The
      undersurface of the shaft had also been denuded and there
      were a number of arteriolar bleeding points, which were
      oversewn. The glans was treated conservatively with local
      petrolatum-gauze dressings and oral trimethoprim. Recovery
      was uneventful.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="sc1">DISCUSSION</span><br />
       Complications of varying severity, including occasional
      fatalities, have been described following all forms of
      circumcision (<a href="#n14">14-17</a>). It is important to
      consider measures that will improve the safety of ritual
      circumcision. The cases presented here do not present a
      complete picture of the complications that have resulted from
      ritual circumcision. Despite reports in the literature (<a
      href="#n6">6</a>, <a href="#n7">7</a>, <a
      href="#n9">9-12</a>, <a href="#n16">16</a>), it is difficult
      to obtain a clear picture of the true incidence of
      complications following circumcision, as there is no
      comprehensive documentation. Weiss (<a href="#n7">7</a>)
      suggests that the morbidity and mortality may be
      substantially higher in ritual than in non-ritual
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mohel is strictly governed by Jewish
      halachi law (<a href="#n18">18</a>). The first step in the
      ritual procedure is cutting off the prepuce, which has been
      drawn forward off of the glans from about the level of the
      corona. A &ldquo;shield&rdquo; or metal guard with a fine
      slit (<a href="#n">6</a>) is slid over the prepuce and
      directed downward and forward to protect the glans from the
      cutting knife and to reduce the risk of damage to the vessels
      of the frenulum. The forward direction of the guard also
      prevents denuding of the undersurface of the shaft. The
      second step involves tearing back the adherent preputial
      mucosa to expose the corona of the glans (<a
      href="#n6">6</a>, <a href="#n19">19</a>). This usually done
      with the nails of the thumb and forefinger. The final step is
      drawing blood from the cut penis before a dressing is
      applied. This step is regarded in religious writings as
      essential for the safety of the infant, is still sometimes
      done by mouth. An awareness of the risk of cross infection
      (<a href="#n7">7</a>) has read many reputable rabbinic
      authorities to recommend that the oral drawing of blood be
      performed only with a sterile glass tube placed over the cut
      penis. (<a href="#n18">18-20</a>). However some authors
      suggest that saliva may have special healing qualities.</p>

      <p class="text2">Slight bleeding during the first few hours
      after circumcision is common and may be explained by the lack
      of close approximation of the cut edges of the skin, which
      are usually brought together by a dressing and only rarely by
      a suture. Capillary, venous or, at times, arteriolar bleeding
      may occur; the former usually settles with a firm dressing,
      but the latter types may lead to exsanguinations if they are
      not treated promptly. (<a href="#n21">21</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">The amount of bleeding depends on how much
      raw area is left between the cut edges. If an ex [lacuna].
      This occurred in case 4. The amount of prepuce removed
      depends on the experience of the operator because with the
      ritual technique the amount can only be approximated. (<a
      href="#n5">5</a>). Undue emphasis is often placed on the
      speed with which the procedure is performed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Because sutures are not used during ritual
      circumcision, a tight dressing may be applied to control
      bleeding. This can lead to urethral compression, the
      retention of urine and to the complications illustrated in
      the first three cases.</p>

      <p class="text2">Many mohels apply antiseptic and coagulative
      powders to the wound to reduce the risk of bleeding; this was
      done in all our cases (<a href="#n6">6</a>). The dressing is
      often left undisturbed for many days (<a href="#n9">9</a>),
      again to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, the presence
      of a foreign body may increase the risk of infection,
      particularly if the circumcision is performed without
      adequate aseptic technique and with instruments and dressings
      that are inadequately sterilized. Oral contact may also
      introduce foreign organisms to an already traumatized area
      (<a href="#n7">7</a>), causing healing by second intention
      over days or weeks (<a href="#n7">7</a>, <a
      href="#n9">9</a>). Scarring of the preputial remnants, the
      occasional development of chordee and even meatal ulceration
      and stenosis have been described (<a href="#n5">5</a>, <a
      href="#n9">9</a>, <a href="#n13">13</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Additional complications may arise from
      faulty technique, as described by Schulman et al. (<a
      href="#n9">9</a>). In case 4, part of the glans was partially
      amputated and the undersurface of the shaft was denuded.
      There is no substitute for proper technique, which can come
      only from adequate training, supervision ad experience. (<a
      href="#n7">7</a>). The small number of infants circumcised by
      some operators may contribute to the morbidity described. The
      use of a shield or guard to separate the prepuce from the
      glans (<a href="#n6">6</a>, <a href="#n19">19</a>) protects
      the glans when the prepuce is cut, unless the tip of the
      glans is caught in the slit of the guard, as occurred in case
      4.</p>

      <p class="text2">If the wound is contaminated (often with
      local perineal organisms) and tightly dressed, compression of
      the urethra and tightly dressed, compression of the urethra
      and resultant urinary retention (<a href="#n9">9-12</a>) may
      lead to an ascending urinary tract infection and septicemia
      (<a href="#n22">22</a>). The compression [lacuna] There may
      also be a tendency among nursing and medical attendants to
      remain uninvolved when ritual circumicision is performed by a
      nonmedical person (<a href="#n5">5</a>) and vital signs of
      infection or other complications may be ignored. It is
      essential that a nonmedical mohel be able to recognize
      abnormal signs and seek appropriate medical attention for the
      infant. This is of even greater importance when the
      circumcision is performed at home.</p>

      <p class="text2">The excellent blood supply of the penis and
      healing powers of the neonate were demonstrated in our cases.
      Once the situation was recognized and appropriate treatment
      was commenced, recovery was rapid and complete.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="sc1">CONCLUSION</span><br />
       Despite the awareness of medical and religious authorities
      of the problems that may follow ritual circumcision, it is
      difficult, if not impossible to fully supervise the practice.
      (<a href="#n7">7</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">If a dressing is applied too tightly to a
      contaminated and infected wound and left on for too long, it
      can lead to compression of the urethra with resulting
      ascending urinary tract infection and the development of
      septicemia, meningitis, or pneumonia. The causative organisms
      are usually those found in the perineal area (<a
      href="#n15">15</a>). It is suggested that voiding subsequent
      to circumcision be carefully observed by the mohel and other
      attendants. In addition, removal of the original dressing on
      the day following the circumcision is highly desirable A
      second dressing with less tension may be applied if
      necessary, although application of 1% aqueoeus merbromin
      (M<span class="sc2">ERCUROCHROME</span><sup>&reg;</sup>) or
      povidone-iodine (B<span
      class="sc2">ETADINE</span><sup>&reg;</sup>) to any raw area
      may be all that is required.</p>

      <p class="text2">The London Initiation Society has shown in
      its publication (<a href="#n19">19</a>) that ritual
      circumcision can be carried out according to the strictest
      Jewish halachic law, and yet utilize aseptic surgical
      techniques with minimal morbidity, no mortality and primary
      healing.</p>
