      <p class="text1">S<font size="-2">INCE THE TURN</font> of the
      century, the operation of circumcision has been performed
      more and more frequently in the United States. Prior to 1900,
      an estimated 6.8 per cent of male infants were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> This number
      gradually increased to about 45 per cent through the
      1940's<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> According to a recent
      estimate, few male children born in this country are not
      circumcised during the neonatal period.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In spite of the high rate of circumcision,
      complications are uncommon, but include bleeding, infection,
      and removal of too much skin. Removal of too little skin
      usually becomes apparent a few years after circumcision; at
      this stage, the redundant prepuce is thickened, irregular,
      often adherent to the glans, and cosmetically objectionable
      to the parents. Injury to the glans penis is uncommon.</p>

      <p class="text2">Injury to the urethra during circumcision is
      very rare. Johnson<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> reported a
      case of urethral fistula following circumcision. Byars and
      Trier<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> reported 1 case of
      complete and 2 cases of partial urethral fistulae occurring
      following circumcision. A case of subglandular urethral
      fistula following neonatal circumcision is the basis for this
      report.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>CASE REPORT</b><br />
       D.S., a 7-year old Caucasian male child, was brought to the
      Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for "hypospadias." The
      parents stated that the child had voided in two streams ever
      since they remembered. One stream came from the tip of the
      penis and was directed forward; the other, a little larger,
      emerged from the under side of the penis and was directed
      downward. The child had undergone a circumcision on the third
      day of life. There was no history of any other surgery,
      injury, or illness. At birth no congenital abnormalities had
      been noted. The record of the circumcision states, "There was
      bleeding in the area of the frenum. This was controlled with
      some difficulty with a suture."</p>

      <p class="text2">Physical examination revealed a normal male
      child except for the penis, which had a normally placed
      urethral meatus and another circular opening about 4 mm. in
      diameter at the site of the frenum. A probe was easily passed
      into the fistulous opening from the normal urethral opening
      (Fig. 1) Laboratory data and an intravenous pyelogram were
      normal.</p>

      <p class="text2">A perineal urethrostomy was done. A circular
      incision was made 3 mm. from the margin of the fistular and a
      skin cuff raised. The fistula was closed by inverting the
      margins of this incision. A 1.5 cm. Incision was made on the
      anterior side of the scrotum and the margins of this were
      sutured to the margins of the raw area on the penis, in a
      Cecil fashion urethroplasty. Post-operatively, the child was
      given sulfsoxazole 0.5 Gm. twice daily The perineal
      urethrostomy tube was removed on the seventh postoperative
      day. On the ninth postoperative day the penis separated from
      the scotum for no apparent reason. The raw area on the
      under-surface of the penis was covered by a scab. The child
      was discharged. One month later the fistula was completely
      healed and the child was voiding in a single stream (Fig.
      2).</p>

      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The rarity of urethral injury during
      circumcision is probably due to the fact that this structure
      is situated in the midline ventrally, underlying only a small
      part of the circular operative field. Urethral injury seems
      more likely to occur when there is bleeding from the frenum
      and an attempt is made to control it with a suture. A suture
      placed too deeply may strangulate a part of the urethral
      wall, thus leading to the formation of a fistula.</p>

      <p class="text2">In attempting to repair such a fistula, it
      should be borne in mind that in a circumcision, little free
      skin is available, particularly in the area of the frenum.
      The method chosen for repair should therefore be the safest.
      Urinary diversion and a repair without tension appear to be
      desirable. In our patient the fistula healed in spite of an
      unexpected penoscrotal separation. We believe this complete
      healing can be attributed only to the safety measures taken
      during the initial procedure.</p>
