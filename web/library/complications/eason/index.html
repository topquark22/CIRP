        <h2>Male ritual circumcision resulting in acute renal
        failure</h2>

      <p><i>Male ritual circumcision is commonplace in the British
      community, especially among those of Jewish and Muslim faiths
      and certain immigrant populations such as West Africans. We
      report three cases of circumcision performed in the community
      in which the parents were not warned about complications and
      which resulted in prolonged urinary retention and acute renal
      failure.</i></p>

      <h3>Case reports</h3>
      <b>CASE 1</b> 

      <p class="text2">A 15 day old baby was admitted with a four
      day history of increasing vomiting and abdominal distension.
      After a normal pregnancy and birth he had been admitted to
      this hospital's special care baby unit for one day because of
      tachypnoea, grunting, and poor feeding. He had been
      circumcised by a local community rabbi at 11 days of age.
      Increasing vomiting and abdominal distension were
      subsequently noted, but he continued to feed well. His mother
      thought that he was passing urine normally.</p>

      <p class="text2">On physical examination he had a pulse rate
      of 140 beats/min, warm hands and feet, a blood pressure of
      77/52 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 28 per minute. The
      bladder was palpable above the umbilicus, but the abdomen
      wall was soft with normal bowel sounds. His penis was tightly
      bandaged, and the circumcision wound was inflammed and
      purulent. Table I shows the results of his initial renal
      function tests.</p>

      <p class="text2">After removal of the penile dressing the
      bladder was catheterised through the urethra and
      chloramphenicol ointment applied to the wound. A wound swab
      contained mixed Gram negative organisms on culture.
      Intravenous cefotaxime was also prescribed. Urine output was
      replaced hourly with 0.9% intravenous saline as his initial
      diuresis after relief of the urinary obstruction was large
      (1129 ml).</p>

      <p class="text2">The following day he became irritable with
      repetitive myoclonic jerking in his arms and legs.
      Anticonvulsants were given for three days, but no cause for
      the abnormal movements was found. Plasma electrolyte
      concentrations had returned to normal by that time (table
      II), but he was still polyuric (10 ml/kg/h). The jerking did
      not recur. The catheter was removed two days later, after
      which he voided a good urinary stream. At review one month
      later the wound had healed and he was thriving.</p>

      <p><b>CASE 2</b></p>

      <p class="text2">A male baby of Nigerian parents was born at
      this hospital at term after a normal pregnancy. At the age of
      1 month he was circumcised by a non-medical community
      practitioner at home. Two days later he began screaming and
      stopped feeding, be came jittery, and his parents noticed
      that his abdomen was distended; when seen in the accident and
      emergency department he had not passed urine for at least 16
      hours. On physical examination his pulse rate was 180
      beats/min, with a respiratory rate of 60-80 per minute; his
      abdomen was distended by the bladder, which was palpable
      above the umbilicus. His penis was swollen, and the tight
      penile dressing was covered with faeces. Initial
      investigations showed mild hyponatraemia and renal failure
      (table I); his urine was infected with Escherichia coli and
      Streptococcus faecalis. He was prescribed cefotaxime and
      flucloxacillin intravenously. He received an extra 3
      mmol/kg/day sodium chloride in his maintenance fluids (0.18%
      saline, 4% glucose). His plasma biochemistry and renal
      fuction tests improved rapidly (table II), and renal
      ultrasonography, micturating cystography, and renal scanning
      with radiolabelled dimercaptosuccinic acid subsequently gave
      normal results.</p>

      <p><b>CASE 3</b></p>

      <p class="text2">A Nigerian baby, who was a second twin, was
      born at 32 weeks' gestation by ventouse extraction after
      premature rupture of the membranes. He was cared for in the
      special care baby unit for 19 days. A urinary tract infection
      caused by S faecalis was diagnosed when he was 5 days old and
      was successfully treated; his renal function was normal.</p>

      <p class="text2">At 6 weeks of age (corrected gestational age
      39 weeks) he was circumcised by a community practitioner.
      Forty eight hours later he was admitted to this paediatric
      department with a history of postoperative irritability. His
      breathing had become distressed, he had had two episodes of
      apnoea with cyanosis and limpness. Some jerking of his left
      leg had occurred during the second episode. On physical
      examination his pulse rate was 130 beats/min, respiratory
      rate 70-80 per minute, and blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg. He had
      cold fingers and toes with bilateral leg oedema. His abdomen
      was grossly distended by the bladder which was palpable up to
      the umbilicus. The penile dressing was tight and the penile
      meatus blocked by paraffin gauze dressing placed over the
      glans, which looked infected. Table I shows his plasma
      electrolyte concentrations and renal function test results.
      He also had a moderate metabolic acidosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">The dressing was removed and the bladder
      catheterised through the urethra. Intravenous cefotaxime and
      flucloxacillin were started. A urine specimen grew
      streptococci. His urine was replaced hourly with 0.9% saline.
      His general condition, plasma electrolyte concentrations,
      metabolic acidosis, and renal function improved within 24
      hours (table II). Two weeks later his would had healed and
      renal scanning with radiolabelled dimercaptosuccinic acid
      showed no scarring.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text2">These three babies were admitted to Guy's
      Hospital over a period of two years with symptoms of
      dyspnoea, vomiting, and abdominal distension following
      circumcision. All were local children; in all cases the
      anuria had gone unnoticed (the parents of the baby in case 2
      realised that their son had not passed urine only after
      direct questioning).</p>

      <p class="text2">Male ritual circumcision is widely practised
      in the community and is generally regarded as safe. Indeed,
      it is the most widely practised surgical procedure in the
      world.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> One sixth of the male
      population has had a ritual circumcision, usually in infancy
      (among Jews) and in early childhood (among Muslims).
      Circumcision otherwise is uncommon in Europe and Scandinavia.
      Its merits have been periodically debated in the United
      Kingdom and the United States.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Medical indications for circumcision are
      recurrent balanitis, phimosis, paraphimosis, and a redundant
      prepuce <span class="cirp">[CIRP Note: sic--there is no such
      thing as a "redundant prepuce".]</span>. Common problems
      encountered with the procedure are bleeding, removal of too
      much skin, removal of too much or too little mucosa, untidy
      tags, previous circumcision in boys with hypospadias, fistula
      of the urethra, meatal stenosis, accidental amputation, and
      urinary retention.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2,3,4,5</a></sup> An
      excellent review of these and other less common postoperative
      complications has recently been published.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Little is ever mentioned about prolonged
      urinary obstruction due to overzealous bandaging or penile
      oedema. Our experience clearly shows that unless parents are
      given appropriate information about possible complications,
      such as anuria associated with urinary retention, the
      consequences could be fatal. Our patients developed
      considerable hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, and acute renal
      failure. Appropriate education of parents and community
      practitioners is clearly needed and would greatly reduce the
      risks.</p>
