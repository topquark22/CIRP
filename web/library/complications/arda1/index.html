      <p><font size="4"><b>Case report</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">A 5-day-old boy, weighing 3.4 kg, was
      circumcised at an outpatient clinic using the standard
      surgical technique. Prilocaine was administered
      subcutaneously (5 mg/kg) around the radix of the penis; there
      were no complications. He developed per-oral cyanosis 2 h
      after the circumcision and then general cyanosis; a physical
      examination showed no other abnormality. His haemoglobin
      level was 150 g/L, haematocrit 46%, white blood cell count
      7600/mm3, arterial pH 7.40, paO<sub>2</sub> 94.2 mmHg, and
      paCO<sub>2</sub> 26 mmHg. A chest X-ray was normal and
      electrophoresis showed a methaemoglobin level of 32.6%.
      Methylene blue (1 mg/kg in 1% saline) was infused
      intravenously when the cyanosis had not cleared after the
      application of nasal oxygen. The patient became symptom-free
      in an hour and methaemoglobin levels returned to normal in 8
      h.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Comment</b></font></p>

      <p class="text1">Methaemoglobin is one of the major
      side-effects of prilocaine use and occurs more frequently in
      newborns [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. The increased susceptibility
      of infants to prilocaine during the first week of life is
      related to high levels of fetal haemoglobin, which is
      oxidized more readily to the ferric state than is haemoglobin
      A, and the transient deficiency of cytochrome C5 reductase
      enzyme activity that persists for the first 3&ndash;4 months
      of life [<a href="#n2">2</a>]. Cyanosis appears within 6 h
      after the administration of prilocaine but may occur earlier
      in neonates when methaemoglobin levels are &gt; 15 g/100 mL,
      whereas recognizable cyanosis does not occur until the
      concentration is &gt; 35 g/100 mL. Nasal oxygen is applied in
      the treatment of mild methaemoglobinaemia and patients with
      methaemoglobin levels of &gt; 15&ndash;20% of total
      haemoglobin are treated with methylene blue (1 mg/kg) in 1%
      normal saline. A rapid decrease occurs within 2 h. As
      prilocaine hydrochloride may cause methaemoglobinaemia,
      particularly in newborns, such patients should be followed
      for at least 6 h. A topical anaesthetic, e.g. a eutectic
      mixture of local anaesthetic, can be a reliable
      alternative.</p>
