      <p>Thirty-six children have been treated for a
      non-hypospadiac urethral stricture. <span class="yellow">Of
      12 patients with meatal or submeatal stenosis, 10 had
      undergone circumcision for balanitis xerotica
      obliterans.</span> The strictures were successfully treated
      by meatoplasty or meatal dilatation. Twenty-four children had
      a more proximal urethral stricture: 16 were caused by
      urethral catheterisation, 4 were post-traumatic, 2 were
      congenital and 2 were idiopathic. Sixteen children were
      treated by visual urethrotomy; this was successful in 12
      after a maximum of 2 urethrotomies. Two children required 4
      or more urethrotomies and 2 required urethroplasty for
      restricturing. Seven children were treated by a formal
      urethroplasty. There were no complications. Two patients died
      of unrelated medical conditions. Follow-up was for a mean of
      2 years.</p>
