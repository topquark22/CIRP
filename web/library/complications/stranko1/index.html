      <h3 align="center">IMPETIGO IN NEWBORN MALE INFANTS
      ASSOCIATED<br />
       WITH A PLASTIC BELL CLAMP CIRCUMCISION</h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision remains the most common
      surgical procedure in the United States, despite any clear
      medical indication for its use. Usual methods of circumcision
      include the Gomco clamp and the plastic bell clamp. There
      also is renewed interest in the Mogen clamp, which was
      designed in 1954 and has a low complication rate.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Because the plastic bell clamp method
      is easy to perform, many doctors favor its use despite many
      complications that have been associated with its use. These
      include passive and prolonged retention of the device on the
      penis that has resulted in constriction of the glans,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> hemorrhage, local infection<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and septicemia.</p>

      <p class="text2">We report the possible association of
      bullous and non-bullous impetigo with use of the plastic bell
      clamp method of circumcision. To our knowledge this
      association has not been reported previously.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Subjects and methods.</b> Between July 1
      and August 30, 1982 and between August 1 and September 30,
      1984, eight cases of impetigo in infants younger than 1 month
      of age were reported to infection control personnel at <a
      href="http://www.geisinger.org/consumers/locations/gmc.html"
      target="_blank">Geisinger Medical Center</a>. (Table 1).
      These cases were subsequently reviewed in a case-controlled
      study, comparing method of circumcision, age at onset of
      symptoms, nursery personnel involved in the circumcision. And
      in the care of the infant, perinatal history, physical
      examination at birth and prior to discharge from the nursery,
      including therapy and outcome.</p>

      <p class="text2">The investigators defined bullous impetigo
      as a pustular, vesicular lesion surrounded by an erythematous
      base, located in the diaper area or lower abdomen. Nonbullous
      impetigo was defined as raised erythematous lesions with
      honey-colored crusts on the face, fingers or about the mouth
      and nose.</p>

      <p class="text2">Results. Four cases of bullous impetigo and
      two cases of nonbullous impetigo were reported between 7 and
      22 days after circumcision by the plastic bell clamp
      technique. That method of circumcision was discontinued until
      August and September, 1984, which time two additional cases
      occurred when a pediatrician, new to our institution, began
      using the plastic bell clamp method of circumcision. During
      that period 25 circumcisions were performed in the newborn
      nursery using this technique. No circumcisions were performed
      using the Gomco clamp during the same two time periods.</p>

      <p class="text2">All infants with impetigo were full-term
      white males. Pregnancy, labor and delivery were
      uncomplicated. At the time of discharge from our nursery all
      had a normal physical examination without evidence of
      cutaneous infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision in all cases was by the plastic
      bell clamp method performed under sterile conditions using
      iodophor preparation and sterile gowns, gloves, and masks.
      Vaseline<sup>&reg;</sup> gauze was not used on the two
      infants who had impetigo in 1984. Cultures of plastic bell
      clamps, Vaseline<sup>&reg;</sup> gauze, nursery personnel and
      other infants were performed and no source of infection was
      identified.</p>

      <p class="text2">The pediatric house staff performed the
      circumcisions under the supervision of a staff pediatrician.
      No consistent pattern as to who performed the circumcision
      was noted, and on one physician was directly involved with
      more than two infants.</p>

      <p class="text2">All infants were cared for in two adjoining
      nurseries using cohorting techniques by the same nursery
      personnel. There were no differences in lengths of
      hospitalization, feeding methods or instructions to parents
      regarding circumcision care and bathing, and all were private
      patients with similar socioeconomic status.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two infants required admission to our
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for suspected staphylococcus
      scalded skin sydrome. They were treated with intravenously
      administered methicillin for 10 days. The other six infants
      were treated with dicloxacillin given orally as
      outpatients.</p>

      <p class="text2">Five patients had <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i> cultured from the impetiginous area. Another
      infant had gram-positive cocci in clusters observed on a Gram
      stain smear of a lesion. Phage typing performed on 75% of the
      <i>S. aureus</i> isolates from infants and from nursing
      personnel failed to reveal a consistent pattern.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since September 1982, more than 1500
      circumcisions had been performed at our institution using the
      Gomco clamp. Two cases of impetigo have occurred in that
      group. Both were bullous impetigo and <i>S. aureus</i> was
      isolated from both patients; the two patients were in the
      newborn nursery at the same time. No other cases of impetigo
      or staphylococcus diseases have occurred in our newborn
      nursery. <span class="yellow">No cases of impetigo have
      occurred in newborn females at our institution in at least
      five years.</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Discussion.</b> Neonatal circumcision has
      been associated with numerous complications. Serious
      infections such as necrotizing fasciitis,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> generalized sepsis,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> meningitis<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> and osteomyelitis<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> have been reported. Other
      noninfectious complications include urinary retention,
      meatitis, chordee, cysts, lymphedema, urethral fistulas and
      necrosis of the glans or entire penis.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Staphylococcus scalded skin sydrome has been
      reported as a complication of circumciion.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> In three cases of staphylococcus
      scalded skin syndrome, <i>S. aureus</i> was recovered from
      cultures of the nasopharynx, throat, conjunctivae or
      circumcised area. Staphylococcus scalded skin sydrome is
      caused by release of an exotoxin that produces an
      intraepidermal separation of tissue. The result is
      erythematous, tender and desquamating areas of skin, usually
      with a positive Nikolsky&rsquo;s sign.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our search of the medical literature we
      have not found an association between circumcision and the
      occurrence of bullous or nonbullous impetigo. Bullous
      impetigo is a local form of disease caused by the same
      organism that produces exfoliation.</p>
