      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Circumcisions and cesarian sections are
      common procedures. Although complications to the newborn
      child fortunately are rare, it is important to emphasize the
      potential significance of this problem and its frequent
      iatrogenic etiology. The authors present 7 cases of
      genitourinary trauma in newborns, including surgical
      management and follow-up.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> The authors relate 7 recent cases of
      genitourinary trauma in newborns from a children's hospital
      in a major metropolitan area.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Case 1 and 2: Two infants suffered
      degloving injuries to both the prepuce and penile shaft from
      a Gomco clamp. Successful full-thickness skin grafting using
      the previously excised foreskin was used in 1 child. Case 3,
      4, and 5: A Mogen clamp caused glans injuries in 3 infants.
      In 2, hemorrhage from the severed glans was controlled with
      topical epinephrine; the glans healed with a flattened
      appearance. Another infant sustained a laceration ventrally,
      requiring a delayed modified meatal advancement glanoplasty
      to correct the injury. Case 6: A male infant suffered a
      ventral slit and division of the ventral urethra before
      placement of a Gomco clamp. Formal hypospadias repair was
      required. Case 7: An emergent cesarean section resulted in a
      grade 4-perineal laceration in a female infant. The vaginal
      tear caused by the surgeon's finger, extended up to the
      posterior insertion of the cervix and into the rectum. The
      infant successfully underwent an emergent multilayered
      repair.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Genitourinary trauma in the newborn is
      rare but often necessitates significant surgical
      intervention. <span class="yellow">Circumcision often is the
      causative event.</span> There has been only 1 prior report of
      a perineal injury similar to case 7, with a fatal
      outcome.</p>
