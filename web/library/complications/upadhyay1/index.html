      <p><b>AIMS:</b> To study the presentation of meatal stenosis
      as a complication of circumcision done in boys of neonatal or
      nappy age.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> A total of 50 patients were studied. These
      patients had meatotomy performed to treat meatal stenosis.
      All the patients had circumcision during the neonatal period
      or in the nappy age. Meatal stenosis was defined as change in
      the appearance of the delicate lips of the urinary meatus,
      with loss of elliptical shape to a circular shape because of
      fibrosis or scarring, with visually apparent narrowing.
      Patients with this appearance and no symptoms, but who had
      presented with a hernia, undescended testes or some other
      unassociated condition and had meatotomy were for the purpose
      of this study classed as the incidental group. Patients who
      were symptomatic and had the meatal stenosis as defined above
      were classed as the symptomatic group.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Sixteen patients (total n = 50) had the
      diagnosis of meatal stenosis made incidentally. Thirty four
      patients, (68% of the total treated by meatotomy) presented
      to the clinic, being symptomatic due to meatal stenosis. The
      median age at presentation of the symptomatic group was 48
      months (range 3 months-13 years) following circumcision. In
      all the symptomatic patients meatotomy alleviated the
      symptoms. All the operated patients were seen between one to
      three months following the operation and discharged. There
      were no late presentations with recurrence of meatal stenosis
      or complications of the treatment.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> <span class="yellow">Meatal stenosis is
      an under recognised complication of circumcision done in
      neonatal and nappy aged boys.</span> Symptomatic presentation
      from meatal stenosis can be very late.</p>
