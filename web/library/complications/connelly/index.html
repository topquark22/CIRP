      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="text1">Spontaneous rupture of a normal stomach is a
      rare event. Approximately 72 cases have been reported in
      adults,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and the problem is
      seldom encountered in pediatric centers. Gastric rupture in
      the newborn usually occurs within the first few days of life
      and is a known cause of pneumoperitoneum in the neonatal
      period.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Von Siebold is credited with reporting the
      first newborn with spontaneous stomach perforation in
      1826.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> In 1939, Thelander
      reviewed 85 cases of gastrointestinal perforation, including
      gastric rupture over a 114-year period and reported only one
      survivor.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> The first surgical
      survivor was reported in 1950,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      and in 1989 Tan et al recorded a 30% mortality in their
      series of 56 patients.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Recently in our hospital, a 2-day-old infant
      developed a spontaneous gastric rupture while undergoing a
      routine newborn circumcision.</p>

      <h4>CASE REPORT</h4>

      <p class="text1">This male infant was born after a 40-week
      gestation to an 18-year-old who experienced a benign prenatal
      course. Birth weight was 2,750 g. Labor lasted three hours,
      and he was delivered vaginally. The amniotic fluid was
      stained with meconium, and the infants, mouth and nasopharynx
      were suctioned with both bulb and DeLee trap. The stomach was
      not suctioned. Apgar scores were 9 at one minute and 9 at 5
      minutes. He was admitted to the well-baby nursery for routine
      care. He bottle-fed well and began urinating and defecating
      normally.</p>

      <p class="text1">On the second day of life, he was fed 4 oz.
      of formula at 5 a.m. and was given nothing else, since he was
      scheduled for circumcision. At about 10 a. m. he was
      restrained in a dorsal recumbent position on a circumcision
      board and began crying. After the infant had been crying
      vigorously and steadily for half an hour, his abdomen became
      distended and he vomited. A nasogastric tube was passed;
      gastric contents, including formula, were removed. The
      abdomen remained distended but was soft, with normal bowel
      sounds. He then underwent routine unanesthetized circumcision
      using a Gomco bell. He cried vehemently for a total period of
      about 90 minutes.</p>

      <p class="text1">At noon he refused to feed. On examination
      he showed increased abdominal distention and a tender,
      tympanitic abdomen. Bowel sounds were absent; a guaiac test
      for his stool was negative for occult blood.</p>

      <p class="text1">Radiographs of the abdomen were taken with
      the infant in the supine anterior-posterior (Figure 1) and in
      the prone, cross-table lateral position (Figure 2). They
      demonstrated a large amount of free intra peritoneal air. At
      operation, a gastric rupture was found in the midportion of
      the anterior gastric wall, with spillage of formula and
      gastric contents into the left upper abdominal quadrant. The
      rupture was repaired, and a catheter was placed as a
      gastrostomy tube. He remained without oral feedings for two
      weeks and was treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
      Nutrition was given through a central venous line. He started
      gastrostomy tube and oral feedings and did well, with good
      weight gain. He was discharged 25 days after birth and
      continues to do well.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">The cause of this baby's spontaneous rupture
      is not known. In 1943, Herbert presented his theory that the
      predisposing factor, is a congenital absence of the muscle
      layer of the stomach.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Shaw et
      al<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> refuted this in 1965,
      reporting that the muscle layer retracts at the rupture site,
      giving the appearance of an absent muscular layer.
      Lloyd,<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> in his 1969 study of 87
      cases of gastrointestinal perforation in newborns, postulated
      that perforations of the gastrointestinal tract were the
      result of ischemic necrosis related to an asphyxial defense
      mechanism due to stress, hypoxia, or shock. Eighty percent of
      his patients had experienced a significant episode of
      asphyxia or shock during the perinatal period.</p>

      <p class="text1">Our patient demonstrated no evidence of a
      congenital absent muscle layer, and there were no
      identifiable hypoxic perinatal events.</p>

      <p class="text1">Speculation, then, centers on the
      possibility that the baby cried hard enough and long enough
      and swallowed enough air to rupture the stomach. Rupture of a
      normal stomach has been known to occur because of increased
      intragastric pressure, with such contributing factors as
      overeating, overdrinking, fermentation of gastric contents,
      and aerophagia.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Hood<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> reported that in a supine subject,
      fluid would collect in the cardia and pylorus, the most
      dependent portions of the stomach. This creates a one-way
      fluid valve. As aerophagia occurs, the air is trapped and the
      pressure increases until the tensile strength of the stomach
      wall is exceeded.</p>

      <p class="text1">The above explanation has been supported by
      Shaker et al,<sup>2</sup> who reported that the stomachs of
      puppies can be forcibly ruptured by distention. These authors
      suggested, based on clinical observation, that a newborn baby
      might swallow enough air to produce gastric rupture.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">We assume the proximate
      cause of the gastric rupture in our patient was aerophagia
      secondary to prolonged vigorous crying. We are not aware of
      other cases documenting a temporal association of gastric
      rupture and circumcision-induced crying.</span> Routine
      newborn circumcision continues to be criticised because of
      its associated complications. Because of the potential for
      gastric rupture, we recommend infants spend a minimal amount
      of time on the restraint board and that consideration be
      given to the use of a penile nerve block or other anesthetics
      or analgesics for pain control.</p>
