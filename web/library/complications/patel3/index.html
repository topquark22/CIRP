      Hospital for Children</a>,<br />
      Boston, MA.</p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Circumcisions and cesarian sections are
      common procedures. Although complications to the newborn
      child fortunately are rare, it is important to emphasize the
      potential significance of this problem and its frequent
      iatrogenic etiology. The authors present 7 cases of
      genitourinary trauma in newborns, including surgical
      management and follow-up.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> The authors relate 7 recent cases of
      genitourinary trauma in newborns from a children's hospital
      in a major metropolitan area.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b><br />
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Case 1 and 2: Two infants suffered degloving injuries to
        both the prepuce and penile shaft from a Gomco clamp.
        Successful full-thickness skin grafting using the
        previously excised foreskin was used in 1 child.<br />
         Case 3, 4, and 5: A Mogen clamp caused glans injuries in 3
        infants. In 2, hemorrhage from the severed glans was
        controlled with topical epinephrine; the glans healed with
        a flattened appearance. Another infant sustained a
        laceration ventrally, requiring a delayed modified meatal
        advancement glanoplasty to correct the injury.<br />
        Case 6: A male infant suffered a ventral slit and division
        of the ventral urethra before placement of a Gomco clamp.
        Formal hypospadias repair was required. Case 7: An emergent
        cesarean section resulted in a grade 4-perineal laceration
        in a female infant. The vaginal tear caused by the
        surgeon's finger, extended up to the posterior insertion of
        the cervix and into the rectum. The infant successfully
        underwent an emergent multilayered repair.

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Genitourinary trauma in the newborn is
      rare but often necessitates significant surgical
      intervention. Circumcision often is the causative event.
      There has been only 1 prior report of a perineal injury
      similar to case 7, with a fatal outcome. J Pediatr Surg
