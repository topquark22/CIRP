              <b>Abstract</b> 
              <hr size="1" color="black" />
              <b>Background:</b> The number of infants managed for
              neonatal circumcision injuries in our unit has been
              on the increase over the past 16 years. In our search
              for the sources and reasons for these injuries, we
              were unable to identify any previous studies of
              circumcision injuries from our environment. We
              therefore decided to carry out this study in order to
              shed some light on this growing problem.<br />
              <br />
               <b>Methods:</b> The patients were made up of 370
              consecutive consented children attending our infant
              welfare clinic for immunization over a period of 3
              months. Information on their demographic data, their
              age at circumcision, where, why and who circumcised
              them was obtained from their mothers. They were
              clinically examined for the presence and type of
              complications of circumcision.<br />
              <br />
               <b>Results:</b> Our circumcision rate was 87%.
              Neonatal circumcision had been performed in 270
              (83.9%) of the children. Two hundred and fifty nine
              (80.7%) were performed in hospitals. The operation
              was done by nurses in 180 (55.9%), doctors in 113
              (35.1%) and by the traditional circumcisionist in 29
              (9%) of the children. Complications of circumcision
              occurred in 65 [20.2%] of the children. Of those who
              sustained these complications, 35 (53.8%) had
              redundant foreskin, 16 (24.6%) sustained excessive
              loss of foreskin, 11 (16.9%) had skin bridges, 2
              (3.1%) sustained amputation of the glans penis and 1
              (1.5%) had a buried penis. One of the two children
              who had amputation of the glans also had severe
              hemorrhage and was transfused. Even though the
              complications tended to be more likely with nurses
              than with doctors or traditional circumcisionists,
              this did not reach statistical significance (p =
              0.051).<br />
              <br />
               <b>Conclusion:</b> We have a very high rate of
              complications of circumcision of 20.2%. We suggest
              that training workshops should be organized to
              adequately retrain all practitioners of circumcision
              on the safe methods available.
