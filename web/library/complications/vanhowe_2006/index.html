      <h2>Incidence of meatal stenosis following neonatal
      circumcision in a primary care setting</h2>
      <b>Van Howe RS</b> 

      <p>Department of Pediatrics, <a
      href="http://humanmedicine.msu.edu/medical_education/community_campuses/campus4.asp"
       target="_blank">Michigan State University College of Human
      Medicine</a>, Marquette, Michigan, USA.</p>

      <p>The objective of this study was to prospectively document
      the incidence of meatal stenosis in boys. The study included
      a consecutive sample of boys whose visit with the physician
      included a genital examination in a private primary care
      pediatric practice in rural northern Wisconsin. Meatal
      stenosis was diagnosed in boys from 1.94 to 12.34 years of
      age. The diagnosis was made in 24 of 329 circumcised boys who
      were Tanner I development and older than 3 years of age
      (7.29%, 95%CI=4.48-10.10%). <span class="yellow">Nearly all
      required meatotomy to resolve their symptoms.</span> All of
      the boys with meatal stenosis were circumcised neonatally
      (exact OR=3.54, 95%CI=0.62-infinity). The ratio of
      circumcised boys to noncircumcised boys in this study
      provided 80% power to demonstrate a 21.4% difference in the
      incidence of meatal stenosis between circumcised and
      noncircumcised Tanner I boys 3 years and older. Meatal
      stenosis may be the most common complication following
      neonatal circumcision. The frequency of this complication and
      the need for surgical correction need to be disclosed as part
      of the informed consent for neonatal circumcision. A careful
      meatal examination is indicted in any circumcised boy with
      abdominal or urinary complaints</p>
