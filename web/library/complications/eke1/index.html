      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Although there is much consensus,
      certain controversies exist regarding the management of
      Fournier's gangrene.

      <p><b>METHOD:</b> Publications in English on
      Fournier's gangrene from January 1950 to September 1999 were
      obtained through the Medline database and relevant reference
      lists in publications. It was possible to identify 1726 cases
      for study. Data extracted for review included country of
      reported cases, number of patients in each report and
      relevant clinical features.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Fournier's gangrene occurs worldwide.
      However, its definition has generated considerable
      controversy as efforts are made to refine the original
      description in the light of increasingly understood
      aetiological factors. Attempts to classify the disease into
      primary and secondary forms have not been successful. The
      basic pathological process, necrotizing fasciitis, has been
      identified in the perineum of women and children, although
      the disease afflicts the male more often than the female.
      Most reported cases have occurred in the USA and Canada. The
      major sources of sepsis are the local skin, colon, anus and
      rectum, and the lower urinary tract. Colonic, anal and rectal
      sources carry the worst prognosis. Diabetes mellitus is
      important in aetiological terms. Rare causes include
      vasectomy and circumcision. Investigations are essential to
      define the cause of an episode but not for the diagnosis of
      the disease. Early aggressive treatment of Fournier's
      gangrene and underlying conditions is essential. Hyperbaric
      oxygen and honey are treatment modalities yet to be
      universally adopted. Risk of death, 16 per cent overall in
      this series, is related to the patient's condition at
      presentation.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Controversies over the definition of
      Fournier's gangrene persist but these do not affect the
      treatment options. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds.
      The occurrence of the disease in women is under-reported and
      may go unrecognized by some clinicians. Some treatment
      options, such as hyperbaric oxygenation and radical excision,
      remain controversial.</p>
