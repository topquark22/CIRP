        A prospective study was performed to evaluate neonatal
        staphylococcal pyoderma. Significantly more males returned

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: <i>Pyoderma</i> is a skin disease
      that produces pus.]</p>

      <p>Direct application of agar plates to skin is an effective
      method of detecting skin colonization.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> In addition. direct contact may make
      pos sible semiquantitative colony counts, as the agar surface
      is a replica of the organism distribution on the cultured
      skin.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Utilizing Rodac plates,
      Brown et al<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> demonstrated the
      superiority of direct contact over dry swab methods for
      monitoring colonization of infant skin by <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i>. Their data suggested that infants having
      quantitatively higher colony counts on direct agar-skin
      contact plates might be at a higher risk of developing
      staphylococcal skin disease.</p>

      <p>A prospective study was designed to evaluate the
      predictive value nf semiquantitative Rodac plate cultures to
      determine colonization of the newborn skin by <i>S.
      aureus</i> prior to discharge from the nursery.</p>

      <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>

      <p><b>Patients (infants).</b> A birth cohort of 158 infants,
      79 males and 79 females, was cultured by direct contact plate
      technique twice prior to discharge from the nursery. Informed
      consent was obtained from the parents of newborns prior to
      admission to the newborn nursery. The mean ages of infants at
      time of culture were one day and two and one-half days,
      corresponding to release from the nursery to rooming-in and
      discharge to home, respectively. A culture was taken at 72
      hours for all infants not ready for discharge on the third
      day of life. At the time of the second culture. all infants
      were assigned a return appointment for 10-14 days of age
      (mean time for follow-up cultures: 12.5 days).
      One-hundred-eighteen infants completed the entire protocol,
      56 males and 62 females.</p>

      <p><b>Direct Contact culture plates.</b> The nursery cultures
      were obtained by the direct agar-skin contact method, using
      Rodac plates containing five per cent sheep red blood cells
      (Clinical Standards Laboratories, Carson, Calif.). The agar
      surface of the plate was applied directly to the skin surface
      just to the right of the umbilicus. The agar surface was
      pressed down with even pressure and slight rocking motion to
      insure even distribution of agar-skin contact. Care was taken
      not to twist or slip the agar to prevent smudging the culture
      inocula on the agar surface. Follow-up swabs. Cultures were
      obtained from infants returning to the follow-up clinic,
      using dry cotton swabs to sample the skin just to the right
      of the umbilicus, Swabs were used since qualitative and not
      quantitative culture were desired. Swabs were cultured on
      blood agar and mannitol salt agar plates. Any disease lesions
      detected during this period were cultured by the same swab
      method.</p>

      <p><b>Staphylococcal isolates.</b> Organisms were identified
      on plates by colonial morphology and confirmed
      microscopically. Direct contact plates were counted after 24
      and 48 hours, and all staphylococcal isolates were tested for
      catalase, DNAase, and coagulase. All coagulase-positive
      staphylococci, except those isolated from disease lesions
      were phage typed by the Department of Health, State of
      Hawaii.</p>

      <p>During the study, the names of the patients were not known
      to the laboratory. All laboratory evaluations were done by
      culture numbers and reported back to the physician by number.
      The follow-up examinations were performed by physicians in
      the Well-Baby Clinic, or by staff pediatricians when infants
      presented with skin infections before their scheduled
      appointments. The physicians performing these examinations
      were unaware of previous culture findings.</p>

      <p><b>Statistics.</b> The statistical significance of the
      results was evaluated using the chi-square distribution with
      one degree of freedom. Results</p>

      <p><b>Colonization data.</b> Results of the first culture
      established an overall 5.7 per cent colonization rate.
      Overall colonization rate after the second cultures was 9.5
      per cent. The nursery colonization rate determined by an
      infant having at least one positive nursery culture was 13.3
      per cent (Table I).</p>

      <p><b>Results by sex.</b> Of 118 infants completing the
      protocol, 56 were males and 62 were females (Table II).
      Completing the study were 19 infants previously
      culture-positive in the nursery, nine males and ten females.
      At the time of follow-up examination. 16 of the 118 infants
      had evidence of staphylococcal colonization (positive
      cultures or disease). <span class="yellow">Thirteen of the 16
      colonized infants were, males (S. p &lt; 0.005), all
      circumcised.</span> Nine of 56 males (16 per cent) completing
      the study developed pyoderma, compared with two of 62 (three
      per cent) females (S, p &lt; 0.025). <span class="yellow">All
      nine males were circumcised.</span> Four of the nine males
      previously positive in the nursery by direct contact culture,
      returned with pyoderma (S. p &lt; 0.025). Neither of the two
      females with disease had positive cultures in the
      nursery.</p>

      <p><b>Results of colony count.</b> Significant overgrowth of
      skin flora Gram-negative organisms on the Rodac culture
      plates made quantitation of <i>S. aureus</i> colonies
      technically difficult. Probably as a consequence, there was
      no relationship between the actual semiquantitative colony
      counts of <i>S. aureus</i> and subsequent skin disease.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>This study did not confirm any superiority of quantitative
      culture over simple qualitative culture. However,
      colonization at some time during the stay in the newborn
      nursery place an infant at increased risk for staphylococcal
      skin disease. The phage typing data suggest that the source
      of the staphylococci is multiple rather than single.</p>

      <p>There was a difference between the colonization rate in
      the nursery and the disease rate when infants were compared
      according to sex. Although there was no statistical
      difference in the colonization rate while in the nursery,
      significantly more male infants returned with staphylococcal
      colonization and skin disease after discharge from the
      nursery.</p>

      <p>A larger study involving more infants is required to
      validate the finding of increased neonatal staphylococcal
      skin disease in males. That study should employ a more
      selective culture medium to enhance growth Gram-positive
      cocci and inhibit Gram-negative rods, facilitating
      quantitative colony counts of S. aureus.</p>

      <p>The disparity between the disease and colonization rates
      of male and female infants after discharge from the nursery
      was not foreseen. <span class="yellow">Circumcision, which is
      performed on approximately 90 per cent of male infants born
      in our hospital, may be a factor. Circumcision, by its very
      nature. requires more staff-patient "hands-on" contact, both
      during the procedure and during preoperative and
      postoperative care.</span></p>
