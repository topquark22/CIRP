      <h3>Early complications of circumcision performed in the
      community</h3>

      <p class="text1">Many circumcisions of male children are
      performed "in the community" by a variety of people,
      including some general practitioners.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The complication rate for "community
      circumcisions" is reported to be higher than that for those
      performed in hospitals.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> This is
      supported by an increase in the rate of complications when
      hospital circumcision rates reduce.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> The most frequent complication of
      circumcision is any setting is bleeding.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Between August 2001 and April 2003 we saw 31
      children with complications because of community performed
      circumcision. Their age range was from 4 weeks to 9 years
      (median 3 months). Nineteen boys had been circumcised with a
      Plastibell<sup>&reg;</sup> ring. Twenty-five children
      presented with bleeding from 4 hours to 6 days
      post-circumcision. Haemoglobin (recorded in 21 patients)
      ranged from 6.2-15.2 g/dl. Five patients received a blood
      transfusion. Ten children needed surgical intervention under
      general anaesthesia to secure haemostasis. Four children
      presented from 8-30 days post-circumcision with the
      Plastibell<sup>&reg;</sup> ring still <i>in situ</i>. Each
      had marked swelling of the glans and skin-mucosal dehiscence
      requiring recircumcision. A neonate presented 12 hours
      following Plastibell<sup>&reg;</sup> circumcision with a
      completely displaced ring; bleeding was minimal and so
      management was conservative. One child presented 5 days
      post-circumcision with a purulent infection that settled with
      oral antibiotics.</p>

      <p class="text2">Over 21 months, at least 31 children
      presented with complications of "community circumcision."
      Most children with bleeding were managed with compressive
      dressing alone, but a significant number required surgical
      haemostasis. Some of the infants had life-threatening blood
      loss requiring blood transfusion, which is not in itself
      without risk. The Plastibell<sup>&reg;</sup> ring, made by
      Hollister Incorporated, is used with good results.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> One source of bleeding was due to
      failure to tie the string tightly enough.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This problem was the cause of bleeding
      in one infant that we saw and was probably to blame in the
      case where the ring fell off prematurely. Vigilence when
      tying the string may prevent such complications.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Our report highlights some of the
      complications of circumcision in children, which all GPs
      should be aware of. Such complications are not unique to
      circumcisions performed in the community and some were
      reported by Shah <i>et al.</i> from their pioneering
      circumcision service in Bradford Hospitals NHS Trust.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> What is crucial is that the
      practitioner should be suitably experienced, give suitable
      analgesia, counsel the patients, and provide appropriate
      aftercare.<sup><a href="#n1">1,6</a></sup> We recommend that
      parents should be advised to seek medical attention if
      bleeding post-circumcision has filled the nappy or continues
      from more than 1 hour.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: Post-circumcision bleeding is
      an extremely serious matter. Infants have very little blood
      in their tiny bodies, so cannot tolerate blood loss. Bleeding
      can lead to exsanguination, followed by hypovolemic shock,
      followed by death. Post-circumcision bleeding requires
      immediate medical attention.]</p>
