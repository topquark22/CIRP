          Circumcision, the most common operation in male patients
          in the United States, is performed by a variety of health
          care professionals. Although not technically difficult,
          it results in a large number of reported and unreported
          complications annually. We report the successful
          reattachment of a distal penile glans, which was
          amputated when the Sheldon clamp was used for newborn
          circumcision. The literature is reviewed, and prevention
          and treatment of this type of circumcision injury are
          described.</font></p>

      Circumcision is the most common operation in male newborns in
      the United States.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">l</a></sup></font> In a nonritual setting its
      risks and benefits remain controversial. Although not
      technically difficult, it can result in complications ranging
      from insignificant to tragic. We describe the successful
      reattachment of a distal penile glans, which was amputated
      during newborn circumcision by a nonurologist specialist with
      the Sheldon clamp. We also discuss the potential
      complications of this procedure with suggestions for the
      prevention of injury.</p>

      <center>
        <p>CASE HISTORY</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      male newborn who was the product of an uncomplicated 38-week
      pregnancy underwent a guillotine type circumcision elsewhere
      with the Sheldon crushing clamp (fig. 1). Preoperatively the
      distal aspect of the penis was swabbed with alcohol and 0.5
      ml. 1% lidocaine solution was injected into the prepuce for
      local anesthesia.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> The prepuce-glans adhesions
      were broken with a hemostat and the foreskin was left in
      place over the glans. The Sheldon clamp was placed over the
      prepuce, and the foreskin was pulled through the clamp and
      crushed. A scalpel was used to excise the prepuce. <span
      class="yellow">It was immediately recognized that the distal
      third of the penile glans had been surgically
      amputated.</span> The excised tissue was wrapped in sterile
      saline soaked gauze, placed in a plastic bag and stored on an
      ice water slush bath for transport to our medical center.
      Approximate time from amputation to surgical reattachment was
      3 hours.</p>

      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Intraoperative examination revealed a viable penis with
      partial shaft skin loss, and clean excision of the foreskin
      and distal third of the glans (fig. 2, A). The glans and
      amputated tissue were debrided gently, and the corpus
      spongiosum and urethra were reanastomosed with 6zero chromic
      suture using loupe magnification (fig. 2, B). A 5F pediatric
      feeding tube was used to stent the urethra. The penile shaft
      skin was reapproximated with 4zero chromic suture and a bulky
      petrolatum gauze/mineral oil immobilizing dressing was
      applied. The patient was sedated and observed in the neonatal
      intensive care unit for 48 hours. Intravenous gentamicin and
      vancomycin were given during hospitalization, and oral first
      generation cephalosporin was continued for 1 week after
      discharge home. The urethral stent was removed after 3 weeks
      with 90% take of the graft. There was some skin loss at the
      coronal sulcus. Polymyxin B-bacitracin ointment was applied
      to the glans twice daily. At 3 months postoperatively the
      grafted glans tissue was mildly contracted but cosmesis was
      excellent overall and voiding was normal through the meatus
      (fig. 2, C), which easily accepted an 8F catheter.</p>

        <p>DISCUSSION</p>
      </center>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      the United States 65% of male newborns are circumcised.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> Indications
      have changed with time and now can be cultural, religious,
      medical or cosmetic. The many techniques of circumcision have
      a common goal: to remove equal amounts of inner and outer
      epithelial preputial tissue in a rapid, minimally traumatic
      and hemostatic fashion. The potential for complications
      during circumcision is real and ranges from the insignificant
      to the tragic. The fairly high rate (1.5 to 15%) reflects the
      fact that the procedure is often performed by an
      inexperienced individual without attention to basic surgical
      principles.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> Bleeding is common and can
      often be, controlled by pressure but occasionally
      necessitates a suture or cautery. Another common problem is a
      displeasing cosmetic result with too much or too little
      foreskin remaining, which can be avoided by carefully marking
      the skin to be removed with a pen at the beginning of the
      procedure. Occasionally penile shaft skin will be removed
      while the inner prepuce is left, forming a concealed penis
      that requires surgical released Most often this complication
      occurs when the surgeon fails to take down all of the
      glanular adhesions at the start of the operation. Infection
      occurs more frequently in postnatal circumcision, and can
      range from minor infection to sepsis and deaths No reports
      suggested the use of prophylactic antibiotics in all cases
      but aseptic technique should minimize the postoperative
      infection rate. Urinary retention, meatitis and meatal
      stenosis (the result of contact between the exposed meatus
      and ammonia in wet diapers) are common enough to warrant
      discussion with parents. The more serious but relatively
      uncommon problems of chordee and inclusion cysts may
      necessitate subsequent surgery.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> Lymphedema, glans necrosis and
      fistula formation have been reported.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9-l3</a></sup></font> Iatrogenic hypospadias
      and/or epispadias can occur when an incision down the
      foreskin is inadvertently extended into the urethra.
      Complaints of erectile dysfunction and psychosocial problems
      in adulthood have been attributed to circumcision, but they
      are largely unsubstantiated.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n14">l4,l5</a></sup></font> In retrospect, it is
      apparent that in our case the glans was inadvertently caught
      in the circumcision clamp when engaged and the distal aspect
      of the penis was excised during foreskin removal. This
      complication could have been avoided with careful retraction
      of the foreskin during placement of the Sheldon clamp over
      the glans and subsequent preputial excision. Excision of the
      penile glans is not common with only 1 previous case of
      penile excision with successful repair reported.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: This paper was published in 1994.
      Several reports of erectile dysfunction following
      circumcision have been published in the medical literature
      since the publication of this paper. For more information,
      see <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/sex_function/">Foreskin
      Sexual Function/Circumcision Sexual Dysfunction</a>.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
      believe that glanular amputation should be treated according
      to standard principles of grafting in reconstructive
      surgery.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> The amputated tissue is best
      transferred in moist gauze, chilled but not in direct contact
      with ice, which might freeze the tissue. Intraoperative
      debridement allows neovascularization, and immobilization
      with a bulky dressing is important to allow imbibition and
      inosculation. Due to the relatively poor blood supply of the
      amputated tissues, antibiotics are appropriate to help
      prevent infection. The duration of urethral stenting should
      be sufficient to allow good take of the grafted tissue.
      Fortunately the distal glans tissue is well vascularized and
      so good graft take is common. The most common complication
      after anastomosis is meatal stenosis, necessitating dilation
      or revision.</p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      our case circumcision was performed by a specialist (although
      a nonurologist) with experience of more than 300
      circumcisions with the Sheldon clamp and no previous
      complications. Urologists perform few neonatal circumcisions
      but are often asked to treat the complications. Most
      circumcision injuries, including glans amputation, can be
      successfully managed with aggressive treatment.</p>
