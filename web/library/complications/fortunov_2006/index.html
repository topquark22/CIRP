      <h2>CASE REPORT</h2>

      <p class="text2">A 3150-g black infant was admitted to TCH
      [Texas Children's Hospital] at 27 days of age for
      inconsolable crying, fever (38.9&deg;C), and 6 days of
      increasing respiratory distress. Medical history revealed an
      uncomplicated 38-week pregnancy, vaginal delivery, unknown
      maternal group B <i>Streptococcus</i> status, normal prenatal
      laboratory results, and <span
      class="yellow">circumcision.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Chest radiograph and ultrasound showed a
      large complex right pleural effusion with septations and
      internal debris surrounding an area of lung consolidation
      resulting in mediastinal shift (Fig 1 A and B). Blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained for culture. A
      thoracentesis revealed pleural fluid with Gram-positive cocci
      in clusters on Gram-stain. The infant was admitted negative.
      Rapid viral studies for respiratory syncytial virus and
      influenza as well as viral culture were also negative. Both
      pleural fluid cultures grew <span class="yellow">MRSA</span>
      susceptible to clindamycin. After antibiotic susceptibilities
      were available, 14 total days of therapy was completed with
      clindamycin alone through day-of-age 42.</p>

           Imaging of CA MRSA right-sided pneumonia and empyema.
          Shown are a chest radiograph (A) and ultrasound (B)
          performed on admission and chest computed tomography (C)
          after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with chest
          tube placement. Arrows indicate loculated fluid.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text2">The final chest tube was removed on
      day-of-age 31. Follow-up chest computed tomography on
      day-of-age 44 showed right-sided atelectasis and
      consolidation as well as fluid pockets in the right upper
      lobe suspicious for lung necrosis. The empyema was decreased
      in size (Fig 1C). After showing normal results from a
      nitroblue tetrazolium test, he was discharged on day-of-age
      47.</p>
