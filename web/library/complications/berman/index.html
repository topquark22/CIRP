      <b>Urinary Retention Due to Ritual Circumcision</b> 

      <p>To the Editor:</p>

      <p>The rare complication or urethral obstruction due to
      ritual circumcision (brit melah), so aptly described by Frand
      et al.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> is more often seen in
      Israel in general practice than in hospital practice. During
      a four-year period in the pediatric department of the same
      hospital no such complication were seen but subsequently, in
      1968 while working in part-time pediatric practice, I saw two
      such cases. The signs and symptoms were very similar to those
      described, but very striking and worrisome to the parents was
      the fact that no urination had occurred since the time of the
      circumcision. Release of the circular bandage gave dramatic
      relief of all the sign and symptoms of urinary
      obstruction.</p>

      <p>Weiss in his survey of ritual circumcision revealed that
      "accidents" frequently occur in the hands of <i>mohalim</i>
      (performers of ritual circumcision),<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> but these are seldom reported in the
      medical literature or in Jewish sources. Stenosis of the
      meatus was included among "some recent bad results" that were
      reported to him.</p>

      <p>A popular method of ritual circumcision still in use is
      the shield magen which, by clamping the prepuce, reduces the
      vascularity of the area where the incision is made. The
      natural clotting mechanism and temporary pressure applied in
      the area by the <i>mohel</i> usually causes adequate
      hemostasis. The vaseline-coated circular bandage is applied
      primarily as a protective covering to the circumcised area
      which remains red and tender for some days. If the infant is
      a "bleeder," the <i>mohel</i> will tighten this bandage to
      aid in hemostasis. The <i>mohel</i> is well aware that this
      bandage can constrict the urethra and will take care to
      prevent this. Unfortunately, at times this complication does
      occur. Parents who relate their infant's symptoms to the
      circumcision usually consult the <i>mohel</i> first, while
      others will see their pediatrician and some will visit the
      hospital emergency room.</p>
