      <p class="abstract"><span class="1"><b>ABSTRACT</b></span>. A
      massive outbreak of the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
      due to an organism with an unusual phage pattern, occurred
      during a 115-day period and involved 68 newborns. Generalized
      exfoliative dermatitis was seen in 24 babies, and
      <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was isolated from 23. Fourteen
      isolates were phage typed, with 13 reported as the epidemic
      strain 29/79/80/3A/3C/54/75. Eight babies had generalized
      scarlatiniform eruption without exfoliation (staphylococcal
      scarlet fever). Cultural data were available from six, all
      positive for <i>S. aureus</i>. Four organisms were typed and
      reported as the epidemic strain. Of 34 infants with bullous
      impetigo 20 had cultures that were positive for <i>S.
      aureus</i>, and four were phage typed, revealing the epidemic
      strain. Illness was mild in all patients; there were no
      deaths and no invasive forms of staphylococcal infection.
      <span class="yellow">The male to female ratio of generalized
      exfoliative disease was 5:1.</span> The concept of a neonatal
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, comprised of a triad of
      skin disorders induced by an exotoxin elaborated by certain
      strains of coagulase positive <i>S. aureus</i>, is confirmed.

      <p class="text2">Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)
      typically occurs as isolated cases, occasionally in small
      clusters, with the largest epidemic previously reported
      consisting of 8 patients.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The
      purpose of this paper is to describe a massive outbreak of
      the disorders comprising the &ldquo;expanded&rdquo;
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> that involved 68 newborns due to an
      epidemic strain (ES) organism with an unusually phage
      pattern.</p>

      <h4>DESCRIPTION OF EPIDEMIC</h4>

      <p class="text2">The year of the outbreak 6,000 newborns were
      delivered at Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital, Jersey City,
      NW. The newborn units consisted of five regular nurseries,
      each containing 25 bassinets: Nursery 4 South (N4S), Nursery
      4 Central (N4C), Nursery 4 North (N4N), and Nursery 5 South
      (N5S). An isolation unit (IU) with 20 bassinets was located
      on the 6th floor, along with a Premature Unit.</p>

      <p class="text2">Between March 22 and April 3, three cases of
      exfoliative dermatitis occurred in N4S. Penicillin-sensitive
      coagulase-positive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was cultured
      from swabs of the nose, eyes, and skin of these babies.
      During the same period, two newborns were seen in clinic
      vesicobullous impetigo. No cases of staphylococcus infection
      were seen for the next 17 days, until April 20 when three
      newborns with erythema, exfoliation, and positive
      Nikolsky&rsquo;s sign were admitted to the IU from the
      clinic. This signalled an acceleration of cases of
      staphylococcal skin disease from N4S, and 60 cases were seen
      from April 20 to June 20. The last case of exfoliative skin
      disease was seen on June 20, followed by three scattered
      cases of bullous impetigo, the last on July 14, terminating
      the outbreak. The epidemic encompassed a period of 115 days
      and involved 68 cases of three variants of the neonatal SSSS
      in babies 4 to 15 days old.</p>

      <h4>MANAGEMENT OF OUTBREAK</h4>

      <p class="text2">Beginning on May 29, intensive bacteriologic
      surveys were made of cultures from newborns, personnel, and
      the nursery environment. On June 6 N4S was closed for six
      weeks, scrubbed and repainted. All newborns were bathed once
      daily with a 3% hexachlorophene preparation (pHisoHex,
      Winthrop Laboratories) and a
      polymycin-B-bacitracitin-neomycin ointment (Neosporin
      ointment, Burroughs Wellcome Co) was applied to the nares,
      axillae, and umbilical stumps. Mothers were instructed to
      continue daily hexochlorophene bathing and told to report any
      skin rash or illness in the babies or other family
      members.</p>

      <h4>CLINICAL FINDINGS</h4>

      <p class="text2">The 68 patients in this report all were seen
      with one of the disorders comprising the triad of the
      expanded scalded skin syndrome:<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      (1) generalized exfoliative disease (Ritters), (2)
      generalized scarlatiniform eruption without exfoliation
      (staphylococcal scarlet fever), and bullous impetigo. Among
      the 68 babies, only five had other forms of infection due to
      the epidemic strain&mdash;four had purulent conjunctivitis
      and one had breast abscess. All five of these patients had
      generalized exfoliative disease. There were no cases of
      sepsis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, meningitis, omphalitis,
      cellulitis, or furunculosis.</p>

      <h4>Generalized Exfoliative Disease</h4>

          newborn with generalized exfoliative disease.</span></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text2">The clinical features of generalized
      exfoliative disease (Table) corresponded closely to the
      description by Rittershain and others.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-30</a></sup> The signs and clinical course of
      the disease were similar in the 26 infants, who ranged in age
      from 4 to 14 days. Onset was abrupt, with erythema, often
      first visible on the face, that involved the entire body
      within 24 hours. The ereythema blanched with pressure, and in
      many babies the skin was tender to touch. Within 24 to 48
      hours the skin became wrinkled, or flat bullae containing
      clear fluid appeared in various locations, most commonly the
      face, distal extremities, and diaper area. (Fig 1). Over a
      period of two or three days the skin exfoliated in large
      sheets, exposing a red moist surface. The most denuded areas
      dried rapidly, soon appearing hyperkeratotic, with
      desquamation of large flakes for several days (Fig 2). The
      erythematous areas that did not exfoliate showed coarse
      desquamation for as long as ten days. The skin appeared
      normal ten to 14 days after onset. The number, size, and
      distribution of the areas of exfoliation varied. In nine
      infants exfoliation was generalized, and four of these
      patients were among the most toxic in the series. The face
      was involved in 22, the trunk in 20 and the extremities in 12
      infants. Exfoliation was often distal on the extremities,
      involving limited, well-demarcated areas such as the heel.
      (Fig 3). No mucous membrane lesions were seen. Fever was not
      a remarkable feature; as observed in only 11 infants, fever
      was mostly low grade and transient, lasting 48 hours or less
      in seven of the infants. Two babies had elevation to 104 F
      (rectal), one for 24 hours and the other for 48 hours. Both
      of these patients experienced transient diarrhea. A single
      newborn had a low grade fever for six days, but showed no
      other signs of systemic disease. For the most part,
      generalized exfoliative disease was a mild, uncomplicated
      disorder. There were no deaths. While several of the infants
      appeared irritable during the periods of erythema and
      exfoliation, most showed no other signs of illness. Two
      patients developed deep, ulcerative lesions at sites of
      exfoliation, on on the heel (Fig 3), the other on the knee.
      The latter required skin grafting. Only two infants were
      anorectic and received intravenous fluids, both with
      generalized exfoliation and a prolonged course. A
      hospitalized baby developed tetany. Four patients had
      purulent conjunctivitis, but the ES organism was obtained
      from the conjunctival sacs of four others who did not develop
      clinically apparent eye infection. One breast abscess
      required incision and drainage. <span class="yellow">The male
      to female ratio of exfoliative disease was 5.5:1.</span> Of
      the 26 babies, exfoliation was less than generalized in 17,
      commonly involving the face, or the acral areas, with
      exfoliation of large sheets of skin from the glove or sock
      areas.</p>

      <h4>Generalized Scarlatiniform Eruption without
      Exfoliation</h4>

      <p class="text2">Generalized scarlatiniform eruption without
      exfoliation was observed in eight newborns. All were afebrile
      and showed no signs of illness other than generalized
      erythema, with no lysis of the epidermis. The rash resembled
      streptococcal scarlet fever, including non-blanching
      accentuation of the erythema in the flexion creases.
      Pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, strawberry tongue, or palatal
      petechiae were not seen. Nikolsky&rsquo;s sign was negative.
      Healing was by coarse desquamation over a period of five or
      ten days. The male to female ration was 1.5:1. The
      designation generalized scarlatiniform exfoliation seems more
      appropriate than scarlet fever, since the other signs of
      scarlet fever (most notably fever) were not present in the
      staphylococcal illnesses in this series.</p>

      <h4>Bullous Impetigo</h4>

      <p class="text2">Bullous impetigo was noted in 34 babies. The
      bullae were small, flaccid, and well-demarcated, and
      contained clear or cloudy yellow fluid. The skin between
      lesions appeared normal. All infants were afebrile and
      otherwise well, but several observers noted a faint transient
      erythema of the face in some patients. Recovery was rapid,
      the lesions resolving over three to five days, with fine
      desquamation noted in eight infants. The male to female ratio
      was 1:1.</p>

      <p class="text2">Treatment consisted of debriding the
      separated skin and cleansing with a 3% hexochlorophen sudsing
      emulsion (pHisoHex) three times daily. After careful rinsing
      with tap water, the skin was dried and an antibiotic ointment
      (Neosporin ointment) was applied to denuded areas. Systemic
      antibiotics, notably penicillin and nafcillin, or penicillin
      and kanamycin, and later, when the nature of the illness was
      recognized and the organism identified as sensitive,
      penicillin alone, were administered for a minimum of ten
      days. Topical or systemic steroids were not used. A total of
      41 babies were admitted, 222 of 26 with scarlatiniform
      eruption and 11 of 34 with bullous impetigo.</p>

      <h4>LABORATORY FINDINGS</h4>

      <p class="text2">White blood cell counts, hematocrits, and
      urinalyses were normal, as were chest radiographs of all
      inpatients. Cultures were obtained from various sites in 50
      of the 68 infants. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, coagulase
      positive, were isolated, usually from several sites, from 23
      of the 24 babies with generalized exfoliative disease
      cultured. But the ES organism was obtained from exfoliating
      skin sites in only ten of those infants. Fourteen of the
      coagulase-positive organisms were submitted for phage typing,
      and 13 were reported as 29/79/80/3A/3C/54/75, an unusual
      pattern not previously noted in cases of SSSS. One organism
      was type 53, a gourp III phage type not previously associated
      with SSS and probably not the causative mechanism in this
      case. Of the eight infants with scarlatiniform eruption
      without exfoliation, cultural data was available from six,
      all positive for <i>S. aureus</i> from sites other than the
      skin (nose, throat, eye, umbilical stump). Four of the
      organisms were typed and all were reported as the ES. Of the
      34 patients with bullous impetigo, 20 cultures were taken and
      all were positive for coagulase-positive <i>S. aureus</i>.
      The organisms were obtained from the skin lesions in all.
      Four were typed and all revealed the ES pattern. Of the 68
      patients, cultural data were available from 50, and a
      coagulase-positive S aureus was obtained from 48. Twenty-two
      of the organisms were phage typed and 21 were
      29/79/80/3A/3C/54/75.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">The association of phage group II
      staphylococci with three skin disorders in neonates and young
      infants, less commonly in older children, and rarely in
      adults,<sup><a href="#n35">35,36</a></sup> has been
      established. The triad of dermatologic manifestations, termed
      the expanded scalded skin syndrome by Melish and
      Glasgow,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> includes generalized
      exfoliative disease, generalized scarlatiniform eruption
      without exfoliation and bullous impetigo. A number of
      studies<sup><a href="#n22">22</a>, <a
      href="#n37">37-42</a></sup> have identified an extracellular
      protein toxic produce from group II staphylococci that
      induces cleavage within the granular layer of the epidermis
      and exfoliation of the skin of newborn mice that is
      indistinguishable from that seen in human patients.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Review of the literature reveals a variety
      of phage patterns associated with SSSS in neonates, infants,
      and children, with members of group II almost always present,
      and phages 71, 55, 3c and 3A predominant. Of the 26 reported
      types, members from group I were present in six, with phages
      from III in seven patterns. The epidemic strain in this
      report was lysed by the largest group of phages, with
      representatives in all three groups. When antibiotic
      sensitivities were reported in previous series, there was a
      predominance of strains resistant to penicillin (10:6).</p>

      <p class="text2">The present report confirms the concept of
      Melish and Glasgow<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> of an
      expanded staphylococcal skin syndrome, and demonstrates that
      the three variants can occur in a large outbreak caused by
      one epidemic strain. Whereas bullous impetigo is a common
      manifestation of skin infection by a variety of
      staphylococcal types in neonates, Margileth&rsquo;s statement
      that bullous impetigo &ldquo;should not be included in the
      SSSS&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> is refuted by the
      evidence presented in this report that the three disorders
      are related clinically and etiologically.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The preponderance of
      males with generalized exfoliative disease (5:1) suggests
      that the circumcision wound may provide a site of
      colonization for staphylococci that would result in an
      increased incidence of SSSS in males.<sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup> This is not supported by our male to
      female ratios of 1.3:1 and 1:1 for scarlatiniform eruption
      and bullous impetigo.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Steroids were not administered to any of the
      infants. Rudolph et al.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup>
      reported rapid progression of generalized exfoliative disease
      in babies who were initially treated with steroids. While
      there is no evidence that steroids influence the action of
      the exotoxin on the skin, they may interfere with the
      host&rsquo;s inflammatory response to the organisms,
      enhancing the production of toxin, and, perhaps, the
      invasivness of the bacteria.</p>

      <p class="text2">Rasmussen<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup>
      reported 112 negative blood cultures from 83 patients with
      the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and concluded that
      the organisms were noninvasive, proliferating on skin and
      mucous membranes only, and that the course of the disease was
      not altered by administration of antibiotics. Rudolph et
      al<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> concluded from their
      series that appropriate antibiotic therapy resulted in rapid
      resolution of the signs and symptoms of SSSS. In the present
      series, blood cultures were obtained from 41 patients (22
      with exfoliative disease, eight with scarlatiniform eruption,
      and 11 with bullous impetigo); the ES was isolated from one,
      the youngest infant in the outbreak, who developed
      exfoliative disease on day four and experienced a mild
      illness without fever or other signs of systemic disease. Our
      experience corresponds with that of Rasmussen,<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> and suggests that the organisms that
      produce SSSS are usually noninvasive and that antibiotic
      therapy is probably not helpful in most cases. However, in
      reported cases the virulence of the organism varies, as does
      the ability of individual infants to localize the infection
      and tolerate the effects of liberated toxin. Also,
      administration of antibiotic will minimize hospital and
      community spread of the bacteria. At his stage of our
      knowledge, it would seem wise to treat newborns with SSSS
      with systemic antibacterials, based on cultural and
      sensitivity data. Margileth<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>
      recommends that a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should
      be given to infants under 1 year of age, pending results of
      the bacteriologic studies.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This report was prepared in 1979
      and published in 1980. It appears that the authors were not
      completely convinced at that time that the circumcision wound
      is a portal of entry for the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>
      pathogen in circumcised boys. Later studies have firmly
      established that the circumcision wound is a portal of entry
      for the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> pathogen. Today, one may
      be confident that open circumcision wound greatly increases
      the incidence of staphylococcus infection in newborn boys who
      are circumcised.]</p>

      <h4>SPECULATION AND RELEVANCE</h4>

      <p class="text2">This report confirms the concept of an
      expanded staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome comprised of
      three disorders with a common etiology, and it demonstrates
      that the three can occur together in a single outbreak. The
      factors that determine which variety of SSSS will manifest
      are unknown. <span class="yellow">The male to female ratio of
      generalized exfoliative disease was 5.5:1, while the male to
      female ratios of scarlatiniform eruption and bullous impetigo
      were 1.5:1 and 1:1 respectively. We speculate that the three
      variants represent differences in the severity of the disease
      that are largely determined by the amounts of exotoxin that
      are produced and absorbed, and the latter depends not only on
      the number, but also on the types of body sites that are
      colonized (intact skin, mucous membranes, wounds). Localized
      skin involvement results in the mildest form, bullous
      impetigo, whereas mucous membrane colonization produces
      generalized scarlatiniform eruption. The circumcision wound
      is a site conducive not only to rapid bacterial growth, but
      also to rapid absorption of exotoxin, and this could account
      for the strikingly higher incidence of the severest form,
      generalized exfoliative disease, in male newborns.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Significant features of the reported
      epidemic are (1) the large numbers of patients with a disease
      that usually occurs as isolated cases or small clusters, (2)
      the mildness of the disease in all patients, (3) the absence
      of invasive forms of the disease and scarlatiniform eruption,
      and (5) the high incidence of localized exfoliation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Rasmussen and Koblenzer<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> reported a dramatic increase in the
      incidence of SSSS. <span class="yellow">It is possible that
      new strains, with greater virulence, will emerge as causative
      organisms in future outbreaks.</span> With our present
      knowledge of the clinical features of pathogenisis of SSSS,
      prompt recognition and effective management are possible.</p>
