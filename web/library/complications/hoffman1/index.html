      <h2>NEONATAL STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PUSTULOUS RASH OUTBREAK
      LINKED BY MOLECULAR TYPING TO COLONIZED HEATHCARE
      WORKERS.</h2>

      <p>In Aug 1998, a 150-bed naval hospital in eastern North
      Carolina identified an outbreak in the newborn nursery. Cases
      were <span class="yellow">newborn males who had undergone a
      circumcision procedure</span> and post-discharge required
      antimicrobial treatment for severe pustulous diaper rash. A
      total of 36 cases were identified from Aug to Jan 1999. All
      17 cases that were cultured grew methicillin-sensitive,
      erythromycin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.
      Extensive environmental culturing of the nursery unit and
      circumcision procedure equipment did not reveal an inanimate
      reservoir for the <i>S. aureus</i>. Initial infection control
      measures (Aug) to review aseptic technique and instrument
      sterilization procedures were ineffective. In Jan additional
      control measures included enforcement of glove wearing for
      all diaper changes and limited post-circumcision care to one
      healthcare worker (HCW) per newborn. In Feb all HCWs (MDs,
      RNs, LPN and corpmen) were cultured by anterior nasal swabs
      and hand swab cultures. Fourteen (14) HCWs had positive
      cultures identified with <i>S. aureus</i>. Pulse field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed on 13 of the 17 case
      isolates. All 13 case isolates were identical. All 14 HCWs
      identified with <i>S. aureus</i> were compared to the &gt;13
      cases by PFGE, and 3 HCWs (2 RN, 1 LPN) matched identically.
      One of these HCWs had a chronic cough, and a second had
      concealed dermatititis. This suggests that these DCWs were
      disseminators in light of the prolonged nature of the
      outbreak. Antimicrobial decolonization was instituted for the
      HCWs and there was one additional case in Mar. In conclusion,
      HCWs identified by DNA testing may have represented the
      reservoir of infection in this outbreak.</p>
