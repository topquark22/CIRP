      <h2>The frequency of foreskin problems in uncircumcised
      children</h2>

      <p><b>L. W. Herzog and S. R. Alvarez</b></p>

      <p>Division of Ambulatory Pediatrics, <a
      href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/"
      target="_blank">Children's Hospital</a>, Boston, Mass.
      02115.</p>

      <p>We performed a retrospective survey to determine the
      frequency of problems of the foreskin among uncircumcised
      children. Among 545 boys aged 4 months to 12 years, there
      were 272 uncircumcised boys and 273 control patients who were
      circumcised at birth. The total frequency of complications
      was significantly higher in the uncircumcised group (14% vs
      6%). Both balanitis (6% vs 3%) and irritation (4% vs 1%) were
      more frequent among the uncircumcised children, but the
      difference was not statistically significant. Problems with
      adhesions were uncommon (1.5%) and equal in both groups.
      Symptomatic phimosis was seen in eight patients. The
      frequency of medical visits for penile problems was
      significantly higher in the uncircumcised group (10% vs 5%).
      Although the overall frequency of complications was higher
      among the uncircumcised children, <span class="yellow">most
      of the problems were minor.</span></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: The control group for this
      study was composed of boys who had been circumcised. In other
      words, they did not have foreskins. One would expect the
      incidence of foreskin problems in such a group to be zero.
      However, some foreskin problems were noted. A group without
      foreskins seems an unsatisfactory control group with which to
      compare the incidence of foreskin problems. Retrospective
      studies are inherently limited in their ability to control
      for confounding factors, such as type of hygienic care.]</p>
