      <h1>Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome</h1>

      <h3>A complication of circumcision.</h3>

      <p><b>David Annunziato, MD, Louis M. Goldblum, DO.</b></p>

      <p class="abstract">&bull; Numerous complications have been
      reported as a result of neonatal circumcision. We describe
      here three cases of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome that
      were thought to be due to <span class="yellow">infected
      circumcisions.</span> A review of the literature failed to
      disclose descriptions of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
      as such a complication. In spite of recent American Academy
      of Pediatrics recommendations against routine circumcision,
      it will continue to be a common procedure. Careful
      preoperative and postoperative screening and guidance are
      urged to prevent staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and
      other complications.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcision is the most common
      surgical procedure in the United States today. Many
      complications have been reported to be associated with this
      procedure. Recently, we encountered two cases of
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome as complications of
      circumcision in otherwise healthy full-term infants. Each
      case had the essential clinical features of staphylococcal
      scalded skin syndrome. A third case, though unproved, was
      believed to be clinically the same.</p>

      <p class="text2">An extensive review of the literature failed
      to reveal reports of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome as
      a complication following circumcision. We hope to alert
      physicians caring for newborns to this possibility.</p>

      <p class="text2">Over the years, when advising parents of the
      problems encountered after circumcision, we had not
      considered staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Indeed, we
      have even reassured parents as to the paucity of problems
      after &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; circumcisions.</p>

      <h4>REPORT OF CASES</h4>

      <p class="cases">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Case
      1.&ndash;</b>A 13-day-old male infant was admitted because of
      &ldquo;high fever to 40.6&deg;C&rdquo; and generalized
      &ldquo;peeling of the skin.&rdquo; Discharged on the fourth
      day of life, he developed two pustules in his groin and on
      the shaft of the penis six days prior to admission, but he
      was &ldquo;doing fine&rdquo; and thriving otherwise. Four day
      prior to admission he underwent a ritual circumcision
      performed by a <i>Mohel</i>. The following day, more pustules
      developed on the lower abdomen and about the circumcision
      site. The mother also noted that the skin was
      &ldquo;red&rdquo; and easy to &ldquo;peel off.&rdquo; Their
      pediatrician recommended immediate hospitalization.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On admission, the infant was
      hypothermic and in profound shock. The skin was erythematous,
      almost violaceous in areas, desquamating and tender.
      Nikolsky&rsquo;s sign was present. The circumcised area was
      red, edematous, and exuding yellow pus (Fig 1). Cultures were
      taken and parenteral administration of methacillin nad
      gentamicin begun. He was treated aggressively with
      electrolyte solutions, whole blood, other plasma expanders,
      vasopressors, and mechanical ventilatory support. <span
      class="yellow">In spite of this he died 41 hours after
      admission.</span> <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was cultured
      from the nasopharynx, throat, pustules, circumcised area, and
      conjunctivae. Blood cultures were negative.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Case 2.&ndash;</b>A full-term
      3-day-old male infant was transferred to our medical center
      with a history of diarrhea and peeling of his skin beginning
      that day. On the second day of life, he was circumcised with
      a commercial clamp; on the third day (28 hours after
      circumcision), he had two explosive watery stools, and the
      skin of the penis, scrotum, buttocks, and periumbilical area
      were noted to be red and desquamating (Fig 2). The
      circumcised area was red and covered with a profuse, thick,
      yellow-green exudate. Nikolsky&rsquo;s sign became positive
      over his entire body surface. Parenteral administration of
      methicillin was begun, along with fluids and electrolyte
      replacement. He responded well and was discharged after 13
      days. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> grew from the cultures of
      the infants nasopharynx, the circumcised area, and from the
      mother&rsquo;s nose.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Case 3.&ndash;</b>A 4,320-g,
      2-day-old male infant was transferred to our medical center
      for evaluation of possible sepsis. At 31 hours of age, he was
      circumcised with a commercial clamp. Several hours later, he
      was noted to feed poorly and became lethargic, febrile to
      39.4&deg;C, and cyanotic in room air. A generalized
      erythematous maculoapapular rash erupted. The circumcised
      area was obviously infected, appearing red, swollen, hot and
      covered with a heavy, yellow, purulent exudate. No other site
      of infection was found. The usual and well as infected sites
      were cultured and antibiotic therapy begun. The rash became
      confluent. The skin was edematous and very tender. Within two
      days, the rash began to fade, and by the fourth hospital day,
      it cleared. While the skin never desquamated, it appeared
      like that of an early staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
      (Fig 3). The cultures from the nasopharynx and circumcision
      site from <i>S aureus</i>. The infant responded well to
      therapy.</p>

      <h4>COMMENT</h4>

      <p class="text2">The etiology and pathophysiology of
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome were a mystery to
      Gottfried Ritter von Rittershain<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> when he originally described 297 cases
      of this entitity, which became known as Ritter&rsquo;s
      disease.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Recently, 100 years
      later, it has been recognized that most cases are due to
      infection with S aureus, known to release an exotoxin,
      exfoliation.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> This toxin causes
      a separation of the epidermis from the basement membrane at a
      superficial level and leads to the classic Nikolsky&rsquo;s
      sign. Other names ascribed to the condition are toxic
      epidermal necrolysis and Lyell&rsquo;s disease, the latter
      usually being applied to the condition in adults.</p>

      <p class="text2">We thought that case 3 was similar to the 11
      described by Melish and Glasgow<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      as a milder variant of the exfoliative form of staphylococcus
      scalded skin syndrome.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to the 1971 report of the Ad Hoc
      Task Force on Circumcision of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics, &ldquo;Circumcision is a surgical procedure that
      requires careful aseptic technique, systematized
      post-operative observation, and evaluation after discharge
      from the hospital. The immediate hazards of the newborn
      include local infection which may progress to septicemia,
      significant hemorrhage, and mutilation.&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Many complications of elective circumcision
      are reported. Hemorrhage is the common complication; local
      infection ranks second in frequency.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> This latter complication is manifested
      by local inflammatory changes, ulceration, and suppuration.
      More severe infections have been reported, including partial
      necrosis of the penis, staphylococcal septicemia with
      osteomylitis, and pulmonary abscesses.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The open wounds of circumcision have
      been reported as a source of neonatal sepsis in
      prematures.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Other, although rare, complications reported
      include urethral fistula,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      circumcision of unrecognized hypospadias,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> laceration of the penile and scrotal
      skin,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> wound dehiscence,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> urinary retention from a too-tight
      dressing,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> injury to the
      glans,<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> retention of plastic
      device ring with edema of the penile shaft,<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> and surgical bivalving of the either
      the dorsal or ventral half of the glans while making the
      &ldquo;dorsal slit.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is
      caused by a staphylococcal exotoxin that is elaborated at the
      site of infection. In the three cases presented, the
      circumcision site was the probable focus. As reported,
      neonates and infants are the predominant victims for almost
      all cases. The patients have not exhibited any antecedent or
      subsequent immunological or metabolic deficiencies.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Since this disease can be rapidly fatal if
      untreated, as illustrated by case 1, accurate diagnosis and
      treatment are necessary. It is urged that careful scrutiny of
      the neonate&rsquo;s total skin skin surface be made prior to
      circumcision. This was clearly omitted in case 1. Any rash,
      especially pustulosis, should force the operator to delay the
      procedure, as should be the presence of staphylococcal
      infection in the nursery.</p>

      <p class="text2">In spite of recent recommendations against
      circumcision<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> except for
      specific medical and religious requirements, it has and will
      continue to be a common surgical procedure. Awareness of its
      potential hazards, scrupulous preoperative examination,
      detailed instructions to the parents regarding postoperative
      care, and observations for signs of complications are vital
      to an uneventful outcome.</p>
