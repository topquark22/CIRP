      <h2>Genital Cutting and Western Discourses on Sexuality</h2>
      <hr color="black" size="1" />
      <i>This article explores dominant discourses surrounding male
      and female genital cutting. Over a similar period of time,
      these genital operations have separately been subjected to
      scrutiny and criticism. However, although critiques of female
      circumcision have been widely taken up, general public
      opinion toward male circumcision remains indifferent. This
      difference cannot merely be explained by the natural
      attributes and effects of these practices. Rather, attitudes
      toward genital cutting reflect historically and culturally
      specific understandings of the human body. In particular, I
      suggest that certain problematic understandings of male and
      female sexuality are deeply implicated in the dominant
      Western discourses on genital surgery.</i> [genital surgery,

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1"><span class="init">T</span>he topic of
      genital cutting first captured my interest while I was
      teaching a gender course at a regional university in the
      United States. During the semester, we explored female
      circumcision as part of a broader examination of the ways in
      which gender becomes physically inscribed on human bodies. My
      goal was to provide students with a more culturally relative
      perspective on female circumcision and to encourage them to
      consider similar practices in their own society. To this end,
      I drew comparisons to male circumcision: the most common
      surgical procedure in the United States today. Each semester,
      the reaction of the students was both immediate and hostile.
      How dare I mention these two entirely different operations in
      the same breath! How dare I compare the innocuous and
      beneficial removal of the foreskin with the extreme
      mutilations enacted against females in other societies! As
      far as my students were concerned, there was no basis for
      comparison.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In an effort to move beyond the intellectual
      impasse I seemed to have reached with my students, I
      discussed the tendency among policy makers to homogenize
      female genital surgeries and to equate operations diverse in
      form and function with their most severe manifestations,
      while simultaneously reducing their meaning to patriarchy. I
      also pointed out that just as there is a common inclination
      to consider all female operations under the rubric of
      &ldquo;mutilation,&rdquo; there is a parallel tendency to
      collapse the widely variable forms of male genital cutting
      into a single operation involving the removal of the prepuce
      of the penis (see <a href="#Caldwell">Caldwell, Orubuloye,
      and Caldwell 1997</a>:1184).</p>

      <p class="text2">I tried to convey that an enormous degree of
      variation exists between operations. For example, in parts of
      East Africa not all of the foreskin is removed, while in
      other regions the foreskin is left largely intact but cut
      into strips (Caldwell, Orubuloye, and Caldwell 1997:1184).
      Such ritual circumcisions also take place in Aboriginal
      Australia, the Philippines, Eastern Indonesia, and Melanesia,
      with wide variation in procedures.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Similar variation exists in the
      religious circumcisions conducted among Islamic and Jewish
      populations. Even the clinical circumcisions familiar to many
      of my students vary widely, as judgments regarding the amount
      of skin to be removed from the penis are left to the skill
      and aesthetic preferences of the individual doctor.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Indeed, while the majority of
      circumcisions are performed on newborns, a minority undergo
      the operation after infancy, and some men choose to be
      recircumcised in later years due to dissatisfaction with the
      original result (see <a href="#Altshul">Altschul
      1990</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Moreover, other forms of male genital
      cutting such as superincision and subincision are also
      practiced. Superincision, where a dorsal slit is made in the
      foreskin, is performed in several Pacific island societies
      (see <a href="#Firth">Firth 1963</a>; <a href="#Kemph">Kempf
      2002</a>).<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Subincision, a far
      more invasive procedure, involves</p>

      <p class="quote">slitting open the whole or part of the
      penile urethra along the ventral or under surface of the
      penis. The initial cut is generally about an inch long, but
      this may subsequently be enlarged so that the incision
      extends from the glans to the root of the scrotum, in this
      way the whole of the under part of the penile urethra is laid
      open. [<a href="#Montagu">Montagu 1974</a>:312]</p>

      <p class="text2">This operation was historically widespread
      among Aboriginal groups in Australia&rsquo;s Central Desert
      (see <a href="#Berndt">Berndt and Berndt 1982</a>; <a
      href="#Montagu">Montagu 1974</a>; <a href="#Roheim">Roheim
      1949</a>),<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> and variations
      existed in Melanesia (e.g., <a href="#Hogbin">Hogbin
      1970</a>) and Polynesia (e.g., <a href="#JMartin">Martin
      1981</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Although many of these genital surgeries are
      less common than the removal of the foreskin, they begin to
      approach the tenor of female operations such as infibulation
      in both their degree of physical invasiveness and their
      potentially damaging health outcomes. Indeed, there are
      reports of subincision necessitating the adoption of a
      squatting position to urinate, as males lose the ability to
      control the direction of their urine flow (<a
      href="#Bettelheim">Bettelheim 1962</a>:101). Bettelheim
      (1962:100) also speculates that subincision &ldquo;probably
      alters the sensations during coitus.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite my efforts to reveal the
      heterogeneity of the practices glossed as &ldquo;male
      circumcision,&rdquo; the relative equanimity of my students
      when they learned of these male surgeries was a striking
      contrast to their sense of outrage and indignation at the
      female operations. Although it is true that several of the
      students did perceive that operations such as subincision
      constitute a form of mutilation, there was little sense that
      it was of a sexual nature. Indeed, what was striking was how
      willing students were to relegate such practices to the realm
      of &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; and how unwilling they were to
      place female surgeries in the same realm. Importantly, the
      lack of equivalence many of my students perceived between
      male and female genital surgeries extended well beyond male
      circumcision and included an unwillingness to consider
      <i>any</i> form of male genital surgery in conjunction with
      the female operations. For the majority of students in the
      class, the only procedure that they considered at all
      equivalent to female circumcision was castration, or more
      than that, full frontal castration&mdash;a penectomy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Over the course of our discussions on this
      topic, one thing became clear: students did not think that
      carving up male genitalia had any damaging effects on male
      sexuality as long as the penis remained largely intact. My
      students reasoned that as long as the man retained the
      ability to ejaculate, his sexuality was unimpaired.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> They were so ready to assert that
      female sexuality has been totally annihilated by genital
      surgery of any kind and so reluctant to proclaim that
      anything short of full frontal castration will affect a
      man&rsquo;s sexuality in the same way, it seemed clear that
      something very interesting was being revealed. Importantly,
      their insistence seemed to have less to do with these
      practices themselves and more to do with underlying
      assumptions about the nature of female and male sexuality,
      assumptions echoed in the dominant discourses on genital
      cutting.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is these assumptions that I am interested
      in exploring in the remainder of this article. Although I
      look at two very large bodies of literature in this article
      (that on female and male circumcision), I focus my discussion
      of male circumcision on the United States where secular,
      medical circumcision is most pervasive. However, I believe
      that much of the argument that follows also applies to other
      countries where secular male circumcision is still relatively
      common, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the
      United Kingdom.</p>

      <h4>The Literature</h4>

      <p class="text2">In the past few years, a number of books
      have explored the debates surrounding female circumcision as
      well as the practices themselves (e.g., <a
      href="#EBoyle">Boyle 2002</a>; <a href="#Gruenbaum">Gruenbaum
      2001</a>; <a href="#James">James and Robertson 2002</a>; <a
      href="#Shell-Duncan1">Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000</a>).
      These works signal a welcome shift toward a wholesale
      critical reflection on the meanings placed on female genital
      surgery and seek to problematize Western responses to these
      operations.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> However, although
      passing reference is made to male circumcision, the attention
      of the authors of these books is directed toward female
      genital operations. This is true of the majority of studies
      on female surgeries, where a comparison between male and
      female circumcisions is generally dismissed altogether, with
      the qualifier that <i>sunna</i> circumcision bears some
      equivalence to male circumcision, but that the comparison
      ends there.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The key activist to make some effort to
      explore the similarities between female and male genital
      surgeries is Hanny Lightfoot-Klein (see <a
      href="#Lightfoot-Klein">1989</a>:183&ndash;195, 1994).
      However, most writers who take up the comparison between male
      and female genital surgeries are activists opposing male
      circumcision. Like Lightfoot-Klein (and often drawing
      explicitly on her work), these writers emphasize that the
      cultural explanations and justifications for male and female
      surgeries are similar (see <a href="#Boyd">Boyd 1998</a>; <a
      href="#Denniston">Denniston and Milos 1997</a>; <a
      href="#Romberg">Romberg 1985</a>). They also point to the
      hypocrisy in decrying only those surgeries that are performed
      in non-Western contexts (see <a href="#Boyd">Boyd 1998</a>;
      <a href="#Gollaher">Gollaher 2000</a>). This point has also
      been made by scholars such as Nancy Scheper-Hughes (<a
      href="#Scheper-Hughes">1991</a>:28), who writes, &ldquo;Where
      are the passionate voices of our Western, male medical
      anthropologists&mdash;some of them circumcised, some of them
      not&mdash;speaking out on the practice of male genital
      surgery in the United States? Why isn&rsquo;t male
      circumcision also one of the places . . . &lsquo;where we
      ought to draw the line?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">There have also been important moves to
      consider male and female genital cutting <i>together</i> in
      an African context (e.g., <a href="#Caldwell">Caldwell,
      Orubuloye, and Caldwell 1997</a>; <a
      href="#Orubuloye">Orubuloye, Caldwell, and Caldwell
      2000</a>). As Caldwell, Orubuloye, and Caldwell (1997:1181)
      convincingly demonstrate, the conceptual separation
      underlying Western treatments of male and female circumcision
      is alien to many Africans, who consider these operations to
      be fundamentally related in both their functions and effects.
      However, little attempt has been made to explore precisely
      <i>why</i> international opinion remains largely hostile to
      female genital cutting and indifferent to the male
      operations.</p>

      <h4>Female and Male Genital Operations: &ldquo;And Never the
      Twain Shall Meet&rdquo;</h4>

      <p class="text2">Although female genital cutting entered the
      consciousness of colonial administrations in Africa in the
      1930s, the practices did not come to larger attention in the
      West until the 1970s&mdash;in large part due to the work of
      activists such as Fran Hosken and feminists such as Gloria
      Steinem, Robin Morgan, and Mary Daly. Although these Western
      perspectives have subsequently been given a certain degree of
      legitimacy by the writings of Africans such as Dirie (and <a
      href="#Dire">Miller 1999</a>), Dorkenoo (<a
      href="#Dorkenoo">1994</a>), El Sadaawi (<a
      href="#Sadaawi">1980</a>), Koso-Thomas (<a
      href="#Koso-Thomas">1987</a>), and Toubia (<a
      href="#Toubia">1995</a>), opinions on female circumcision
      remain firmly divided&mdash;both within Africa and the
      international arena.</p>

      <p class="text2">Few topics have polarized opinion as much as
      female circumcision, and during the past few decades it has
      generated an onslaught of discussion and debate (<a
      href="#Shell-Duncan1">Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000</a>:1).
      The 1990s especially saw an unprecedented level of interest
      in this issue. Events such as Alice Walker&rsquo;s appearance
      on <i>Oprah</i> (subsequent to the publication of her 1992
      novel, <i>Possessing the Secret of Joy</i>) and the
      publication of excerpts from Waris Dirie&rsquo;s <i>Desert
      Flower</i> in <i>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</i> in 1999 helped in
      no small way to dramatically increase public awareness of
      &ldquo;female genital mutilation&rdquo; (FGM). Female
      circumcision became such a hot topic it was discussed in
      women&rsquo;s magazines, the U.S. radio program <i>All Things
      Considered</i>, and was even featured on a 1997 episode of
      <i>Law and Order</i>. The 1990s also saw an intensification
      of eradication efforts, with international health and aid
      organizations placing political and economic pressure on
      African governments to legislate against the practices (see
      <a href="#Shell-Duncan1">Shell-Duncan and Hernlund
      2000</a>:32&ndash;34).</p>

      <p class="text2">Over this same period, a parallel body of
      literature on male circumcision also developed. In 1971, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics stopped endorsing the routine
      circumcision of males, concluding that there was &ldquo;no
      absolute medical indication&rdquo; for routine circumcision.
      In 1989, they modified their position slightly, stating that
      neonatal circumcision has potential medical benefits and
      advantages as well as disadvantages and risks. They have
      since revisited the issue (<a href="#American">AAP 1999</a>)
      in light of more recent studies&ndash;particularly those
      linking circumcision with lower HIV infection rates<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> and continue to maintain that although
      male circumcision may have potential benefits, the available
      studies are inconclusive and insufficient to justify
      recommending routine male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In conjunction with the growing medical
      debate over male circumcision, the anticircumcision movement
      began to gain ground in the 1980s, with the publication of
      Edward Wallerstein&rsquo;s (1980) respected <i>Circumcision:
      An American Health Fallacy</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Since this period, there has been a
      subtle groundswell of literature opposing male circumcision.
      A number of anticircumcision organizations have also been
      formed over the years such as NOHARRM: the National
      Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of
      Males, NOCIRC: the National Organization of Circumcision
      Information Resource Centers, BUFF: Brothers United for
      Future Foreskin, RECAP: Recovery of a Penis, and DOC: Doctors
      Opposing Circumcision. Many of these organizations have
      created websites and there is also a journal, <i>Foreskin
      Quarterly</i>, devoted to similar activist activities.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite the proliferation of
      anticircumcision materials on the Internet, for the most part
      the profiles of these preservationist<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> organizations are reasonably low.
      Thus, while the anti-FGM position has enormous public
      currency, the male preservationist position is not well
      known, nor is it taken very seriously. The biomedical debates
      about male circumcision in the United States do not seem to
      have infiltrated public attitudes toward the practice to any
      significant degree.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> According
      to a recent article published in <i>USA Today</i>, in many
      parts of the United States, neonatal circumcision rates have
      remained steady, and in areas such as the Midwest, they have
      actually increased (<a href="#Rubin">Rubin 2001</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">The only region that has seen a reduction in
      circumcision rates is the West, and this decline seems
      largely attributable to increasing levels of migration from
      noncircumcising countries and the increase in Hispanic births
      in this region&mdash;an ethnic group in which circumcision
      rates are comparatively low. Thus, the claims of sexual
      mutilation made by opponents of male circumcision are more
      likely to be met by the public (and the press) with snorts of
      derision than nods of recognition. Indeed, activists working
      to eradicate male circumcision tend to be depicted in the
      press as a small, misguided group of &ldquo;extremists&rdquo;
      (e.g., <a href="#Epstein">Epstein 1997</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Ultimately, the evidence regarding the
      benefits of male circumcision remains extremely
      controversial.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Yet, while
      there has certainly been a great deal of hyperbole on both
      sides of the male circumcision debate, some scholars and
      activists have argued compellingly about the disputable value
      of studies claiming health benefits for male circumcision and
      the tendency to unthinkingly reproduce accepted wisdom
      regarding these benefits<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> (see
      <a href="#EBoyle">Boyle et al. 2002</a>; <a
      href="#Gollaher">Gollaher 2000</a>; <a
      href="#Wallerstein">Wallerstein 1980</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Carla Obermeyer (<a
      href="#Obermeyer">1999</a>, <a href="#Obermeyer">2003</a>)
      makes a similar point in relation to the anti-FGM
      literature.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> She argues that a
      number of the reports on the health effects of female genital
      cutting rely on sources that have numerous shortcomings, such
      as a lack of information about where the data were from and
      how they were collected, high percentages of nonresponses to
      questionnaires, inconsistencies in calculations, and biased
      estimates due to small sample sizes. Recent attempts to link
      HIV transmission with female circumcision,<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> despite the poorly documented and
      epidemiologically improbable health risks (see <a
      href="#Taverne">Taverne 1994</a>), seem to support
      Obermeyer&rsquo;s claim (<a href="#Obermayer">2003</a>:81)
      that &ldquo;despite their deficiencies, some of the published
      reports have come to acquire an aura of dependability through
      repeated and uncritical citations.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">The tendency to minimize the health effects
      of male circumcision and maximize the damage caused by female
      circumcision, particularly in popular representations of the
      operations, seems to require little justification. The
      so-called commonsense explanation for the differing reception
      of male and female genital cutting relates to the specific
      nature of the female operations, which are seen to be
      fundamentally more damaging to health (unlike the male
      operations, which are often seen to be actively health
      promoting). Thus, the World Health Organization (<a
      href="#WHO">1997</a>:1) states that &ldquo;female genital
      mutilation is universally unacceptable because it is an
      infringement on the physical and psychosexual integrity of
      women and girls and is a form of violence against
      them.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">Implicit within the WHO position is the
      assumption that such operations destroy female sexuality.
      This focus on sexual health becomes even more explicit in
      labels such as &ldquo;sexual castration&rdquo; (<a
      href="#Badawi">Badawi 1989</a>; <a href="#Hosken">Hosken
      1994</a>:38) and &ldquo;sexual blinding&rdquo; (<a
      href="#Walker">Walker 1992</a>) that several writers have
      used to describe the procedures. Thus, although these
      organizations claim to be concerned about health generally,
      they are really concerned specifically with sexual health.
      This is because the detrimental long-term health consequences
      seem limited largely to in- fibulation (see <a
      href="#Obermeyer">Obermeyer 1999</a>, <a
      href="#Obermeyer">2003</a>; <a
      href="#Shell-Duncan1">Shell-Duncan and Hernlund
      2000</a>:14&ndash;18; <a href="#Shweder">Shweder 2000</a>),
      which accounts for around only 15 percent of cases. Moreover,
      the short-term health effects can be minimized through the
      use of trained surgeons, sterile equipment, and anesthetics
      (i.e., the transfer of surgery to a medical setting). Yet, as
      Shell-Duncan, Obiero, and Muruli (<a
      href="#Shell-Duncan2">2000</a>:110) point out,
      &ldquo;paradoxically, those who emphasize female
      &lsquo;circumcision&rsquo; as a public health issue at the
      same time oppose any medical intervention designed to
      minimize health risks and pain for women being cut.&rdquo;
      Thus, the opposition of the World Health Organization (1997)
      and many other international agencies to the medicalization
      of female operations would reinforce the idea that their key
      opposition to female genital cutting relates specifically to
      its impact on female sexual health.</p>

      <p class="text2">The other key argument against female
      genital cutting relates to the issue of informed consent.
      According to Fran Hosken (in <a href="#Abusharaf">Abusharaf
      2000</a>:151), &ldquo;Any violation of the physical nature of
      the human person, for any reason whatsoever, without the
      informed consent of the person involved, is a violation of
      human rights.&rdquo; Gerry Mackie (<a
      href="#Mackie">2003</a>:136) similarly states that &ldquo;in
      general there is an absence of meaningful consent to the
      irreversible act of FGC [female genital cutting],&rdquo;
      echoing Nussbaum&rsquo;s (1999:123) position that,
      &ldquo;female genital mutilation is usually performed on
      children far too young to consent even were consent
      solicited.&rdquo; In a slightly different vein, Rahman and
      Toubia (<a href="#Rahman">2000</a>:3) take the position that
      &ldquo;the act of cutting itself&mdash;the cutting of healthy
      genital organs for non-medical reasons&mdash;is at its
      essence a basic violation of girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s
      right to physical integrity. <i>This is true regardless of
      the degree of cutting or of the extent of the complications
      that may or may not ensue&rdquo;</i> (emphasis added).</p>

      <p class="text2">Yet, even the most superficial examination
      of these positions reveals that the particular arguments
      being produced here to condemn female genital cutting can be
      used equally to condemn male circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Each operation involves an
      unnecessary bodily violation that entails the removal of
      healthy tissue without the informed consent of the person
      involved (see <a href="#Price">Price 1999</a>; <a
      href="#Winkel">Winkel 2003</a>; <a href="#Zavales">Zavales
      1996</a>). That a general lack of recognition prevails<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> reveals just how conceptually
      distant the male and female operations are. Indeed, attacks
      against male circumcision by agencies and health workers in
      Africa tend to condemn only the conditions under which the
      operations are performed, rather than the actual procedures
      themselves.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This has led to some rather contradictory
      policies on the part of international health organizations,
      which seek to medicalize male circumcision on the one hand,
      oppose the medicalization of female circumcision on the
      other, while simultaneously basing their opposition to the
      female operations on grounds that could legitimately be used
      to condemn the male operations. Ultimately, the message is
      clear: genital mutilation is gendered. These male and female
      genital operations are not merely seen to differ in
      <i>degree</i>, they are seen to differ in <i>kind</i>. Thus,
      despite the heterogeneous voices speaking out against female
      circumcision, a common thread unites many: all forms of
      female genital cutting are seen to constitute a sexual
      mutilation and violation of bodily integrity, and male
      genital operations are dismissed as benign.</p>

      <h4>Medical Circumcision: &ldquo;An Operation in Search of a
      Disease?&rdquo;</h4>

      <p class="text2">As numerous scholars have documented, the
      origins of secular male circumcision are surprisingly recent,
      dating merely to the late Victorian era, when a number of
      U.S. and British doctors began to regularly endorse
      circumcision to cure all manner of physical ailments.
      Especially interesting are the connections made between male
      circumcision and hygiene. Although proponents of male
      circumcision still commonly promote the hygienic benefits of
      the operation, there is little recognition of the fact that
      the hygiene of the Victorian imagination conflated physical
      and moral sanitation much more overtly than the contemporary
      meaning of the word would suggest.</p>

      <p class="text2">The best example of this conflation was the
      attitude toward masturbation, which was considered to be not
      only morally unclean, but also, by implication, the cause of
      physical health problems such as asthma, insanity, epilepsy,
      gout, headaches, rheumatism, curvature of the spine, hip
      disease, and kidney failure (<a href="#Boyd">Boyd
      1998</a>:52). Moreover, a number of people have argued that
      it is precisely such beliefs that go a great way toward
      explaining the Victorian embrace of medical male
      circumcision. (See <a href="#Darby">Darby 2003</a> for an
      extensive review and discussion of the literature; see also
      <a href="#Boyd">Boyd 1998</a>; <a href="#Gollaher">Gollaher
      1994</a>, <a href="#Gollaher">2000</a>.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup>) Circumcision, it seemed, helped
      cure the tendency to masturbate, and its hygienic and health
      benefits stemmed largely from this correlation. Thus,
      according to American doctor J. M. McGree, writing in 1882,
      male circumcision &ldquo;is acknowledged to be useful as a
      preventative to masturbation&rdquo; (in <a
      href="#Gollaher">Gollaher 2000</a>:85).</p>

      <p class="text2">The popular 1896 U.S. parenting manual,
      <i>All about Baby</i>, also advised that male circumcision
      was to be preferred in most cases and recommended it largely
      for preventing the &ldquo;vile&rdquo; habit of masturbation
      (in <a href="#Gollaher">Gollaher 2000</a>:104). John Kellogg,
      cocreator of Kellogg&rsquo;s corn flakes and health reformer
      obsessed with both regular bowel movements and masturbation,
      saw similar value in circumcision. In 1888 he writes,</p>

      <p class="quote">Tying the hands [to overcome masturbatory
      tendencies] is also successful in some cases. . . . Covering
      the organs with a cage has been practiced with entire
      success. A remedy which is almost always successful in small
      boys is circumcision. The operation should be performed by a
      surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief
      pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon
      the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of
      punishment. [in <a href="#Boyd">Boyd 1998</a>:51]</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the justifications for male
      circumcision have changed, the continuance of the practice
      should not merely be understood to reflect more
      &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; medical appraisals of the
      operation&rsquo;s benefits. As David Gollaher (<a
      href="#Gollaher">2000</a>:205) cautions, &ldquo;much as we
      believe ourselves to be enlightened citizens of the age of
      science, not superstition, the continuing circumcision of
      newborn American boys betrays lingering illusions about
      health and reveals the power of culture in shaping medical
      practice.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">The history of female circumcision in the
      West sheds light on the way that changing cultural attitudes
      (as opposed to &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; medical opinion) may
      lead to the continuation or cessation of medical practices.
      As many scholars have noted, during the Victorian era male
      circumcision was not the lone prophylactic in shielding
      children from the dangers of masturbation; female
      circumcisionwas also practiced during this period for very
      similar reasons (<a href="#Darby">Darby 2003</a>:738; <a
      href="#Gollaher">Gollaher 2000</a>:201; <a
      href="#Wallerstein">Wallerstein 1980</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Perhaps the most public endorsement of
      female circumcision was provided by Isaac Baker Brown, an
      eminent obstetrical surgeon who ran a practice in London
      during the latter half of the 19th century. He worked mainly
      on diseases of women, and in 1866 he published a book
      entitled, <i>On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity,
      Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females</i>, which
      advocated clitoridectomy as treatment for the aforementioned
      medical weaknesses in women (<a href="#Sheehan">Sheehan
      1997</a>). As Elizabeth Sheehan (<a href="#Sheehan">1997</a>)
      points out, although Baker Brown was publicly vilified
      following the publication of this book, the medical reasoning
      behind clitoridectomy was not discredited. Indeed, in 1936,
      Holt&rsquo;s medical reference text, <i>Diseases of Infancy
      and Childhood</i>, recommended cauterization or removal of
      the clitoris for girls as a cure for masturbation (in <a
      href="#Lightfoot-Klein">Lightfoot-Klein 1989</a>:180).</p>

      <p class="text2">Clitoridectomies were occasionally endorsed
      in Australia and the United States well into the 1960s as a
      cure for excessive masturbation. For example, in the popular
      Christian coming-of-age manual, On Becoming a Woman, first
      published in 1951 and reprinted in 1968, Dr. Harold Shryock
      writes,</p>

      <p class="text2">There are teenage girls who, impelled by an
      unwholesome curiosity or by the example of unscrupulous girl
      friends, have fallen into the habit of manipulating these
      sensitive tissues as a means of excitement. This habit is
      spoken of as masturbation. . . . There is an anatomical
      factor that sometimes causes irritation about the clitoris
      and thus encourages a manipulation of the delicate
      reproductive organs. . . . Oftentimes the remedy for this
      situation consists of a minor surgical operation spoken of as
      circumcision. This operation is not hazardous and is much to
      be preferred to allowing the condition of irritation to
      continue. [<a href="#Shryock">1968</a>:38]</p>

      <p class="text2">That secular male circumcisionwas taken up
      while female circumcision never really caught on, except in a
      limited way, reveals a great deal about the attitudes toward
      female and male sexuality that were crystallizing over this
      period.</p>

      <h4>Sexuality and the Rise and Fall (and Rise) of the
      Clitoris</h4>

      <p class="text2">As Thomas Laqueur (<a
      href="#Laqueur">1999</a>) has shown, before the 18th century,
      the existence of female sexual pleasure, and its necessity
      for the successful reproduction of humankind, was taken for
      granted. Male and female bodies were understood to be
      fundamentally similar, although a lack of heat caused female
      genitalia to be inverted (see also <a href="#EMartin">Martin
      1987</a>). In this period, male and female sexual excitement
      was seen to be critical to reproduction: the combined
      orgasmic heat generated by sexual intercourse concocted and
      commingled the seed of life. Thus, during the Renaissance,
      the clitoris was routinely described as the organ
      &ldquo;which makes women lustful and take delight in
      copulation&rdquo; (<a href="#Laqueur">Laqueur 1999</a>:220).
      Seventeenth-century writers insisted that male and female
      pleasure were located in essentially the same kind of organ:
      the end of the clitoris was likened to the glans of the penis
      and was defined as the seat of sexual pleasure in women (<a
      href="#Laqueur">Laqueur 1999</a>:220).</p>

      <p class="text2">However, in 18th-century Europe, a radical
      reconstitution of female sexuality took place, which Laqueur
      insists cannot be explained by scientific progress alone. At
      this time, a new model of human biology emerged, which
      emphasized both fundamental and immutable differences between
      the sexes. The female body was no longer understood to be an
      inversion of the male body with similar organs, functions,
      and characteristics. It was now of a different order
      altogether, and in this reconfiguration of the female body
      sexuality was pushed to the periphery (<a
      href="#Laqueur">Laqueur 1999</a>:219). Theodor
      Bischoff&rsquo;s discovery in 1843 that ovulation in dogs
      occurs independent of sexual intercourse was taken as proof
      that the female orgasm serves no reproductive purpose and was
      therefore unnecessary to the perpetuation of life (<a
      href="#Laqueur">Laqueur 1999</a>:233, 239). Thus, the idea
      that woman was inherently passionate was sacrificed in the
      effort to assert a fundamental underlying difference in male
      and female biology.</p>

      <p class="text2">These assumptions about passive female
      sexuality were maintained for much of the 20th century. Early
      support arrived in the form of Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s 1905
      essay entitled <i>Three Contributions to the Theory of
      Sex</i> (<a href="#Freud">1905/1962</a>). According to Freud,
      mature female sexuality resided in the vagina, and immature
      female sexuality resided in the clitoris. As he explains it,
      puberty in females brings with it the transference of
      &ldquo;erogenous excitability&rdquo; from the clitoris to the
      vagina (pp. 78&ndash;79). Indeed, it was precisely this focus
      on the vagina as the source of sexual satisfaction and
      reproductive action that allowed the clitoris to be
      desexualized to the extent that Victorian doctors routinely
      performed clitoral massages on hysterical females as a form
      of medical treatment. In this conceptual framework, the
      pretense could be maintained that the resulting orgasms, or
      &ldquo;hysterical paroxysms,&rdquo; were of a nonsexual
      nature (see <a href="#Maines">Maines 1999</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">And so it was that in the 19th and early
      20th centuries, the clitoris, so venerated in previous
      centuries as the organ most closely resembling the penis, was
      denigrated to the status of irrelevant anatomical appendage.
      Nevertheless, it is possible to detect certain contradictory
      elements in the early 20th-century testimonies on female
      anatomy. Moore and Clarke (<a href="#Moore">1995</a>) point
      out that the homology between the penis and the clitoris did
      not disappear completely at the turn of the 20th century,
      although the latter was deemed a &ldquo;rudimentary&rdquo;
      imitation of the former. Furthermore, Freud (<a
      href="#Freud">1905/1962</a>:77&ndash;78) also emphasizes the
      homology between the clitoris and penis, even though he
      ultimately dismisses its role in mature female sexuality.
      Indeed, I would speculate that the disfavor attending the
      publication of Baker Brown&rsquo;s theories on the value of
      clitoridectomy occurred because he was publicly creating a
      link between the clitoris and female sexuality that
      contradicted the prevailing theories of the day, even if it
      was privately accepted by many physicians. As Sheehan (<a
      href="#Sheehan">1997</a>:328) notes, &ldquo;it would appear
      that the medical profession wanted it both ways: the clitoris
      was so unimportant to a normal woman as not to be missed if
      removed, yet lurking in its tissue was the greatest threat to
      female welfare ever known.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">The tendency to downplay the clitoris became
      even more entrenched over the course of the 20th century, and
      by the late 1940s it was common practice to omit the clitoris
      from anatomy textbooks altogether (<a href="#Moore">Moore and
      Clarke 1995</a>:274). However, in the 1970s, the clitoris was
      taken up once again, this time by feminists intent on sexual
      liberation. In the mid-1970s, with the publication of <i>The
      Hite Report</i> (<a href="#Hite">Hite 1976</a>), the clitoris
      was restored to its former seat of glory. <i>The Hite
      Report</i> indicated that almost all women achieve orgasm
      through clitoral, as opposed to vaginal, stimulation.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> It therefore raised the question of
      why clitoral stimulation was not seen to be a normal part of
      sex, when it is so fundamental to a woman&rsquo;s sexuality.
      At the time of its publication, <i>The Hite Report</i>
      obviously provided an important rebuttal to Freudian theories
      about immature clitoral sexuality and mature vaginal
      sexuality.</p>

      <p class="text2">The findings of <i>The Hite Report</i> were
      quickly taken up by feminists and helped support the earlier
      claims made by Anne Koedt in her article, <i>The Myth of the
      Vaginal Orgasm</i> (<a href="#Koedt">1970 [1991]</a>). In
      language that echoes eerily the Renaissance midwifery texts,
      Koedt argues, &ldquo;It is the clitoris which is the centre
      of sexual sensitivity and which is the female equivalent of
      the penis&rdquo; (<a href="#Koedt">1991</a>:326). She
      continues, &ldquo;Its erection is similar to the male
      erection, and the head of the clitoris has the same type of
      structure and function as the head of the penis&rdquo; (p.
      329). In Koedt&rsquo;s framework, there is no room for
      females who do not fit this clitoral model. She accuses women
      who claim the capacity for vaginal orgasms of ignorance and
      false consciousness. According to Koedt, these women are
      confused, because they either fail to locate the real center
      of their orgasm (the clitoris) or they desire to fit their
      experience into the male-defined idea of sexual normalcy.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Boston Women&rsquo;s Health Book
      Collective (<a href="#Boston">1971/1978</a>) made similar
      assertions regarding the clitoris in <i>Our Bodies
      Ourselves</i>, as did the 1981 book, <i>A New View of a
      Woman&rsquo;s Body</i> (cited in <a href="#Moore">Moore and
      Clarke 1995</a>). As Moore and Clarke (<a
      href="#Moore">1995</a>) note, in these works the clitoris is
      transformed from minor homologue into the raison
      d&rsquo;&circ;etre of other organs. Susann Gage, the
      illustrator of <i>A New View of a Woman&rsquo;s Body</i>,
      later noted, &ldquo;I think that we were revealing the truth.
      And how can you argue with anatomy? It is all the same. The
      erectile tissue of the clitoris functions the same as the
      penis&rdquo; (in <a href="#Moore">Moore and Clarke
      1995</a>:280). Similarly, <i>Our Bodies Ourselves</i> (<a
      href="#Boston">Boston Women&rsquo;s Health Book Collective
      1971/1978</a>:20) describes the &ldquo;shaft&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;glans&rdquo; of the clitoris, appropriating the
      anatomical terminology of male genitalia to portray the
      female organ.</p>

      <p class="text2">The collective influence of these feminist
      writings and the findings of <i>The Hite Report</i> were
      influential, and Koedt&rsquo;s (re) equation between the
      clitoris and the penis is commonplace today. Indeed, it is in
      the arena of female circumcision that this connection is most
      explicitly asserted. Thus, the World Health Organization
      states that &ldquo;almost all types of female genital
      mutilation involve the removal of part or all of the
      clitoris, which is the main female sexual organ, equivalent
      in its anatomy and physiology to the male penis&rdquo; (<a
      href="#WHO">WHO 1997</a>:8). For Fran Hosken (<a
      href="#Hosken">1994</a>:25), &ldquo;The excision of the penis
      which is the equivalent of the excision of the clitoris is
      instantly recognized as a severe physical genital mutilation
      with permanent consequences and is a criminal offence.&rdquo;
      Similarly, Rahman and Toubia (<a href="#Rahman">2000</a>:4)
      note that, &ldquo;The male equivalent of clitoridectomy, in
      which all or part of the clitoris is removed, would be
      amputation of most of the penis.&rdquo; Finally, according to
      Nussbaum (<a href="#Nussbaum">1999</a>:119),<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> &ldquo;the male equivalent of the
      clitoridectomy would be amputation of most of the penis. The
      male equivalent of infibulation would be &lsquo;removal of
      the entire penis, its roots of soft tissue, and part of the
      scrotal skin.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">Clearly, the argument being put forward
      echoes precisely the position of my undergraduate students:
      because the clitoris is the equivalent of the penis, only
      removal of the penis can parallel the effects of female
      circumcision. Koedt declares as much in her article, arguing
      that men fear the clitoris because they recognize that it is
      almost identical to the penis. Thus, she argues that men
      either ignore the clitoris or they excise it altogether. As
      Obermeyer (<a href="#Obermeyer">1999</a>:96) and Shell-Duncan
      and Hernlund (<a href="#Shell-Duncan1">2000</a>:21&ndash;22)
      point out, in this conceptual framework, clitoridectomy
      became the symbol par excellence of patriarchal
      oppression.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, although the genital equation
      between clitoris and penis has now become central to the
      dominant discourses surrounding both male and female genital
      cutting, how valid are equations of this kind? Although it is
      important to recognize that second-wave feminists deployed
      the homology argument to subvert the original biomedical
      intent to diminish the clitoris (<a href="#Moore">Moore and
      Clarke 1995</a>:995), the ongoing tendency to define the
      clitoris as the female penis merely reinvokes androcentric
      notions of female sexuality first described centuries ago
      (see <a href="#Laqueur">Laqueur 1999</a>; <a
      href="#EMartin">Martin 1987</a>). Male physiology is
      <i>still</i> taken as the norm, and female physiology is
      <i>still</i> understood in relation to it. Indeed, by
      defining the clitoris as the female penis, contemporary
      activist discourses merely <i>phallicize</i> female sexuality
      instead of attempting to understand it on its own terms.
      Although the clitoris may play an important role in female
      sexual response, does it necessarily follow that female
      anatomy, so radically different in form and function to male
      anatomy, can be understood through the latter? Yet, in the
      dominant discourses on genital cutting, male anatomy
      continues to be the yardstick against which female structures
      are compared.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nevertheless, the tendency to condemn female
      genital operations while remaining indifferent toward their
      male counterparts cannot simply be understood in terms of the
      genital equation between clitoris and penis that I have
      outlined above. There are other dimensions at work here,
      stemming from the 19th-century disconnection of orgasm from
      female reproduction. It seems that despite the genital
      equation between the penis and the clitoris, a difference is
      also maintained&mdash;a difference that feminist revisions
      were never entirely successful in challenging. As Moore and
      Clarke (<a href="#Moore">1995</a>:284) note, &ldquo;although
      narratives centered on discussing female sexual experiences
      are now acceptable, these sexual experiences are depicted as
      limited.&rdquo; Thus, although an equivalence is asserted
      between the clitoris and the penis, a difference is
      ultimately maintained, largely because of the anatomical
      structure of the genitals and the perceived relationship
      between the male and female orgasm.</p>

      <p class="text2">As previously stated, male genital surgeries
      are deemed unharmful to the male, because as long as the
      penis is left structurally intact, the man can still have an
      orgasm, signaled by the ejaculation of semen. However, female
      orgasm is signaled by no such recognizable emission.<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> In this framework, a man&rsquo;s
      orgasm is both essential to reproduction and accompanied by
      an objective sign: ejaculation. A woman&rsquo;s orgasm, on
      the other hand, is entirely incidental to reproduction and
      accompanied by no objective signal. Thus, the homology
      between penis and clitoris only takes us so far, because this
      deeper, more fundamental difference is simultaneously
      recognized and plays an important role in the construction of
      both female and male sexuality.</p>

      <h4>Active Men and Passive Women: Contemporary Constructions
      of Male and Female Sexuality</h4>

      <p class="text2">Lenore Tiefer (<a href="#Tieffer">1992</a>)
      has noted a number of sexual beliefs to which many American
      men subscribe,<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> including the
      perception that men&rsquo;s sexual apparatus and needs are
      simple and straightforward (unlike women&rsquo;s); that men
      are ready, willing, and eager for as much sex as they can
      get; and that sexual prowess is central to masculinity.
      Implicit within this discourse is a parallel discourse on
      female sexuality. Because of the seemingly less
      straightforward nature of female physiology and sexual
      response, women&rsquo;s sexual needs are presumed to be more
      complicated and limited than men&rsquo;s.</p>

      <p class="text2">Susan Bordo (<a href="#Bordo">1999</a>)
      writes at length about the prominence of the &ldquo;hot
      man&rdquo; thesis, reenergized by popular science, which
      &ldquo;[has been] busy re-establishing that men are
      testosterone-driven, promiscuous brutes whom nature
      won&rsquo;t permit to keep their peckers in their
      pants&rdquo; (p. 232). This image of the sexually rapacious
      male pervades popular representations of masculinity, from
      media advertisements to relationship manuals, such as the
      immensely successful works of psychologist John Gray. As
      Bordo (<a href="#Bordo">1999</a>:232) notes, for Gray,
      &ldquo;women need to <i>talk</i> in order to raise their
      sexual temperature . . . , because unlike men, we get warmed
      up not by physical but by mental chemistry. . . . In
      contrast, man&rsquo;s blowtorch is ignited by
      &lsquo;mindless&rsquo; physical attraction to body
      parts.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="text2">The ongoing currency of these ideas is also
      evident in Smith and Doe&rsquo;s<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> 1998 bestseller, <i>What Men
      Don&rsquo;t Want Women to Know: The Secrets, the Lies, the
      Unspoken Truth</i>. The central premise of their book is that
      man is a &ldquo;sexual animal&rdquo; (p. 11) who
      &ldquo;spends his life in one of two basic states: loaded or
      unloaded&rdquo; (p. 26).<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> In
      this discursive framework, genital surgery is far less likely
      to impair a man&rsquo;s sexuality than a woman&rsquo;s
      because of his highly developed, instinctive, and powerful
      sexual drive. A woman&rsquo;s sexual instincts, being
      fundamentally more delicate, will be crippled by <i>any</i>
      form of genital surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">This connection between circumcision and
      male sexuality is most evident in popular perceptions that
      circumcised men&ldquo;last&rdquo; longer during sexual
      intercourse.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Procircumcision
      websites provide a fascinating source of information
      regarding this aspect of male circumcision. Unsurprisingly,
      many of these websites originate in countries where male
      circumcision is less common (such as the United Kingdom and
      Australia), just as the bulk of anticircumcision websites
      come out of the United States.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> Nevertheless, I would argue that
      these sites provide an important source of information
      regarding the cultural meanings that male circumcision
      has&mdash;meanings that are often only explicitly articulated
      in contexts where male circumcision is less normalized.</p>

      <p class="text2">Several procircumcision websites (notably
      http://www.circlist.com and http://www.circinfo.com)<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> actively configure male circumcision
      as a sort of positive sexual restraint stopping the man from
      &ldquo;jumping the gun&rdquo; during sexual intercourse.
      According to circlist.com, although an uncircumcised penis
      may be more sensitive, this same sensitivity can lead to
      premature ejaculation. Such &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; of male
      circumcision are a regular focus of discussion, as the
      following selection of quotes demonstrate:</p>

      <p class="quote">My husband had a very long, thick foreskin
      which did not retract automatically when erect. . . . This
      provided very little stimulation for me. Consequently, after
      discussing this for several months (during which time he did
      not provide me with one orgasm), I convinced him to be
      circumcised. . . .My husband and I are very happy with the
      results. He now has a very tight circumcision with no
      frenulum remaining. . . . Sex is much better for both of
      us.&mdash;Karen, U.S.A. [<a href="#Circlist">Circlist
      1999</a>]</p>

      <p class="quote">I would like to write and express the joy
      and liberation I too feel about being circumcised. It is a
      beautifying operation, cosmetic surgery at its best.
      It&rsquo;s also more comfortable, sex is better and it is so
      much nicer for your partner. It beats me how any woman
      consents to sex with a man who still has his foreskin. So it
      follows that you would expect women to have their male
      offspring circumcised for the sake of the next generation of
      females, but then you hit a problem. These males will never
      have the chance of experiencing the joy of getting
      circumcised, though hopefully they will be content with their
      circumcised status once their mothers tell them about what
      was done to them and why.&mdash;Anonymous, UK [<a
      href="#Circlist">Circlist 1999</a>]</p>

      <p class="quote">My girlfriend told me that she preferred the
      appearance of a circumcised penis, and asked me if I would
      consider it. At first I gave her only evasive answers, but
      after thinking it over for a few weeks I decided to go ahead
      and tell her that I would indeed consider it. . . . Thoughts
      and memories of this experience have since enriched our
      sexlife [<i>sic</i>] beyond description, and although I
      wouldn&rsquo;t want to go through that again, I am glad that
      I did and would recommend such an experience for
      anyone.&mdash;George, USA [<a href="#Circlist">Circlist
      1999</a>]</p>

      <p class="quote">My first circumcision was at the age of 17
      being done by a general practicioner [sic]. On my own I
      requested the surgery without parental knowledge. . . . The
      circ was done under local anesthetic in the doctors
      [<i>sic</i>] office. Unfortunately no stitches were taken
      which resulted in a 3/16" wide uneven scar. I was
      recircumcised at the age of 23 to remove the excessive scar
      tissue. I have no regrets about being circumcised. The
      somewhat reduced sensitivity of the head is made up for by
      prolongation of sexual intercourse. My wife approves of the
      circumcision. I find sex much more prolonged and
      enjoyable.&mdash;Rob. [<a href="#Circinfo">Circinfo
      1999</a>]</p>

      <p class="quote">I was circumcised as a newborn so my
      perspective is from the point of always being circumcised. .
      . . Quite a few of my hundred plus partners (not bragging)
      have made unsolicted [<i>sic</i>] comments about their
      preference for circumcised partners and that they were
      pleased to see my penis had been neatly done. . . . Another
      advantage to my being circumcised is apparently lasting
      longer during sex; again commented upon by the ladies. This
      may come at the expense of some sesensitivty [<i>sic</i>].
      But again I cannot speak to that, since I have always been
      circumcised.&mdash; Bob. [<a href="#Circinfo">Circinfo
      1999</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Although these commentaries are mostly from
      men circumcised at a later age, I believe that they
      articulate constructions of male sexuality that are
      entrenched and pervasive. Importantly, these anecdotes speak
      to the role that sexual competence plays in constructions of
      contemporary masculinity, as many men clearly believe that
      any loss of sensitivity that accompanies circumcision is
      compensated by their enhanced sexual performance.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> Indeed, what is interesting here is
      how irrelevant the issue of reduced sensation is for both the
      men who have this operation and their sexual partners. This
      poses a striking contrast to the dominant discourses
      surrounding female genital cutting, where the idea of a woman
      undergoing genital surgery to enhance her partner&rsquo;s
      sexual pleasure (while concomitantly reducing her own level
      of sensation) strikes most observers as
      &ldquo;barbaric&rdquo; and misogynistic. The differing
      reaction these operations evoke is hardly surprising in light
      of the assumptions regarding instinctive, active male
      sexuality and fragile, passive female sexuality that I have
      detailed above. Thus, as Bordo points out, when it comes to
      sex, &ldquo;mostly, men&rsquo;s bodies are presented like
      action-hero toys&mdash;wind them up and watch them
      perform&rdquo; (<a href="#Bordo">1999</a>:191).</p>

      <h4>Genital Surgeries and the &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; Body</h4>

      <p class="text2">It is clear that popular discourses on
      genital cutting are infused with cultural assumptions about
      male and female sexuality. Yet, these same discourses display
      a tendency to essentialize and universalize human sexuality
      in rather disturbing ways. As Fuambai Ahmadu (<a
      href="#Ahmadu">2000</a>:284) notes,</p>

      <p class="quote">The aversion of some writers to the practice
      of female circumcision has more to do with deeply embedded
      Western cultural assumptions regarding women&rsquo;s bodies
      and their sexuality than with disputable health effects of
      genital operations on African women. . . . One universalized
      assumption is that human bodies are &ldquo;complete&rdquo;
      and that sex is &ldquo;given&rdquo; at birth. A second
      assumption is that the clitoris represents an integral aspect
      of femininity and has a central erotic function in
      women&rsquo;s sexuality.</p>

      <p class="text2">Ahmadu argues that many women (herself
      included) who had sexual experiences prior to excision
      perceive either no difference or increased sexual
      satisfaction. She also points out that many Western women who
      have clitorises are unable to achieve orgasms. Similarly,
      Rogaia Abusharaf (<a href="#Abusharaf">2000</a>:152) points
      out that Western women overemphasize the effects of female
      circumcision on sexual pleasure and that the specificity of
      African women&rsquo;s experience is overlooked.</p>

      <p class="text2">Ellen Gruenbaum (<a
      href="#Gruenbaum">2001</a>:133&ndash;157) also questions the
      generalization that female sexual response is destroyed in
      circumcised women, pointing out that these perspectives are,
      in part, the result of ethnocentrism. Discussing her Sudanese
      experiences, she documents the changes in her own perceptions
      of female sexuality, as they were challenged over the course
      of her fieldwork. Gruenbaum (<a
      href="#Gruenbaum">2001</a>:140&ndash; 141) writes,</p>

      <p class="quote">I knew that men have orgasms
      (&ldquo;finish&rdquo;) in sex, but do women also? Yes, I was
      told, women &ldquo;finish.&rdquo; I wanted to ascertain that
      what they were talking about was a true orgasm and not some
      vague conceptualization by women who had never personally
      experienced them. I pressed for a clearer description.
      Somewhat exasperated that I didn&rsquo;t seem to understand
      plain Arabic, a visiting midwife named Miriam grabbed by
      hand, squeezed by fingers, and said, &ldquo;Look, Ellen, some
      of us do &lsquo;finish.&rsquo; It feels like electricity,
      like this,&rdquo; and she flicked her finger sharply and
      rhythmically against my constricted fingers. Iwas convinced
      we were talking about the same thing.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Vicki Kirby (<a href="#Kirby">1987</a>:44),
      in an early article on female circumcision, cuts to the heart
      of the problem with applying Western understandings of
      sexuality to other cultural contexts. She writes,</p>

      <p class="quote">Although a whole battery of disciplinary
      practices (medical, pedagogical, familial, architectural,
      etc.) have <i>produced</i> what we take to be this essence of
      our personhood, we have reclaimed this cultural effect as a
      biological fact. Consequently, what has come to secure the
      &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of Western bodies becomes problematic
      when it is used as a universal, explanatory grid: the
      pleasures and desires of a body situated in other histories
      and other cultures, may not be so readily comprehended.</p>

      <p class="text2">Obermeyer (<a href="#Obermeyer">1999</a>:95)
      concurs, pointing out that while studies that systematically
      investigate the effects of genital cutting on female
      sexuality are rare, the available evidence raises important
      questions about whether the link between an intact clitoris
      and orgasm represents an indisputable physiological reality.
      Although scholars such as Mackie (<a
      href="#Mackie">2003</a>:151&ndash;153) are critical of
      approaches that question the causal connection between
      anatomy and orgasmic sexual response, a wealth of literature
      from disciplines as diverse as anthropology, cultural
      studies, literary studies, and feminist philosophy support
      such attempts to denaturalize the human body and
      sexuality.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is worth noting that questions can also
      be raised about the parallel tendency to reduce human
      sexuality to physiology in the literature opposing male
      circumcision,<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> where a great
      deal of attention is paid to the structure and sensitivity of
      the foreskin and its role in determining sexual response.
      Many activists tend to equate the reduced sensation
      accompanying the removal of the foreskin with a corresponding
      reduction in sexual pleasure. According to this logic, the
      more of the penile skin removed, the greater the decline in
      sexual satisfaction. However, as discussed, for many men,
      reduced sensation cannot be unproblematically linked with
      reduced sexual pleasure&mdash;hardly surprising when pleasure
      and performance are so inextricably linked in the minds of
      most men (and women). Once again, this demonstrates the
      fundamental problems in attempting to separate the
      physiological from the cultural dimensions of sexuality or,
      worse still, ignoring the cultural elements altogether.</p>

      <p class="text2">Let me be clear that I am not suggesting
      that sexuality bears no relation to physiology; however, it
      certainly cannot be reduced to it. My point is that sexual
      pleasure and desire are impossible to quantify and measure,
      and they are certainly not reducible to observable biological
      response.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> Clearly, many
      circumcised women feel that the operation constitutes a
      sexual mutilation that has greatly diminished their capacity
      to experience sexual pleasure (e.g., <a href="#Dirie">Dirie
      and Miller 1999</a>). And a growing number of men similarly
      feel that they have been sexually impaired by a medically
      unnecessary operation. However, some circumcised African
      women do not feel that their sexual capacities have been
      reduced through the operation, and countless men make similar
      claims. Thus, attempts to condemn genital cutting on these
      grounds alone (whether they be operations performed on
      females or males) seem doomed to failure, because the
      resulting discourse of sexual mutilation and incapacitation
      can be so far removed from people&rsquo;s personal
      experiences and daily lives. Ultimately, I do not endorse an
      extreme cultural relativism that denies the possibility of
      questioning the efficacy and value of female genital cutting;
      my key concern is with the <i>asymmetry</i> in discussions of
      genital cutting and the problematic assumptions they
      perpetuate.</p>

      <h4>Conclusions</h4>

      <p class="text2">Given the wide range of literature on
      genital cutting and the fact that research on this topic
      spans a variety of disciplines, including the medical
      sciences, anthropology, history, women&rsquo;s studies,
      psychology, social work, political science, law, literature,
      and the humanities (<a href="#Obermeyer">Obermeyer
      2003</a>:81; <a href="#Shell-Duncan1">Shell-Duncan and
      Hernlund 2000</a>:1), I recognize the problems in attempting
      to discuss &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; discourses, when a
      plurality of opinions clearly exists. However, despite the
      heterogeneous voices speaking on this topic, I believe that
      many of these perspectives share common reductionist
      tendencies. Therefore, I think that policy makers err in
      assuming that their readiness to condemn female circumcision
      and condone male circumcision stems merely from the natural
      attributes and effects of these practices. Medical and
      commonsense constructions of the human body are <i>not</i>
      divorced from cultural beliefs and values, and such
      assumptions about the nature of the male and female body need
      to be critically interrogated in all of their complexity.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is my view that genital operations become
      tied into much larger discourses about the nature of
      sexuality. As I have shown, in the context of genital
      cutting, assumptions are regularly invoked that are readily
      challenged elsewhere. These assumptions include the idea that
      the male body provides the basis for understanding the female
      body; that men are ruled by their penises and that females
      are sexually passive; and that human sexuality is reducible
      to anatomy and physiology.</p>

      <p class="text2">Unsurprisingly, this framework results in a
      widespread inability to conceptualize male circumcision as
      anything other than beneficial and a similar inability to
      conceptualize female circumcision as anything other than a
      form of sexual mutilation tied directly to patriarchal
      domination. However, I suggest that the terms under which
      female circumcision is presently condemned by international
      agencies such as the World Health Organization deserve close
      scrutiny. This scrutiny must be accompanied by a similar
      willingness to scrutinize male circumcision and a recognition
      that perceptions of one are fundamentally implicated in
      understandings of the other. Ultimately, it is only by
      examining <i>why</i> people react to male and female genital
      cutting in the way that they do that consideration of these
      issues can start to move beyond this limiting conceptual
      framework.</p>

      <i>Acknowledgments.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the
      views expressed in this article are my own, I have benefited
      from extensive discussions with Dr. Darlene McNaughton and
      Professor Sally McBeth. Dr. Alex Edmonds also provided useful
      feedback that forced me to sharpen and clarify my
      arguments.<br />
       <a id="n1"
      name="n1"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      1. Perhaps the comments of my students may seem anomalous in
      light of Nussbaum&rsquo;s (1999) discussion of her own
      undergraduate students&rsquo; reaction to female
      circumcision, where they were inclined to be &ldquo;ethical
      relativists.&rdquo; However, I would be interested to know
      how her students would have reacted had they been asked to
      consider the relationship between male and female
      circumcision. In my experience, students (often well versed
      in the writings of Naomi Wolf) are able to think far more
      critically about dieting and cosmetic surgery than male
      circumcision, given the fundamentally normalized status of
      the operation. As Gollaher (2000:205) points out, &ldquo;most
      Americans, even those who consider male circumcision
      unnecessary, cannot help but think of the circumcised penis
      as normal and the foreskin as a piece of excess
      skin.&rdquo;<br />
       <a id="n2"
      name="n2"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      2. See Hull and Budiharsana (2001) on Asia and Melanesia, and
      Peterson (2000) on Australia.<br />
       <a id="n3"
      name="n3"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      3. In some cases, the skin removal is apparently so excessive
      that men are &ldquo;cut back to the balls.&rdquo; This is
      common enough that the expression &ldquo;proud cut&rdquo; has
      developed to describe the effects (see the &ldquo;Personal
      Experiences&rdquo; section at http://www.circinfo.com).<br />
       <a id="n4"
      name="n4"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      4. It seems that some circumcisions in East Africa also fall
      into this category.<br />
       <a id="n5"
      name="n5"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      5. Reports indicate that it was still being conducted as late
      as 1983 (see Pounder 1983), although the operation seems to
      have been largely replaced by circumcision in recent years
      (see Peterson 2000).<br />
       <a id="n6"
      name="n6"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      6. Interestingly, female students tended to be the strongest
      advocates of this position.<br />
       <a id="n7"
      name="n7"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      7. Individual critiques along these lines have obviously
      existed for a number of years (e.g., Kirby 1987). However,
      the fact that four books devoted to this topic appeared in
      two years indicates that a more widespread and sustained
      critique has emerged.<br />
       <a id="n8"
      name="n8"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      8. Some scholars have even questioned this comparison,
      arguing that an operation removing merely the hood of the
      clitoris (a common definition of sunna circumcision) does not
      actually exist (see Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000:4).<br />
       <a id="n9"
      name="n9"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      9. Although several well-regarded studies have pointed to a
      connection between circumcision and lower HIV transmission
      rates, it is important to note that legitimate questions have
      been raised regarding the findings of these studies (see
      Gollaher 2000:149&ndash;152). Interestingly, despite the
      publicity surrounding these studies, few organizations have
      made active moves to instigate male circumcision as a public
      health measure. For example, although some organizations such
      as USAID (2003) seem to support the idea of mandating male
      circumcision as a tool in the fight against HIV/AIDS, their
      support is qualified, contingent on further research and
      clinical trials. Organizations such as the Population
      Council, the International Planned Parenthood Federation
      (IPPF), and the United Nations Family Planning Agency (UNFPA)
      are even more cautious, pointing to the ethical ramifications
      of promoting male circumcision (Population Council 2000:2)
      and the fact that male circumcision may be contraindicated by
      an increase in risk-taking behavior (UNFPA 2001). In light of
      these factors and many others, IPPF (2000) points out that it
      is impossible to predict whether the promotion of
      circumcision will ultimately reduce the prevalence of HIV. I
      should also point out that as female circumcision takes place
      in societies where male circumcision is simultaneously
      performed and the so-called AIDS belt corresponds largely
      with regions where circumcision (either male or female) is
      <i>not</i> practiced, a correlation also exists between
      female circumcision and lower HIV transmission rates. Yet, it
      is hard to imagine any health organization endorsing female
      circumcision on the basis of this correlation.<br />
       <a id="n10"
      name="n10"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      10. However, it is important to point out that opponents of
      male circumcision had existed in the United States well
      before the 1970s (e.g., Lewis 1949).<br />
       <a id="n11"
      name="n11"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      11. This seems to be the preferred term for activists
      opposing male circumcision (see Boyd 1998:12&ndash;13).<br />
       <a id="n12"
      name="n12"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      12. However, countries such as Australia, NewZealand, and the
      United Kingdom have witnessed substantial declines in
      neonatal circumcision rates over the past two decades.<br />
       <a id="n13"
      name="n13"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      13. Mackie (2003) also makes the point that evidence on male
      circumcision is not ideal, although his intent appears to be
      to show that evidence regarding the health complications of
      FGC is &ldquo;not peculiarly wanting&rdquo; (p. 146).<br />
       <a id="n14"
      name="n14"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      14. For example, it has been commonly asserted that male
      circumcision guards against cervical cancer in women, which
      seems to stem largely from flawed studies produced in the
      1940s and 1950s on Jews and gentiles (see Gollaher
      2000:140&ndash;142 for a discussion). Two former members of
      the American Cancer Society have also strongly rejected
      attempts to link male circumcision with reduced cervical
      cancer in women, stating &ldquo;Research suggesting a pattern
      in the circumcision status of partners of women with cervical
      cancer is methodologically flawed, outdated and has not been
      taken seriously in the medical community for decades&rdquo;
      (Shingleton and Heath 1996). Yet reputable papers such as the
      <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> (see Skatssoon and Jacobsen
      2003) continue to uncritically cite the circumcision and
      cervical cancer equation in discussions on the medical
      benefits of male circumcision.<br />
       <a id="n15"
      name="n15"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      15. See Mackie (2003) for a refutation of Obermeyer&rsquo;s
      arguments, and Obermeyer (2003) for her response.<br />
       <a id="n16"
      name="n16"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      16. The WHO (2004) discusses this possible link in the
      &ldquo;FGM&rdquo; section of their website
      (http://www.who.int). Although they mention that this link
      has not been the subject of detailed research, the fact that
      they discuss it at all provides covert legitimacy to this
      proposed &ldquo;health risk.&rdquo;<br />
       <a id="n17"
      name="n17"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      17. The same is also true of operations on intersexed
      infants. See Cheryl Chase (2002) on medical double standards
      in relation to intersexed infants in the United States, who
      are routinely subjected to surgery to modify and
      &ldquo;normalize&rdquo; the appearance of their
      genitals.<br />
       <a id="n18"
      name="n18"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      18. While some of these authors may find male circumcision
      entails a similar lack of consent, this is not stated,
      although many of the authors cited (e.g., Nussbaum 1999;
      Rahman and Toubia 2000) actively dismiss any connection
      between the two.<br />
       <a id="n19"
      name="n19"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      19. A good example of this sort of attention is the focus on
      Xhosa circumcision ceremonies in South Africa during the
      mid-1990s (e.g., Taylor 1995).<br />
       <a id="n20"
      name="n20"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      20. Virtually all of the preservationist websites make
      similar statements about the connection between secular male
      circumcision and attempts to cure masturbation but seem to
      rely on the research of scholars such as those cited.<br />
       <a id="n21"
      name="n21"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      21. The earlier Kinsey report made similar observations but
      did not receive the same widespread attention.<br />
       <a id="n22"
      name="n22"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      22. It appears that Nussbaum is relying in part on
      Toubia&rsquo;s definition.<br />
       <a id="n23"
      name="n23"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      23. This is true from a biomedical perspective at least.
      There are certainly cultural contexts where a female emission
      analogous to semen is recognized (e.g., India).<br />
       <a id="n24"
      name="n24"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      24. Her comments seem equally relevant to social
      constructions of masculinity in other Western countries such
      as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.<br />
       <a id="n25"
      name="n25"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      25. These names are pseudonyms as the authors hid their real
      identities.<br />
       <a id="n26"
      name="n26"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      26. The gun metaphor is used quite explicitly throughout the
      book&mdash;according to the authors, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shaped
      like a gun. It shoots. And, like a gun, a penis is definitely
      more dangerous when it&rsquo;s loaded than when it&rsquo;s
      unloaded&rdquo; (p. 27).<br />
       <a id="n27"
      name="n27"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      27. Such ideas are common in Australia, although perhaps less
      consciously articulated in the United States, where the
      majority of men are circumcised.<br />
       <a id="n28"
      name="n28"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      28. Clearly, being &ldquo;procircumcision&rdquo; only becomes
      a meaningful label in contexts where the practice is not
      fundamentally normalized, and, conversely, being
      &ldquo;anticircumcision&rdquo; becomes similarly charged in
      contexts where it is more taken for granted.<br />
       <a id="n29"
      name="n29"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      29. Although circlist.com seems to focus on the erotic and
      aesthetic dimensions of male circumcision far more explicitly
      than other procircumcision websites (many of the commentaries
      are accompanied by pornographic images), nevertheless, sites
      that focus on &ldquo;education&rdquo; such as circinfo.com
      contain similar commentaries, as the quotes show.<br />
       <a id="n30"
      name="n30"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      30. Of course, the opponents of male circumcision argue that
      it is precisely such loss of sensitivity that makes the
      operation a form of sexual mutilation.<br />
       <a id="n31"
      name="n31"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      31. Given my arguments regarding the role of culture in
      sexuality, I&rsquo;m not sure that it is possible to talk
      about orgasms cross-culturally as the &ldquo;same
      thing.&rdquo;<br />
       <a id="n32"
      name="n32"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      32. The proponents of circumcision occasionally demonstrate
      similar tendencies, as they focus on the fact that removal of
      the foreskin permanently exposes the sensitive penis glans.
      The anticircumcision websites counteract these claims by
      pointing to the fact that the exposure of the glans to
      everyday friction eventually results in a reduction in the
      sensitivity of the glans itself.<br />
       <a id="n33"
      name="n33"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      33. I certainly recognize the value of Masters and
      Johnston&rsquo;s interesting and important research, but I do
      not think that their clinical studies represent the final
      word on human sexuality.</p>
