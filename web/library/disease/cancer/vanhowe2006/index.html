      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Smegma, the collection of material in the
      subpreputial space, is perhaps the most maligned of all human
      products. This normal substance has been causally linked to
      cervical, prostatic and penile cancers, all matters
      unhygienic, and any preputial pathology for which a clear
      aetiology has not been established. While these associations
      are widely endorsed and disseminated, the scientific evidence
      supporting these claims is flimsy, or non-existent. In this
      review we explore the physical attributes of smegma, its
      function, its epidemiology, and the attempts to demonstrate
      its carcinogenic capabilities. Finally, to develop a full
      appreciation of the current status of smegma in the
      scientific community, the interpretation of smegma&rsquo;s
      role in health and in disease over the past two centuries
      needs to be chronicled.</p>

      <h4>Physical characteristics</h4>

      <p class="text1">The inner surface of the foreskin and the
      surface of the glans penis are mucosal membranes that must
      remain moist to function properly. Smegma beneficially serves
      to preserve subpreputial wetness. Smegma was once thought to
      result from secretions of ectopic sebaceous glands
      concentrated near the frenulum;<sup><a
      href="#n1">1&ndash;4</a></sup> however, subsequent
      histological study of hundreds of foreskins has failed to
      find these glands.<sup><a href="#n5">5&ndash;7</a></sup>
      Researchers at the Botkin&rsquo;s Hospital in Moscow have
      asserted that smegma is produced from minute microscopic
      protrusions of the mucosal surface of the foreskin. According
      to these scientists, living cells constantly grow towards the
      surface, undergo fatty degeneration, separate off, and form
      smegma.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> The presence of
      fructose and acid phosphatase in subpreputial material and
      the absence of urea indicate the presence of seminal vesical
      and prostatic secretions, but exclude the presence of
      urine.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Smegma also contains
      desquamated epithelial cells and the mucin content of the
      urethral glands of Littre.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Smegma takes on the colour of the inner
      lining of the prepuce and is darker in highly pigmented
      individuals. In most men it is odourless,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> but it has been reported to harden
      into &lsquo;smegma stones&rsquo; in men with extremely poor
      hygienic habits.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Chemically, smegma contains immunologically
      active compounds such as cathepsin B, lysozyme, chymotrypsin,
      neutrophil elastase,<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      cytokines,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> and hormones such
      as androsterone.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Lytic
      materials, such as lysozyme, which probably originates from
      the prostate and seminal vesicles, <sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> destroy bacterial cell walls and
      inhibit and destroy Candidal species.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A 1958 chemical analysis found the dry
      weight of smegma to be 28.4% total lipids, with 0.8%
      phospholipids, 3.8% free cholesterol, 1.0% cholesterol esters
      and 22.8% neutral fats.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      Similarly, a 1973 analysis found smegma to be 26.6% fat and
      13.3% protein, consistent with necrotic epithelial
      debris.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Three distinct steroids
      have been identified in smegma.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Function</h4>

      <p class="text1">Smegma protects and lubricates the glans and
      inner lamella of the prepuce, facilitating erection,
      preputial eversion and penetration during sexual intercourse.
      This natural lubricant allows for prolonged intercourse and
      eliminates the need for artificial supplemental lubrication
      during normal coitus or masturbation.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Epidemiology</h4>

      <p class="text1">A study of 1000 Indian men without phimosis
      found that 198 had a very thin coating of smegma [19.8%, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) = 17.33&ndash;22.27], 141 had an
      obvious thin layer of smegma (14.1%, 95% CI = 11.94&ndash;
      16.26), 41 had a 1-mm-thick layer of smegma (4.1%, 95% CI =
      2.87&ndash;5.33), 20 had thick, caked-on smegma (2.00%, 95%
      CI = 1.13&ndash;2.87), and 600 had no smegma at all (60.00%,
      95% CI = 56.96&ndash;63.04). <sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      By contrast, Jayant evaluated Indian men and reported
      &lsquo;++&rsquo; smegma in 44% of Hindus, 44% of Christians,
      6% of Parsis, and 0% of Muslims. The number of men studied
      and the criteria for &lsquo;++&rsquo; smegma were not
      provided.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Of 64 men in India who required surgical
      correction for phimosis, only four (6.25%, 95% CI =
      0.32&ndash;12.18) had smegma noted at surgery.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> Subsequently, in 1980, Parkash and
      Rao reported that: &lsquo;In the absence of adhesions, no
      subpreputial collection was found in any patient with
      phimosis examined critically since 1972.&rsquo;<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In a strongly pro-circumcision article,
      smegma was found in 19.2% of 3000 German men between 18 and
      22 years of age. One-third of these had &lsquo;a large
      amount&rsquo; of smegma. The men were graded as to the
      appearance of their foreskins. Class A had glans and coronal
      sulcus exposed, class B glans partially covered, class C
      glans entirely covered, but sulcus could be exposed by
      retraction, class D glans entirely covered, but only able to
      visualize meatus or part of glans on retraction, class E
      glans completely covered with rigid preputial opening. The
      prevalence of smegma increased with each class of foreskin: A
      = not reported, B = 11.8% (1/3 with a lot), C = 24.3% (1/3
      with a lot), D = 35.3% (1/2 with a lot), E = &lsquo;always
      present but impossible to confirm&rsquo;.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The results of a study of 347 genitally
      intact American men indicate that 70.53% (95% CI =
      66.50&ndash;74.56) had no smegma on the glans penis and
      66.67% (95% CI = 62.50&ndash;70.83) had no smegma in the
      coronal sulcus. Only 2.44% and 2.85% had marked amounts of
      smegma on the glans penis and in the coronal sulcus,
      respectively. There was a negative correlation between the
      amount of smegma noted and the degree of foreskin
      retractability (P &lt;0.0001).<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In a study out of Salt Lake City, Utah, of
      45 genitally intact males aged from 2 months to 52 years
      (mean 10.5 years), 13 were noted to have smegma on physical
      examination (28.89%, 95% CI = 15.65&ndash;42.13). The amount
      or thickness was not noted.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 9545 observations in 1968 Danish
      schoolboys aged 6 to 17 years, smegma was noted to be present
      in only 5.26%, with the lowest rate being in 6- to
      7-year-olds (0.92%) and the highest rate in 14- to
      15-year-olds (9.41%). The risk of smegma increased with age
      [odds ratio (OR) = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.57&ndash;1.85 for each
      2-year stratum].<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In Japanese children, of 3238 boys aged 1 to
      12 months, smegma was notable in only 16 (0.49%, 95% CI =
      0.25&ndash; 0.74) and for 1283 boys aged 3 years, smegma was
      notable in only five (0.39%, 95% CI =
      0.05&ndash;0.73).<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Of 93 British boys referred for a
      non-retractile foreskin, 10 were noted to have smegma
      (10.75%, 95% CI = 4.46&ndash; 17.05).<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> In another British study of 120 boys
      referred to a paediatric urologist for circumcision, one was
      referred because of smegma.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Microbiology</h4>

      <p class="text1"><i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> was
      originally isolated in smegma, but the association probably
      ends there. While Parkash <i>et al.</i> were able to find the
      &lsquo;smegma bacillus&rsquo; in half of Indian men,<sup><a
      href="#n">5</a></sup> in other studies, <i>M. smegmatis</i>
      is rarely isolated from the genital tract,<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> nor is it the source of disease
      there.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> The organism is found
      in dirt and its original isolation from smegma was most
      probably coincidental.</p>

      <h4>Animal studies</h4>

      <p class="text1">Nearly all studies investigating the alleged
      carcinogenic properties of smegma were conducted in the 1940s
      and 1950s. In 1942, Fishman <i>et al.</i> obtained smegma
      from institutionalized elderly men and suspended it in lard.
      This was injected into the left axilla of 20 young mice.
      Likewise, smegma was introduced into the vaginas of 20 mice
      three times a week for 12 months. As a control, 10 mice had a
      5% solution of 3,4-benzpyrene in cholesterol introduced into
      the vagina two to three times a week until a tumour appeared.
      One of the mice with the axillary injections developed a
      mammary adenocarcinoma, which the authors believed may have
      been spontaneous. None of the mice with vaginal insertion of
      smegma developed genital tumours, while all of the control
      mice developed tumours by 14 months.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1947, Plaut and Kohn-Speyer placed horse
      smegma in surgically created &lsquo;skin tunnels&rsquo; in
      190 mice every 2 to 3 weeks, subcutaneously in 122 mice, and
      the non-soap fraction of horse smegma in skin tunnels in 88
      mice. Horse smegma was used because human smegma could not be
      obtained in sufficient quantities. Cerumen was used as a
      control substance on &lsquo;most&rsquo; of the 150 control
      mice. The resulting tumours are shown in Table 1. There was
      no significant association between tumours of any type and
      application of horse smegma.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">This study suffers from two serious
      methodological problems. The first is missing data, as only
      53% of the mice survived long enough to be evaluated.
      Survival was unequal between treated and control mice, with
      treated mice surviving longer (log-rank &divide; 2 = 19.73,
      <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001; hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI =
      0.57&ndash;0.84). This increased survival, while potentially
      an unheralded benefit of smegma application, would allow
      treated mice more opportunity to develop tumours. Using
      Poisson regression, none of the tumour types, alone or in
      combination with others, was found to be more common in
      treated mice (Table 1).</p>

      <p class="text2">The second methodological flaw was the use
      of horse smegma. While horse smegma is available in
      prodigious quantities, the fatty acid patterns of horse and
      human smegma are widely divergent.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> Thus any extrapolations from horse
      to human smegma are fraught with danger. Although many
      circumcision advocates cite this article as supportive of
      smegma&rsquo;s role as a carcinogen,<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> the original authors concluded,
      &lsquo;There is nothing to indicate the possible nature of
      the supposed carcinogenic factor in smegma.&rsquo;<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The third study was an extension of the
      second study and was published in 1949. Unable to demonstrate
      that unadulterated smegma was carcinogenic, the investigators
      hypothesized that cholesterol in smegma was converted to
      carcinogens by <i>M. smegmatis</i>. The authors were unable
      to demonstrate the conversion of cholesterol to carcinogenic
      compounds that could not be attributed to the incidental
      molecular oxygenation.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The fourth study was published by
      Pratt-Thomas <i>et al.</i> in 1956,<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> with additional study groups being
      added and republished by Heins <i>et al.</i> in 1958.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> The authors used human smegma
      obtained from the South Carolina State Mental Hospital and
      injected it into the vaginas of female mice. The raw smegma
      was collected in sterile normal saline, centrifuged, and
      ground into a paste. Mice were deleted from final
      pathological evaluation if postmortem changes were extreme,
      if the animals had been partially devoured by cage mates, or
      if death occurred within a few days after they were committed
      to the experiment.</p>

      <p class="text2">As with previous studies, the number of mice
      living long enough to be evaluated for tumour development was
      low (62.4%). Weekly vaginal injection of smegma (group 1)
      produced no tumours, but biweekly injection (group 2) yielded
      four invasive carcinomas, which the authors &lsquo;judged to
      be significant&rsquo;. When the biweekly vaginal injection
      experiment was repeated (group 18), however, the
      investigators were unable to replicate their earlier
      results.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> In a similar
      fashion, they were unable to induce any tumours by injecting
      smegma into skin tunnels (group 11) or with biweekly vaginal
      injection of smegma into another strain of mice (group 20).
      We performed a post hoc analysis using two control groups:
      group 17 in which a clean speculum and obturator were
      vaginally inserted, and groups 9 or 10 in which dermoid cyst
      material was inserted. Using intent-to-treat analysis the
      various comparisons are shown in Table 2.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two of the tumours in group 2 were described
      in questionable terms, but were included in these
      calculations, none of which yielded a statistically
      significant result. The authors doubted whether dermoid-cyst
      material was an appropriate control, stating, &lsquo;It
      [dermoid-cyst material] was not sufficiently different from
      smegma to qualify as a control agent, but we feel that its
      ability to produce epithelial hyperplasia and even carcinoma
      in these mice does not nullify the significance of a similar
      effect produced by smegma; rather, because of the similarity
      between the two, it reinforces their importance.&rsquo; We
      disagree with this interpretation; their data fail to provide
      any evidence of smegma&rsquo;s carcinogenic potential
      regardless of the control group used.</p>

      <p class="text2">The final animal study was published by
      Indian researchers Reddy and Baruah in 1963.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> Twenty-nine male and 26 female mice
      had a paste of fresh human smegma applied to their genitals
      and bared skin three times weekly for 16 months. In the
      females, the smegma was rubbed onto the vagina and cervix by
      rotating a fine glass rod. A control group of 10 male and 10
      female mice had sterile saline applied using the same methods
      and frequency. No malignancies developed in any of the
      animals.</p>

      <p class="text2">While cancer produced in one species of
      animal does not necessarily extrapolate to other
      species,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> none of the
      experiments in mice provided any evidence that smegma is a
      carcinogen.</p>

      <h4>Human studies</h4>

      <p class="text1">The first study to attempt to find a
      relationship between smegma and disease in humans was
      published in 1968. Believing they had made a breakthrough
      discovery, the authors reported four smegma specimens from
      198 male subjects that yielded herpes simplex virus on viral
      culture. Not surprisingly, all four men had clinical evidence
      of active genital herpes.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1973, Terris <i>et al.</i> looked for an
      association between the amount of smegma on a woman&rsquo;s
      primary sexual partner and cervical cancer, carcinoma <i>in
      situ</i>, or cervical dysplasia. No association could be
      demonstrated for smegma on the glans penis (OR = 0.81, 95% CI
      = 0.55&ndash; 1.20 adjusted for cervical pathology), nor for
      smegma in the coronal sulcus (OR = 0.74, 95% CI =
      0.51&ndash;1.09 adjusted for cervical pathology).
      Interestingly, smegma on the glans was associated with a
      decreased risk of cervical dysplasia (OR = 0.47, 95% CI =
      0.22&ndash;0.98).<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In an Indian study, 80 consecutive men being
      treated for histologically proven penile cancer and 80
      control men without penile cancer were compared. The wives of
      44 cases were examined for cervical dysplasia and carcinoma.
      All were negative. The authors concluded that &lsquo;the
      importance of smegma in the causation of cervical cancer is
      probably minor&rsquo;.<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The abstract from a study published in
      Chinese in 1986 notes that risk factors for cervical cancer
      included sexual activity, smegma and cervical erosion.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup> The magnitude of the associations
      and the source of the smegma are not provided in the
      abstract, so it is unknown whether the abstract reflects
      findings made in the study or merely repeats the claim
      because it was the paradigm at the time.</p>

      <p class="text2">Brinton <i>et al.</i> reported on women with
      cervical cancer in Panama, Costa Rica, Columbia and Mexico.
      Detection of smegma under the foreskin of the regular sexual
      partner of these women was associated with cervical cancer
      (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.03&ndash;2.31, Fisher&rsquo;s exact
      test <i>P</i> = 0.0407).<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> Roy
      <i>et al.</i> screened women in Calcutta for cervical
      cytology. The study failed to support the smegma theory of
      cervical carcinoma. <sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1991 Brinton <i>et al.</i> published the
      results of potential risk factors for penile cancer in men in
      China. Using raw data, five cases had no smegma, 25 had
      smegma, and 15 were unreported. For the control men, 46 had
      no smegma, 21 had smegma, and two were unreported. Using the
      raw data the association is significant (OR = 10.51, 95% CI =
      3.52&ndash;31.37). This should not be taken at face value.
      There is a serious missing data problem. If extreme
      assumptions are used with the missing data, one extreme
      yields a result that is not statistically significant (see
      Table 3). Likewise, the smegma association is more easily
      explained by the association of phimosis and penile cancer.
      When controlled for phimosis using logistic regression, the
      association between smegma and penile cancer lessens
      considerably (OR = 3.48, 95% CI = 0.95&ndash; 12.67) and is
      no longer statistically significant. Missing data are still a
      problem in this analysis with one extreme yielding a result
      in the opposite direction (see Table 3). The smegma finding
      could also be confounded by substandard general hygienic
      practices and is evidence thereof.<sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1993, Maden <i>et al.</i> published their
      comparisons of men with penile cancers (carcinoma <i>in
      situ</i> and invasive carcinoma) in the Pacific North-West to
      controls. We must emphasize that most of the subjects were
      elderly, poor, alcoholic, uneducated smokers with substandard
      and unhealthy hygienic and lifestyle practices and a history
      of venereal disease. Smegma and difficulty in retracting the
      foreskin were both associated with penile cancer (Table 3);
      however, no attempt was made to control for retractability or
      phimosis. As carcinoma <i>in situ</i> and invasive carcinoma
      can result in preputial scarring and difficulty in retracting
      the foreskin and this difficulty in retracting can result in
      smegma accumulation, smegma accumulation could have resulted
      from the carcinomas rather than vice versa. This study also
      relied on questioning rather than examining the subjects, so
      there may be an unknown reporting bias.<sup><a

      <h4>Smegma as it stands in history</h4>

      <p class="text1">Abraham Ravich credits himself with
      originating the smegma theory of disease in 1941,<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> but he was not the first to
      pathologize smegma. Medical concern over smegma first emerged
      during the masturbation hysteria in the nineteenth century.
      In the prebacteriological age, smegma was not considered an
      unclean, disease-causing substance; rather, it was
      acknowledged as a natural element of male sexuality.<sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup> In an age when all sexual sensations
      and activities were discouraged and demonized, however,
      smegma was believed to stimulate erection and enhance orgasm.
      The highly respected French physician, Claude-
      Fran&ccedil;ois Lallemand (1790&ndash;1853), pronounced that
      smegma could provoke erections that would lead to
      &lsquo;disastrous pleasures&rsquo;.<sup><a
      href="#n47">47</a></sup> The power of an accumulation of
      smegma to erogenously stimulate the nervous system was
      consistent with the accepted theory of reflex
      &lsquo;irritation&rsquo;, a term then understood to mean
      &lsquo;stimulation&rsquo; rather than its modern connotation
      of discomfort. Thus a boy stimulated by smegma would
      &lsquo;relieve himself of this irritation by rubbing the
      foreskin over the glans, and as a consequence he may develop
      the habit [of masturbation]&rsquo;.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The American physician Roberts Bartholow
      (1831&ndash; 1904) formulated the theory that smegma produced
      &lsquo;hyper&aelig;sthesia&rsquo; of the glans. Bartholow
      argued that the level of sensitivity of the <i>natural</i>
      penis (where the foreskin is present and covers the glans) to
      be <i>abnormal</i> and pathologically exacerbated. <sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1914, erroneous medical beliefs about
      smegma were compounded by influential American urologist and
      eugenicist Abraham Wolbarst (1872&ndash;1952), who updated
      the demonization of the foreskin and promulgated the idea
      that it harboured &lsquo;carcinogenic secretions&rsquo;.
      Wolbarst&rsquo;s lifelong crusade to promote circumcision was
      initially provoked as a means of countering contemporary
      medical concerns over the unsanitary and occasionally deadly
      aspects of ritual Jewish circumcision, specifically the
      prescribed sucking of blood from the wound. Rather than being
      unsanitary, Wolbarst countered that circumcision was, in
      fact, so sanitary that it should be imposed on all males.
      Wolbarst&rsquo;s definition of &lsquo;sanitation&rsquo;,
      however, was more heavily suffused with the antimasturbation
      hysteria concept of &lsquo;moral sanitation&rsquo; than
      concern for physical cleanliness. Referring to smegma,
      Wolbarst made the bigoted characterization of
      &lsquo;gentiles&rsquo; of even middle-class standing as being
      unable to &lsquo;pay proper attention to the cleansing of
      their genitals&rsquo;. Wolbarst thundered in <i>JAMA</i>:
      &lsquo;Times innumerable, in my experience, the stench
      arising from the confined and retained balanic secretions has
      been almost unbearable&rsquo;, and thus &lsquo;the argument
      for circumcision as a measure of hygiene must be apparent to
      any but a man deprived of his olfactory sense&rsquo;.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Additionally, drawing on the pervasive and
      unchallenged nineteenth-century medical dogma that the
      &lsquo;irritation&rsquo; caused by the foreskin was a potent
      cause of epilepsy, convulsions, insanity, masturbation,
      spinal paralysis and acute melancholia,<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup> in 1926 and again in 1932 Wolbarst
      simply inserted penile cancer into that list by accusing the
      foreskin of maintaining a &lsquo;state of chronic
      irritation&rsquo;, inflammation, &lsquo;erosions,
      excoriations, and raw patches&rsquo;.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48,52</a></sup> Just as nineteenth-century
      physicians had blamed the foreskin for retaining secretions
      that heightened the sensitivity of the penis and stimulated
      the nervous system to produce &lsquo;reflex diseases&rsquo;,
      Wolbarst insisted that the foreskin caused the diseases that
      were of concern to the medical profession of his era, namely
      venereal disease and cancer.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the carcinogenicity of smegma has
      never been demonstrated, smegma has been cited as a
      carcinogen by at least one article in the 1940s and 1950s,
      nine articles in the 1960s, four articles in the 1970s, seven
      articles in the 1980s, 17 articles in the 1990s, and two
      articles in the present decade. It appears as though the myth
      has gained favour with time. Some researchers, when
      mentioning smegma, are unconvinced about its impact on
      disease, yet are compelled to include smegma in their
      discussion of cancer aetiology. We found at least 17 articles
      that used this approach. Most disturbing is the continued
      mention of smegma as a risk factor for penile cancer in
      recent textbooks. One of the textbooks fails to mention
      smoking as a risk factor,<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup>
      despite clear evidence of an association between smoking and
      penile cancer.<sup><a href="#n44">44,54,55</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Like any myth, the harm attributed to smegma
      has evolved over time and with retelling. For example, a case
      report of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in a
      circumcised man published by Ross <i>et al</i>. in 1998
      states that smegma may be causative of penile cancer after
      being converted to a carcinogen by <i>M.
      smegmatis</i>.<sup><a href="#n56">56</a></sup> To support
      this statement, the authors cited a report published in
      <i>Urology</i> by members of the urology department at the
      Mayo Clinic.<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup> In this 1993
      study of the role of human papillomavirus in penile
      carcinomas, the Mayo urologists stated, in the discussion
      section, that previous studies had shown &lsquo;that
      application of smegma from horses (which have a high
      incidence of penile cancer) to the skin of mice induces
      condylomata acuminata and SCC [squamous cell
      carcinoma]&rsquo; and that &lsquo;that smegma sterols may be
      converted to carcinogenic sterols by <i>Mycobacterium
      smegmatis</i>, which is present from the first few days of
      life&rsquo;. Instead of citing the primary studies to support
      these statements, which do not exist, the authors cite an
      opinion piece written by a well-known circumcision
      advocate.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> Having done so,
      they even managed to misquote their source.</p>

      <p class="text2">Even though their inaccurate portrayal of
      smegma was exposed in a pair of letters to the editor,<sup><a
      href="#n58">58,59</a></sup> this did not deter the Mayo
      urologists. Similar inaccuracies were found in a 1995 study
      published in the <i>Journal of Urology</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> Avoiding the word
      &lsquo;smegma&rsquo;, a 1998 study published in
      <i>Urology</i> by the same the group referred to the
      subpreputial space as a &lsquo;cocoon of
      carcinogenesis&rsquo; and host to &lsquo;a multitude of
      carcinogenic factors and cofactors&rsquo; without identifying
      any of the factors or providing any references to support
      their assertions.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Hill&rsquo;s criteria</h4>

      <p class="text1">It is impossible to assert a causal
      relationship based on retrospective data. Hill developed
      criteria for assessing whether a strong case can be made for
      causality based on retrospective data.<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></p>

      <h5>Strength</h5>

      <p class="text1">There have been very few associations
      documented between smegma and disease that were statistically
      significant let alone having a high odds ratio.</p>

      <h5>Consistency</h5>

      <p class="text1">Study results have fairly consistently
      failed to show an association between smegma and genital
      cancers.</p>

      <h5>Specificity</h5>

      <p class="text1">Findings of an association between smegma
      and genital cancers may in fact be due to phimosis and
      hygienic practices. In studies where phimosis was adjusted
      for, smegma was not a contributing factor.</p>

      <h5>Temporality</h5>

      <p class="text1">Accumulation of smegma prior to the
      development of genital cancers has never been demonstrated
      and a logical argument, as presented above, suggests that
      smegma accumulation may be the result of penile cancers.</p>

      <h5>Biological gradient</h5>

      <p class="text1">If smegma is to be put forth as a cause of
      genital cancers, it should be shown that more smegma
      translates into more genital cancers. A demonstration of this
      has never been undertaken. Given the small percentage of men
      with smegma on examination, the even smaller percentage of
      men with significant accumulations of smegma, and extreme
      rarity of penile cancer, such a study would be nearly
      impossible to accomplish. Women are known to produce more
      smegma than males, so one would expect more vulvar carcinomas
      in women than penile cancer in men. This is not the
      case.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <h5>Biological plausibility</h5>

      <p class="text1">No known carcinogens have been isolated from
      smegma, even after incubation with <i>M. smegmatis</i>.</p>

      <h5>Coherence</h5>

      <p class="text1">Recent research has shown that the foreskin,
      other than having additional tissue that eventually may
      become cancerous, is not a factor in the development of
      penile cancer. The risk comes from the development of
      phimosis,<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> and perhaps more
      specifically the result of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans.<sup><a href="#n64">64&ndash;66</a></sup>
      Likewise, the development of cervical cancer is most strongly
      linked to human papillomavirus infections, while
      approximately half of penile cancers appear to be due to the
      virus.</p>

      <h5>Experimental evidence</h5>

      <p class="text1">Laboratory studies with mice have failed to
      demonstrate the carcinogenic properties of smegma.</p>

      <h5>Analogy</h5>

      <p class="text1">There are no other natural human secretions
      produced in physiological quantities that have been shown to
      induce cancer. Likewise, as the development of the male and
      female external genital organs is similar, it is illogical
      that 90% of carcinomas of the penis develop from the glans
      and the prepuce compared to only 25% clitoral involvement in
      females. If the agent of these carcinomas is similar, the
      distribution of the carcinomas would be expected to follow
      the embryological development of the organs, but they do
      not.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">If the smegma theory were correct, penile
      cancer rates and cervical cancer rates should have fallen
      with increasing neonatal circumcision rates in North
      America.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> This has not
      happened. Despite the introduction of Pap smears, cervical
      cancer rates have risen because of an increase in human
      papillomavirus infections, which cause of most of these
      cancers. Similarly, the USA, rather than having falling
      penile cancer rates, has a higher penile cancer rate than
      many Scandinavian countries where routine neonatal
      circumcision is not performed.<sup><a
      href="#n62">62,67,68</a></sup></p>

      <h5>Conclusion</h5>

      <p class="text1">The evidence does not support the theory
      that smegma is a cause of genital cancer.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">The smegma theory of disease was best stated
      by Boczko and Freed: &lsquo;Smegma, a sterol, produced by
      Tyson&rsquo;s glands in the epithelium of the retroglandular
      sulcus, has been implicated as the causative agent. It may be
      converted to a carcinogen by the action of the
      <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>.&rsquo;<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">From the medical literature we have found
      that smegma is not a sterol, that there are no Tyson&rsquo;s
      glands, that smegma is not converted to a carcinogen by <i>M.
      smegmatis</i>, and that <i>M. smegmatis</i> is not part of
      the normal genital flora. The myth is sustained only by its
      popularity among circumcision advocates.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some have extrapolated the smegma theory by
      hypothesizing that men with inadequate circumcisions may be
      at risk for cancer because smegma can accumulate under any
      foreskin remnants.<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> In similar
      fashion, Abraham Ravish expanded the smegma theory to indict
      smegma as the cause of prostate cancer by travelling upstream
      through the urethra to invade the prostate gland.<sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup> Davis-Daneshfar and Trueb speculated
      that chronic infection with <i>M. smegmatis</i> is the cause
      of plasma cell (Zoon&rsquo;s) balanitis,<sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup> but Yoganathan <i>et al</i>. could
      not isolate the organism in any of their cases.<sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some have shown an unwillingness to abandon
      the smegma theory. When it was postulated that sperm proteins
      caused cervical cancer, it was the smegma mixing with the
      sperm proteins that were to blame.<sup><a
      href="#n74">74</a></sup> When diaphragm use was found to
      decrease cervical cancer, it was postulated that it provided
      a barrier to contact with smegma.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> When it was clear that cervical
      cancer resulted from a viral infection, some still postulated
      that smegma was a necessary part for the viral exposure to be
      carcinogenic.<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> Those promoting
      the &lsquo;cocoon&rsquo; theory prefer to think of smegma as
      a cofactor in the development of penile cancer. There are two
      reasons to dismiss this speculation. First, there is no
      scientific evidence to support the assertion. Second, it is
      analogous to declaring saliva a cofactor in the development
      of lip cancer in those who chew tobacco. Both saliva and
      smegma are bodily fluids that serve a function and, like any
      other bodily fluid, are present in organs than can develop a
      malignancy.</p>

      <p class="text2">The purpose of the scientific method is to
      distinguish between wishful thinking, strongly held opinion,
      and provable fact. The smegma theory of disease, which began
      as wishful thinking on the part of circumcision zealots such
      as Abraham Wolbarst and Abraham Ravich, has evolved into
      irrefutable dogma, but as modern physicians, we need to
      recognize that, until proved otherwise, smegma is
      harmless.</p>
