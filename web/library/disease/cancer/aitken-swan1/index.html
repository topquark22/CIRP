      <p class="text">T<span class="sc1">HE</span> relative
      frequency of cancer of the uterine cervix in Jewish women
      compared with women of other races has interested
      epidemiologists since the beginning of the century, but has
      not yet been explained. The average annual number of cases
      per 100,000 Jewish women in Israel over a 19-year period has
      been shown by Hochman, Ratzkowski and Schreiber (1955) to be
      2&middot;2, while the rate per 100,000 women elsewhere ranges
      from 17 in Sweden to 44 in a group of 10 cities in the U.S.A.
      Reasons for the disparity have been sought in genetics, in
      the Jewish ritual laws governing sexual hygiene and in the
      possible protective effects of universal male circumcision.
      Support for the circumcision hypothesis is found in the lower
      frequency of cancer of the cervix in other populations who
      practice circumcision when compared with populations who do
      not. Again, penile cancer is rare in those circumcised at an
      early age, suggesting some carcinogenic property of smegma
      and an association between poor penile hygiene and cancer of
      the cervix. It is not easy to isolate the effect of
      circumcision from that of many simultaneous variables and
      environmental differences between population groups.
      Circumcision has been included among the factors considered
      in several careful studies of the aetiology of the disease,
      but its importance is still in doubt. The difficulty in
      finding out if there is a lower rate of cancer among wives of
      circumcised non-Jewish men lies in ascertaining accurately
      who is or is not effectively circumcised, and in obtaining
      the information for all of the partners of each woman. While
      the second difficulty seems insurmountable, the present study
      attempts to compare, by physical examination in 110 cases,
      the circumcision status of present husbands of women with
      pre-clinical and clinically diagnosed cancer of the cervix
      and husbands of matched controls. Even such a small number is
      of interest when the facts about circumcision are definitely
      established. Moreover, the study has shown what degree of
      co-operation can be obtained in such an inquiry and what
      error there would be were examination dispensed with and the
      husband's or wives report relied on.</p>

      <p class="section">PREVIOUS WORK</p>

      <p class="text">In population groups other than Jewish,
      practicing circumcision, lower rates of cervical cancer have
      been noted when compared with groups in the same general
      environment who do not practise circumcision. Examples have
      come from the Fiji Islands (Handley, 1936), India (Wynder
      <i>et al.</i>, 1954) and more recently Macedonia (Kmet <i>et
      al.</i>, 1963). Graham, Sotto and Paloucek (1962) point out
      that Handley was comparing the rate of cervical cancer in a
      Fijiian circumcised population in whom the incidence of
      cancer generally was very low (Polynesian and Melanesian)
      with the rate in an uncircumcised immigrant Indian
      population, predominantly Hindu, in whom the incidence of
      cancer of the cervix, in India at any rate was high.
      Khanolkar's (1950) figures for patients attending the Tata
      Memorial Hospital in Bombay, suggest a higher relative
      frequency of cervical cancer in Moslems than in Parsees,
      although the former practise circumcision and the latter do
      not. Parsees attach great importance to personal cleanliness,
      and on the assumption that this explains the low cancer
      frequency one would expect the Moslems to achieve the same
      effect by circumcision. That circumcision does not fully
      explain differences in rates is also indicated by Kmet's
      study in Macedonia. While cancer of the cervix was found less
      frequently in circumcised Moslems than in the uncircumcised
      non-Moslems, the frequency of pre-malignant and malignant
      conditions of the cervix was 5&middot;5 per 1,000 in &ldquo;
      emancipated &rdquo; Moslems and nil in the orthodox Moslems
      adhering strictly to religious rules regarding sexual
      hygiene.</p>

      <p class="text">Wynder <i>et al</i>. (1954), in their study
      of environmental factors in cancer of the cervix, asked women
      in several wards whether or not their husbands were
      circumcised. If they did not know they were asked to find out
      from their husbands. Wynder admitted that this data was not
      ideal&mdash;the woman's or husband's statement was
      uncorroborated and not all could give the necessary
      information. They found that more husbands in the control
      than in the cancer group were reported to be circumcised and
      this was so for all the population groups studied, white
      non-Jewish, Negro, small group of Jewish, patients at
      Memorial Clinic separately and at all clinics combined.</p>

      <p class="text">In a study made in Los Angeles, Jones,
      Macdonald and Breslow (1958), who also obtained their
      information by interview, found that when Jewish women were
      excluded circumcision was as frequent in cases as in
      controls. They do not discuss the validity of their
      circumcision data, although they regrouped cases and controls
      by various techniques to verify the initial conclusion.</p>

      <p class="text">Dunn and Buell (1959) looked critically at
      contradictory findings on circumcision of these two studies.
      Using the material of Jones and associates, they worked out
      the age-standardized expected number of patients with
      circumcised and uncircumcised husbands. <span
      class="yellow">They too found no association between cervical
      cancer and lack of circumcision of the husband.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Further negative evidence has recently been
      provided by Boyd and Doll (1964) who asked married women in a
      survey if their husbands were circumcised. They found that a
      third could not give a definite answer and of the remainder
      very similar proportions of patients and controls said that
      they had an one time been married to an uncircumcised
      man.</p>

      <p>Contradictory results on the association between cervical
      cancer and circumcision raised doubts about the diagnostic
      criteria of circumcision used and the validity of statements
      made by the patients. Noting Wynder's difficulty in obtaining
      reliable facts about the husbands&rsquo; circumcision status,
      Lilienfeld and Graham (1958) compared statements of 192 male
      patients on their circumcision status with the findings of
      the physician making the first routine physical examination
      of the patient on admission to hospital. They found
      disagreement between statement and examination results in
      about 34 percent of cases, most frequently in those who said
      that they were not circumcised when physical examination
      indicated the reverse. They found no explanation of the wide
      discrepancy in unfamiliarity with the English language, lack
      of education (as indicated by occupation) or in mistakes in
      classification by one or more of the examining physicians.
      They fact that surgical circumcision had been performed was
      of less importance than the actual amount of foreskin
      removed.</p>

      <p class="text">Dunn and Buell (1959) comparing the opinions
      of 184 men on their circumcision status with the results of
      an examination made by physicians decided that the only
      question that could be answered by the examination was: is
      the patient effectively circumcised anatomically? They found
      that over a third of the men (37&middot;5 per cent) were
      partially circumcised, suggesting that a sizable proportion
      of non-Jewish males in the U.S.A. have a short foreskin which
      occurs naturally or as a result of operation. By contrast,
      Jewish men were almost invariably fully circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">In a further study to test the reliability of
      circumcision data <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/wynder1/">Wynder and
      Licklider</a> (1960) interviewed and examined 100 male
      hospital patients in New York and a similar number in Los
      Angeles, care being taken to use the same criteria defining
      circumcision. A quarter of the 200 male patients weer unable
      to state correctly their circumcision status. They also asked
      a similar number of female patients in the two cities for
      their circumcision status of their husbands, and the
      proportion thought to be circumcised did not correspond with
      the proportion found in the 200 men examined. <span
      class="yellow">They conclude that to find out whether
      circumcision has or has not been performed physical
      examination is mandatory</span> and also that where the
      foreskin is present its length is probably of great practical
      importance.</p>

      <p class="section">PRESENT STUDY</p>

          <p><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: This file does not

      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">An opportunity to take the matter further was
      provided by a study of social and environmental factors in
      cancer of the cervix in Aberdeen. Women in three categories
      were being interviewed, those with clinically diagnosed
      squamous cell cancer of the cervix, those with cancer not
      diagnosable clinically, but by cytology and subsequent
      histology, and matched controls for the latter, chosen from
      among those with negative smears. The interview with the
      woman being completed, a letter with stamped, addressed
      envelope was left for the husband, inviting him to assist in
      the research by contributing some information that he alone
      could give, involving a visit to the hospital out of working
      hours and a brief examination by a doctor. Rather
      surprisingly, as many as 47 per cent of the husbands came for
      interview.</p>

      <p class="text">Equal proportions in each of occupational
      class groups co-operated. Husbands of women in the clinically
      diagnosed group were the most co-operative although the total
      numbers were small because of the high proportion of widowed,
      divorced or separated women in this category. The &ldquo;
      controls &rdquo; in this study do not necessarily match the
      pre-clinical group due to self-selection, in that only
      certain individuals responded to this request to take
      part.</p>

      <p class="text">The object of the study was to
      investigate:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whether the wife's statement on her husband's
        circumcision status tallied with the doctor's opinion,</li>

        <li>to what extent the husband's statemen tallied with the
        doctor's opinion and</li>

        <li>
          regardless of surgical circumcision, did the foreskin 

          <ol type="a">
            <li>completely cover the glans,</li>

            <li>partly cover the glans, or</li>

            <li>was it completely absent?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text">Was there any difference in this respect
      between husbands of women with preclinical and clinical
      lesions on the one hand and controls on the other?</p>

      <p class="text">About 60 percent of the men were seen by one
      Registrar from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,
      about a quarter by another and the remainder by other
      Registrars as available. All recorded the same type of
      information on a standard form.</p>

      <p class="section">RESULTS</p>

      <p><i>Wife's statement on whether husband circumcised</i></p>

      <p class="text">In 5 instances the husband was present and
      answered for himself. Thirty-three wives said they did not
      know. Seventy-two stated their opinion, which proved to be
      right in 60, wrong in 6 and in 6 the doctor could not be sure
      even after the examination.</p>

      <p class="text">Where the wife was certain she knew (36
      cases) she was right in 34 and could have been right in the
      other 2 where the doctor was not sure. When she only
      <i>thought</i> she knew (36 cases) she was right in 26, wrong
      in 6 and the doctor was not sure in the other 4.</p>

      <p><i>Husband's statement on his circumcision status</i></p>

      <p class="text">There was agreement between the husband's
      statement and the doctor's findings in 85 of the 110 cases.
      In 5 there was disagreement, and in the remaining 20 either
      the man did not know or the doctor could not be sure if an
      operation had been done.</p>

      <p class="text">Table IV shows the husband's statement in
      relation to the physical findings. An ambiguous group is the
      intermediate category (b) with partial lack of foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text">In at least 17 of these 24 cases the doctor
      considered this to be a natural effect, but in another 6 he
      could not be sure. In only one was the effect attributed to
      incomplete operation. Reliance on the husband's statement
      would have relegated most of these cases to the uncircumcised
      group, but it is possible that partial circumcision affords
      partial protection against the risk of cancer, and this
      category is shown separately in the tables that follow.</p>
      <i>Husband's circumcision status, surgical or natural
      effect</i> 

      <p class="text">In 60 of the 110 cases the husbands were
      uncircumcised (a), in 24 partially circumcised (b) and in 26
      completely circumcised (c), in terms of length of foreskin.
      The small numbers show no significant difference in these
      categories between preclinical, clinical cases and
      controls.</p>

      <p class="text">Contrary to Jewish experience, it appears
      that the small group of 54 husbands of women with
      pre-clinical and clinical cancer has included 12 who were
      completely circumcised (c). The interview with the wife
      supplies some background information about this interesting
      group and Table VI compares some of the characteristics with
      those of cancer patients and controls whose husbands were
      uncircumcised or partially circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">The totals column for 4 of the first 5
      variables confirms what is already known about cervical
      cancer patients compared with the female population as a
      whole. More of them are twice married, start coitus at an
      early age, they have larger families and fewer are married to
      men in non-manual occupations. Most of these characteristics
      are independent of the circumcision status of the husband,
      but the numbers circumcised may be affected by age and
      occupational class.</p>
      <i>Age and circumcision</i> 

      <p class="text">Assuming that husbands are the same 15-year
      group as their wives there is little difference in the 3 age
      groups, 25-39, 40-54 and 55 and over in the proportion
      completely circumcised. Little is known of the circumcision
      status of the population, but a check made in 1960 among 83
      surgical ward patients, also Aberdeen city residents, showed
      a lower overall rate of circumcision, (17 per cent fully
      circumcised compared with 24 percent in the present survey).
      In the 2 surveys the proportion circumcised was not
      significantly different in the younger age groups. At age
      55-69 a higher proportion of circumcised is found in the
      present survey but numbers are small for comparison.</p>
      <i>Occupational class and circumcision</i> 

      <p class="text">Available data suggest that circumcision is
      more common in the higher socio-economic groups. Carne (1956)
      in his study of R.A.F. recruits aged 17-24 found different
      rates of circumcision according to the type of school the
      recruits had attended. Rates for the United Kingdom as a
      whole were highest for those from public schools (41&middot;9
      per cent), lower for those from grammar schools (36&middot;6
      per cent) and lowest for those from elementary schools
      (32&middot;8 per cent). He found that rates were uniformly
      lower in Scotland than in England (35&middot;4 to 20 per cent
      circumcised). Table VI (e) shows the proportion completely
      circumcised to range from 18 per cent of the non-manual to 30
      per cent of the unskilled manual group, but numbers are too
      small for this to have any particular significance.</p>
      <i>Contraceptives and Circumcision</i> 

      <p class="text">If penile cleanliness protects the cervix
      from cancer, circumcision is not the only means of obtaining
      this. Good standards of personal hygiene should prevent the
      formation of smegma equally effectively. Protection might
      also be afforded by the regular use of a contraceptive, such
      as a sheath or cap. Stern and Dixon (1961), considering the
      presence of dysplasia, <i>in situ</i> cancer and invasive
      cancer of the cervix in women attending a cancer detection
      center, studied several variables thought to be of
      significance in the aetiology of cervical cancer by methods
      of multiple regression analysis. They found both circumcision
      and contraception to be of secondary significance. Terris and
      Oalmann (1960) in an epidemiological study of patients with
      cervical cancer and controls, homogenous in regard to
      educational level, religion and husband's or father's
      occupation, found that few used contraceptives (mostly sheath
      or cap), but that the proportion doing so was significantly
      lower in patients than in controls. Boyd and Doll (1964)
      considering different methods of contraception ever used by
      patients and controls found that the use of an obstructive
      method by either husband or wife was less frequent in
      patients than in controls.</p>

      <p class="text">The present study agrees with that of Boyd
      and Doll in finding that fewer patients than controls had
      &ldquo; ever used &rdquo; or &ldquo; predominantly used
      &rdquo; a sheath or cap. Thirteen per cent of the patients
      reported the use of a sheath or cap as their predominant or
      main regular method of contraception compared with 43 per
      cent of controls (Table VI f). The difference is partly
      accounted for by the preponderance in the control group of
      non-manual workers, the main regular users of the sheath or
      cap (Table VII). However, the proportion using the sheath or
      cap as their predominant method of contraception is higher
      among controls than patients in each occupational group
      separately.</p>

      <p class="text">Looked at another way, Table VIII shows the
      total numbers in the survey regularly using or not using
      sheath or cap contraception. The proportion of patients in
      this total is shown for the 3 circumcision categories
      separately.</p>

      <p class="text">The bottom lines shows that when the husband
      was circumcised and the couple regularly used a sheath or cap
      (7 cases) there were no patients. Where the husband was
      circumcised but there was no regular use of sheath or cap (19
      cases) 12 were patients. The other two circumcision
      categories show the same trend&mdash;fewer patients where
      there is regular use of sheath or cap. Clearly numbers are
      much too small for firm conclusions to be reached, but Table
      VIII suggests that circumcision helps if a sheath or cap is
      regularly used as well. If the women's statement is correct,
      she has complete protection at all times from contact with
      smegma. Where the husband is partly circumcised or
      uncircumcised, she does not have complete protection, despite
      the regular use of sheath or cap.</p>
      <i>Interval from first coitus to first attendance at hospital
      : patients</i> 

      <p class="text">Assuming first coitus to be the stimulus
      initiating the process leading to the finding of cancer, how
      is the interval between the two events affected by
      circumcision or by the regular use of sheath or cap
      contraception) If these measures prevent the occurrence of
      cancer in some, they may also delay its onset in others.</p>

      <p class="text">Table VI (g) shows the interval from first
      coitus to first attendance at the hospital for patients with
      husbands in the 3 circumcision categories. Although the
      difference between the fully circumcised and fully
      uncircumcised groups is in the direction of a longer interval
      where the husband is fully circumcised the numbers are
      obviously too small for significance. The difference
      disappears if those regularly using a sheath or cap or added
      to the number with husband fully circumcised (that is women
      with presumed maximum protection) and compared with those not
      regularly using these methods and with husband fully
      uncircumcised (minimum protection) (Table IX)</p>
      <i>Women with pre-clinical or clinical cancer of the cervix
      whose husbands are fully circumcised</i> 

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The study has shown
      (Table V) that complete circumcision is found about as
      frequently in husbands of patients with cancer of the cervix
      as in husbands of controls.</span> As the patient group is of
      particular interest and the numbers are small, the 12 with
      fully circumcised husbands are set out individually in Table
      X.</p>

      <p class="text">It is immediately evident that in a number of
      cases these patients cannot be compared with Jewish women in
      regard to their husbands&rsquo; circumcision status. In 5
      cases the husbands were circumcised at ages between 18-33. It
      is difficult to see why age at operation should make any
      difference in regard to cancer of the cervix, providing the
      operation was done before intercourse began. This high
      proportion of circumcision in later life among husbands of
      patients may well be a chance result, but it is an
      interesting finding, for among the 14 circumcised husbands of
      controls, no case of adult circumcision was recorded.</p>

      <p class="text">Omitting these 5, there remain 7 whose
      husbands were presumably fully circumcised in infancy or
      childhood. We do not know if any of these 7 had an
      uncircumcised partner, but this is likely in one case (the
      twice-married patient) and may have been so in the case where
      pre-marital coitus was reported. Omission of these two leaves
      5 (marked with an asterisk in the table). These 5 were of
      high average parity (4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 pregnancies) which puts
      non-Jewish women in a high risk group anyway. However, in
      contradiction to Jewish experience, this study of 54 patients
      has produced a minimum of 5, in 2 of whom pre-invasive cancer
      was found 23 and 26 years after marriage, and in 3 of whom
      invasive cancer of the cervix was found 23, 28, and 32 years
      respectively after marriage to husbands completely
      circumcised, presumably in infancy.</p>

      <p class="section">CONCLUSION</p>

      <p class="text">The 54 patients in the study resemble cervix
      cancer patients in general in respect of early first coitus,
      high parity and low socio-economic group. In one
      characteristic, the circumcision status of their husbands,
      they do not follow the expected pattern. <span
      class="yellow">Twenty-two per cent of patients had husbands
      who were ascertained by physical examination to be completely
      circumcised and a similar proportion was found in controls.
      These results do not support the theory that women whose
      husbands are circumcised will be less likely to develop
      cervical cancer than those whose husbands are uncircumcised.
      In this the study agrees with the findings of Jones et al.
      (1958), Dunn and Buell (1959) and Boyd and Doll
      (1964).</span> We are well aware, however, that numbers are
      very small, extra-marital partners cannot be ruled out and in
      any case cancer of the cervix is a disease of multiple
      causality.</p>

      <p class="text">There is an indication in the 110 women
      studied that fewer cancer patients are found among those who
      have regularly used a sheath or cap as their predominant
      method of contraception. This method, like circumcision,
      would protect the cervix from contact with smegma. Unlike
      circumcision, it would protect the cervix from contact with
      spermatozoa, if epithelial penetration by spermatozoa could
      initiate the process leading to cancer, as has been mooted by
      Reid (1964). Coitus interruptus would not be equally
      protective in effect as it is not always practiced
      efficaciously, especially by those who most commonly use it.
      The negative findings on circumcision and indications in this
      and some other surveys of greater use of the sheath by
      husbands in the control than in the cancer group do nothing
      to contradict Reid's interesting speculation.</p>

      <p class="text">It would be interesting to know precisely the
      nature of the sexual hygiene practised in different
      population groups. In a circumcised population smegma is only
      minimally present, if at all, and in the female washing is
      hardly likely to be so thorough as to remove spermatozoa from
      the cervix. Previous workers have found no difference in the
      type and frequency of douching between patients with cervical
      cancer and controls. Yet the apparent absence of the
      pre-cancerous lesions as well as cancer of the cervix in a
      circumcised population who follow strict rules of sexual
      hygiene (orthodox Moslems) and the presence of such
      conditions in a circumcised population not bound by such
      rules ( &ldquo; emancipated &rdquo; Moslems) suggests that
      personal cleanliness in both parties not derived from
      circumcision alone.</p>

      <p class="text">This study has shown that an inquiry which
      includes physical examination of the genitalia can be made
      among the husbands of gynaecological patients with a high
      degree of co-operation provided that the initial request is
      made with care and tact. Greater numbers are needed for an
      adequate analysis, but as far as it goes the present study
      shows no positive association between circumcision status and
      cervical cancer. Social and environmental factors thought to
      be of significance in the aetiology of the disease will be
      considered in a later paper.</p>

      <p class="section">SUMMARY</p>

      <p class="text">The husbands of 110 women who were patients
      with pre-clinical or clinical cancer of the cervix or
      controls co-operated in a study which ascertained their
      circumcision status by physical examination. In cases where
      the examining doctor could give a definite opinion, the
      husband stated his circumcision status correctly in 84 per
      cent and in 62 per cent the wife's opinion was correct. In
      terms of length of foreskin 54 percent of the husbands were
      uncircumcised, 22 per cent partially circumcised and 24 per
      cent completely circumcised. <span class="yellow">There was
      no significant difference in these proportions between
      patients and controls.</span></p>

      Gynaecology who examined the men.</p>
