      <h2>Human Papillomavirus Types 16 and 18 in Carcinomas of the
      Penis from Brazil.</h2>

      <p><b>McCance DJ, Kalache A, Ashdown K, Andrade L, Menezes F,
      Smith P, Doll R</b></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Human papillomavirus (HPV) type-16
      DNA sequences were found in 26/53 (49%) and HPV type-18 in
      5/53 (9%) of penile cancers.</span> In only one specimen was
      HPV18 found on its own. HPV16 sequences were integrated into
      the host cell chromosomes although some monomeric and
      oligomeric free forms of DNA were detected in a few tissues.
      HPV18 was, as far as detectable, free and unintegrated in all
      tissues tested. HPV16 DNA was also detected in 40% of cases
      of carcinoma of the cervix in 19 women from the same social
      groups as the males. The viral DNA in the female cases was a
      mixture of integrated and free forms. The DNA binding protein
      (ICSP 11/12) of herpes simplex type 2 (HSV2) was not detected
      in 10 penile cancers tested with a monoclonal antibody.</p>
