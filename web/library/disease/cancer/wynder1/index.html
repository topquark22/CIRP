      class="sc1">HE RELATIVE</span> immunity of Jewish women and,
      to a lesser extent, of Moslem women to cancer of the cervix
      has been attributed to the fact that Jewish and Moslem men
      are routinely circumcised.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> One
      statistical study that presented information on the
      circumcision status of the husbands by inquiring from the
      wives and, if uncertain, also from husbands, reported a
      higher percentage of control patients exposed only to
      circumcised husbands than for the cervical cancer patients.
      However the differenc was not as large as would be expected
      if the low cancer rate amongst Jewish women is solely due to
      their contact with their circumcised husbands. Two other
      studies in which only wives were questioned revealed no
      difference in this aspect.<sup><a href="#n1">1, 3</a></sup>
      It, therefore, seems pertinente to review the manner in which
      circumcision data can be obtained and with what degree of
      reliability they may be regarded.</p>

      <p class="heading">M<span class="sc1">ETHOD</span></p>

      <p class="text">The study has been carried out in Los
      Angeles, Calif,, and in New York, N.Y. One hundred male and
      100 female clinic and ward patients, all more than 30 years
      of age, were interviewed in each locality. In Los Angeles,
      the patients were interviewed at the White memorial Hospital;
      in New York, at Memorial Hospital and Bellevue Hospital in
      Manhattan and at the Veterans Administration Hospital in
      Brooklyn. In the case of the male patients, the patient was
      first asked as to his circumcision status and then carefully
      examined by a physician.</p>

      <p class="heading">R<span class="sc1">ESULTS</span></p>

      <p class="text">Among the female patients in Los Angeles, 36%
      did not understand the term circumcision or did not know the
      circumcision status of their husbands (Table 1). Twenty-four
      per cent stated that their husbands were circumcised, and 40%
      of the patients stated that they thought their husbands were
      not circumcised. Eighteen per cent of the patients were
      Negroes. Three per cent had a college education, 15% had
      attended high school, and the remainder had attended only
      grammar school.</p>

      <p class="text">Among the female patients in New York, 38%
      did not understand the term circumcision or did not know the
      circumcision status of their husbands, 22% thought their
      husbands were circumcised, and 40% believed that their
      husbands were not circumcised. The patients included 13%
      Negroes. Six percent had a college education, 21% had
      attended high school and the remainded had attended only
      grammar school.</p>

      <p class="text">Of the men interviwed in Los Angeles, 83%
      were white, and 17% were Negroes. Eighty-five percent were
      born in the United States, 9% were born in Mexico, and the
      others were born in European countries. Twenty-three per cent
      had attended high school, 8% had attended college, and the
      remainder had attended only grammar school. Or had no
      education. Five per cent did not understand the term
      circumcision (Table 2). Sixty-six per cent of the patient
      stated that they were not circumcised and upon physical
      examination by one of us (E.L.W.) were found to be
      uncircumcised. Fourteen per cent stated that they were
      circumcised but physical examination showed them to be
      uncircumcised. Eleven per cent stated that they were
      circumcised but physical examination showed them to be
      circumcised. Nine of these 11 patient were circumcised after
      the age of 5, and all were circumcised prior to age 30. Four
      per cent of patients stated that they were not circumcised
      but examination showed them to have a short foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text">The male patients in the New York series
      included 13% Negroes. Only 61% were born in the United
      States; 11% were born in Italy, and 9% in Britain, with the
      remainder born in other European countries. Twenty-six per
      cent had gone to high school, and 9% to college; the
      remainder had attended only grammar school. Seventeen per
      cent of these patients did not understand the term
      circumcision. This is a larger percentage of unknowns than
      that found in the Los Angeles series, possibly because of the
      higher percentage of foreign born individuals in the New York
      series. Upon examination by one of us (S.L.) 66% were found
      to be uncircumcised when they so had stated. Six per cent
      were found to be uncircumcised when the patient stated that
      he was. One per cent was found to be circumcised when the
      patient declared that he was not, and 10% of the patients
      were found to be circumcised, in agreement with the patient's
      statement.</p>

      <p class="text">The following scheme may make it easier to
      compare the type of foreskin from study to study. The Los
      Angeles and New York data were quite similar in this regard
      though obtained by different observers. Fifty-two per cent of
      the Los Angeles men and 62% of the New York group not
      claiming circumcision had foreskins that nearly covered the
      glans (type A, Table 3). Twenty-three per cent of the former
      and 17% of the latter had foreskins that covered or nearly
      covered the glans (type A, Table 3). Twenty-three percent of
      the former and 17% of the latter had foreskins that covered
      at least one-half of the glans (type B). In 20% and 13%
      respectively the foreskin was at in "rest position" beyond
      the sulcus but after forward traction covered at least
      one-half of the glans without compressing it (type C). In 5%
      of the Los Angeles patients and 8% of the New York patients,
      the foreskin was beyond the sulcus and could not be extended
      over the glans without compressing it (type D). It would
      appear that these individuals had naturally short foreskins.
      About one-half of the group had foreskins that extended
      beyond the glans when pulled forward (type C) stated that
      their foreskins in earlier life had extended over the glans
      but that as they got older the foreskin retracted. In some
      instances the patients stated that they actively attempted to
      pull the foreskin back beyond the sulcus.</p>

      <p class="heading">D<span class="sc1">ISCUSSION</span></p>

      <p class="text">The review of these data indicates a sizable
      error in ascertaining the circumcision status by interviewing
      men, an error that is likely to be larger when the
      information is obtained from women. In the Los Angeles study
      36% of the women did not know the circumcision status of
      their husbands. This clinic population should have been
      similar to the population studied by Jones et al.,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> who reported only one-third as many
      unknowns. This may reflect a difference in the manner in
      which the question was asked. Our present percentage of
      unknowns is similar to the percentage of unknowns that we
      reported in a previous investigation,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> which showed that in a female clinic
      population, one-third to one-half of the patients were not
      familiar with the circumcision status of their husbands.
      There may, of course, be even additional errors in the
      answers of those women who state that they do know; this
      would seem apparent from the fact that more women state that
      there husbands are circumcised than is apparent from data
      obtained by physical examination.</p>

      <p class="text">The extent to which data obtained from women
      can lead to possible erroneous conclusions has been reviewed
      by us another report.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The inadequacy of the data based solely on
      interviews with women is further emphasized by the errors
      which appear in the answers of men as to their own
      circumcisions status. Dun and Buell have recently made
      observations similar to those found here.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> They emphasized the existence of
      naturally short foreskins and the fact that some surgical
      circumcisions are not complete. Lilienfeld and Graham have
      also reported a large error in reporting by men.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Thirty-five per cent reported they
      were circumcised, and examination showed that, in fact, 44%
      were circumcised. This percentage of circumcision seems
      rather high when compared to what we have found in New York
      and Los Angeles. In the present study 24% of 200 male
      patients were unable to correctly state their circumcision
      status.</p>

      <p class="text">What is more, it appears that even physicians
      may be unable to tell with certainty whether the patient has
      at some past date undergone a surgical excision of the
      foreskin. This was found to hold true particularly for
      patients with type B and type C foreskins. From the practical
      point of view, it may make little difference whether the
      husband has been historically considered circumcised or not.
      The important consideration is the length of the foreskin in
      terms of its smegma-collecting capacity. It is with these
      thoughts in mind that we have introduced the classification
      illustrated in Fig. 1. This classification has been tested on
      100 men in Los Angeles and 100 men in New York, 2 groups that
      were comparable by race, education, circumcision history, and
      circumcision status by conventional physical examination.
      These 2 groups were also found to be comparable by the
      classfication introduced, despite the fact that the
      observations were made by two different observers. This
      finding seems to demonstrate that this classification is a
      reproducible scheme by which different observers may obtain
      comparable results.</p>

      <center>
        <p><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: Later research has
        established that smegma is not
        carcinogenic.]</b></font></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text">It is recommended that future studies on
      cancer of the cervix employ a scheme descriptive of the
      penile prepuce such as the classification presented here. In
      individuals with type C it is important to consider the age
      at which the prepuce began to retract. If this occurred when
      the individual was past the age of 40 this type represents a
      situation of potential smegma collection identical with type
      A or type B. If however, the foreskin began retracting
      spontaneously or with manipulation by the individual before
      he was 20 years of age, the situation is similar to that of
      type D. If circumcision in fact protects against cancer of
      the cervix, patients with cancer of the cervix should have a
      higher proportion of husbands with type A and type B
      foreskins than do matched controls.</p>

      <p class="text">In summary, the present study demonstrated
      that in assessing whether circumcision or short foreskins
      tend to prevent cancer of the cervix, interviews with women
      alone are ineffective. If interviews with men are added to
      those interviews with women who do not specifically know the
      circumcision status of their husbands, the results are
      improved but still not perfect. It seems probable that
      questioning men, particularly those in the higher income
      groups and with better education, would result in more
      reliable answers. However, since cancer of the cervix occurs
      more commonly in the lower income groups, studies of these
      population groups are most pertinent. Since it has been shown
      that even upon questioning men a substantial error can be
      introduced, the most accurate way, though a difficult one, is
      to examine the husband or husbands of women with cancer of
      the cervix and control patients and to describe the type of
      foreskin in line with a scheme such as described in this
      study. Such a survey, though time consuming and difficult,
      can contribute further to our knowledge of the etiology of
      cervical cancer.</p>

      <p class="text">1. Data on circumcision in men have been
      obtained from men and women. Knowledge of circumcision status
      tends to be better among the men than among the women.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">2. Even among the men
      who were questioned as to their circumcision status, a
      sizable error is noted.</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">3. To obtain a
      definitive answer on circumcision status, a physical
      examination of the men is mandatory.</span></p>

      <p class="text">4. A scheme for recording the type of
      foreskin has been presented and is recommended as a basis for
      comparison of future studies in this field.</p>
