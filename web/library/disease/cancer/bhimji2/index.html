      <h2>Evidence sketchy on circumcision and cervical cancer
      link</h2>

      <p class="text1">Dr Christine Rivet<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> presents evidence suggesting that
      circumcision reduces risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infection in men and cervical cancer in their female
      partners.</p>

      <p class="text2">This evidence should be put in perspective.
      Other studies have found no significant correlation between
      circumcision and either HPV or cervical cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> Moreover, a large and well
      controlled American study found that circumcised men were
      likely than uncircumcised men to have had both bacterial and
      viral sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, a large and
      well controlled American study found that circumcised men
      were slightly <i>more</i> likely than uncircumcised men to
      have had both bacterial and viral sexually transmitted
      diseases.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> For chlamydia, one of
      the most common sexually transmitted diseases, the difference
      between circumcised men and uncircumcised men was quite
      large. While 26 of 1033 circumcised men had contracted
      chlamydia during their lives, none of the 353 intact men
      reported having had it.</p>

      <p class="text2">Evidence linking the foreskin to sexually
      transmitted infections and cervical cancer is contradictory.
      But even if the evidence were conclusive, it would still not
      constitute a justification for circumcising baby boys.
      Because infants are not sexually active, they should not be
      required to bear the burden of preventing sexually
      transmitted infections. Sexually transmitted diseases will be
      prevented by practising safer sex, not by circumcising
      infants. If circumcision is touted as a prophylactic, it
      could confer a false sense of security and encourage
      high-risk sexual behaviour.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some physicians believe that infant male
      circumcision should be a matter of parental choice, even
      though the procedure is not medically indicated. However,
      operating on an incapable patient who has no medical need for
      surgery is normally viewed as a violation of medical ethics.
      As the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan
      noted last year in a memo to its members, performing surgery
      of questionable value on an infant is generally considered
      &ldquo;imprudent if not improper.&rdquo;</p>
