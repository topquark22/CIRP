      <h2>Dispelling Miscommunications</h2>

      <p>ACS NewsToday -- Statements about circumcision preventing
      penile cancer and cervical cancer are cropping up on the
      Internet. A two-year-old <a
      href="/library/statements/letters/1996-02_ACS/">letter</a>
      being circulated on the Net discussing scientific evidence
      regarding penile cancer and its relationship to circumcision
      is personal correspondence reflecting the observations of two
      former ACS physician staff members. The American Cancer
      Society does not have a formal guideline statement on
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Penile cancer is extremely rare in the United States and
      accounts for less than one half a percent of cancers
      diagnosed among men and less than one tenth of a percent of
      cancer deaths among men.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is the removal of a part or all of the male
      foreskin either at birth or later on. This practice has been
      suggested as giving some protection against cancer of the
      penis by contributing to improved hygiene.</p>

      <p>However, the penile cancer risk is low in some
      uncircumcised populations, and the practice of circumcision
      is strongly associated with socio-ethnic factors, which in
      turn are associated with lessened risk. The consensus among
      studies that have taken these other factors into account is
      circumcision is not of value in preventing cancer of the
      penis.</p>

      <p>Proven penile cancer risk factors include having
      unprotected sexual relations with multiple partners
      (increasing the likelihood of human papillomavirus
      infection), and cigarette smoking.</p>
