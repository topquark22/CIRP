      <h2>History of Circumcision, Medical Conditions, and<br />
       Sexual Activity and Risk of Penile Cancer</h2>

      Cancer Research Center</a>, Seattle, Wash.</p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Epidemiological evidence suggests lack
      of neonatal circumcision as the strongest risk factor for
      penile cancer, but the role of sexually transmitted diseases
      in the etiology of penile cancer has remained unclear.</p>

      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> To further clarify risk factors for penile
      cancer, we examined the role of circumcision, personal
      characteristics and habits (such as smoking), sexually
      transmitted diseases, past sexual activity, and medical
      conditions of the penis.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> A population-based, case-control study was
      conducted in western Washington state and in the province of
      British Columbia. We interviewed 110 men with penile cancer
      diagnosed from January 1979 to July 1990 and 355 control
      subjects from the general population, frequency matched to
      case subjects on age and date of diagnosis. Tumor tissue from
      67 case subjects was tested for human papillomavirus (HPV)
      DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Results of blood tests from
      69 case subjects and 208 control subjects were available for
      study.</p>

      <p><b>STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS:</b> Relative to men
      circumcised at birth, the risk for penile cancer was 3.2
      times greater among men who were never circumcised and 3.0
      times greater among men who were circumcised after the
      neonatal period. For current smokers, the risk was 2.8 times
      that of men who never smoked. The risk among men reporting a
      history of genital warts was 5.9 times that of men reporting
      no such history. Of 67 tumors tested for HPV DNA, 49% were
      positive; the majority of these positive tumors (70%) were
      type 16, which has been associated with anogenital carcinoma.
      Relative risks (RRs) associated with a reported history of
      penile rash or penile tear were 9.4 and 3.9, respectively.
      Among men not circumcised at birth, RRs associated with
      presence of smegma and difficulty in retracting the foreskin
      were 2.1 and 3.5, respectively. Twenty-eight percent of case
      subjects, compared with only 10% of control subjects,
      reported 30 or more sexual partners, and men with
      HPV-positive tumors were more likely to report a greater
      number of sexual partners.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> These results suggest that the absence
      of neonatal circumcision and potential resulting
      complications are associated with penile cancer.
      Additionally, medical conditions of the penis, sexual
      activity, infection with HPV, and smoking may increase the
      risk for penile cancer.</p>

      <p><b>IMPLICATIONS:</b> A larger study would allow
      examination of interrelationships of circumcision, infection
      with HPV, and smoking as risk factors.</p>

      for age, there is no statistically significant effect of
      circumcision on the rate of penile cancer. See <a
