      <p>Early age at first intercourse, increased number of sexual
      partners, lack of circumcision and history of sexually
      transmitted diseases (STDs) are associated with prostate
      cancer. There has been no investigation of the effect of
      these factors on prostate health at an early age. Previously
      collected serum samples from STD clinic attendees were tested
      retrospectively for anti-chlamydial antibodies, and prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) concentration. Patients at an STD
      clinic were interviewed regarding age of first intercourse,
      number of sexual partners and circumcision status. This was
      compared to clinical diagnosis, anti-chlamydial antibody
      titre and PSA concentration. The results showed:</p>

      <p>(1) that of patients with an anti-chlamydial antibody
      titre equal or greater than 1 in 64 (n=27) 37% had a PSA
      concentration greater than 0.8 ng/ml while those with a titre
      less than 1/64 (n=201) only 17% had a PSA &gt;0.8
      (P&lt;0.05).</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">(2) No association was found with
      circumcision status.</span></p>

      <p>(3) Early age of first intercourse and more than 20 sexual
      partners were associated with a synergistic increase in mean
      anti-chlamydial antibody titre and a mean PSA concentration
      of 1.2 ng/ml (95% CI 0.56-1.76).</p>

      <p>It is concluded that these results provide the first
      evidence that sexual behaviour related risk factors for
      prostate cancer do damage the prostate at an early age.
      Though they do not prove that infection is a cause of
      prostate cancer they do justify further research into the
      specificity of agents involved and impact of antibiotic
      treatment.<br />
