      <hr color="black" size="1" />

      <p class="text1">Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common
      gynecologic malignant tumors worldwide and a leading cause of
      death from genital malignancies in women. One of the most
      important epidemiologic observations concerning this neoplasm
      is that the disease is practically non-existent in celibate
      populations. This was first noticed in the 19th century by
      Rigonni-Stern [<a href="#n1">1</a>] of Verona, Italy,
      regarding Catholic nuns, who are sexually inactive. Gagnon of
      Quebec [<a href="#n2">2</a>] subsequently confirmed this
      observation. He served as a gynecologist in a few Quebec
      nunneries for several years, and it occurred to him that he
      had never seen a case of cancer of the cervix in a nun. Among
      13,000 deaths of nuns, 12 were recorded as due to corpus
      cancer. If the same ratio of cervix to corpus cancer exists
      among nuns as among the general population, there should have
      been 5 to 8 times as many cervical cancers. Instead there was
      none. These observations and the subsequent identification of
      risk factors led to the conclusion that cervical cancer is
      associated with coitus, and that it shares many
      characteristics with communicable diseases which follow a
      venereal mode of transmission. These findings led eventually
      to the identification towards the end of the 20th century of
      the human papillomavirus and its major etiologic role in this
      neoplasm [<a href="#n3">3&ndash;5</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">A potentially similarly important
      observation was published by Braithwaite [<a
      href="#n6">6</a>] in <i>The Lancet</i> in 1901. Referring to
      the experience with cancer of the cervix at the Leeds General
      Infirmary and at the London Hospital, he stated that it ``was
      seldom or never met with amongst the numerous Jewesses''
      attending these institutions. Although the low incidence
      among Jewish women has been repeatedly confirmed since then,
      the reason for it has intrigued and eluded many
      investigators.</p>

      <p class="text2">The purpose of the present review is to
      survey investigations concerning cervical cancer in Jewish
      women, with special emphasis on attempts made to elucidate
      the reason for the infrequency of this neoplasm among this
      population, including the most recent genetic study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Since the report by Braithwaite [<a
      href="#n6">6</a>], numerous publications have verified his
      observation. Hochman et al. [<a href="#n7">7</a>] cite 14
      individual studies published from 1902 to 1947, all
      indicating the low frequency of cervical carcinoma in Jewish
      women. Kennaway, in 1948 [<a href="#n8">8</a>], published an
      extensive summary including reports from various cities in
      the United States and many countries in Europe, all pointing
      to the infrequency of cervical carcinoma in Jewish women.
      Many additional reports on the low occurrence of cancer of
      the cervix in Jewish women were published in the U.S. in the
      1950s and 1960s [<a href="#n9">9,10</a>]. The ratio between
      Jewish and non-Jewish patients with cancer of the cervix was
      variously calculated at between 1/9 and 1/5.</p>

      <p class="text2">After the State of Israel was established in
      1948, even more studies were published indicating the low
      occurrence of cervical cancer in Israeli Jewish women [<a
      href="#n7">7,11</a>]. Hochman et al. [<a href="#n7">7</a>]
      reviewed all the cervical carcinoma cases registered between
      1933 and 1951 at the Hadassah University Hospital in
      Jerusalem. Since radical operations were not performed in the
      country at that time, and this was the only hospital that
      could administer radium therapy, they assumed that the 125
      cases they located (only 67 of which were histologically
      confirmed) represent all the cases diagnosed in Jewish women.
      They were the first to consider ethnic differences within the
      Israeli Jewish population. Their study compared three ethnic
      groups: the Mizrahi (Oriental) &ndash; i.e., descendants of
      those born in Iraq, Syria, Persia, Yemen and North Africa;
      the Sephardic (Spanish) &ndash; descendants of those born in
      Spain, Portugal and some Mediterranean countries; and the
      Ashkenazi &ndash; descendants of those born in Eastern
      Europe. But they found no incidence difference between the
      Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi groups. Stewart et al. [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>], in the early 1950s, conducted an
      extensive interview and incidence study of cervical cancer,
      comparing Israeli Jewish women with Jewish and non-Jewish
      white women in New York City. In Israel, the interviewers
      were located in three medical centers in the major cities and
      were notified of new patients by staff members of hospitals
      in and around these cities. In addition, cases were located
      from records of hospital discharges and death certificates.
      The Central Bureau of Statistics provided an estimate of the
      female population of Israel, classified by age and country of
      birth. The incidence rates of cervical cancer in Israeli
      Jewish women and Jewish women in New York City were virtually
      identical (4.8 and 4.1 respectively), and strikingly lower
      than the rate in non-Jewish white women (15.0). Similar to
      the findings of Hochman's study [<a href="#n7">7</a>], the
      rates in the Ashkenazi and Sephardi-Oriental subgroups were
      also virtually identical (4.7 and 4.9 respectively). In 1960
      the Israel Cancer Registry was established. This registry is
      notified by law of all new cancer patients and obtains its
      information from three sources: hospital records, pathologic
      reports, and death certificates. Steinitz and Costin [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>] published the first population-based
      incidence rates of cervical cancer, again showing that they
      are markedly low in Israeli Jewish women. Between 1960 and
      1967, only about 60 new cases were diagnosed annually
      throughout Israel, and the incidence rate was about 5.8.
      Subsequently, when differences between ethnic groups were
      analyzed by continent of birth and not by allocation to
      Ashkenazi and Sephardi-Oriental subgroups, appreciable
      differences were noted. Modan et al. [<a href="#n14">14</a>],
      and later Sharon et al. [<a href="#n15">15</a>], reported
      that the incidence of cervical carcinoma among Jewish women
      born in North Africa was considerably higher than in those
      born in the other continents, mainly due to the high
      incidence in women born in Morocco. This observation was
      subsequently confirmed by Menczer and colleagues [<a
      href="#n16">16</a>]. Their study included all cases of
      cervical cancer diagnosed in Israel during the 11 year period
      1961&ndash;71. They found that the mean age-adjusted
      incidence rate in North African-born Jewish women was
      statistically significantly higher than in women born in
      Europe, Asia and Israel (8.3 vs. 3.6, 2.8, 2.5 respectively;
      P &lt; 0.01). The lowest rates (1.54) were observed in Jewish
      women born in Yemen [<a href="#n17">17</a>]. It seems,
      therefore, that there are not only marked differences in
      incidence between Jewish and non-Jewish women, but also
      considerable differences between various Jewish ethnic
      groups. The reason for these inter-ethnic differences has not
      yet been clarified. Many attempts have been made to identify
      the cause of the remarkable infrequency of carcinoma of the
      cervix among Jewish women. This quest is of great general
      importance, since an explanation for this phenomenon might
      contribute to a better understanding of the process of
      carcinogenesis and possibly assist in the prevention of the
      neoplasm. The low occurrence of cervical cancer in Jewish
      women has been variously attributed to traditional habits, to
      different risk factors, or to genetic factors that provide
      some degree of resistance or immunity.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="b">Traditional
      habits</span><br />
       Jews around the world practice two distinct traditional
      habits: the ritual circumcision of males 8 days after birth,
      and the prohibition by the family purity laws (<span
      class="d"><i>Niddah</i></span>) against sexual intercourse
      both during menses and 7 days after its complete
      cessation.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="c">Circumcision</span><br />
       The low incidence of cervical cancer in Jewish women has
      been ascribed to maximal circumcision of Jewish male infants
      [<a href="#n18">18</a>]. However, others subsequently
      concluded that non-circumcision does not increase the risk of
      cervical cancer [<a href="#n19">19</a>]. It is beyond the
      scope of the present survey to review the innumerable studies
      dealing with the association between circumcision and
      cervical cancer. Many of the studies were performed in
      non-Jewish women, or compared non-circumcised Christian
      populations with circumcised Moslem populations, or
      non-circumcised Hindu populations with Moslem populations.
      The findings of these epidemiologic studies are often
      conflicting. The reason for the inconsistent results is that
      attempts to assess the association between the circumcision
      status of the male partner and cervical cancer encountered
      several difficulties [<a href="#n20">20</a>]. Many
      confounding factors were not accounted for, and when multiple
      partners were involved the issue became even more
      complicated. Many women did not know the circumcision status
      of their sexual partner. In addition, there may have been
      discrepancies between men's reports of their circumcision
      status and the results of examinations. Finally, the degree
      of circumcision was not uniform. It has therefore been
      suggested that circumcision studies should be based on actual
      examination of the male partners. Such a study was conducted
      by Terris et al. [<a href="#n20">20</a>], who found no
      significant differences in the circumcision status of the
      first marital partners of women with invasive and
      pre-invasive cervical lesions and controls matched by age and
      ethnic group. The circumcision status of the partners of the
      few Jewish women included in the study was not specified.
      Another example of a study negating the association was
      performed in Lebanon [<a href="#n21">21</a>]. This
      population- based study found that notwithstanding the
      circumcision status of men, cervical carcinoma was as
      frequent in Moslems as in Christians. There was also no
      difference between cases and controls in circumcision status
      of the husband as determined by physical examination. The
      data by Stewart et al. [<a href="#n12">12</a>] also yielded
      no support for a relationship between lack of circumcision
      and cancer of the cervix in non-Jewish white women. They
      found that among Jewish women in Israel, only 1 of the 48
      with cancer of the cervix stated that she had had intercourse
      with an uncircumcised male. Of the Jewish women in New York
      City, 7 of 46 cases (15.2%) and 1.7% of controls gave a
      history of intercourse with one or more uncircumcised
      partners. This difference was significant (P &lt; 0.01).
      However, the higher rate of intercourse with uncircumcised
      males in the cases may be a reflection of the liberal sexual
      habits in this group and not of the circumcision status of
      their partners. It should also be mentioned that the
      incidence of cervical cancer among Israeli Jewish female
      immigrants from the former Soviet Union, some of whom are
      married to uncircumcised men, is not different to that in the
      general population [<a href="#n22">22</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Although the dispute
      over the association of circumcision and cervical cancer in
      various populations is still ongoing [<a
      href="#n23">23,24</a>], there seems to be no hard evidence
      that circumcision prevents its occurrence in Jewish women,
      and it is no longer considered to play a protective
      role.</span></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="c">Abstinence from
      intercourse</span><br />
       Among orthodox Jewish women who observe the laws of <span
      class="d"><i>Niddah</i></span>, cervical cancer is even less
      common than in the rest of Israeli Jewish women. This
      observation seems to support the notion that abstinence from
      intercourse during and for several days after menses is a
      protective factor. However, it is extremely difficult to
      isolate this ritual from other risk factors that are absent
      in the orthodox group, such as early coitarche, multiple
      partners, and smoking. A similar low occurrence has been
      found in other communities with strict sexual conduct that
      practice endogamy &ndash; i.e., marrying within their faith
      [<a href="#n25">25</a>], but do not practice circumcision.
      The data by Stewart and co-workers [<a href="#n12">12</a>]
      also failed to show any significant association between
      cancer of the cervix and abstinence from intercourse during
      or after menses in Israeli Jewish women and Jewish women in
      New York City, as well as in non-Jewish white women. It
      should also be mentioned that the great majority of Israeli
      Jewish women no longer practice the laws of <span
      class="d"><i>Niddah</i></span>, yet the incidence of cervical
      cancer among them remains persistently low.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="b">Risk factors</span><br />
       <span class="c">General risk factors</span><br />
       No difference between Jewish and non-Jewish women has been
      found with regard to general risk factors for cervical
      carcinoma. Comprehensive epidemiologic studies by Martin in
      the U.S. [<a href="#n25">25</a>] and by Pridan and Lilienfeld
      in Israel [<a href="#n26">26</a>] indicated that like other
      populations, cervical cancer in Jewish women is associated
      with younger age at first coitus and first marriage, a higher
      number of sexual partners, and lower socioeconomic
      status.</p>

      <p class="text1">Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection<br />
       For almost a decade the sexually transmitted HSV-2 was
      implicated in the etiology of cervical carcinoma and has been
      the subject of detailed investigations [<a
      href="#n27">27,28</a>]. The association between HSV-2 and
      cervical cancer was also assessed in Israeli Jewish women.
      Menczer et al. [<a href="#n29">29</a>] examined HSV-2 titers
      in sera from 39 Jewish women with cervical cancer, in sera
      from controls hospitalized for benign gynecologic diseases,
      matched by age and country of origin, and in sera from the
      general population of healthy female subjects. The HSV-2
      titers were significantly higher in patients than in
      controls, and in the range of reported rates in cervical
      carcinoma patients in other populations. On the other hand,
      the HSV-2 titers in the general female population were low
      compared to many other demographic areas. The authors
      suggested that the low incidence of cervical cancer among
      Jewish women may be related to the low reservoir of the HSV-2
      virus in the general population. These findings contradicted
      another study in Israeli Jewish women in which the percentage
      of HSV-2-positive controls resembled that in the cervical
      cancer cases [<a href="#n26">26</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">It is now generally accepted that HSV-2
      plays no major role in the etiology of cervical cancer,
      except perhaps as a co-factor in a limited number of patients
      [<a href="#n30">30</a>], or as an initiating agent [<a
      href="#n31">31</a>]. The low reservoir of HSV-2 therefore
      does not explain the infrequency of cervical cancer in Jewish
      women.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="c">Human papillomavirus
      infection</span><br />
       Currently, it is widely accepted that degradation of the
      <i>p</i>53 suppressor gene by oncogenic HPV E6 early protein
      plays a crucial role in the etiology of cervical cancer
      [3&ndash;5]. Oncogenic HPV was found in about 90% of cervical
      carcinoma tissue samples in many demographic areas [<a
      href="#n31">31</a>]. Previously, using the Southern blot
      hybridization technique, a low (36%) prevalence rate among 22
      Israeli cervical carcinoma patients had been reported [<a
      href="#n32">32</a>]. However, another recent study, using a
      sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique, found that, as
      in other populations, the prevalence of HPV in cervical
      cancer cases is very high [<a href="#n33">33</a>]. In the
      general Israeli population the prevalence of HPV, as assessed
      by filter <i>in situ</i> hybridization of cervical smears,
      was found to be low [<a href="#n34">34</a>]. Whether this
      affects the frequency of cervical cancer in Israeli Jewish
      women is not clear.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="b">Genetic factors</span><br />
       Hochman et al. [<a href="#n7">7</a>] contend that the equal
      incidence of cervical cancer in the Ashkenazi and
      non-Ashkenazi ethnic groups is clear evidence that the low
      cervical cancer incidence in Jewish women is not a genetic or
      racial phenomenon. On the other hand, Stewart et al. [<a
      href="#n12">12</a>] proposed that the similar incidence rate
      in the various groups of Jewish women studied in New York and
      Israel support the assumption that the disease is infrequent
      because of a genetically determined lack of
      susceptibility.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="c"><i>p</i>53
      polymorphism</span><br />
       In 1998, Storey and associates [<a href="#n35">35</a>]
      reported that the presence of homozygous arginine
      polymorphism at codon 72 of <i>p</i>53 represents a
      significant risk factor in the development of HPV-associated
      cervical carcinoma. If this observation is valid, then a low
      prevalence of this polymorphism in Jewish women might
      constitute the genetic basis for the low incidence among
      them. Thus, it was of tremendous interest to assess the
      prevalence of the homozygous arginine polymorphism in healthy
      Israel Jewish women, and the association between the presence
      of this polymorphism and cervical cancer in Jewish women. We
      recently performed such an investigation [<a
      href="#n36">36</a>]. Our study group included 23 Israeli
      Jewish patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell
      carcinoma of the cervix. The control group comprised 162
      randomly chosen Israeli Jewish healthy women, considered to
      represent the general population. The germline <i>p</i>53
      polymorphism at codon 72 was determined by PCR in DNA
      obtained from a blood sample taken from each subject. In this
      study, Arbel-Alon et al. [<a href="#n36">36</a>] showed that
      among healthy Israeli Jewish women, the prevalence of the
      arginine homozygous <i>p</i>53 polymorphism paralleled the
      pattern of cervical carcinoma in the Israeli population.
      While lower than in other populations, it was significantly
      higher in women of North Africa origin than in the other
      ethnic groups (30.3 vs. 10.8%, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the
      association between the homozygous arginine polymorphism and
      cervical cancer, as reported by Sorey et al. [<a
      href="#n35">35</a>], was also found in Israeli Jewish
      women.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">These findings support
      the possibility that the low prevalence of the homozygous
      arginine polymorphism may play a role in determining the low
      incidence of cervical cancer in Jewish women and may also
      explain the differences between the ethnic groups. If these
      observations are confirmed, then the low incidence of
      cervical cancer in Jewish women is genetically determined,
      and an explanation for the ethnic incidence pattern of
      cervical cancer in Jewish women has also finally been
      found.</span></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="b">Conclusions</span><br />
       For many years it was predicted, on the basis of
      observations in selected cohorts or individual institutions,
      that the incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma in Israeli
      Jewish women will increase [<a href="#n37">37-39</a>]. While
      ritual circumcision is still practiced widely, today only a
      minority of Jewish women observes the laws of <span
      class="d"><i>Niddah</i></span>. Sexual habits have also
      changed considerably, becoming far less stringent. In spite
      of these trends of the last four to five decades, the
      population-based incidence of cervical cancer in Israeli
      Jewish women has not increased and remains very low [<a
      href="#n22">22,40</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Braithwaite [<a href="#n6">6</a>], who first
      noted the low incidence in Jewish women in 1901, suggested
      two explanations for this ``immunity.'' The first was the
      difference of race, and the second the difference in diet,
      namely the ``absence of bacon and ham in the diet of Jews.''
      He then added: ``The latter is far more probable than the
      former, although there may be something in race.'' Now, a
      century after Braithwaite's original observation, it seems
      that there may indeed be something in ``race.''</p>
