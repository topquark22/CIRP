      <p>[Abstract]</p>

      <p>Although genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is
      well established as the etiologic agent for cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), little is known about the
      cofactors involved in the development of high-grade lesions
      or the progression of low-grade to high-grade lesions. In our
      study of HPV-infected women with CIN (163 CIN I, 51 CIN II
      and 44 CIN III), women with CIN II or III were compared with
      those with CIN I for risk factors associated with high-grade
      lesions. After controlling for age, education, ethnicity and
      frequency of Pap smear screening, infection with HPV 16, but
      not high viral load or infection with multiple types, was
      associated with high-grade lesions (OR for CIN II = 11.96, OR
      for CIN III = 23.74). Risk of CIN III, but not CIN II,
      increased with number of cigarettes smoked per day (ORs =
      1.49 and 3.35 for &lt; or = 10 and &gt; 10 cigarettes per
      day, respectively) and decreased with frequency of condom use
      during sex (ORs = 0.60 and 0.32 for women who used condoms
      occasionally/sometimes and most/all of the time,
      respectively). There were no associations between high-grade
      lesions and plasma levels of micronutrients (retinol,
      beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol and reduced ascorbic
      acid).</p>

      <p>Our results indicate that infection with HPV 16 is
      associated with high-grade lesions. Additional cofactors,
      such as cigarette smoking, may be required as a carcinogen to
      advance HPV-infected cells toward neoplastic progression.</p>
