      <p><b>Objective:</b> To study the role of tobacco in squamous
      cell carcinoma of the penis.</p>

      <p><b>Subjects and methods</b> The use of tobacco in the form

      chewing tobacco (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and the use of snuff
      (<i>P</i> = 0.004) in patients with penile carcinoma as
      compared with controls. A dose-response relationship was
      observed for both smoking and chewing.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b> The use of tobacco is a significant
      risk factor for penile carcinoma, and the use of more than

      <p><font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

      <p class="text">Penile cancer has a world-wide distribution,
      with a low incidence among Muslims and infrequent occurrence
      among Jews due to religious circumcision. It incidence varies
      in different parts of the world and is reported to be 0.5 to
      1.5 per 100 000 population in the western world [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. In Southern India, the average annual rate
      is 2.9 per 100 000 population (Madras Metropolitan Tumour
      Registry, Cancer Institute. Madras, India).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phimosis
      has been shown to be a significant factor in the aetiology of
      penile cancer [<a href="#n2">2</a>]. Sexually transmitted
      diseases have been proposed as aetiological factors, but with
      no definite proof [<a href="#n3">3</a>]. Tobacco has been
      shown to affect many organ systems in the body. Although only
      the upper aerodigestive and respiratory tracts come in direct
      contact with carcinogens, smoking has also been shown to
      increase the risk of distant tumours such as cancer of the
      uterine cervix [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. There are a few reports
      relating smoking to genito-urinary and penile cancers [<a
      href="#n1">1,5-7</a>]. In India, apart from smoking, tobacco
      is used on other forms such as chewing tobacco and snuff.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim
      of the present study was to determine the role of tobacco in
      the causation of penile carcinoma.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Subjects and methods</b></font></p>

      <p class="text">A total of 505 patients with squamous cell
      carcinoma of the penis, who were registered at the Cancer
      Institute (WIA), Madras, between 1960 and 1990, and 600
      controls selected at random from amongst the partners of
      patients with breast cancer, were included in the study. Data
      collected included subject age, presence or absence of
      phimosis, and the use of tobacco in the form of cigarettes,
      chewing tobacco or snuff. The number of cigarettes smoked and
      length of smoking were noted, as were the use of areca nut,
      tobacco or both and the duration of use. Each patient was
      age-matched with a control. The matching was done on a
      computer using only the patient index number and age. Any
      unmatched patients and controls were excluded from the study.
      The final data were analysed for 503 patients and 503
      age-matched controls.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial
      signifance tests were carried out for each factor separately
      and then a multivariate analysis was performed with the
      Conditional Logistic Regression Model for matched data.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Results</b></font></p>

      <p class="text">The results of the study are given in Table
      1.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phimosis
      was an important risk factor for penile carcinoma, with 30.6%
      of patients having phimosis as against 5.2% of controls (odds
      ratio [OR] 7.4 [<i>P</i>&lt;0.001]).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">Tobacco in the form of cigarettes was a risk
      factor for penile carcinoma</span> (OR=1.44, <i>P</i>=0.005).
      No significant association was observed in those who smoked
      &lt;10 cigarettes per day or those who had smoked for &lt;5
      years, whereas a significant amount of risk was seen for
      those who smoked &gt;10 cigarettes a day and those who had
      smoked for &gt;5 years. A significant association was noted
      with a lifetime exposure to &gt;30 pack years.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chewing
      tobacco was a significant risk factor for penile carcinoma,
      with 34.0% of patients in the habit of chewing tobacco as
      against 15.5% of controls (OR = 3.114, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). A
      total of 159 of 171 patients (93.0) chewed both areca nut and
      tobacco. Therefore it was not possible to adjust for
      confounding of one of the factors.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the
      patients, 5.4% took snuff as against 1.6% of controls. (OR =
      3.396, <i>P</i> = 0.003).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      effect of tobacco was analysed by considering smoking and
      chewing. A total of 59.4% of patients either smoked or chewed
      tobacco and 12.3% of patients used both. Either habit was a
      risk factor (OR = 2.298, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and a
      combination of both habits carried a higher risk (OR = 3.396,
      <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      multivariate analysis was carried out by the Conditional
      Logistic Regression Model to adjust for the confounding
      effects of each of the factors analysed. The results are
      shown in Table 2. All factors were found to be
      significant.</p>

        <img src="table2.gif" alt="Table 2." />

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
      effects of areca nut and tobacco could not be differentiated,
      a similar analysis was carried out as in Table 2 but with
      tobacco chewing as a factor instead of chewing. Tobacco
      chewing was found to have a significant association with
      penile carcinoma (Table 3).</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

      <p class="text">In this study, the association between the
      three commonly used forms of tobacco (cigarettes, chewing
      tobacco and snuff) and squamous cell carcinoma of the penis
      has been analysed. Earlier studies have reported that smoking
      is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis [<a
      href="#n1">1,5-7</a>], but the overall impact of tobacco on
      penile cancers has thus far not been analysed in detail.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
      forms of use of tobacco were found to be significant risk
      factors for penile carcinoma, even after adjusting for their
      confounding. A clear dose-relationship response for smoking
      and chewing was observed, although it was not possible to
      differentiate between the effect of areca nut and tobacco. In
      view of tobacco being a proven carcinogen, and also because
      similar results were obtained in the multivariate analysis
      when tobacco chewing was analysed as a factor instead of
      chewing, we believe that tobacco was the important agent and
      areca nut may at best be a potentiating agent. Data on the
      frequency of chewing and duration of retention of quid in the
      oral cavity were not available for analysis. The effect of
      all three forms of tobacco used together could not be studied
      as only three patients used all three forms of tobacco. Use
      of more than one form of tobacco carried a higher risk, as
      evidenced by an OR of 2.298 for patients with one habit and
      an OR of 3.396 for patients who both smoked and chewed
      tobacco.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has
      been hypothesized that tumours of the anogenital region, such
      as those of the utererine cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, and
      penis, have common and similar aetiological factors [<a
      href="#n8">8</a>]. Smoking has been shown to increase the
      risk of cancers of the uterine cervix, urinary bladder and
      penis. Chemical analysis of smokeless tobacco indicates that
      three types of known carcinogens -- N-nitrosamine, polycylic
      aromatic hydrocarbons and Polonium-210 -- are present. The
      nitrosamines are metabolized in vivo to products shown to
      produce genetic changes in cells and also to produce tumours
      [<a href="#n9">9</a>]. A higher availability of
      tobacco-specific nitrosamine to a snuff dipper has been
      suggested [<a href="#n10">10,11</a>]. A role for nicotine as
      an inhibitor of apoptosis and subsequent tumor promotion has
      been proposed [<a href="#n12">12</a>]. It has been claimed
      that cigarette smoke exposure may increase the extent of DNA
      damage per mutagenic event in bladder cancer [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>]. A similar event may apply to other
      cancers as well. <span class="yellow">A tobacco-specific
      nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamiol-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
      (NNK) was found in the urine of smokers</span> [<a
      href="#n14">14</a>]. NNK metabolism takes place in a few
      tissues and is eventually excreted largely in the urine and
      to a smaller extent in saliva, faeces and secretions from
      preputial glands [<a href="#n15">15</a>]. <span
      class="yellow">Accumulation of carcinogens in smegma may be
      an important factor.</span> Another support for a remote mode
      of action of smoking is its role as in immunosuppressant by
      reducing the number of Langerhans' in a linear fashion.
      Langerhans' cells are dendritic epithelial cells which play
      an important role in immune surveillance and in the response
      to neoplastic transformation [<a href="#n16">16</a>].</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      class="yellow">In summary, the use of tobacco in any form is
      a risk factor for penile carcinoma. Tobacco may exert its
      action through its metabolites, or directly after systemic
      absorption. Use of more than one form of tobacco multiplies
      the risk of development of penile carcinoma.</span></p>
