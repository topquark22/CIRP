      <h2>Geographical pathology of cancer of the uterine
      cervix.</h2>

      <p><b>Persaud V.</b></p>

      <p>The availability of age-standardized cancer incidences for
      different parts of the world has enabled a thorough and
      meaningful analysis of the geographical distribution of
      cancer of the uterine cervix. The high morbidity and
      mortality from cervical cancer reported for most European
      countries and North America at the beginning of this century
      has, in recent years, been superseded by those for Asian,
      African, Latin American and Caribbean countries with the
      provision of additional data. Striking differences in
      cervical cancer incidences have been observed among various
      ethnic groups in Africa which seem to reflect variations in
      the intensity of certain environmental influences. Cervix
      cancer is uncommon in the white population of North America
      and Europe with the exception of West Germany, Denmark,
      Sweden and Yugoslavia. In the United States, the highest
      incidence occurs in Puerto Rican women of New York City and
      the Latin population of the South. The very low incidence in
      Jewish women is virtually the same in New York City as in
      Israel. <span class="yellow">This world-wide survey has shown
      that poor sexual hygiene rather than lack of male
      circumcision per se is a more important aetiological factor
      in cervical cancer.</span></p>
