      <h2>High prevalence of papillomavirus-associated penile<br />
       intraepithelial neoplasia in sexual partners of women<br />
       with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.</h2>

      <h4>Barrasso R, De Brux J, Croissant O, Orth G</h4>

      <p>To determine whether neoplastic cervical lesions in women
      are associated with papillomavirus infections in their sexual
      partners, we used a colposcope to examine male sexual
      partners of women with cervical flat condyloma (294 cases) or
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (186 cases), before and
      after 5 percent acetic acid was applied to the penis and the
      anogenital area. Condylomata acuminata, papules, and macules
      were observed in 309 of the 480 men (64.4 percent). In 204 of
      them (42.5 percent), macules or slightly elevated papules
      were detected only after application of acetic acid.
      Condylomata acuminata or lesions showing histologic features
      of condyloma were found in 121 partners (41.2 percent) of
      women with condyloma, but in only 10 partners (5.4 percent)
      of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Penile
      lesions showing histologic features of intraepithelial
      neoplasia were found in 61 partners (32.8 percent) of women
      with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but in only 4
      partners (1.4 percent) of women with flat condyloma. <span
      class="yellow">Thirty-six (60 percent) of the 60 macules or
      papules tested contained papillomavirus DNA sequences. Human
      papillomavirus types 16 and 33 were almost exclusively found
      in penile intraepithelial neoplasia.</span> Type 6, type 11,
      and the recently recognized type 42 were found in lesions
      showing features of condyloma or minimal histologic changes.
      As yet uncharacterized papillomaviruses were found in 15
      percent of the specimens. These data support the concept that
      cervical carcinomas and precancerous lesions in women may be
      associated with genital papillomavirus infection in their
      male sexual partners.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This data equally supports the
      concept that penile carcinoma and precancerous lesions in men
      may be associated with genital papillomavirus infection in
      their female partners.]</p>
