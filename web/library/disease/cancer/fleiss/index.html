      <b>NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST CANCER</b> 

      <p>E<span>DITOR</span>,&mdash;Although <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/frisch/">Morten Frisch and
      colleagues have made a valuable contribution to the study of
      penile cancer</a>, they mistakenly repeat the myth that
      neonatal circumcision renders the subject immune to penile
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The reference given for
      this statement is not an epidemiological study but an opinion
      article by the American circumcisionist Abraham L. Wolbarst
      in 1932.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Wolbarst invented this
      myth and was directly responsible for its proliferation; he
      based it on unverifiable anecdotes, ethnocentric stereotypes,
      a faulty understanding of human anatomy and physiology, a
      misunderstanding of the distinction between association and
      cause, and a unbridled missionary zeal. It was not based on
      valid scientific and epidemiological research.</p>

      <p>All subsequent repetions of this myth are traceable to
      Wolbarst's article, though Wolbarst himself advocated
      universal neonatal circumcision principally as a preventive
      for epilepsy, paralysis, and masturbation. Circumcisionists
      such as Wolbarst do not seem to have promoted this myth
      because they have a genuine interest in reducing penile
      cancer; they used it instead as a scare tactic to increase
      the rate of neonatal circumcision. It is surprising that
      sober scientists such as Frisch and colleagues could have
      relied on such a reference in their research.</p>

      <p>Epidemiological studies disproved Wolbarst's myth long
      ago. In North America the rate of penile cancer has been
      estimated to be 1 in 100,000<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> -
      somewhat higher than the rate of 0.82 per 100,000 found by <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/frisch/">Frisch and
      colleagues</a>. Maden et al reported penile cancer among a
      fifth of elderly patients from rural areas who had been
      circumcised neonatally and had been born at a time when the
      rate of neonatal circumcision was about 20% in rural
      populations.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Their study also
      shows that the rate of penile cancer among men circumcised
      neonatally has risen in the United States relative to the
      rise in the rate of neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p>Science must look beyond normal human anatomy to discover
      the true risk factors for penile cancer. Current
      investigations into risks posed by infection with human
      papillomavirus <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/cook2/">(circumcised males have
      been shown to have an increased rate of such infection)</a>
      and use of tobacco have been instructive.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Frisch and his colleagues have
      otherwise injected a welcome note of scientific rationalism
      into the debate over circumcision, which, despite the active
      participation of medical staff, is in essence an issue not of
      medical science but of human rights.</p>
