      <p>An association between cigarette smoking and cervical
      cancer has been demonstrated by numerous epidemiologic
      studies. However, just because there is an association does
      not mean that there is an etiologic connection between
      tobacco use and cervical cancer, although some studies do
      indicate such a relationship. There are numerous potential
      explanations, including smoking as a behavior being
      associated with other behaviors that place women at increased
      risk of HPV infection. In a state like Kentucky, where the
      prevalence of smoking is so very high, one would expect that
      the disease burden from cervical cancer would also be high. A
      review of available data on invasive cervical cancer cases
      from the <a href="http://www.kcr.uky.edu/"
      target="_blank">Kentucky Cancer Registry</a> shows that this
      is indeed the case, with the incidence rate of invasive
      cervical cancer in Kentucky being as much as 40% higher than
      the SEER rate during the 1991-1998 time period. An analysis
      of available tobacco use history data from the KCR on women
      diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer during 1997-1998
      shows that 61% of them indicated a history of tobacco
      use.</p>
