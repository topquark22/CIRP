      <h2>The male factor in the etiology of cervical cancer among
      sexually monogamous women</h2>

      <p>To address the hypothesis that male sexual behavior may
      affect the etiology of invasive cervical cancer, a
      case-control study was undertaken in Panama, Costa Rica,
      Colombia and Mexico. The study enrolled husbands of those
      women with invasive cervical cancer and of those age-matched
      controls who reported only one lifetime sexual partner. A
      total of 204 case and 485 control husbands (78% and 72%,
      respectively, of identified husbands) were interviewed,
      clinically examined, and had penile swabs taken for
      papillomavirus assays. Risk increased significantly (p =
      0.005) with the number of sexual partners reported by the
      husband (RR = 2.0 for 26+ vs. less than 6 partners). Low
      educational status of the husband was also an important
      predictor of risk, possibly indicating the role of unmeasured
      aspects of sexual behavior. <span class="yellow">Visits to
      prostitutes, circumcision status and sexually transmitted
      disease histories were not important predictors of risk, but
      evidence from clinical examination indicated that poor
      genital hygiene may be involved.</span> Human papillomavirus
      (HPV) expression as defined by filter in situ hybridization
      was detected in 20-23% of subjects and, except in the small
      group with both HPV types 6/11 and 16/18, was not related to
      risk. This may reflect sampling problems in the male or the
      importance of host factors which enhance viral
      carcinogenicity in the female.</p>
