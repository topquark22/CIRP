<b>Cervical Cancer and the Elusive Male Factor</b>

Male circumcision is probably one of the oldest surgical procedures and is
still the most common. Globally, about one man in four is likely to undergo
circumcision for various reasons.1 In the United States, an estimated 80
percent of all newborn boys were circumcised in the 1970s. These rates have
subsequently decreased, however, as a result of several policy statements
issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics. According to the most recent
of these documents, the medical benefits are "not sufficient to recommend
routine neonatal circumcision."2

Notwithstanding this balanced statement, it is generally accepted that
circumcision may reduce the prevalence and thereby the sexual transmission
of several infectious diseases. Of the various infectious agents involved,1
certain oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) are directly linked
to some genital cancers and are considered to be the main cause of both
premalignant and malignant lesions of the uterine cervix.

The article by Castellsagu&eacute; and colleagues3 in this issue of the Journal
represents the culmination of a major research effort undertaken by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer to evaluate the role of HPV and
various modifying factors in the development of cervical cancer. In the
context of this large project, seven case&shy;control studies were undertaken in
five countries on three continents. Using results from all seven studies,
Castellsagu&eacute; et al. report two main findings that are ostensibly
interrelated: male circumcision is associated with a reduced risk both of
penile HPV infection and of cervical cancer in the female partners of men
who had six or more lifetime sexual partners.

That circumcision may reduce the risk of cervical cancer in the female
partner has long been suspected.4 However, until certain types of HPV were
conclusively implicated in the etiologic process of this cancer, the reason
underlying the reduced risk remained poorly understood. The convincing
evidence provided by Castellsagu&eacute; and colleagues that the prevalence of HPV
infection is reduced among circumcised men clarifies the nature of the
elusive male factor5 in the causation of cancer of the cervix and provides a
biologically plausible explanation for the overall excess risk of cervical
cancer among female partners of uncircumcised men.

The study has several strengths: it was large, used state-of-the-art
laboratory procedures for the detection of HPV infection, and included
several different populations, a factor that enhances the generalizability
of the results. The integration of molecular techniques and epidemiologic
methods produced a powerful composite tool for the study of the etiologic
process of cervical cancer.

However, the shortcomings of the study should also be recognized. Because
many factors associated with HPV infection are also more common among
uncircumcised than circumcised men, such as a history of multiple sexual
partners and poor genital hygiene, these factors may help to explain the
results of the study. That confounding was important is demonstrated by the
finding that strong associations in the crude data between circumcision and
penile HPV infection and between circumcision and cervical cancer in a man's
female partner were attenuated after adjustment for these and other factors.
Appropriate statistical techniques were used to adjust for confounding.
Nonetheless, when variables are difficult to define and measure accurately
(such as the frequency of genital washing after intercourse or the general
adequacy of a subject's genital hygiene judged on the basis of a single
assessment), they are also difficult to control for.

Another, probably unavoidable, limitation was the way in which the factor of
main interest &lsaquo; circumcision &lsaquo; was ascertained. Progression from
infection with an oncogenic HPV to the development of carcinoma in situ and,
ultimately, to invasive cervical cancer may take several decades.6 Because
of this long latency, the possibility that the female partner may have
become infected with HPV many years earlier by a different male partner
cannot be ruled out. Castellsagu&eacute; et al. appropriately limited their
analyses to the husbands or stable partners of the women, but
misclassification would tend to attenuate the true association between
circumcision and the risk of cervical cancer, and the reduction in risk
among the female partners of circumcised as compared with uncircumcised men
may well be more substantial than reported.

With respect to the public health implications of this study, it is
important to emphasize that circumcision itself does not protect against
cervical cancer. Rather, circumcision should be considered as a modifying
factor, in that it protects against cervical cancer by reducing the
prevalence of the principal cause, HPV infection. In other words, in the
absence of penile infection with an oncogenic HPV strain, circumcision
should have no effect on the female partner's risk of cervical cancer. In
this regard, the lower incidence of cervical cancer was limited to the
female partners of circumcised, as compared with uncircumcised, men who also
had six or more lifetime sexual partners.

As Castellsagu&eacute; et al. indicate, circumcision of men at high risk for penile
HPV infection may reduce the overall risk of cervical cancer among their
female partners by 50 percent or more. If we assume that 25 percent of men
around the world are circumcised,1 then the general adoption of circumcision
might lead to a further reduction in the incidence of cancer of the cervix
of 23 to 43 percent. Because circumcision also tends to reduce the risk of
penile cancer,7 human immunodeficiency virus infection,8 and perhaps other
urogenital infections,8 this practice should have considerable public health
benefits.

These implications need, however, to be considered in the broader context of
costs and feasibility. Although carcinoma of the cervix remains one of the
leading causes of death from cancer among relatively young women, notably in
developing countries,9 numerous approaches could change this gloomy picture.
In Sweden, for example, earlier clinical detection of invasive cancer,
achieved through increased public and professional awareness, combined with
ready access to basic treatment, reduced the five-year case fatality rates
from about 80 percent to 40 percent between 1920 and 1960. Indeed, before
this intervention, the situation in Sweden was similar to that in many poor
countries, where most cervical cancers are diagnosed in advanced, incurable
stages.6 With more resources and a sophisticated infrastructure, the
incidence of cervical cancer and the associated mortality can be further
reduced by detecting and eliminating precursor lesions, chiefly carcinoma in
situ. Since the mid-20th century, cytologic screening with use of the
Papanicolaou test has achieved this aim in many developed countries,6 and
HPV testing may soon become a complementary tool.

Regular use of condoms may also inhibit sexual transmission of HPV and
thereby prevent cervical cancer. The use of condoms can, at least in theory,
be targeted to men involved in high-risk sexual behavior. Prophylactic
vaccination against HPV infection10 is now being evaluated in clinical
trials and could substantially reduce the rates of HPV infection and
associated cervical cancers. Whether interventions intended to increase the
rates of circumcision are a realistic and quantitatively important addition
to other strategies to combat cancer of the cervix remains to be documented.
