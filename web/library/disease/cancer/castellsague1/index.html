ABSTRACT

Background   It is uncertain whether male circumcision reduces the risks of
penile human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the man and of cervical
cancer in his female partner.

Methods   We pooled data on 1913 couples enrolled in one of seven
case&shy;control studies of cervical carcinoma in situ and cervical cancer in
five countries. Circumcision status was self-reported, and the accuracy of
the data was confirmed by physical examination at three study sites. The
presence or absence of penile HPV DNA was assessed by a
polymerase-chain-reaction assay in 1520 men and yielded a valid result in
the case of 1139 men (74.9 percent).

Results   Penile HPV was detected in 166 of the 847 uncircumcised men (19.6
percent) and in 16 of the 292 circumcised men (5.5 percent). After
adjustment for age at first intercourse, lifetime number of sexual partners,
and other potential confounders, circumcised men were less likely than
uncircumcised men to have HPV infection (odds ratio, 0.37; 95 percent
confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.85). Monogamous women whose male partners had
six or more sexual partners and were circumcised had a lower risk of
cervical cancer than women whose partners were uncircumcised (adjusted odds
ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.79). Results were
similar in the subgroup of men in whom circumcision was confirmed by medical
examination.

Conclusions   Male circumcision is associated with a reduced risk of penile
HPV infection and, in the case of men with a history of multiple sexual
partners, a reduced risk of cervical cancer in their current female
partners.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since Hutchinson reported in 1855 that circumcision might prevent syphilis,1
studies have suggested that circumcision may reduce the risk of penile
cancer, urinary tract infections, and common sexually transmitted diseases,
including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Little is known, however, about the effect of male circumcision on the risk
of acquiring human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV causes genital warts in men and
women, and it has been linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus,
and penis.10,11 Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women
worldwide, and up to 99 percent of all cases may be attributed to infection
by oncogenic HPV genotypes.12,13 Therefore, factors that reduce the
probability of acquiring or transmitting HPV among men or women may reduce
the risk of disease associated with these infections.

During the past 15 years the International Agency for Research on Cancer has
performed several large case&shy;control studies of cervical cancer in different
countries. We used data from these studies to assess the effect of male
circumcision on the risk of genital HPV infection in the men themselves and
the risk of cervical cancer in their sexual partners.

Methods

Study Design

Study subjects were enrolled in one of seven case&shy;control studies, five
involving invasive cervical cancer and two involving cervical carcinoma in
situ. The fieldwork for these studies was conducted from 1985 through 1993.
Two studies each were conducted in Spain and Colombia, and one study each
was conducted in Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines. Details of the
methods of each study, as well as the results of analyses of some risk
factors for cervical cancer, have been published
previously.14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 Female patients were women who had
newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed cervical carcinoma in situ or
invasive cervical cancer. Control women were recruited from the general
population in the two studies of invasive cervical cancer in Spain and
Colombia (population-based studies) and from the same hospitals as the
patients in the case of the other studies (hospital-based studies). In all
studies, control women were frequency-matched to the women with cervical
cancer according to age. Since male and female risk factors for carcinoma in
situ were similar to those for invasive cervical cancer, women with
carcinoma in situ and controls were also included in the present analysis.24

Men who were eligible for the present study were the husbands or stable
partners of the women with cervical cancer and the control women enrolled in
each of these studies. A man was considered to be a stable partner of an
enrolled woman if he reported having had regular sexual intercourse with the
woman for at least six months, whether or not they were married or lived
together.

All protocols were approved by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer and the local ethics and research committees. Informed consent was
obtained from all study subjects. Oral consent was obtained from the
subjects in the Spanish and Colombian studies (which were initiated in
1985), consistent with the standard at the time. In the remaining studies,
which were initiated later, written informed consent was obtained.

Questionnaire and Medical Examination

Subjects were interviewed with use of a standardized questionnaire
administered in person by specially trained interviewers. Detailed
information was collected on demographic and socioeconomic variables, sexual
history, and circumcision status.

The circumcision status was assessed by a clinician in the case of 794 of
the 815 men (97.4 percent) who were recruited in the studies in Brazil,
Thailand, and the Philippines. After the exclusion of 4 men whose
circumcision status was assessed as uncertain by the clinician, medical
examination of the penis confirmed the self-reported circumcision status in
748 of 790 of the male partners (94.7 percent). Only 1.7 percent of men (5
of 287) who reported having been circumcised were considered by the
clinician to be uncircumcised, and 7.4 percent of men (37 of 503) who
reported not having been circumcised were considered by the clinician as
having been circumcised (kappa, 0.89). On the basis of this high degree of
reliability, the self-reported circumcision status was used for all
analyses.

Detection of HPV DNA

Two samples of exfoliated cells were obtained from the penis: one from the
distal urethra with the use of a very thin, wet, cotton-tipped swab and one
from the external surface of the glans and coronal sulcus with the use of a
standard-sized wet, cotton-tipped swab. Cervical exfoliated cells were
collected from the women as previously described.14,15,16,17,18,19,20 The
detailed protocol used for the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay for the
detection of HPV DNA in the cervical and penile specimens has been described
previously.14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 Briefly, the L1 consensus primers
MY09&shy;MY11, as modified by Hildesheim et al.,25 were used for the samples
collected in the Colombian and Spanish studies. The GP5+/6+ general primer
system was used for the samples collected in the remaining studies. PCR
products were assessed for HPV DNA with the use of a cocktail of
HPV-specific probes and were genotyped by hybridization of the PCR products
with type-specific probes for 33 HPV types in the case of cervical samples
and for at least 6 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33) in the case of
penile samples.26,27 Samples that were positive for HPV but that did not
hybridize with any of the type-specific probes were called "HPV X."
Amplification of a fragment of the -globin gene served as an internal
quality control for each specimen.

Statistical Analysis

We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95
percent confidence intervals in order to measure associations between
specific variables and the risk of penile HPV infection or cervical cancer.
All logistic-regression models were adjusted for the age of the male partner
(in quartiles) and the study in which his partner was enrolled (seven
categories). Covariables in the model for penile HPV infection included the
male partner's level of education (primary school or less vs. secondary
school or higher), the age at which he first had sexual intercourse (16, 17
to 18, or 19 years), his lifetime number of sexual partners (1 to 5, 6 to
20, or 21), and his self-reported frequency of genital washing after
intercourse (always vs. occasionally or never). The Wald test, adjusted for
the same covariables, was used to assess the association of each variable
with circumcision status. Further adjustment for case&shy;control status or the
presence of cervical HPV DNA did not substantially alter the point
estimates, and these variables were not included in the analyses.
Logistic-regression models for cervical cancer were also adjusted for the
woman's age, her lifetime number of sexual partners, and the age at which
she first had sexual intercourse. Fisher's exact test was used to assess the
association between male circumcision status and the risk of penile HPV
infection, with stratification according to several characteristics of the
men.

We assessed whether the association of circumcision status with the risk of
penile HPV infection and cervical cancer differed significantly according to
the country in which the various studies were conducted by including in the
fully adjusted logistic-regression model an interaction term combining
country and circumcision status. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.

Results

Study Subjects

Of the 3790 women (1896 women with cervical cancer and 1894 controls) who
were enrolled in the seven case&shy;control studies, 2800 (1329 women with
cervical cancer and 1471 controls) reported having a husband or stable male
partner at study entry. A total of 984 of the 1329 partners of women with
cervical cancer (74.0 percent) and 937 of the 1471 partners of control women
(63.7 percent) were interviewed. Of these, 807 partners of patients (82.0
percent of those interviewed) and 717 partners of control women (76.5
percent) provided cytologic specimens, of which 610 (75.6 percent) and 533
(74.3 percent), respectively, yielded a valid PCR result. Eight men whose
circumcision status was unknown (four with a valid PCR result and four who
did not provide samples) were excluded from the analyses.

Overall, the men whose HPV status could be confirmed by PCR assay were
similar to the men whose HPV status could not be established with respect to
age, level of education, circumcision status, and variables related to
sexual behavior. In Colombia, highly educated men were more likely than less
educated men to have a valid PCR result. In Thailand, uncircumcised men and
men who reported having had a large number of sexual partners were more
likely to have a valid PCR result than their counterparts. However, the
exclusion of men from Thailand did not substantially alter the magnitude of
the associations.

Women whose partners participated in the study did not differ significantly
from women whose partners did not participate with respect to age, level of
education, or variables related to sexual behavior. Likewise, women whose
partners were tested for HPV infection were similar to those whose partners
were not tested.

Characteristics of the Subjects

The overall prevalence of self-reported circumcision was 19.3 percent (370
of 1913 men): 1.5 percent in Colombia, 6.1 percent in Brazil, 10.0 percent
in Thailand, 11.5 percent in Spain, and 91.0 percent in the Philippines. As
compared with uncircumcised men, circumcised men had a higher level of
education, were less likely to report frequent genital washing after sex,
and were more likely to have good genital hygiene, as assessed by a
physician (Table 1).

Circumcision and Penile HPV Infection

HPV DNA was detected in 182 of the 1139 penile specimens (16.0 percent). The
most common HPV genotypes were 16 (24.7 percent of all positive samples), 18
(4.9 percent), 6 or 11 (3.3 percent), 53 (3.3 percent), 31 (2.7 percent),
and 33 (2.2 percent). The type could not be identified in the case of 51.1
percent of the positive samples. HPV types 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 54, and 59
each accounted for less than 1.5 percent of the positive samples.
HPV was detected in 19.6 percent of uncircumcised men (166 of 847) and 5.5
percent of circumcised men (16 of 292). As compared with uncircumcised men,
circumcised men had a lower prevalence of HPV infection in all subgroups
defined according to base-line characteristics (Table 2).

   Table 2. Prevalence of Penile Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection among
Uncircumcised and Circumcised Men According to Various Characteristics.
 
The overall odds ratio for penile HPV infection associated with
self-reported circumcision was 0.37 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.16 to
0.85), after adjustment for age, study location, level of education, age at
first sexual intercourse, lifetime number of sexual partners, and frequency
of genital washing after sex. The adjusted odds ratio associated with
clinician-assessed circumcision was 0.44 (95 percent confidence interval,
0.17 to 1.13). There was an inverse association between circumcision and the
risk of HPV infection in all studies (P for heterogeneity=0.87), and this
finding persisted whether or not the female partner had cervical HPV
infection or had been given a diagnosis of cervical cancer (data not shown).
The only other risk factor that was significantly associated with the risk
of penile HPV infection was the number of sexual partners the men had had;
as compared with men who had five or fewer partners, those who had had six
or more partners had an odds ratio of 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval,
1.3 to 3.2).

The odds ratio for HPV infection among circumcised men, as compared with
uncircumcised men, was similar after the exclusion of men from Spain and
Colombia; these men did not undergo a medical examination of the penis (odds
ratio, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.20 to 1.56). The odds ratio
was also not changed significantly by the exclusion of men from the
Philippines, who represented 65.4 percent of all circumcised men in the
study (odds ratio, 0.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.93).

Circumcision and Cervical Cancer

Male circumcision was associated with a moderate, but nonsignificant,
decrease in the risk of cervical cancer in the men's female partners (odds
ratio for self-reported circumcision, 0.72; 95 percent confidence interval,
0.49 to 1.04; odds ratio for clinician-confirmed circumcision, 0.69; 95
percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 1.11). There was no evidence of
heterogeneity with respect to the location of the study (P=0.41), and the
inverse association was not substantially altered by any of the
characteristics of the women that we assessed (Table 3). Results were
similar after the exclusion of men from Spain and Colombia (odds ratio,
0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 1.33) and after the exclusion
of men from the Philippines (odds ratio, 0.76; 95 percent confidence
interval, 0.51 to 1.15).

as Compared with Those of Uncircumcised Men, According to Selected
Characteristics of the Women.
 
To minimize confounding as a result of the women's having had male partners
other than the current partner, we restricted the analysis to the 1420 men
whose female partner reported having had only one sexual partner. We also
stratified this analysis according to several variables related to the male
partner's sexual behavior in order to test the hypothesis that the reduction
in the risk of cervical cancer would be greater among women whose male
partners were at higher risk for HPV infection. As one measure of risk, we
computed an index based on a man's age when he first had sexual intercourse
and his total number of sexual partners. Men who had had six or more sexual
partners and who had first had intercourse before the age of 17 years were
considered to be at high risk; men who had had five or fewer sexual partners
and who were at least 17 years of age when they first had intercourse were
considered to be at low risk; and the remaining men were classified as being
at intermediate risk.

The inverse relation between circumcision and the risk of cervical cancer
was stronger and was significant in the case of women whose partners had a
high risk index and who engaged in sexual practices known to increase the
risk of exposure to HPV, such as having had intercourse before the age of 17
years, having had six or more sexual partners, and having a history of
contact with prostitutes (Table 4). Tests for an interaction between
circumcision status and the male partner's number of sexual partners and
between circumcision status and the risk index were significant (P=0.03 and
P=0.02, respectively).

Discussion

In our study, male circumcision was associated with a reduced risk of penile
HPV infection in men. We also found an inverse association between
circumcision and the risk of cervical cancer was significant among women
whose male partners engaged in sexual practices known to increase the risk
of infection with HPV, such as having had multiple sexual partners.

The assessment of the reliability and validity of self-reported circumcision
status has yielded inconsistent results,8,28,29,30 and potential
misclassification of circumcision status with the use of this method has
been a major concern in previous studies. One strength of our study is the
high rate of accuracy of self-reported circumcision status. Medical
examination of the penis, performed in 43 percent of the men, confirmed the
self-reported circumcision status in 95 percent of those examined. Inverse
associations with the risks of penile HPV infection and cervical cancer were
similar when circumcision status was classified according to self-report or
medical examination. Likewise, the exclusion of subjects who had not
undergone a penile examination (men from Spain and Colombia) did not
materially affect the findings.

A potential concern with respect to our study was the fact that 65 percent
of the circumcised men were from the Philippines. This result was not
unexpected, since mass circumcision sessions are regularly conducted by many
organizations in that country and most boys are circumcised before puberty.
We performed a secondary analysis excluding men from this study site and
found that results were virtually unchanged.

Some studies have reported that genital warts are more common among
uncircumcised men than among circumcised men,4,5,30,31,32,33 but other
studies have not confirmed these associations.2,34,35,36,37 Epidemiologic
evidence suggests that the absence of circumcision at birth and the presence
of phimosis, poor genital hygiene, genital warts, and HPV infection are risk
factors for penile cancer.3,10,11,38,39 Other data have suggested that the
risk of cervical cancer is reduced among the female partners of circumcised
men, but these studies were limited by the small number of circumcised men
or the low sensitivity of the methods used to detect HPV DNA.40,41,42

Little is known about the mechanisms by which removal of the foreskin may
protect against HPV infection. Our data suggest that, even though
circumcision increases the probability of maintaining good penile hygiene,
there are other ways in which circumcision reduces the risk of penile HPV
infection.

The penile shaft and the outer surface of the foreskin are covered by a
keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that provides a protective
barrier against HPV infection. In contrast, the mucosal lining of the
prepuce is not keratinized and may be more vulnerable to the virus.43 Since
during intercourse the foreskin is pulled back, the inner mucosal surface of
the prepuce is wholly exposed to vaginal secretions. HPV might be afforded
access to the basal cells through minute ulcers or small epithelial
abrasions.44 Removal of the foreskin could minimize the probability of viral
entry by markedly decreasing both the size of the surface area vulnerable to
HPV and the likelihood of mucosal trauma during intercourse. The glans of a
circumcised penis has a thicker, cornified epithelium, making it more
resistant to abrasions and less susceptible to the entry of HPV. The only
mucosal epithelium in a circumcised penis is in the distal urethra, a site
known to contain comparatively few HPV-related lesions.33

Our finding that male circumcision may reduce the risk of cervical cancer in
female sex partners is highly plausible for several reasons. First,
circumcision is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of penile
HPV infection. Second, and as indicated in further analyses of the same
data, penile HPV infection is associated with a fourfold increase in the
risk of cervical HPV infection in the female partner (data not shown).
Third, cervical HPV infection is associated with a 77-fold increase in the
risk of cervical cancer (data not shown).

In conclusion, our study has provided epidemiologic evidence that male
circumcision is associated with a reduced risk of genital HPV infection in
men and with a reduced risk of cervical cancer in women with high-risk
sexual partners. Thus, circumcision can be considered an important cofactor
in the natural history of HPV infection, since it may influence the risks of
the acquisition and transmission of HPV as well as of cervical cancer. These
findings are consistent with those of other studies that male circumcision
is associated with a reduced risk of HIV infection,7,8,9 penile cancer,2,3
and a number of other common sexually transmitted diseases.4,5 Given the
worldwide effect of these diseases on public health, further study is needed
to determine whether routine circumcision can reduce the risks of HIV and
HPV infections and other sexually transmitted diseases.
