    <p>I have been mulling over the NEJM cervical
    cancer/circumcision study with growing anger and disbelief. My
    statistical analysis skills are quite rusty, but I get the
    impression that a knowledgeable statistician could blow it out
    of the water. I think we need professional (statistical) help
    here, and that there is a reasonable potential for embarrassing
    the NEJM, possibly even forcing a retraction of the whole
    article. We also need tactical skill to decide the best way to
    publicize our criticisms. Sorry about this incredibly long
    post. Just hit delete if you aren't up for it.</p>

    <p>To refresh my statistics, I found some useful information
    at:</p>

    <p>http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html</p>

    <p>In particular, the following web page allows the calculation
    of odds ratios in a 2x2 contingency table (odds ratios are used
    extensively in the NEJM study):</p>

    <p>http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/odds2x2.html</p>

    <p>You can plug in your own numbers to check their math (so far
    I haven't found a single number in agreement&#133;) One
    drawback with these web-based stats calculators is the
    inability to calculate Fisher's exact test for samples of
    greater than 100. For that, I downloaded a trial version of
    "Analyse-it" which is a plug in for Excel tables.</p>

    <p>The single most shocking thing about this study is that 5.3%
    of the men were knowingly included in the wrong category with
    regard to their circumcision status. That's right!!! For
    the most part, the study used the self-reported circumcision
    status of the male partner to classify the partners into
    groups. In a subsample of the couples (97.4 percent of the men
    from the Brazil, Thailand, and Philippines studies) the
    circumcision status of the male partner was verified by a
    physician. They found a discrepancy between the self-reported
    and actual circumcision status in 42 of these 794 men (the
    physicians were uncertain in 4 more men). Five men who reported
    themselves to be circumcised were not, and 37 men who reported
    themselves as uncircumcised were in fact found to be
    circumcised.</p>

    <p>You would think that for the subsequent statistical
    analyses, the researchers would use the actual
    physician-verified circumcision status. Inexplicably, this is
    not the case. The authors state "the self-reported
    circumcision status was used for all analyses."</p>

    <p>The authors give us a hint as to why they elected to use
    this strange practice of using wrong data when the correct data
    were known---it weakens their findings. They report the overall
    adjusted odds ratio for penile HPV infections according to
    self-reported circumcision was 0.37 (95 percent confidence
    interval, 0.16-0.85) whereas the adjusted odds ratio associated
    with clinician-assessed circumcision was 0.44 (95 percent
    confidence interval 0.17-1.13). Not only is the odds ratio less
    impressive using the real numbers, but the confidence interval
    for physician verified numbers includes 1.0; in other words,
    the result is no longer significant.</p>

    <p>I find this to be intellectual dishonesty and a
    demonstration of bad faith on the part of the researchers.
    Using self-reported circumcision status might be forgiven if
    there were no alternative. However, when the actual
    circumcision status was known, the researchers were obligated
    to use the most correct data available in their analyses, in my
    opinion.</p>

    <p>Could it make a difference to the findings? Absolutely. I
    will get back to this below.</p>

    <p>Overall, out of 1913 couples in the study, 19.6% of the
    women with cervical cancer (194/977) had circumcised partners,
    whereas in those women without cervical cancer, only 18.8%
    (176/936) were circumcised. In other words, women with cervical
    cancer were slightly more likely to have a circumcised partner
    overall, before further statistical chicanery. Expressed in
    terms of uncircumcised (intact&#151;I know, I know) partners,
    80.1% of women with cervical cancer had uncircumcised partners
    whereas 81.2% of women without cervical cancer had
    uncircumcised partners. This difference is not significant by
    my calculation of Fishers exact test (odds ratio 1.07;
    confidence interval 0.85-1.34). This is using the self-reported
    (erroneous) data.</p>

    <p>Here are the numbers for cervical cancer according to the
    self-reported circumcision status of the partner (from Table 3)
    (Fisher exact test calculated using "Analyse-It" for
    Excel):</p>

    <p>Now, we know that 42 men in the above table are
    misclassified (i.e. in the wrong box above). Specifically, 5
    need to move from the circumcised to the uncircumcised row and
    37 need to move from the uncircumcised to the circumcised row.
    In order to see what the maximum impact of this
    misclassification could be, let us move 5 from circumcised to
    uncircumcised in the cervical cancer negative column and move
    37 from uncircumcised to circumcised in the cervical cancer
    positive column (of course it is unlikely that the real data
    would be this skewed). This gives the following results:</p>

    <p>Now the odds ratio shows an even greater likelihood that a
    woman with a circumcised partner will have cervical cancer. The
    odds ratio becomes 1.385 and the confidence interval no longer
    includes 1, which means a significant result, i.e. women with
    circumcised partners are significantly more likely to have
    cervical cancer.</p>

    <p>The validity of pulling numbers from other studies to test a
    hypothesis which they were not designed to test is
    questionable. I believe this is called post-hoc analysis (my
    stats courses were some time ago&#133;). Well actually, it is
    not even that, since post-hoc analysis applies to testing for
    other hypotheses than the study was originally designed for in
    the case of one's own single study. Here we have an
    analysis of data pulled from seven other studies. The other
    studies were not designed to test the hypothesis that there is
    an association between circumcision status and cervical cancer.
    In addition, the countries studied had very different
    underlying rates of HPV infection ranging from 5.5% of the men
    studied who were positive in Philippines to 37.6% positive in
    Brazil. The majority of the circumcised men in the study
    happened to come from Philippines (65.4% of the circumcised men
    in the study) where the overall rate of HPV was the lowest,
    nearly half the rate of the second lowest country (Spain at
    10.8% HPV positive overall). There may have been other studies
    done in other geographical locations with far different
    numbers, which were not included in the analysis. Since the
    authors have demonstrated their bad faith by knowingly
    analysing erroneous data, how are we to know that the
    particular studies chosen were not culled from a larger pool
    specifically to show a particular result?</p>

    <p>The odds ratios were "adjusted" to account for
    other variables such as age, location, education, and so on.
    Usually these adjustments are applied when at first glance
    there seems to be a large correlation between two variables, in
    order to account for some of this apparent correlation. So,
    when the odds ratios are adjusted, an apparent correlation
    usually becomes smaller, and what at first appears to be a
    strong correlation may be entirely explained away by one or
    more of these co-factors, so that no real correlation between
    the two variables under study remains.</p>

    <p>In the case of this study, we start out with no apparent
    correlation between circumcision status and cervical cancer,
    and in fact with a slightly greater risk for cervical cancer in
    the partners of circumcised men. The odds ratio is 1.07 (see
    table above). After applying an "adjustment" for the
    co-factors, the odds ratio shown in Table 3 for the same
    numbers is given as 0.72. The confidence interval is 0.49-1.04.
    We are not given the actual numbers or formula for the
    adjustment or the adjusted result. Thus, the correlation nearly
    reaches significance in the opposite direction (i.e. greater
    risk of cervical cancer in the partners of uncircumcised men)
    as the odds ratio applied to the actual numbers without
    "adjustment". I am not sure that this is a valid way
    of trying to show correlation between two variables. It implies
    that by finding more and more "co-factors" (which may
    be strategically chosen), one could eventually show a
    correlation between to variables where none would seem to exist
    by simply looking at the overall correlation between them. If
    the data presented in the study were true, this would also
    imply that one or more of the co-factors varies strongly in the
    direction opposite circumcision with regard to cervical cancer
    (i.e. increases risk), yet also tends to vary in the same
    direction as circumcision (i.e. more common in circumcised), so
    that when its effect is not separated out, there appears to be
    no overall effect of circumcision on cervical cancer. This
    would be a three-way interaction, so that "Factor X"
    is more likely to be seen in circumcised men yet also more
    likely to be seen in couples where the women has cervical
    cancer. This could then explain the fact that without allowing
    for Factor X, there appears to be no association between
    circumcision and cervical cancer, but when the effect of Factor
    X is accounted for, the true relationship between circumcision
    and cervical cancer is revealed. What could Factor X be? It
    would have to be something more likely to be seen in the
    circumcised group, and also more likely to be associated with
    cervical cancer. In the study, the circumcised men were
    considered subjectively to have better "genital
    hygiene" overall, for example (apparently, smegma is
    pathological&#133;). Could better genital hygiene be associated
    with a greater risk of cancer? If this were the case, it could
    in fact obscure the relationship between circumcision and
    cervical cancer. The circumcised men's better genital
    hygiene exposes their partners to a higher risk of cervical
    cancer, which was counterbalanced by the lower risk of cervical
    cancer due to their having been circumcised (still with me?)
    Should we start getting this message out to the population?
    Well, if this variable does not intuitively fit the bill for
    Factor X, the circumcised men also tended to be younger, more
    educated, to have started sex at a later age, had fewer sexual
    partners, less sex with prostitutes, and more condom use,
    especially with prostitutes. In other words, could we further
    reduce the risk for cervical cancer by advocating sex with more
    partners, preferably prostitutes, preferably without a condom,
    preferably beginning at a younger age, etc? This obviously
    seems counterintuitive.</p>

    <p>My point is that there is no trend toward an association
    between circumcision and cervical cancer using the overall
    pooled data, but according to the researchers, there is a
    strong trend which becomes evident when applying an unspecified
    "adjustment" to the data to account for cofactors
    that intuitively would not seem to be likely candidates for
    increasing the risk of cervical cancer. It would be nice to
    have the actual data here.</p>

    <p>To be fair, there is another co-factor called "genital
    washing after intercourse", which in fact does vary in the
    direction necessary for a putative Factor X--- it is much less
    common for circumcised men to wash after sex according to the
    data. So perhaps not washing after sex, as is more commonly the
    case for circumcised men also increases the risk for cervical
    cancer. (Sound bite: genital washing after intercourse has more
    effect on risk of cervical cancer than circumcision status).
    This might make sense intuitively, but it is hard to place much
    weight on the validity of this factor. Again, it is a
    self-reported variable, with two categories: "Always"
    versus "never or occasionally". No attempt was made
    to quantify the meanings of the categories, or validate the
    couples' self-report. It is hard to believe that this
    cofactor could have such a powerful impact.</p>

    <p>The other cofactor I have not mentioned in the context of a
    "Factor X" is study location, but this cofactor had
    the most significant interaction with circumcision status of
    all. It is not a continuous variable, like most of the others
    (e.g. more/less sexual partners, etc.), but obviously could
    have an impact. In order to reveal an association between
    circumcision status and cervical cancer that was not seen in
    the overall pooled data, it would be necessary for the
    likelihood of coming from Country Z to be greater both in the
    partners of women with cervical cancer and also among the
    circumcised men. Since the studies were case-controlled, each
    country contributed roughly equal numbers of women with and
    without cervical cancer. So Country Z would have to have
    contributed a higher proportion of women with cervical cancer
    having circumcised partners, in order to obscure the
    "true" relationship between circumcision and cervical
    cancer. This is not the case. Each country has a slightly
    higher percentage of uncircumcised partners of women with
    cervical cancer as opposed to controls.</p>

    <p>So, overall, the pooled data revealed no relationship
    between circumcision status and cervical cancer whatsoever. I
    calculate an odds ratio of 1.07&#151;about as close to no
    association as you can get. The study reports a strong trend
    toward less risk of cervical cancer in partners of circumcised
    men with an "adjusted" odds ratio of 0.72, very close
    to being significant (CI 0.49 to 1.04). In order for the
    "adjustment" to reveal a trend that was not there in
    the pooled data, the co-factors used to "adjust" the
    odds ratio would have to vary in the direction of the so-called
    Factor X discussed above, which does not seem intuitively
    possible.</p>

    <p>The only finding which reaches significance is in a subgroup
    analysis. Taking only those women who had only one male sexual
    partner (purportedly to decrease variance caused by women
    possibly contracting HPV and cervical cancer from a previous
    partner), they further divided the couples into those where the
    male partner had sex with fewer than six other partners or six
    or more partners. They report an "adjusted" odds
    ratio of 0.42 (CI 0.23-0.79) for the group of men with &gt;= 6
    partners. However, when I plug in the numbers given in Table 4,
    I get an unadjusted odds ratio of 0.981 (CI 0.681-1.413), again
    just about as close to no relationship as you can get. The
    numbers from Table 4 for men with &gt;=6 lifetime sexual
    partners are shown below.</p>

    <p>So where does this "adjusted" odds ratio that is
    significant come from? Bear in mind that the numbers above
    still include some of the men known to have been misclassified.
    At this point, it is not stated how many of these men are left
    in this subgroup analysis, although with ever smaller numbers
    in each cell, switching a few men from one cell to another
    could have a huge impact, as I showed above. The
    "adjustment" for co-factors does not seem to have an
    obvious "Factor X" as described above that varies in
    a way so as to obscure a possible relationship between
    circumcision and cervical cancer.</p>

    <p>So, we are not given data to support what is billed as the
    most significant finding of all, the one which was played up in
    the editorial and the media. The "adjusted" odds
    ratio for the subgroup appears as if out of thin air and we are
    supposed to trust the authors' calculations, when careful
    scrutiny of the co-factors used does not point in the direction
    of a co-factor varying in the manner it would have to in order
    to make such a large change in the odds ratio.</p>

    <p>This is only a beginning of the criticisms I believe can be
    levelled at this study, but I wanted to get at least a few of
    my concerns out there. Other issues would be claiming to show a
    causal relationship using correlational data (a statistical red
    flag), etc. Hopefully, someone with a good statistical
    background can point out to me where I went wrong in my
    analysis. Someone with a good statistical background can
    probably find other problems with the study that I have not
    noticed.</p>

    <p>I would be in favor of trying to enlist a professional
    statistician's aid in bulletproofing our case and trying
    to exploit the weaknesses in this study to the maximum.</p>
