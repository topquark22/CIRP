      <h1>Cancer of the Cervix in Reference to<br />
       Circumcision and Marital History</h1>

      <p class="author">Elizabeth Stern, M.D., and Peter M. Neely,
      Ph.D.</p>

      <p class="text">T<span class="sc">HE STUDY OF THE</span>
      distribution of cancer in populations has led to useful
      information regarding the epidemiology of cancer and to the
      formulation of hypotheses on the etiology of cancer. For
      example, the incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst Jewish
      women is very low compared to non-Jewish women. Because of
      the universal custom of circumcision of Jewish males, the low
      incidence was attributed to this practice. An etiological
      agent for cancer of the cervix was thought to be associated
      with a factor related to the presence of the foreskin in
      males. This hypothesis received support in that Moslems are
      reported to have a lower incidence of cancer of the cervix
      than do women of other religious affiliations in India where
      circumcision is routine for Moslem males.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> There has also been experimental
      induction of cancer of the cervix in mice by direct
      application to the cervix of smegma collected from male
      volunteers.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Indirect evidence
      for this hypothesis is offered by the report of Gagnon<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> that cancer of the cervix does not
      occur in celibate women. However, this finding has been
      refuted to some extent by the report of Towne<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> who found a lowered but definite
      incidence of cases of cancer of the cervix in women living in
      religious seclusion. Discussion of low incidence in celibate
      women brings up the question of nulliparity and other factors
      related to marriage and family life, which will be discussed
      later.</p>

      <p class="text">Since the recommendation had been made that
      circumcision should be used as a preventive measure against
      cancer of the cervix.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> we sought
      further confirmation of this hypothesis. An almost ideal
      population was that of the well women attending a cancer
      detection facility, where the population was split almost
      equally between women whose husbands were circumcised and
      those whose husbands were not. <span class="yellow">The
      discovery rate for cancer of the cervix among non-Jewish
      women whose marital partners were circumcised was no
      different from the rate among non-Jewish women with
      non-circumcised husbands.</span><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Further, the use of a sheath
      contraceptive by the marital partner, which has an effect
      equivalent to circumcision in that the cervix is protected
      from contact with smegma, was found not to be associated with
      rate differences for cancer of the cervix. In this
      population, among religious groups, there was no difference
      between Catholic and Protestant women; for Jewish women this
      study confirmed the finding of the low rate of cancer of the
      cervix in this group.</p>

      <p class="text">It was then decided to study a larger number
      of factors which seemed important in determining cervical
      cancer by a method of statistical analysis which examined
      these factors simultaneously, making allowance for the effect
      of one variable on another. For this reason we can expect
      greater validity for those variables found to be
      statistically significant. The variables used were: age;
      race; religious affiliation; use of a sheath contraceptive;
      age at marriage; number of marital events defined as the sum
      of marriages, divorces, and widowhoods; whether or not the
      individual was currently married; and the circumcision status
      of the husband. (If a woman had had more than one husband,
      the status was considered non-circumcision if any husband was
      not-circumcised.) These data for the well population and for
      those found to have cancer were analyzed using the
      statistical method of multiple regression analysis.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The variable, &ldquo;number of marital
      events,&rdquo; was found to be most useful in selecting the
      women with cancer of the cervix; the variable
      &ldquo;religion&rdquo; (Jewish), was almost as important as
      marital events when Jewish women were included in the
      analysis; <span class="yellow">the variable,
      &ldquo;circumcision&rdquo; never appeared as a primary
      variable.</span> (For details see Stern and Dixon.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup>) These findings were substantiated in
      a subsequent study using a more extended list of variables
      including data on parity, occupation, family history, ages at
      menarche and menopause, and &ldquo;estrogen index&rdquo; as
      estimated by squamous cell differentiation of vaginal
      smears.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">The Papanicolaou technique was used as
      screening method for the detection of cancer of the cervix in
      his presumably well population. This technique provides
      information essential for exploring the relationships among
      those found to be normal and those with abnormalities
      separated into the following groups: dysplasia of the
      cervix,* carcinoma in situ, and the invasive stages of cancer
      of the cervix.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">When statistical analysis was applied to the
      separate groups, the findings suggested a two-stage
      hypothesis for carcinogenesis in which different factors were
      associated with the initiation of cancer of the cervix than
      were associated with the promotion of one stage to another.
      For example, the variables, &ldquo;currently married,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;age at marriage,&rdquo; and &ldquo;estrogen
      index,&rdquo; were most useful as discriminators in
      separating cases with dysplasia from cases with in situ or
      invasive cancer. The variable, &ldquo;age,&rdquo; perhaps
      indicating the passage of time was most important in
      separating in situ from invasive cancer.</p>

      <p class="heading">COMMENT</p>

      <p class="text">The finding of an important statistical
      association does not, however, constitute evidence for an
      etiological factor. Statistical associations do supply leads
      for further investigation, particularly if there is
      biological plausibility. In the case of cancer of the cervix,
      on one factor has been observed to confer immunity to this
      disease, and, although, marked differences in rates do exist
      in some specialized groups of women, some common denominator
      must be sought.</p>

      <p class="text">We propose the hypothesis, based on the
      observation that women with cancer of the cervix are more
      likely to have a history of multiple marital events, and
      taking all other findings into consideration, that women with
      cancer of the cervix have a personality makeup suggesting
      emotional instability (which expresses itself in some women
      by multiple divorces), and that this may be due to or
      responsible for an underlying hormonal inbalance.</p>

      <p class="text">We hope that other workers will critically
      review the present findings as well as carry out new studies.
      In any case, further studies must use analytical methods
      which help see the forest of basic factors rather than the
      trees of specific related findings.</p>

      <p class="note">*Currently dysplasia of the cervix is not
      considered a stage of cancer. Recent studies show that
      dysplasias constitute a high risk group for cancer. This is
      not inconsistent with the view that dysplasia is a very early
      stage of cancer perhaps in part reversible.</p>
