      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To review the epidemiology of invasive
      cancer of the penis based on scientific publications
      identified by a Medline search from 1966-2000 for the
      keywords penis/penile, cancer/carcinoma and risk as well as
      the cited references in the identified papers.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Strong risk factors (OR &gt;10) identified
      by case-control studies included phimosis, chronic
      inflammatory conditions such as balanopostitis and lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus and treatment with psoralen and
      ultraviolet A photochemotheraphy (PUVA). A consistent
      association was found between penile cancer and smoking that
      was dose- dependent and not explained by investigated
      confounding factors such as sexual history. Sexual history
      and self-reported history of condyloma were associated with a
      3-5-fold increased penile cancer risk. Cervical cancer in the
      wife was not consistently associated with cancer of the penis
      in the husband. Circumcision was associated with penile
      cancer risk in ecological studies. In a case-control study,
      circumcision neonatally, but not after the neonatal period,
      was associated with a 3-fold decreased risk, <span
      class="yellow">albeit 20% of penile cancer patients had been
      circumcised neonatally.</span> In a large number of case
      series, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was identified in
      penile neoplastic tissue. In penile intraepithelial
      neoplasia, between 70 and 100% of lesions were HPV DNA
      positive, whereas invasive penile cancer was positive in only
      40-50% of cases. <span class="yellow">A few serological
      case-control studies and one prospective study also
      identified an association between HPV type 16 and penile
      cancer risk. An association between penile cancer risk and
      HPV prevalence in the population was also suggested by
      ecological studies.</span></p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> The evidence on risk factors for penile
      cancer suggests that <span class="yellow">preventive measures
      that could be considered include prevention of phimosis,
      treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, limiting PUVA
      treatment, smoking cessation and prophylactic prevention of
      HPV infection.</span></p>
