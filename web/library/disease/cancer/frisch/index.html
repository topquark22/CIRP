      <p>Boys circumcised neonatally are effectively protected
      against penis cancer. <span class="CIRP">[CIRP note: See <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/fleiss/">letter ff.]</a></span>
      Using data from the Danish Cancer Registry we investigated
      the long term trends in the incidence of penis cancer in a
      virtually uncircumcised population.</p>

      <h3>Patients, methods, and results</h3>

      <p>Penis cancers diagnosed in Denmark during 1943-90 and
      notified to the cancer registry were evaluated manually. We
      excluded scrotal and epididymal cancers and 39 non-epidermoid
      penis cancers (20 basal cell carcinomas, nine melanomas, and
      10 others). World standardized incidence rates were
      calculated and linear regression applied to evaluate the
      temporal changes in incidence (five year data) and age
      distribution. We evaluated the impact of marital status in a
      case control design using patients with colon and stomach
      cancers diagnosed in the same period as controls. The odds
      ratios of never having married were calculated using logistic
      regression.</p>

      <blockquote>

          <small>Incidence rates of penis cancer per 100,000
          person years (world standardised) among men<br />
          living in Copenhagen (including suburbs) and men living
          in other areas of Denmark, 1943-90</small>
        </center>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The material comprised 1,523 epidermoid penis cancers
      (including 207 without specified histology). Patients were 22
      to 95 years old at diagnosis. Incidence rates fell 0.5% a
      year from 1.15 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.36) in
      1943-7 to 0.82 (0.65 to 0.99) per 100,000 person years in
      1988-90 (P=0.002) (figure).</p>

      <p>Of 1,516 patients with information available about marital
      status at the time of diagnosis, 10.6% had never married. The
      corresponding percentages among control patients with colon
      and stomach cancer were 7.3% and 8.6%, respectively. The mean
      age at diagnosis increased among men who had ever married
      from 64 years in 1943-62 to 67 years in 1978-90
      (P&lt;0.0001). Patients with penis cancer who had never
      married living in the Copenhagen area were generally younger
      (mean age 60 years). After adjustment for age (10 year
      intervals), calendar period (five year periods), and place of
      residence (Copenhagen and suburbs v. rest of Denmark),
      patients with penis cancer were significantly more likely to
      have remained unmarried than patients with colon cancer (odds
      ratio=1.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 1.6). This applied
      in different strata of age and calendar period, and a
      particularly high risk was found for unmarried men in the
      Copenhagen area (odds ratio=1.9; 1.4 to 2.6). Compared with
      patients with stomach cancer, the association with unmarried
      marital status was not present (odds ratio=l.l; 0.97 to 1.4),
      except among those living in the Copenhagen area (odds ratio=
      1.7; 1.2 to 2.3).</p>

      <h3>Comment</h3>

      <p>Improvements in diagnostic methods can be ignored when
      considering factors influencing the incidence of penis
      cancer. Also, the proportion of undiagnosed or mis-classified
      cases is likely to be negligible.</p>

      <p>With phimosis and penis cancer as two central issues,
      neonatal circumcision has been the subject of considerable
      debate for more than a century. , The virtual absence of
      penis cancer in populations prescribing neonatal circumcision
      has been a crucial argument in this discussion. However, only
      511 out of approximately 478,000 Danish boys aged 0-14 years
      were circumcised in 1986 (National Board of Health, personal
      communication), corresponding to a cumulative national
      circumcision rate of around 1.6% by the age of 15 years.
      Thus, the declining incidence of penis cancer in Denmark
      cannot reasonably be attributed to an increased practice of
      neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p>The observed association with marital status might be
      explained by socioeconomic and hygiene factors. The finding
      that patients with penis cancer and patients with stomach
      cancer who predominate h lower socioeconomic strata had
      rather similar marital status patterns supports this. Also,
      even though it is not established how and to what extent men
      who had never or ever married differ in sexual behavior, it
      seems plausible that within the broad category of men who had
      never married, the proportion of men with lifestyles
      characterized by unstable partner relations and poor genital
      hygiene may be larger than among men who had ever married.
      This might particularly be so in the Copenhagen area, the
      only metropolitan area of Denmark. During the period under
      study, the proportion of Danish dwellings having a bath
      increased gradually from 35% in 1940 to 90% in 1990. It seems
      plausible that better penile hygiene resulting from this
      improvement in sanitary installations might have contributed
      to the observed trend.</p>
