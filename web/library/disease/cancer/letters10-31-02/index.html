      <h4>Male Circumcision, Penile Human Papillomavirus Infection,
      and Cervical Cancer</h4>
      <a id="travis" name="travis"></a> 

      <p>To the Editor: Castellsagu&eacute; <i>et al.</i> (April 11
      issue) [<a href="#t1">1</a>] did not correct for several of
      the major known risk factors for cervical cancer: race or
      ethnic group, smoking, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection, poor diet, long-term use of oral contraceptives,
      and low socioeconomic status. [<a href="#t2">2</a>] Samples
      for testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) were obtained by
      intraurethral swabbing and swabbing of the external surface
      of the glans and coronal sulcus. <span class="yellow">This
      surface is dry on circumcised penises but moist on intact
      penises, increasing the likelihood of detection of HPV
      regardless of the actual rate of infection.</span></p>

      <p class="2">In other work involving the same participants,
      <span class="yellow">the HPV genotypes in the men did not
      match those in their partners. This finding strongly suggests
      that the relation between HPV in men and that in their
      partners was not one of simple transmission.</span> [<a

      <p>To the Editor: Castellsagu&eacute; <i>et al.</i> present
      evidence that male circumcision is associated with reduced
      risks of penile HPV infection and cervical cancer in female
      partners. They theorize that removal of the foreskin
      "markedly decreases" both the surface area susceptible to HPV
      infection and the likelihood of mucosal trauma during
      intercourse. <span class="yellow">However, the mucosal
      surface of the foreskin has been described as a "specific
      erogenous zone" [<a href="#b1">1</a>] and an "important
      component of the overall sensory mechanism of the human
      penis." [<a href="#b2">2</a>] Prudence dictates that before
      promoting circumcision as preventive treatment against
      disease, researchers should confirm that the procedure is
      ethically appropriate and has no adverse long-term effects on
      sexual sensation or function.</span></p>

      <p><b>The authors reply:</b></p>
      <a id="castelsague" name="castelsague"></a> 

      <p>To the Editor: Travis raises the issue that potential
      confounding could explain the inverse association between
      male circumcision and the risk of cervical cancer in female
      partners. In fact, the addition to our final
      logistic-regression model of the race or ethnic background of
      monogamous female partners and their smoking status, use of
      oral contraceptives, and level of education lowered the odds
      ratio for cervical cancer from 0.75 to 0.64 (95 percent
      confidence interval, 0.39 to 1.04), thus showing an even
      stronger inverse association. Information on HIV status and
      diet was not collected in this study, but for these variables
      to be considered true confounders, they must be related both
      to circumcision status (which is very unlikely in the case of
      diet) and to cervical cancer. Although HIV status and
      circumcision status might be associated with one another, HIV
      infection alone is not considered a cause of cervical cancer.
      Furthermore, estimates of the prevalence of HIV infection in
      the populations we studied were too low to explain the
      associations we found.</p>

      <p class="2">Travis also suggests that the association might
      be explained by potential HPV-DNA-detection bias introduced
      by circumcision. Although it is plausible that circumcision
      compromises cellular yield, the quality and sensitivity of
      our polymerase chain reaction overcome this potential
      limitation. We used amplification of a fragment of the
      -globin gene as an internal quality control for each
      specimen, thus ensuring both the high quality of the DNA and
      the presence of cells. Samples from which the -globin and HPV
      L1 genes could not be amplified were excluded from the
      analyses, and no differences were found between the subjects
      with such samples and those with valid samples. <span
      class="yellow">Finally, we admit that the lack of correlation
      of HPV genotypes between the two partners [<a
      href="#x1">1</a>] is puzzling,</span> but it should not call
      into question our findings regarding circumcision, since the
      study involving couples provided information only on the HPV
      status of each partner at the time of the sampling.</p>

      <p class="2">We thank Bhimji and Harrison for reminding us
      that circumcision may have other consequences, since <span
      class="yellow">the procedure removes an important erogenous
      zone;</span> this and other "noninfectious" considerations
      should also be taken into account before any recommendations
      are made. Since we received numerous letters (and even a
      targeted, data-damaging cyberattack) from pro- and
      anti-circumcision groups, <span class="yellow">we would like
      to emphasize that our study was not intended to provide
      global evidence against or in favor of recommending
      circumcision. Nevertheless, we still think that there is a
      need for a comprehensive multidisciplinary review that
      considers all aspects of male circumcision and identifies
      which kinds of studies are still required in order to
      elaborate evidence-based recommendations regarding this
      controversial issue.</span></p>
