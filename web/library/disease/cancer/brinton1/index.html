      <h2>Risk factors for penile cancer: results from a
      case-control study in China</h2>

      Institute</a>, Bethesda, MD 20892. 

      <p>An epidemiologic study of penile cancer involving 141
      cases and 150 community controls was undertaken in a
      high-risk area in China. Personal interviews, as well as
      physical examinations among the prospectively ascertained
      subjects, enabled evaluation of a variety of potential risk
      factors. <span class="yellow">Strongly related to risk were
      conditions restricting the motility of the foreskin</span>,
      including phimosis or paraphimosis, particularly when so
      severe that circumcision was used for treatment. Poor hygiene
      practices also appeared to increase risk, particularly as
      evidenced by detection of smegma on physical examination,
      although it was difficult to decipher whether this
      association was etiologic or merely a consequence of disease.
      A sexual relationship outside of marriage was associated with
      a RR of 1.7, and appeared to be a more important
      discriminator than number of lifetime sexual partners. Risk
      was increased among subjects reporting previous genital
      conditions, particularly sexually transmitted diseases, and
      physical examinations revealed the appearance of genital
      warts among 13 cases vs. I control. Interviews with wives of
      study subjects failed to provide evidence of a "female
      factor" in the etiology of penile cancer. <span
      class="yellow">This study supports the need for further
      evaluation of the role of hygiene and sexually transmitted
      agents in the etiology of penile cancer.</span></p>
