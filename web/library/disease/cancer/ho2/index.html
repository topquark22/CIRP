      <p>[Abstract]</p>

      <p>Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major
      causal factor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
      The potential role of nutrition as an additional, independent
      risk factor for CIN has not been appropriately addressed in
      the context of HPV. This case-control study evaluated the
      etiologic role of HPV in terms of viral type and load and
      examined the association between CIN and plasma levels of
      micronutrients adjusting for HPV. Cases (n = 378) with
      histo-pathologically confirmed CIN and controls (n = 366)
      with no history of abnormal Pap smears were recruited from
      colposcopy and gynecology clinics, respectively. <span
      class="yellow">Risk of CIN was significantly increased among
      women who were infected with multiple HPV types (odds ratio
      [OR] = 21.06), a high viral load (OR = 13.08) and HPV 16 (OR
      = 62.49).</span> After adjusting for HPV positivity and
      demographic factors, there was an inverse correlation between
      plasma alpha-tocopherol and risk of CIN (OR = 0.15). <span
      class="yellow">Plasma ascorbic acid was protective at a high
      level of &gt; or = 0.803 mg/dl (OR = 0.46).</span> CIN was
      not associated with plasma retinol and beta-carotene levels.
      The effect of genital HPV infection on CIN development is
      highly influenced by oncogenic viral type and high viral
      load. Vitamins C and E may play an independent protective
      role in development of CIN that needs to be confirmed in
      prospective studies.</p>
