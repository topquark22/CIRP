      <p class="abstract"><i>This study was undertaken to
      investigate the relation of cancer of the cervix to
      circumcision status as determined by actual examination of
      the marital partner. A total of 1,148 histologically
      confirmed cases from five New York City hospitals were
      included in the study: 454 of invasive carcinoma, 411 of
      carcinoma in situ, and 283 of cervical dysplasia. Controls
      were matched by age and ethnic group. The examination of
      marital partners for circumcision status was limited to
      patients and matched controls who were married to first
      husband. Five degrees of circumcision status, i.e coverage of
      the glans by the foreskin were recorded. Patients married to
      first husband included 91 with invasive carcinoma, 140 with
      carcinoma in situ, and 98 with cervical dysplasia. Successful
      completion of examination of the marital partner was obtained
      for 64 of the invasive carcinoma control pairs, 103 of the
      carcinoma in situ pairs, and 74 of the cervical dysplasia
      pairs. <span class="yellow">No significant differences were
      found in the circumcision status of marital partners of cases
      and controls. This held true even when the invasive and in
      situ pairs were combined to provide a series of 172
      pairs.</span></i></p>
