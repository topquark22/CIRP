            <i>Background:</i> Determine the relationship of
            circumcision status to the risk for genital infection
            with human papillomavirus (HPV).<br />
             <i>Methods:</i> A MEDLINE search and a review of
            references in published articles were used to identify
            publications from peer-reviewed journals in Index
            Medicus with data on circumcision status in patients
            with and without HPV infections. Inclusion criteria
            included diagnosis by culture, biopsy, or PCR,
            determination of circumcision status by physical
            examination, and multiple site sampling including the
            shaft of the penis. A meta-analysis was performed with
            sensitivity analyses.<br />
             <i>Results:</i> Sixteen articles contained data on
            circumcision status in patients with and without HPV
            infections. Eight studies used accurate diagnostic
            methods. Only three articles satisfied the strict
            inclusion criteria. There was no significant
            association between circumcision status and HPV
            infection (random-effects model summary effect OR Z
            1.20, 95%CI Z 0.80&ndash;1.79) in these three studies.
            If the eight studies using accurate diagnostic methods
            are adjusted for the method of determining circumcision
            status and failure to sample the penile shaft using
            meta-regression the summary effects odds ratio is 1.25
            (95%CI Z0.95&ndash;1.67).<br />
             <i>Conclusions:</i> The medical literature does not
            support the claim that circumcision reduces the risk
            for genital HPV infection. To correctly assess the risk
            of HPV infection in circumcised males, the penile shaft
            needs to be sampled for HPV infection.<br />

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text2">A decreased risk for sexually transmitted
      infections in circumcised adult males has long been used as a
      justification for neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1&ndash;3</a></sup> Other than general review
      articles and opinion pieces, the association between
      circumcision status and sexually transmitted infections has
      not been subjected to systematic review or analysis until
      recently.<sup><a href="#n4">4,5</a></sup> In 1999, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision
      concluded, &lsquo;&lsquo;Existing scientific evidence
      demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male
      circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
      recommend routine neonatal circumcision.&rsquo;&rsquo; In
      addressing sexually transmitted infections other than HIV,
      they merely stated, &lsquo;&lsquo;Evidence regarding the
      relationship of circumcision to STD in general is complex and
      conflicting.&rsquo;&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Human papillomavirus (HPV) is believed to be
      responsible for cervical cancer in women and penile cancer in
      men. In an effort to clarify the impact of circumcision
      status on sexually transmitted HPV infections and indirectly
      on the female partner&rsquo;s risk of cervical cancer, the
      medical literature addressing the impact of circumcision
      status on sexually transmitted HPV infections was reviewed
      and analyzed.</p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p class="text2">The recommendations of Stroup et al. for the
      meta-analysis of observational studies were followed.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Inclusion criteria included
      publication of a cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control
      study in a peer-reviewed journal, the presence of data on the
      circumcision status of males both with and without genital
      HPV infections, diagnosis by culture, biopsy, or HPV DNA
      detection using PCR or Hybrid capture 2, determination of
      circumcision status by physical examination, and multiple
      site sampling including the shaft of the penis. Articles were
      identified using a MEDLINE search and a review of references
      in published articles. A MEDLINE search using PubMed was last
      undertaken on March 13, 2006.
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Circumcision&rsquo;&rsquo; was used as a key
      word, which identified 3515 articles. The majority were
      review articles and opinion pieces. Fifteen articles compared
      the rates of sexually transmitted HPV infections, including
      genital warts, in men who were and were not
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n8">8&ndash;22</a></sup> One
      additional study was identified by review of the
      bibliographies.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Of these sixteen studies, four made the
      diagnosis of genital warts clinically,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,11,12,14</a></sup> one relied on patient report,
      <sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> and four lacked
      documentation of the diagnostic method.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8,15,23</a></sup> These eight studies were
      excluded from analysis. An additional two studies failed to
      sample the penile shaft and were excluded.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16,19</a></sup> Three other studies relied on
      patient report to determine circumcision status and were
      excluded.<sup><a href="#n17">17,20,22</a></sup> This left
      three studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Analysis
      was performed with these three studies. Because of the small
      number studies that met the inclusion criteria, it was
      elected to analyze the eight studies with sufficient
      diagnostic methods adjusting for differences in sampling and
      assignment using metaregression<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> and, alternatively, by estimating
      the number of cases of HPV infection missed by not sampling
      the penile shaft based on the rates published by Weaver et
      al.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> In studies in which
      distinct strata of the subjects, each strata was considered
      separately in calculating the summary effect.</p>

      <p class="text2">To stabilize the impact of cells with small
      numbers, a general variance-based random-effects model<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> was run using each study&rsquo;s
      exact odds ratios and confidence intervals (Proc LogXact,
      version 5.0, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge,
      Massachusetts). To test for potential outliers, the dataset
      from each study group was individually excluded from the
      analysis to measure the impact on the chi-square measure of
      betweenstudy heterogeneity. The possibility of publication
      bias was explored using funnel graphs and linear regression
      analysis as described by Egger and associates,<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> funnel plot regression as described
      by Macaskill, Walter, and Irvwig,<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> and the adjusted rank correlation
      test described by Begg and Mazumdar<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> using statistical analysis software
      (SAS version 8.02, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
      Adjustment for publication bias was performed using the
      &lsquo;&lsquo;trim and fill&rsquo;&rsquo; method described by
      Duvall and Tweedie.<sup><a href="#n29">29,30</a></sup></p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text2">Characteristics of the studies with data on
      the circumcision status of males both with and without
      genital HPV infections are shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows
      the raw data from the sixteen studies comparing HPV
      infections by circumcision status. Table 3 shows the results
      of the meta-analyses. The random-effects summary effect odds
      ratio of the three studies meeting the inclusion criteria was
      1.20 (95%CIZ 0.80&ndash;1.79). There was no evidence of
      significant between-study heterogeneity.</p>

      <p class="text2">In our attempt to identify datasets that
      might be outliers, none met the criteria.</p>

      <p class="text2">A funnel graph, which plots precision (the
      inverse of variance) on the y-axis and the natural logarithm
      of the odds ratio on the x-axis, should have a shape like an
      inverted funnel (Fig. 1). With the largest study representing
      the apex of the inverted funnel, there is a paucity of
      studies in the left lower portion of the inverted funnel and
      cluster of studies in the right lower portion that did not
      meet the strict inclusion criteria. Methods to determine the
      presence of publication bias use a p-value threshold of 0.10
      for significance. These were applied to the eight studies
      using reliable diagnostic methods. Using Egger&rsquo;s
      regression model the p-values were 0.3642 and 0.1996 for the
      unweighted and weighted models, respectively. The results of
      Begg&rsquo;s adjusted rank correlation test were also not
      consistent with publication bias (pZ 0.9029 and pZ 0.3290 for
      standardized treatment effect versus variance of the
      treatment effect and versus study sample size, respectively).
      Using Macaskill&rsquo;s funnel plot regression, neither the
      unweighted model nor the weighted model was significant for
      publication bias (p Z0.5537 and p Z 0.3600,
      respectively).</p>

      <p class="text2">Using the &lsquo;&lsquo;trim and
      fill&rsquo;&rsquo; technique on the eight studies using
      reliable diagnostic techniques, three datasets in the right
      hand portion of the inverted funnel were found to not have a
      corresponding dataset in the left hand portion of the
      funnel.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text2">This is the first systematic review of the
      medical literature looking at the risk of genital HPV
      infections based on circumcision status. Using strict
      criteria to include multiple genital sites for sampling,
      including detection of HPV on the penile shaft the analysis
      failed to show a significant association between genital HPV
      infection and circumcision status.</p>

      <p class="text2">The limitations of the meta-analysis when
      applied to observational studies, the role of between-study
      heterogeneity, the role of publication bias, the use of exact
      odds ratios, and the limitations of attributing risk of STD
      to circumcision status have been discussed previously.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> To minimize bias in studies included
      in the meta-analysis, selection criteria were developed.
      Relying on patient report or clinical appearance would miss
      the many HPV infections that are only found through physical
      examination using acetic acid, biopsy, culture, or HPV DNA
      testing. Likewise, the correlation between patient report and
      physical examination can vary widely depending the population
      studied.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a>,<a
      href="#n31">31&ndash;34</a></sup> Finally, two studies have
      shown the distribution of HPV infections of the male penis to
      differ by circumcision status, with circumcised men having
      the penile shaft as the focus of these infections.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a>,<a href="#n21">21</a></sup> For example,
      more than half of HPV infections in circumcised men will be
      missed if the penile shaft, scrotum, and urine are not
      sampled, while more than 89% of HPV infections will be
      detected in genitally intact males sampling only the glans
      and foreskin.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Studies that
      failed to sample the penile shaft would fail to diagnose a
      disproportionate number of circumcised subjects. While some
      would argue that the relevance of HPV DNA detection from the
      penile shaft is unclear, genital warts and penile
      intraepithelial neoplasia have been found on the
      shaft.<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup> The presence of HPV
      on the shaft of the penis indicates that the virus is also
      available for sexual transmission.</p>

      <p class="text2">With these criteria in pla ce, only three
      studies satisfied all of them. Rather than limit the analysis
      to these three studies, it was elected to evaluate the eight
      studies with reliable diagnostic methods and attempt to
      minimize the bias introduced by incomplete sampling and
      determination of circumcision status by patient report. The
      first method, meta-regression, adjusted for incomplete
      sampling and method of ascertaining circumcision status using
      a regression model.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> The
      second method estimated the number of cases of HPV infection
      missed by not sampling the penile shaft using the numbers
      generated by Weaver and colleagues.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> This method depends on the
      applicability of these ratios to other populations. Knowing
      that these biases exist and not adjusting for them would
      generate results know to be biased.</p>

      <p class="text2">The studies included for analysis only
      measured prevalence of HPV infection. This study does not
      attempt to describe the relationship between circumcision
      status and persistent HPV infection or penile cancer. The
      impact of HPV and circumcision status on penile cancer is
      only now enfolding. While HPV DNA is found over 90% of the
      biopsies of penile intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma in
      situ, it is detected in only about half of the cases with
      invasive squamous cell carcinomas.<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> Two recent studies indicate that
      phimosis rather than having a foreskin places a
      noncircumcised male at greater risk for invasive penile
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n36">36,37</a></sup> Non-circumcised
      men are at no greater risk for less invasive disease.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> There is mounting evidence that
      balanitis xerotica obliterans, a common cause of pathologic
      phimosis, may also be associated with penile cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n38">38&ndash;40</a></sup> It is likely that HPV
      associated lesions, such as penile intraepithelial neoplasia,
      carcinoma in situ, and half of the cases of invasive squamous
      cell carcinoma occur equally in circumcised and
      non-circumcised men. The remaining squamous cell carcinomas
      may develop from the rare case of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans seen in non-circumcised men. Longitudinal studies
      documenting the natural history of HPV infection in men are
      needed to answer this question more directly.</p>

      <p class="text2">Three of the recent publications comparing
      the rate of genital HPV in circumcised and non-circumcised
      men suffer from serious methodological flaws. One study
      compiled seven studies from five countries from three
      continents. The study groups were the regular male sexual
      partners of women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer or
      cervical cancer in situ. Control groups were drawn from the
      same medical facilities.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      Consequently, half of the study&rsquo;s population was
      high-risk. A fatal flaw in the study was the small number of
      circumcised men in all of the countries other than the
      Philippines and small number of non-circumcised men in the
      Philippines. Of the twenty data cells from the five
      countries, seven had five or fewer subjects. The authors used
      parametric statistical methods, which are notably unreliable
      in this situation, to report the statistics on the combined
      data. These studies only sampled the glans, foreskin, and
      urethra. If the data are adjusted for the number of
      infections that would be missed from this limited sampling,
      the odds ratio, adjusted for study site using exact
      statistics, lowers the reported odds ratio of 3.41 (95%CI Z
      1.56&ndash;8.03) to an odds ratio of 1.64 (95%CI
      Z0.87e3.18).</p>

      <p class="text2">The second problematic study found that
      Hispanic men were at greater risk for genital HPV
      infection.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Since Hispanic men
      are more likely to be non-circumcised, the authors
      predictably found a greater risk for genital HPV infection in
      non-circumcised men. When performing multivariate analysis,
      the authors inexplicably failed to control for ethnicity when
      determining the adjusted risk of circumcision status. Since
      sexual partners are not chosen at random, small, close
      communities can have accelerated increases in incidence and
      higher prevalences than the community at large. Controlling
      for ethnicity was a reasonable tool available to the authors
      to adjust for transmission rates in close communities,
      although the colinearity of ethnicity and circumcision status
      may be problematic. Without controlling for ethnicity it is
      impossible to determine whether being in the Hispanic
      community or circumcision status was responsible for the
      increased risk of genital HPV. This study also did not sample
      the penile shaft for HPV. Adjusting for this incomplete
      sampling, the results of the study are reversed (ORZ 0.63,
      95%CI Z 0.40&ndash;0.98).</p>

      <p class="text2">The third problematic study was published by
      Lajous et al.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> In this study
      fourteen men were identified as circumcised on physical
      examination, while 95 men identified themselves as being
      circumcised. Physical examination is considered the gold
      standard for assigning circumcision status. Instead of using
      physical examination as the measure of circumcision status,
      the study published the association between HPV infection and
      self-report of circumcision. Eighty-eight of the 95 men who
      reported themselves as circumcised were not
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One limitation of this meta-analysis is the
      inability to find all sources of data using any search
      strategy. There may be published and unpublished studies not
      included in the analysis. Adjustment for confounding factors
      was missing in nearly all of the studies used in the
      analysis, so raw numbers were used.</p>

      <p class="text2">The funnel graph and one of the measures for
      publication bias indicate the presence of publication bias.
      Since there has been no comparative analyses of the methods
      of detecting publication bias, it is recommended that all of
      the tests for publication bias be performed.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup> When adjusted for publication bias
      using the &lsquo;&lsquo;trim and fill&rsquo;&rsquo; method,
      three studies in the right lower portion of the inverted
      funnel was found to not have a corresponding study in the
      left lower portion. Adjustment for publication bias needs to
      viewed with caution as asymmetry of a funnel plot may be due
      to factors other than publication bias, and, likewise,
      results generated to correct for the asymmetry may not
      reflect a correction for publication bias.<sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup> An analysis of strengths and
      weaknesses of the different measures of publication bias has
      been performed by Macaskill et al.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">One of the drawbacks seen in some of the
      observational studies is that specific outcomes can have a
      small number of patients. When this occurs, the assumptions
      that allow one to make accurate inferences from the
      Mantel-Haenszel and GLIMMIX methods may no longer be valid.
      Likewise, if parametric methods are used to estimate odds
      ratios and 95% confidence intervals for studies with small
      cell sizes, these inaccurate estimates can bias summary
      effects using general-variance based methods. The instability
      propagated by studies with small cell sizes is reflected in
      variation of results each method delivers (not shown). In an
      attempt to minimize the bias of studies with cells of small
      size, the odds ratios and confidence intervals were
      calculated using exact methods. These values were then used
      to calculate a random-effects summary odds ratio using the
      general-variance based method. This method introduces less
      bias than models based on parametric assumptions.</p>

      <p class="text2">In conclusion, the medical literature does
      not support an association between the prevalence of genital
      HPV and circumcision status when strict criteria for
      diagnosis are applied.</p>
