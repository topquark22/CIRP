        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <p>To detect the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA
        in penile cancers, 18 squamous-cell carcinomas were studied
        by Southern blot analysis. All specimens were from
        Brazilian patients ranging in age from 31 to 78 years. Of
        these, 7 harbored DNA sequence homology. Most positive
        specimens contained more than 100 copies of viral DNA. No
        HPV 16 was detected in our samples. Presence of HPV DNA
        sequences in the samples studied was not correlated with
        the patients' age or race, nor with extent or progress of
        disease.</p>
