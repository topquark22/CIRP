      <blockquote>
        <p>The commonly believed notion that circumcised men cannot
        develop penile cancer can result in delays in diagnosis.
        Recent medical literature has failed to confirm the
        protective effect of circumcision on penile neoplasms.
        Physicians need to be aware that men circumcised after 1
        month of age may be at higher risk for penile cancer than
        those never circumcised.</p>

        <p>Key Words. Penile neoplasms; circumcision; Bowen's
        disease.<br />

      <p class="text">A commonly held misperception in modern
      medicine is that circumcised men cannot develop neoplasms of
      the penis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> This misperception can be
      traced to a single 1932 article by Wolbarst,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> a
      procircumcision advocate who also proclaimed circumcision as
      the cure for everything from masturbation to epilepsy to
      infant death.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> This often cited paper based
      its conclusion on gathered reports of penile cancer from
      hospitals. No attempt was made to confirm circumcision
      status, and no control group was employed. None of the cases
      of penile cancer occurred in Jewish men circumcised at birth,
      prompting Wolbarst to conclude that circumcision prevented
      penile cancer. Until recently this conclusion has not been
      properly studied or challenged. As circumcision gained
      popularity early in this century, the number of circumcised
      men reaching the age when penile cancer becomes apparent is
      rapidly increasing. Concomitantly, the number of circumcised
      men with penile cancer is already beginning to increase.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> The following
      report demonstrates the potential danger resulting from this
      misperception.</p>

      <h4>CASE REPORT</h4>

      <p class="text">A 72-year-old white man presented to his
      physician in August 1992 with several millimeters of what was
      described in the chart as "white erythema" on the right glans
      penis. The lesion had been treated by a urologist with
      "creams." The patient was referred again to the urologist,
      but delayed the appointment until his followup cystoscopy for
      a papillary, grade 2, transitional-cell bladder carcinoma,
      which had been diagnosed in 1984. The erythematous patch was
      noted on the glans again by his physician in May 1994. In
      August 1995, at the age of 76 years, the patient was referred
      to a dermatologist, whose biopsy showed a squamous cell
      carcinoma in situ (Bowen's disease). No further evidence of
      disease has been identified in the first 6 months of clinical
      follow-up.</p>

      <p class="text">Significant past medical history included
      nonrecurrent bladder carcinoma, left hemicolectomy in 1964
      for colon adenocarcinoma, excision of a rectal tubovillous
      adenoma in 1994, benign prostatic hypertrophy status
      post-transuretharl resection of prostate, prostatourethritis
      in 1965, and hepatitis A with jaundice in 1942. He has been
      followed at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin
      since 1928.</p>

      <p class="text">He is of German descent and has lived his
      entire life in Marathon County, Wisconsin as a dairy farmer.
      He was married in 1951 and has had no sexual relationships
      outside his marriage. He has a 23-pack- year history of
      cigarette smoking but quit in 1959 and reports drinking an
      occasional beer. His circumcision status was not documented
      in the chart. After a review of the chart, the patient was
      contacted and he confirmed he had been circumcised as long as
      he could remember.</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text">Cancer of the penis is an extremely rare
      malignancy with a predicted lifetime risk of 1 in 1437 men in
      the United States<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> and 1 in 1694 in Denmark,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> representing

      genital conditions (including urinary tract infection,
      genital warts, yeast infections, chlamydia, genital crabs,
      gonorrhea, genital herpes, syphilis, genital ulcers or
      sores),<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font>

      chewing tobacco or areca nut, using snuff,<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></font> and postnatal
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7,8</a></sup></font> Of these risk factors, a
      history of genital warts appears to be the most significant,
      leading experts to identify human papillomavirus (HPV) as the
      most common causative factor in penile cancer.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text">Interestingly, genital warts are now more
      common in circumcised men,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> and HPV-associated lesions
      are equally prevalent in circumcised and intact men. Penile
      intraepithelial neoplasia, although found rarely, is slightly
      more common in men with foreskins.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></font> In one study of 11 men with
      carcinoma in situ of the penis, 10 had been circumcised as
      infants.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text">The role of circumcision in preventing penile
      cancer has recently been called into question.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> In addition
      to several publications documenting cancer in circumcised
      men,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n19">19-26</a></sup></font>
      a recent case control study of 110 men with penile cancer
      from the Pacific Northwest revealed that 41 (37%) had been
      circumcised.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> Relative to men circumcised at
      birth, the risk for penile cancer was 3.04 times as great
      among men who were never circumcised and 3.55 times as great
      among men who were circumcised after the neonatal period. The
      magnitude of risk for developing penile cancer was similar in
      smokers, but a history of multiple sex partners or genital
      warts were the strongest risk factors (Table). While neonatal
      circumcision may play a small role in preventing penile
      carcinoma, 20% of the patients in this study were circumcised
      at birth.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></font>
      When the control group was properly adjusted for age, there
      was no difference between the case group and control group in
      circumcision status.</p>

      <p class="text">Circumcision performed after the newborn
      period may increase the likelihood of penile neoplasms. In a
      Danish study, men with localized squamous cell carcinoma of
      the penis were 7.81 times as likely to have been circumcised
      after the newborn period as the general population.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8,27</a></sup></font> Maden et
      al<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></font>
      demonstrated that men circumcised after the newborn period
      had a slightly higher risk when compared with those
      circumcised at birth.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text">In an epidemiologic study with both
      retrospective and prospective cases from China, 157 men with
      penile neoplasms were identified. Circumcised men were
      markedly more likely to develop penile cancer than
      controls.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font>
      The circumcision scar is often the focus of tumor
      formation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> In Africa an uncontrolled
      study found that all of the circumcised men who developed
      penile cancer were circumcised late in adolescence or
      adulthood.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> Why the timing of
      circumcision is a significant factor is unclear.</p>

      <p class="text">For the circumcision status of the patient to
      be missing from the chart for the past 60 years is
      indefensible, but not uncommon. In a series of penile cancer
      patients from the Mayo Clinic, 15% did not have their
      circumcision status documented in the chart.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> Because
      circumcision is so prevalent in the United States, a
      circumcised penis is often described as "normal" in medical
      records, thus providing no useful information.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">In spite of the body of
      evidence to the contrary, several circumcision advocates
      still profess that penile cancer is "virtually eliminated" by
      neonatal circumcision.</span><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1,28-31</a></sup></font> Having been given access
      to respectable medical journals, their errant message has
      been adopted by many mainstream physicians.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> The
      persistence and prevalence of his myth may be detrimental, as
      evidenced by the 3-year delay in this patient between the
      time the penile lesion was noted and a biopsy taken.</p>

      <p class="text">This patient had multiple previous neoplasms,
      which prompts us to speculate whether men who develop penile
      cancer may be more "cancer-prone." Do these "cancer-prone men
      respond to stimuli (such as HPV) by forming a penile
      neoplasm, when the vast majority of men with similar exposure
      will not? Should occupational or environmental irritants also
      be considered? These questions suggest the need for further
      study.</p>

      <p class="text">Officials of the American Cancer Society do
      not recommend circumcision as a cancer preventative measure.
      (personal correspondence, <a
      href="/library/statements/letters/1996-02_ACS/">H. Shingleton
      and C. W. Heath, Jr</a>, to Peter Rappo, MD, Feb 16, 1996).
      Recognizing that circumcised men can acquire penile cancer
      are are at equal or higher risk for HPV-associated lesions is
      the first step in preventing penile cancer. Screening for,
      recognizing, and treating these lesions as they develop on
      the penis as is currently performed on the uterine cervix may
      be the most responsible approach to controlling both cervical
      and penile cancer; however the utility of such screening
      needs to be explored.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16,32</a></sup></font> Persistent penile rashs
      are a highly significant risk factor for penile cancer<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> and should not
      be ignored.</p>

      <p class="text">Because of the absence of a national tumor
      registry in the United States, most of the epidemiological
      studies have been performed outside the United States. When
      the incidence of penile cancers from different countries are
      compared, the biggest factor appears to be indoor
      plumbing.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup></font> The downward trend in the
      incidence of penile cancer over the past 47 years in Denmark,
      where 1.6% of men are circumcised, has been partly attributed
      to better penile hygiene.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> <span
      class="yellow">Ironically, Denmark, in spite of its low
      circumcision rate, currently has a lower incidence of penile
      cancer than the United States, where 60% to 80% of men are
      circumcised.</span></p>
