      <h2>Case-control study of risk factors for cervical neoplasia

       I: Role of the "male factor" in women with one lifetime
      sexual partner.</h2>

      <p>Possible risk factors for cervical cancer were
      investigated in 645 women, 20-49 years of age from
      Copenhagen, with histologically confirmed cervical cancer or
      carcinoma in situ and in 614 controls drawn at random from
      the female population of the same area. To study the role of
      the "male factor", monogamous cases and controls together
      with their husbands were invited for further examination.
      This included a personal interview, a blood sample for
      analysis of herpes simplex virus antibodies, and a penile
      swab for papillomavirus analysis. In total, 41 case couples
      and 90 control couples were enrolled (89% and 92% of
      eligibles, respectively). The most significant risk
      determinants were a history of genital warts in the male (RR
      = 17.9 for ever vs. never) and ever having used condoms (RR =
      0.2). Other potentially important factors, although not
      statistically significant, were ever having visited
      prostitutes (RR = 2.6, p = 0.14), circumcision (RR = 0.3, p =
      0.18), and a history of genital warts in the female (RR =
      4.6), p = 0.09). Having a husband with a history of multiple
      sexual partners was also associated with an increased crude
      risk, but when adjustment was made for husband ever having
      had genital warts, use of condom, and age, no significant
      excess risk was observed. Human papillomavirus DNA, which was
      tested for with ViraPap and ViraType, was detected in one of
      the controls, and in only 2 case husbands. <span
      class="yellow">This study points to the importance of
      "high-risk males" for the development of cervical cancer in
      their sexual partner; the results support the infectious
      nature of the disease.</span></p>
