      <h2>Reports of circumcised men developing penile cancer</h2>

      <p>Reviewing the literature and the experience at our
      institution I have found at least 91 cases of circumcised men
      developing penile neoplasms. These include:</p>

        cases]</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These articles all contain at least one case of a
      circumcised man developing penile cancer, however I do not
      have the articles in hand to provide an exact number:</p>

        State J Med</i> 1979; 79: 1903-4.</li>

        Urol</i> 1973; 110: 696-702.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition:<br />
      Reddy et al. examined the frequency of carcinoma of the penis
      from 32 hospitals in India and found a wide variation in
      incidence that could not be explained by the intact status of
      the Hindus or the circumcision practices of the Muslims.
      [Reddy CR, Raghavaiah NV, Mouli KC. Prevalence of carcinoma
      of the penis with special reference to India. <i>Int Surg</i>
      1975, 60: 474-6.]</p>

      <p>In addition:<br />
      We have just begun review of our experience at the Marshfield
      Clinic in Wisconsin with 26 penile carcinoma cases. Of the
      first five cases reviewed, two of the men were circumcised.
      We hope to publish our series sometime in the next year. One
      of the men experienced a two year delay in having his cancer
      diagnosed because his urologist wrongly believed that
      circumcised men cannot develop penile cancer. The diagnosis
      was made by a dermatologist. We hope we don't get sued.</p>

      <p>It is important to remember when looking at the studies
      performed in the 1950s(which most procircumcision zealots
      such as Schoen and Wiswell like to cite) those octogenarians
      were born in the 1870s when the circumcision rate in the
      United States was close to zero. The increased number of
      cases of penile cancer found in more recent studies is
      reflective of the steadily increasing circumcision rates in
      this country (37% of Maden's cases were circumcised). Using
      Maden's numbers and properly adjusting his control population
      to match the case population for age, there was no difference
      in risk of developing penile cancer between men who were
      circumcised and those who were not. HPV (the cause of genital
      warts) has been found in most cases of penile cancer. Genital
      warts are now more common in circumcised men [<a
      href="/library/disease/STD/cook1/">Cook LS, Koutsky LA,
      Holmes KK</a>. Circumcision and sexually transmitted
      diseases. <i>Am J Public Health</i> 1994; 84: 197-201. <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/cook2/">Cook LS. Koutsky LA.
      Holmes KK</a>. Clinical presentation of genital warts among
      circumcised and uncircumcised heterosexual men attending an
      urban STD clinic. <i>Genitourin Med</i> 1993; 69: 262-264.]
      and HPV lesions are equally common in circumcised and intact
      men [Aynaud O, Ionesco M; Barrasso R. Penile intraepithelial
      neoplasia. Specific clinical features correlate with
      histologic and virologic findings. <i>Cancer</i> 1994; 74:
      1762-7.]. As the number of circumcised men approaching the
      age at which penile cancer becomes evident (70s and 80s) it
      is quite likely that the vast majority of men developing
      penile cancer in the United States will be circumcised.</p>

      <p>Finally, circumcision does not explain why Japan and
      Denmark have lower penile cancer rates than the United States
      when those two countries do not practice circumcision.

      the penis. A life-table analysis. <i>Am J Dis Child</i> 1980;

      of the penis [letter] <i>Am J Dis Child</i> 1985; 139:
