      <p>A recent report that 93 per cent of invasive cervical
      cancers worldwide contain human papillomavirus (HPV) may be
      an underestimate, due to sample inadequacy or integration
      events affecting the HPV L1 gene, which is the target of the
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test which was used.
      The formerly HPV-negative cases from this study have
      therefore been reanalyzed for HPV serum antibodies and HPV
      DNA. Serology for HPV 16 VLPs, E6, and E7 antibodies was
      performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were HPV-negative and a
      sample of 48 of the 866 cases which were HPV-positive in the
      original study. Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly HPV-negative
      biopsies were also reanalyzed by a sandwich procedure in
      which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for
      histological review, while the inner sections are assayed by
      three different HPV PCR assays targeting different open
      reading frames (ORFs). No significant difference was found in
      serology for HPV 16 proteins between the cases that were
      originally HPV PCR-negative and -positive. Type-specific E7
      PCR for 14 high-risk HPV types detected HPV DNA in 38 (69 per
      cent) of the 55 originally HPV-negative and amplifiable
      specimens. The HPV types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39,
      45, 52, and 58. Two (4 per cent) additional cases were only
      HPV DNA-positive by E1 and/or L1 consensus PCR. Histological
      analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were
      qualitatively inadequate. Only two of the 34 adequate samples
      were HPV-negative on all PCR tests, as against 13 of the 21
      that were inadequate ( p&lt; 0.001). <span
      class="yellow">Combining the data from this and the previous
      study and excluding inadequate specimens, the worldwide HPV
      prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99.7 per cent. The
      presence of HPV in virtually all cervical cancers implies the
      highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a
      specific cause of any major human cancer.</span> The extreme
      rarity of HPV-negative cancers reinforces the rationale for
      HPV testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical
      cytology in routine cervical screening. Copyright 1999 John
