      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Cancer of the penis is a serious health
      problem in many parts of the world. In the Western World the
      incidence of penile cancer varies from 0.5 to 1.5 per 100 000
      men. In many parts of the world, however, it is the most
      common male cancer with an incidence of 2 to 5 per 100 000,
      constituting--for example, 12% to 22% of all male cancers in
      China, Uganda, and Puerto Rico.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      The incidence is extremely low in Israel and Moslem
      countries, where neonatal circumcision or circumcision during
      childhood is practised: only nine cases of penile cancer in
      Jewish men circumcised neonatally have been reported world
      wide,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> but a higher incidence
      has been reported in Moslems, who practice circumcision at
      5-10 years of age.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision has been known to be a negative
      risk factor since the beginning of this century.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Known risk factors are phimosis and
      balanitis: phimosis has been reported in 50 to 98% of
      patients with penile cancer, and chronic suppuration and a
      history of balanitis are also very common.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4-8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Smoking in women has been accepted as a
      genuine risk factor for cervical neoplasia.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9 10</a></sup> Winkelstein hypothesized that
      smoking causes squamoepithelial cancer not only in parts of
      the body in contact with smoke (lung, larynx) but also far
      from where it makes contact (urinary bladder, cervix) but by
      means of the circulatory system.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> This hypothesis may apply to penile
      cancer, which in 98% of cases is squamoepithelial.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Human papillomavirus
      has recently been implicated as a causal agent in penile
      cancer,<sup><a href="#n12">12-16</a></sup> which suggests
      that this cancer may be a sexually transmitted
      disease,<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> with its female
      counterpart being cervical cancer.</span><sup><a
      href="#n18">18-20</a></sup> If penile cancer were sexually
      transmitted this would be reflected epidemiologically by
      measuring sexual behavior (low age at first intercourse and
      many sexual partners), as for cervical cancer.</p>

      <h4>Subjects and methods</h4>

      <p class="text2">In Sweden an average of 50 men a years are
      diagnosed as having cancer of the penis, giving an incidence
      of 1.4 per 100 000.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> All cases
      of cancer are registered at the National Cancer Registry,
      which in 1958-80 registered 1064 new cases. As the median age
      of onset in Sweden is 65 to 69 years<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> a large proportion of these patients
      were dead when we started this study. The population studied
      was all living men under 80 with cancer of the penis, who
      numbered 299. According to the regulations of the National
      Cancer Registry, the doctor who diagnosed or treated each
      patient must give her or her written permission to allow an
      interview with the patient. We traced the doctors for 247
      patients, and they all gave their permission. Three patients
      were excluded from the study because of serious brain damage
      due to cerebrovascular disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">For each patient we selected a control
      subject from the Swedish population registry. The controls
      were matched for age and geographical area. Fifteen of the
      247 controls were excluded because they had brain damage due
      to cerebrovascular disease, had recently died, or had moved
      abroad, thus giving a control group of 232 men.</p>

      <p class="text2">All 476 men in both groups, most of whom
      were aged 60-80 years, were sent a questionnaire. This
      included questions about marriage, occupation, smoking
      habits, use of snuff, history of phimosis and balanitis, age
      at first intercourse, and the number of sexual partners
      during their life. The men were particularly asked not to
      answer questions on subects about which they were not
      absolutely sure to avoid biasing the results. The
      questionnaire was coded, and only we had access to the code,
      which guaranteed total anonymity and meant that no
      identification number would be registered when the results
      were statistically analysed. In cases in which there was no
      reply to the questionnaire, a maximum of two reminders were
      sent. On the fourth occasion patients were sent a letter
      asking permission for an interview by telephone; those who
      agreed were subsequently interviewed by telephone by one of
      us.</p>

      <p class="text2">All information was entered into a computer.
      Initial significance tests were done with &chi;&sup2; or
      Student's &tau; tests as appropriate. To assess the
      simultaneous effect of all likely explanatory variables we
      analyzed multiway frequency tables. As patients were matched
      with controls in the design of the study we performed
      analyses with a logistic approach for matched data.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> Unmatched log linear analyses were
      also used, whose results were similar to those in the
      logistic analyses.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text2">The questionnaire was answered by 381 (80%)
      men, and another 43 agreed to be interviewed by telephone,
      giving a total response of 424 out of 476 (89%). A slightly
      higher proportion of patients (91%, 223) than controls (87%,
      201) agreed to be interviewed. Not all subjects were able to
      answer all the questions. The most difficult to answer were
      those concerning sexual history. Of the 424 who responded, 22
      (5%) did not know the number of sexual partners and 34 (8%)
      had forgotten how old they were when first had sexual
      intercourse. Those who could not answer either or both of
      these questions were equally distributed among patients and
      controls.</p>

      <p class="text2">Penile cancer was not associated with a
      particular occupation nor was there any significant
      difference in its distribution among different socioeconomic
      groups.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> The incidence of
      penile cancer tended to be higher among lower classes; a
      comparison of classes 1 and 2 (lower) with classes 3-5
      (higher) gave a &chi;&sup2; value of 3.73 (p=0.05). People in
      classes 1 and 2 also tended to smoke more often so that when
      socioeconomic group was controlled for smoking the
      significance of socioeconomic group vanished.</p>

      <p class="text2">An equal proportion (88%) of men in the two
      groups were or had been married (197 patients, 175 for
      controls). There was no difference in age at first
      intercourse, with a median age of 18 for both groups and an
      equal distribution in all age groups (table I). As men with
      phimosis might have had a different sexual history from other
      men age at first intercourse was controlled for phimosis.
      This did not change the findings.</p>

      <p class="text2">Only seven men with penile cancer and five
      controls said that they had never had intercourse with a
      woman (table II). On average, both groups of men had had
      intercourse with six to 10 women during their lives. There
      was no statistical difference between patients and controls,
      and this remained so when the number of sexual partners was
      controlled for phimosis.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="table1.gif" alt="Table 1" /><br />
         <img src="table2.gif" alt="Table 2" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">As would be expected, there was a much
      greater prevalance of phimosis among men with cancer of the
      penis. (table III). The relative risk of having penile cancer
      among men with phimosis was 64.6, which was a highly
      significant excess risk. The large numbers of men with a
      history of one or more episodes of balanitis was also
      significant among those with penile cancer (table IV); the
      relative risk was 9.49 for men who had experienced one or
      more episodes of balanitis. As balanitis may be difficult to
      remember (the beginnings of penile cancer could be
      misinterpreted as balanitis by patients) those who stated
      that they had suffered from balanitis more than once were
      analysed separately, but balanitis remained a strong risk
      factor for penile cancer. Balanitis could also be secondary
      to phimosis and therefore phimosis was controlled for in one
      analysis. The relative risk with balanitis then decreased to
      5.22 but was still significant (p&lt;0.001).</p>

        <img src="table3.gif" alt="Table 3" /><br />
         <img src="table4.gif" alt="Table 4" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Table V shows the distribution of smoking in
      the two groups. Smoking had a significant effect on the
      prevalence of penile cancer even when the amount of smoking
      was not considered. When smokers were grouped according to
      the number of cigarettes smoked a day we saw a clear
      dose-response relation, with smokers of more than 10
      cigararettes a day having a significantly higher risk than
      light smokers (1 to 10 cigarettes a day) (&chi;&sup2;=5.43,
      p=0.02). The relative risk of having penile cancer for
      smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day was 1.88 (95%
      confidence level 1.10 to 3.19) when compared with light
      smokers and 2.22 when compared with non-smokers.</p>

      <p class="text2">Table V shows that ex-smokers had a higher
      risk of having penile cancer than light smokers. This might
      have been because ex-smokers were not grouped according to
      the number of cigarettes that they had consumed a day. Had
      this been done ex-smokers would have been expected to have a
      relative risk closer to that of non-smokers. Thus we found a
      clear dose-response relation between smoking and penile
      cancer, but no effect of duration of smoking. This might have
      been because most men in this study had smoked for a very
      long time (88% for more than five years). We also asked about
      taking snuff but found no difference in the proportions using
      it (6%).</p>

      <center>
        <img src="table5.gif" alt="Table 5" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">We identified three risk factors, phimosis,
      balanitis, and smoking, which despite having been
      statistically controlled for significant confounding events,
      remained significantly associated with penile cancer. Our
      initial analyses also showed an association between phimosis
      and balanitis and phimosis and smoking, but not balanitis and
      smoking. We then did a logistic regression analysis,
      adjusting simultaneously for smoking, balanitis, and phimosis
      to give the genuine risk for each of those factors. For light
      smokers the risk was 0.98 (95% confidence level 0.68 to
      1.42); for smokers smoking 11 or more cigarettes a day 1.53
      (1.00 to 2.35); for men with a history of phimosis 57.4 (14.1
      to 233); and for those with a history of balanitis 2.44
      (1.03-5.78). Despite the adjustment for possible confounding
      effects of both phimosis and balanitis smoking remained a
      risk factor for penile cancer: the relative risk in smokers
      of more than 10 cigararettes a day was 1.53, but the lower
      limit of the confidence interval was 1.00.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">We interpret our
      results as supporting the hypothesis that smoking is a risk
      factor for penile cancer. The association between smoking and
      penile cancer was direct, related to the dose, and
      independent of other known risk factors, which suggests that
      smoking is a genuine causal factor.</span> By comparison with
      the cervix, where high concentrations of nicotine have been
      found in cervical mucus,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      tobacco products could become concentrated in smegma, making
      it carcenogenic, especially in men with phimosis. Castonguay
      et al showed that in rats nitrosamines specific to tobacco
      were not only excreted by the kidneys but also concentrated
      in the preputial glands.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">An alternative interpretation is possible,
      however, because, we studied only living men: theoretically
      smoking could have prolonged the lives of men with penile
      cancer, thus explaining the larger number of smokers in this
      group. This interpretation, however, seems unlikely: there is
      no other non-hormone dependent cancer in which smoking is
      known to prolong life, and smokers are known to die earlier
      than non-smokers. The prevalence of smoking would be expected
      to be higher in the group of men who had died of penile
      cancer, but the same would also apply to a control group of
      dead men, so no bias would be expected for smoking.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is no evidence that different forms of
      penile cancer exist with different aetologies. In this study
      of living men the average age of birth was 1918 and for all
      cases in Sweden from 1958 to 1980 was 1904. As penile cancer
      generally has a good prognosis, with up to 90% of patients
      surviving five years,<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> age may
      be the main factor that differs between the population
      studied here and a cumulative population of patients with
      penile cancer.</p>

      <p class="text2">This study also confirms earlier risk
      factors for penile cancer (phimosis and balanitis). Phimosis
      seems to be a genuine risk factor, which probably occurs
      through the retention of smegma because smegma is not
      retained by the group at negative risk--that is, those men
      who were circumcised during childhood. The increasing
      incidence of early circumcision and better hygienic standards
      may account for the fall in the incidence of penile cancer in
      the United States.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> In tests
      of carcinogenicity of smegma smegma from horses (which have a
      high incidence of penile cancer) was found to be carcinogenic
      in mice,<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> whereas human smegma
      was found to be carcinogenic in mice in one study<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> but not in another<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup>; in this latter study, however, only
      four mice were tested so the results are not conclusive.</p>

      <p class="text2">We did not confirm the hypothesis that
      penile cancer is a sexually transmitted disease. This may
      have been because of bias in recalling sexual history,
      although we might expect recall to be more detailed among
      patients than controls because they are more likely to try to
      remember exactly their sexual experiences. In addition, we
      instructed both patients and controls to leave questions
      unanswered if there was any shadow of doubt about their
      answers. It therefore seems plausible that penile cancer is
      not sexually transmitted.</p>

      <p class="text2">If so the theory that human papillomavirus
      is an aetiological agent may be difficult to defend. In 90%
      of cases of cervical cancer deoxyribonucleic acid from human
      papillomavirus, mainly types 16 and 18, has been isolated
      from cancer cells,<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> but it has
      been isolated from only 35 out of 85 (41%) cases of penile
      cancer tested.<sup><a href="#n12">12-16</a></sup> Rather than
      causing penile cancer human papillomavirus type 16 seems to
      cause cancer in situ (Bowen's disease)<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a> <a href="#n31">31</a></sup> or bowenoid
      papulosis.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> This may explain
      why cervical cancer is transmitted sexually and penile cancer
      is not. Of course, another type of human papillomavirus with
      other modes of transmission than sexual might cause penile
      cancer; the numbers of types of human papillomavirus isolated
      is steadily increasing and is now more than 40.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup>. Another explanation may be that
      infection with the virus is so prevalent in a normal
      population that measures of sexual behavior do not affect its
      transmission. (H zur Hausen, personal communication).</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">In summary, the results
      of this study suggest that another cancer, penile cancer may
      be caused by smoking.</span> This association between penile
      cancer and smoking can be explained biologically and is
      independent of phimosis; treatment of phimosis alone cannot
      be expected to rule out the risk caused by smoking. We could
      not, however, show that penile cancer is a sexually
      transmitted disease.</p>
