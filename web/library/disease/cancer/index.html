      <h1>Penile cancer, cervical cancer, and circumcision</h1>

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>The alleged relationship between "lack of circumcision"
      and genital cancers formerly implicated smegma or
      smegma-borne pathogens as the causative agent. Only two
      histologic studies of human smegma ever have been conducted,
      both of which found it to be perfectly harmless. Smegma is
      composed of secretions of ectopic sebaceous glands in the
      prepuce mixed with secretions of the prostate, seminal
      vesicles, mucin from the urethral glands, and desquamated
      epithelial cells.<sup><a href="#n10">10,12</a>, <a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></p>

      <p>The hypothesis that human male smegma is carcinogenic was
      first formulated in 1932 by circumcision promoter Abraham L.
      Wolbarst, M.D.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>. Wolbarst also
      believed that circumcision prevented epilepsy. (In the early
      part of the 20th Century, the paroxysm of masturbation in
      children was often misidentified as an epileptic seizure.)
      Wolbarst wrote: "[Circumcision] diminishes the tendency to
      masturbation, convulsions and other reflex phenomena of local
      irritation." Wolbarst's beliefs about circumcision were
      shared by other writers, such as Peter Remondino and Abraham
      Ravich.</p>

      <p>No laboratory or clinical research had been done on the
      subject at the time. Regardless, Wolbarst's hypothesis about
      smegma and cancer found its way into early medical textbooks.
      In the 1950s a few experiments were done to test the
      hypothesis by injecting horse smegma into wounds made in the
      backs of mice. There were clinical studies that attempted to
      induce cancer by introducing smegma subcutaneously and
      intravaginally: No carcinomas could be induced.</p>

      <p>The smegma hypothesis was finally disproven by an
      exhaustive study by Reddy<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> in
      1963. His results were: "The conviction that human smegma is
      a carcinogen could not be substantiated."</p>

      <p><a href="/library/general/preston/">Preston</a>
      established quite clearly that there was little evidence to
      support a relationship between lack of circumcision and
      penile cancer, cervical cancer, or cancer of the prostate in
      1970 but he was unable to identify the causative agent at
      that time,<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> while <a
      href="/library/general/leitch1/">Leitch</a><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> did the same in Australia.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/general/gellis1/">Gellis</a> (1978) said
      there are more deaths from circumcision than from cancer of
      the penis.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p><a href="/library/disease/cancer/boczko/">Boczko et
      al</a>. found numerous reports of penile cancer in
      circumcised men, thus conclusively disproving Wolbarst's
      false claims of protection from penile cancer by
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p>In "Circumcision: An American Health Fallacy," Edward
      Wallerstein writes<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>: "If
      infant circumcision reduces penile cancer we could expect to
      see proportionately less penile cancer in circumcising
      nations as compared to noncircumcising ones. No such
      difference is found." Wallerstein reports that, for various
      years between 1966 and 1972, the annual rate of new cases of
      penile cancer was 0.8 for the United States (which
      circumcises), and 0.5 for Finland, 0.9 for Denmark and 1.1
      for both Norway and Sweden (all of which do not). None of
      these differences is statistically significant. Further,
      within the same time frame, both France and the United States
      had the same rate, 0.3, of deaths due to penile
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p>The link between the presence of human papillovirus (HPV)
      and genital cancer was established in the 1980s.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15,17,18,19,20,21</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/hellberg1/">Hellberg <i>et
      al</i></a>. (1986) identified tobacco use as another risk
      factor for cancer of the penis. <a
      href="/library/general/poland/">Poland</a> identified the
      human papilloma virus (HPV) types 16 and 18 as the cause of
      penile and cervical cancers in 1990. Cervical cancer has
      epidemiologic similarities to venereal disease. The human
      papilloma virus is spread by sexual contact.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> DNA sequences from HPV have been
      identified in more than 50 percent of cervical cancers tested
      by 1989.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p>In February 1996, representatives of the American Cancer
      Society stated in a <a
      href="/library/statements/letters/1996-02_ACS/">letter</a> to
      the American Academy of Pediatrics:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The American Cancer Society does not consider routine
        circumcision to be a valid or effective measure to prevent
        such [genital] cancers. Research suggesting a pattern in
        the circumcision status of partners of women with cervical
        cancer is methodologically flawed, outdated and has not
        been taken seriously in the medical community for
        decades."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Penile cancer</h2>

      <p>In 1993, Christopher Maden, Ph.D., et al. reported a <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/maden/">study</a> <sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> in which 110 men with penile cancer,
      diagnosed from January 1979, to July, 1990, were interviewed.
      Of these 110 men, 22 had been circumcised at birth, 19 later
      in life, and 69 never. The majority of the men interviewed
      were intact, 37% were circumcised, and 20% had been
      circumcised as infants. In circumcised men, the cancer
      usually occurs along the line of the circumcision scar.
      Finland, where circumcision is extremely rare, has a low
      incidence of penile cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p>It is thus categorically not true that circumcision
      eliminates the risk of penile cancer, although that assertion
      has been made nonchalantly in a number of papers by Schoen,
      Wiswell, and Weiss. In fact, the data indicate that only
      other factors -- among them <a
      href="http:/library/disease/cancer/harish/">cigarette
      smoking</a>,<sup>22,30</sup> genital warts, and 30 or more
      sexual partners -- contribute to the risk of penile
      carcinoma.<sup>27</sup></p>

      <p>To paraphrase Dr. George Denniston: Cancer of the penis is
      very rare, with a lifetime risk of between 1/600 and 1/1300.
      It strikes mostly older men. Even if circumcision could
      prevent it completely (which it does not), about a thousand
      foreskin amputations would be necessary to prevent one cancer
      of the penis. A thousand infants would be mutilated, and
      several would die to prevent that one case of cancer. Who
      could scientifically advocate foreskin amputation for this
      reason?</p>

      <p>In its 1996 <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">Statement</a>,
      the Canadian Paediatric Society noted:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Cadman, Gafni and McNamee... calculated that the cost of
        circumcising 100,000 male infants is $3.8 million and that
        this maneuver would prevent only two cases of cancer of the
        penis. ... they estimated that the cost of prevention would
        be 100 times the cost of treatment.<sup>12</sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>There are many <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe1/">documented cases</a>
      of penile cancer in circumcised men. To reduce the risk of
      penile cancer, men are best advised simply to use reasonable
      hygiene, practice responsible sexual behavior, and to avoid
      handling tobacco.</p>

      <p>The history of the penile cancer myth was published by <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/fleiss/">Fleiss and Hodges</a>
      in the <i>British Medical Journal</i><sup>32</sup>.</p>

      <p>Post-circumcision cancer may occur at the circumcision
      scar.<sup>16,23</sup> The cause is unknown. One may
      hypothesize that the circumcision scar tissue is less
      resistant to penetration of HPV which then transfers DNA to
      the human cell and starting the growth of the neoplasm. More
      research is needed to determine the etiology of
      post-circumcision cancer.</p>

      <p><b>American Cancer Society.</b> The American Cancer
      Society issued a five part advisory statement on penile
      cancer in June 1999. Circumcision is not considered to be
      beneficial in <a
      href="http://www3.cancer.org/cancerinfo/main_cont.asp?st=pr&amp;ct=35">
      preventing or reducing the risk of penile cancer</a>. The ACS
      indentifies HPV, smoking, and phimosis as risk factors.
      Sexually active adult males with a non-retractable foreskin
      should have the phimotic condition treated. (See <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">phimosis</a> for
      conservative treatment options. Circumcision is outmoded as a
      treatment for phimosis.)</p>

      <p>The ACS states that penile cancer is extremely rare in
      Europe and North America. The cancer only occurs in 1 in
      100,000 men. Penile cancer usually occurs well beyond age 50,
      although it can occur earlier.</p>

      <p><b>Vaccine.</b> A newly developed human papillomavirus
      (HPV) bi-valent vaccine is expected to offer protection
      against all forms of ano-genital cancer, including penile
      cancer, when it becomes available.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>
      Circumcision does not provide protection against penile
      cancer. Even if it did, it would no longer be necessary due
      to the expected availability of a HPV vaccine. 

      <h2>Cervical cancer in partners</h2>

      <p>The hypothesis that cervical cancer is caused by smegma of
      the male foreskin was invented in 1954 by Wynder. His study
      was found to be invalid, because most of the cervical cancer
      patients in his study incorrectly reported that their
      husbands were uncircumcised. These women had no idea whether
      their husbands were circumcised or not. They gave the answer
      they thought the doctor wanted to hear. Wynder later
      recognized and admitted the error in 1960.<sup>3</sup> This
      hypothesis was formally and scientifically disproven in 1962
      by Stern.<sup>4</sup></p>

      <p>Stern and Neely examined some of the early research on
      this subject:<sup>4</sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        "Since the recommendation had been made that circumcision
        should be used as a preventative measure against cancer of
        the cervix, we sought further confirmation of this
        hypothesis. An almost ideal population was that of the well
        women attending a cancer detection facility, where the
        population was split almost equally between women whose
        husbands were circumcised and those whose husbands were
        not. The discovery rate for cancer of the cervix among
        non-Jewish women whose marital partners were circumcised
        was no different from the rate among non-Jewish women with
        noncircumcised husbands. Further, the use of a sheath
        contraceptive by the marital partner, which has an effect
        equivalent to circumcision in that the cervix is protected
        from contact with the smegma, was found not to be
        associated with rate differences for cancer of the cervix."
      </blockquote>

      <p>This study, more than the others, exposed the myth that
      the presence of a foreskin or smegma had any association with
      the incidence of cancer of the cervix. See also
      <sup>37-39</sup>.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/disease/cancer/ho1/">Ho et al</a>.
      <sup>36</sup> have established that co-factors such as
      cigaratte smoking may be necessary to advance HPV infected
      cervical epithelial cells toward a cancerous condition. <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/ho2/">Ho et
      al.</a><sup>37</sup> have also suggested that high levels of
      antioxidants in the blood serum may provide some protection,
      although more study is needed.</p>

      <p>Walboomers reported that HPV DNA is found in more than
      99.7 percent of cervical cancer cells in 1999. HPV infection
      is a necessary condition for cervical cancer.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p>The known etiologies of cervical cancer are: early onset
      of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, smoking, and
      the presence of HPV.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> Based on
      currently available evidence, it would be mistaken to suggest
      an association between cervical cancer and the presence of
      the foreskin in the male partner.</p>

      <p>The <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> published an
      article by Castelsagu&eacute; and others in 2002. That
      article purported to show that circumcision reduced the risk
      of infection to the wives of circumcised men. This article
      has experienced severe and unrelenting criticism due to
      numerous methodological flaws, its conflict with other
      published research, and other research by the <i>same
      authors</i> that showed that different types of HPV were
      found in husbands and wives.<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> Editorial problems previously had
      been reported at the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.
      The publication of this flawed article may have been the
      result of those editorial problems.</p>

      <p>See the NOCIRC <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/statements/cervical_cancer_stmt2002.php"
       target="_blank">position statement</a> for more information
      on cervical cancer and circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup></p>

      <p>Menczer reports that genetics, not male circumcision,
      limits the incidence of cervical cancer in Jewish
      women.<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup> The argument that
      Jewish women have a lower incidence of cervical cancer
      because their husbands are circumcised appears to be
      destroyed by this finding.</p>

      <p><b>Vaccine.</b> Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV)
      is a necessary condition for the formation of cervical
      cancer.<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup> A bi-valent vaccine
      that offers substantial protection from infection with HPV
      has been successfully tested.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>
      It is expected that approval of this vaccine will receive
      approval from regulatory authorities and that when it will
      greatly reduce the incidence of HPV infection, cervical
      cancer, and death when vaccination against HPV becomes
      widespread.<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup> Male circumcision
      has never been proved to offer any real protection against
      HPV infection in the female partner, but even if it did, it
      still would not be necessary because the vaccine will offer
      protection.<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>It is now clear that the major risk factors for both
      penile cancer and cervical cancer are the use of
      tobacco,<sup>22,31</sup> which spreads carcinogens throughout
      the body via the bloodstream, and the presence of the human
      papillomavirus,<sup>35</sup> which is communicated through
      sexual activity.</p>

      <p>Abraham Wolbarst's promotional claims that circumcision
      prevented penile cancer were false and mislead the medical
      community for decades.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup>
      Circumcision does not prevent penile cancer in men and it
      does not prevent cervical cancer in the female partner.</p>

      <p>However, phimosis, or a non-retractile foreskin, is a risk
      factor in adult males who are sexually active, because a
      non-retractile foreskin is more difficult to clean. There are
      many non-traumatic, non-distructive methods for <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/">conservative
      effective treatment of phimosis</a> available to the male
      with phimosis. Circumcision is neither required nor
      recommended to treat phimosis. Cancer may form on the
      circumcision scar.<sup>16,24</sup></p>

      <p>A new human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine offers protection
      against both penile and cervical cancers.<sup><a
      href="#n63">64</a></sup> Fear of cancer cannot be used to
      support the practice of male circumcision.</p>
