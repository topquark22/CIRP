        conclusively disproves the false claims made by
        circumcision promoter Abraham Wolbarst in 1932 that
        circumcision prevents penile cancer. This article probably
        accurately reflects the state of medical knowledge at the
        time. The most important risk factors for penile cancer,
        which are the presence of <a

        virus</a> and <a href="/library/disease/cancer/harish/">use

        this article was written. See <i><a
        href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">Carcinoma in Situ
        of the Penis in a 76-Year-Old Circumcised Man</a></i> for a
        more recent report on cancer in circumcised
        males.]</span></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In Wolbarst's<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> extensive
      review of 1,103 case of penile carcinoma he was unable to
      find even a single patient who had been circumcised in
      infancy. Since then there have been only eight documented
      cases of penile carcinoma in an individual circumcised in
      infancy. The following is the ninth reported case and the
      first since 1968.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Case report</h3>

      <p>A 78-year-old Jewish male appeared in the emergency room
      of Montefiore Hospital with fungating and purulent penile
      lesion in the region of the frenulum. The patient claimed
      that the lesion had been present for nearly three years and
      had failed to respond to various topical medications
      prescribed by numerous physicians. He maintained that he had
      been ritually circumcised at eight days of age, and this was
      corroborated by family members.</p>

      <p>Significant history included an open prostatectomy nine
      years earlier. The old chart was reviewed and described a
      normal circumcised penis without abnormalities.</p>

      <p>A biopsy of the penile lesion revealed squamous cell
      carcinoma. No metastases were found, and the patient
      underwent a partial penectomy. Histologic examination showed
      a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive
      zones of invasion into the spongiosum; the margins of
      resection were free of tumor.</p>

      <p>The patient recovered uneventually and was well one year
      postoperatively, after which he was lost to followup.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Comment</h3>

      <p>Circumcision is the oldest known surgical procedure,
      dating back more than 6,000 years according to Herodotus.
      Certain tribes with mother goddess figures, such as Ishtar
      and Cybele, in the ancient matriarchal religions, required
      the sacrificial offering of external male genitalia. As
      castration would have inevitably led to extinction of the
      tribe, it gave way to circumcision. The Hittites and the
      Amorites were also practicing this procedure when Abraham
      introduced mandatory ritual circumcision, in 1813 B.C. for
      all Hebrew males at the age of eight days. The ancient Hindus
      regarded the genitalia as the center of life and sacrificed
      the prepuce as a valuable offering to the gods. However, they
      no longer practice routine circumcision. Moslems continue to
      circumcise all males between 4 and 10 years of age.</p>

      <p>There have been a number of articles published on the high
      incidence of penile carcinoma in Hindus who do not practice
      routine circumcision as compared with the Moslems who
      do.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> During the Roman period,
      certain religious activities could only be performed by
      circumcised priests, but the general population was not
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Circumcision arose independently in the ancient Orient,
      Africa, and Polynesia as a pubertal or premarital rite, as
      well as a test of a man's ability to withstand pain. The
      females of certain African tribes are said to have demanded
      circumcision of their husbands, believeing that it decreased
      the sensitivity of the glans and, as a result, prolonged
      coitus. The practice gradually spread westward, and by the
      nineteenth century was well established on the European
      continent. In 1891 Remondino<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      devoted an entire book to the various aspects of circumcision
      and described the prepuce as "tight constricted, glans
      deforming, onanism producing, and cancer generating."<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>Cancer of the penis has also been recognized for thousands
      of years. Celsus recommended amputation for penile carcinoma
      with cauterization of the raw stump to control bleeding. In
      the seventeenth century, Scultetus used fire to destroy the
      tumor. The morbidity of the surgery in those days probably
      approached that for the disease itself.</p>

      <p>In this country, the incidence of penile carcinoma is
      about 1 percent of male cancers.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> However, in countries where routine
      circumcision is not practiced, its incidence has been
      reported as high as 18 percent.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      While numerous reviews since Wolbarst<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> have confirmed his observation and
      corroborated the protective effect of circumcision, it has
      become apparent that this protection decreases if the
      circumcision is performed in later life. Lenowitz and Graham
      studied this group and found penile carcinoma occurring on an
      average of 22 years after the circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> A chronic irritative state, resulting
      from years of phimosis and balanoposthitis prior to the
      circumcision, has been postulated to explain this long latent
      period.</p>

      <p>The incidence of phimosis in reviews of penile carcinoma
      ranges from 40 to 70 percent.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>
      Smegma, a sterol, produced by Tyson's glands in the
      epithelium of the retroglandular sulcus, has been implicated
      as the causative agent. It may be converted to a carcinogen
      by the action of the <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. Plaut
      and Kohn-Speyer<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> weer able to
      produce malignant skin lesions in mice, using smegma, but
      other investigators have been unsuccessful in confirming its
      carcinogenicity.</p>

      <p>In 1936, the first case of penile carcinoma in a
      circumcised Jewish male was reported by Dean.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> In this patient the neoplasm
      developed in an old scar resulting rom cautery for a venereal
      wart. Four more cases in circumcised Jewish males have been
      reported.<sup><a href="#n11">11-14</a></sup> There have also
      been three cases of penile carcinoma in gentiles who were
      reportedly circumcised in infancy.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> In four of these eight cases
      there was a history of trauma to the penis preceding the
      development of cancer.</p>

      <p>The diagnosis in our patient was made late, as in the
      other cases reported, perhaps because the disease was
      presumed not to occur in those circumcised in infancy. This
      is clearly not so. Although rare, the diagnosis must be
      considered when evaluating a penile lesion even in a
      circumcised individual.</p>

      <p>Circumcision originated with the ancient tribes, and its
      basis can hardly be considered scientific. Nonetheless,
      performing it in infancy continues to be the most effective
      prophylactic measure against penile carcinoma.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Summary</h3>

      <p>The ninth case of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in
      an individual circumcised in infancy is reported. The history
      of circumcision and its relationship to penile carcinoma is
      reviewed.</p>
