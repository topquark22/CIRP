      <blockquote>
        <p><b>OBJECTIVE&mdash;</b>To evaluate the
        clinicopathological features and response to circumcision
        in patients with plasma cell balanitis.</p>

        <p><b>SUBJECTS AND METHOD&mdash;</b>32 uncircumcised men
        with penile lesions typical of plasma cell balanitis.
        Twenty specimens were available for histopathology.</p>

        <p><b>RESULTS&mdash;</b>Lesions involved prepuce and glans
        in 17, prepuce only in 10 and in 5 were localised to glans
        alone or extended to coronal sulcus. Histopathology showed
        variable features but were consistent with the diagnosis of
        plasma cell balanitis. Haemosiderin pigment could be
        detected in only three specimens of patients with shorter
        duration of the disease. Twenty seven patients were treated
        with circumcision and no recurrence was noticed in 3 years
        of follow up.</p>

        <p><b>CONCLUSION&mdash;</b>Circumcision is an effective
        treatment modality in plasma cell balanitis. Absence of
        haemosiderin pigment in majority of tissue sections is
        difficult to explain but may be related to longer duration
        of the disease.</p>
