      <p>Summary&mdash;The clinical features of 100 cases of
      balanitis are described. The condition affects no more than
      4% of boys, is commonest during pre-school years (but rare
      prior to toilent training) and is usually associated with a
      prepuce which is partly or completely non-retractable. It
      does not cause phimosis and no single pathogen is involved.
      Most boys suffer a single episode and circumcision is
      indicated only for those with recurrent, troublesome
      attacks.</p>

      <p>Acute balanoposthitis or, more popularly, balanitis, is a
      common complaint of boys yet one which receives no more than
      cursory attention in textbooks and none in the literature
      otherwise. We make a modest attempt to remedy this
      deficiency.</p>

      <h3>Patients and Methods</h3>

      <p>We report 100 consecutive boys seen in our clinic over a
      3&frac12;-year period when a diagnosis of balanitis; 32 had
      presented directly to the Accident and Emergency Department,
      when a swab of purulent discharge from the preputial orifice
      had been obtained for bacteriological examination. In order
      to assess the incidence of the condition, we questioned 200
      consecutive boys aged 7 to 14 years passing through the
      outpatient clinic for a history of balanitis; excluded were
      those previously circumcised for other reasons.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <h4>Incidence</h4>

      <p>Of the 200 boys questioned, 3 definitely had balanitis and
      5 gave a history suggestive of the disease.</p>

      <h4>Age distribution</h4>

      <p>Most were aged 2 to 5 years; only 5 boys were not toilet
      trained. Three were under 2, 15 were either 6 or 7 and 6 were
      either 8 or 9.</p>

      <h4>Symptomatology (Table 1)</h4>

      <p>A history of purulent discharge from the preputial orifice
      was regarded as pathognomonic of balanitis; in the absence of
      this feature, a combination of redness and swelling of the
      prepuce was considered compatible with the diagnosis provided
      there was no evidence of ammonia dermatitis, allergy or
      mechanical irritation of the foreskin (&ldquo;foreskin
      fiddling&rdquo;) Among the few complaining of dysuria, other
      symptoms of urinary tract infection were lacking.</p>

      <h4>Physical signs</h4>

      <p>One patient had true phimosis. The only other finding of
      note was the state of retractability of the prepuce, which
      was non-retractable in 30 cases, partially retractable in 57
      and fully retractable in 13.</p>

</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <hr size="1" />

      <h4>Recurrence</h4>

      <p>A single attack of balanitis was recorded in 64 boys. At
      the time of writing, which extends from 0.6 to 4.1 years
      (mean 2.3) after they had been seen, only 2 have returned
      with a second episode despite a general invitation to
      reattend if there were further problems. Only a small
      minority (Table 2) had suffered 3 or more episodes.</p>

      <h4>Bacteriology</h4>

      <p>Among the 32 patients presenting acutely, culture of
      discharge from the preputial orifice showed no growth in 15
      cases, a mixed growth in 7 and a pure growth of a single
      organism in 10 (5 Staph. Aureus, 4 proteus vulgaris, 1
      Morganella morgagni).</p>

      <h4>Management (Table 2)</h4>

      <p>The usual policy was to recommend circumcision in the
      event of 2 or more episodes; 6 of the 7 boys circumcised for
      a single attack had this performed at the parents&rsquo;
      request.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>Although balantitis is a common complaint, the risk in any
      individual, uncircumcised boy appears to be no greater than
      4% and even if this is appreciably more than the 1% who
      develop true phimosis (<a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Oster, 1968</a>; <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood/">Rickwood et al.,
      1980</a>) or the very few with paraphimosis (<a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner, 1949</a>). A
      policy of routine neonatal circumcision to avoid these
      preputial complains of childhood would be difficult to
      justify. <span class="yellow">We found no evidence that
      balanitis causes phimosis.</span></p>

      <p>Diagnosis outside the acute stage cannot always be certain
      and some patients in this series may not have had true
      balanitis. Ammonia dermatitis is usually easy to exclude, but
      <span class="yellow">&ldquo;foreskin fiddling&rdquo;, a habit
      indulged in by not a few boys, may be mistaken for
      balanitis.</span></p>

      <p>The aetiology remains unresolved. <span
      class="yellow">There is no single causative pathogen, nor is
      it proven that the suppurative process is necessarily of
      bacterial origin.</span> Its rarity among boys in napkins
      suggests that some component of urine, or of its breakdown
      products (possibly) ammonia), affords protection. Beyond
      infancy, the age distribution corresponds with that period
      when the foreskin is partially or completely non-retractable
      due to persistence of preputial adhesions and there is logic
      in the proposition that this disposes to lodgement of
      pathogens beneath the foreskin. That said, the incidence of
      incomplete retractability of the foreskin in patients in this
      series was no greater than is normally found in young boys
      (Gairdner, 1949; Oster, 1968), nor is a fully retractable
      foreskin proof against balanitis. Poor personal hygiene would
      seem an obvious factor, although we are not impressed that
      this is the case.</p>

      <p>As for management, once the acute episode has been
      treated, active measures seem unnecessary for boys with a
      single attack since most will will suffer no more. For those
      with multiple episodes, we take the idiosyncratic view that
      &ldquo;preputial stretching&rdquo; and &ldquo;freeing of
      adhesions&rdquo;, with or without general anaesthesia are
      wholly useless procedures. Other surgeons are of the opposite
      persuasion and until the improbable event of a clinical
      trial, this issue, like so many in surgery, must remain more
      a matter of faith than fact. The age distribution of our
      patients indicates that balanitis is ultimately a
      self-limiting condition and most patients could probably be
      managed expectantly. Nonetheless, we consider that
      circumcision is justified for boys with recurrent balanitis
      causing appreciable discomfort.</p>
