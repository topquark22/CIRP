      <h2>Clinical Features and management of recurrent<br />
       balanitis; association with atopy and genital<br />
       washing</h2>

      <p><b>H D L Birley, M M Walker, G A Luzzi, R Bell, D
      Taylor-Robinson, M Byrne,<br />
       A M Renton</b></p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b><br />
       <i>Objective -</i> To evaluate clinical features and
      diagnostic investigations in patients with recurrent or
      unresponsive balanitis in order to institute rational
      management.</p>

      <p><i>Design -</i> Forty three patients presenting to a
      genitourinary medicine clinic with recurrent or persistent
      balanitis were studied. All patients were asked whether they
      had a history of atopic illness and about their practice of
      genital washing. All patients were investigated by taking a
      swab specimen from the preputial area for bacterial and viral
      culture and 30 underwent biopsy of the affected skin. Follow
      up was between three and six months.</p>

      <p><i>Setting</i> - Outpatient genitourinary medicine clinic,
      St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK</p>

      <p><i>Results -</i> In 31 (72%) of the patients a diagnosis
      of irritant dermatitis was made. In comparison with the
      remaining patients, they had a greater lifetime incidence of
      atopic illness and more frequent daily washing of the
      genitals with soap. <span class="yellow">For 28 (90%) of
      these patients, use of emollient creams and restriction of
      soap washing alone controlled symptoms satisfactorily.</span>
      For the remaining 12 patients, a variety of diagnoses were
      made. Biopsy proved a well tolerated and diagnostic
      investigation, but the isolation of microbial pathogens from
      preputial swabs was irrelevant to management.</p>

      <p><i>Conclusion -</i> A history of atopic illness and of the
      practice of penile washing are important aspects in the
      evaluation of patients with recurrent balanitis. Biopsy is an
      important investigation in the condition when it does not
      seem to be caused by irritant dermatitis.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b><br />
       Balanitis is a common condition. At the Jefferiss Wing
      walk-in Genitourinary Medicine clinic at St. Mary's Hospital,
      Paddington there were 2006 male attendances for conditions
      requiring treatment in a 3 month period in 1992. Of these,
      234 (11%) were diagnosed as balanitis. Furthermore, in a
      review of 100 men presenting consecutively at this clinic, 32
      had been treated for balanitis at least twice in the previous
      six months. Nevertheless, despite its frequency, this
      condition often receives scant attention. In some cases,
      there is a clearly defined cause for balanitis, for example a
      generalized skin condition for which balanitis is a
      component.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> In many cases,
      however, the cause is assumed to be fungal and the patient
      treated with repeated courses of topical antifungal creams.
      Our aim was to study patients with recurrent or stubborn
      problems in which a cause had not been identified in an
      attempt to establish a firm diagnosis and institute rational
      management.</p>

      <p>PATIENTS AND METHODS.<br />
       Forty-three consecutive patients who had had two or more
      episodes of itching or soreness of the preputial or glans
      area within the previous six months, or who had not responded
      to topical antifungal creams were recruited into the study.
      Local ethical committee approval had been granted and signed
      consent was obtained from the patients. No topical treatment
      was given for at least two weeks before assessment. Time was
      allocated for careful history taking, including a personal or
      family history of atopic disease (eczema, hayfever or asthma)
      <span class="yellow">and information about the patient's
      usual habit of genital washing.</span> Patients were examined
      for the presence of rashes both within and without the
      anogenital area and swabs were taken from the preputial sac
      for bacterial, fungal, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) culture
      by routine diagnostic methods. All patients were screened
      serologically for syphilis (VDRI and TPHA), for gonorrhoea by
      gram stain and culture of an urethral swab and for the
      presence of a purulent urethral discharge (defined as more
      than 5 neutrophils per high-power field on microscopy of an
      urethral smear). A 2 mm. pinch biopsy specimen was taken from
      an inflamed area of the prepuce or glans of 30 of the
      patients using a technique described previously.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Apart from five patients, whose biopsy
      sties took up to four weeks to heal completely, the remainder
      had healed within two weeks, and there were no complications.
      Biopsy specimens were fixed in formalin, processed routinely
      and sections stained by haematoxylin and PAS were examined by
      a single histopathologist (MMW). All patients were reviewed
      monthly in the clinic for between three and six months and
      they were encouraged to self-refer in case of relapse or new
      symptoms.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b><br />
       CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS AND PREVIOUS TREATMENT<br />
       Forty-three men, mean age 35 years (range 20-77 years), of
      whom five were homosexual, were seen with balanitis that had
      been present for a mean period of 18 months (range 1-96
      months). Sixteen of the men had previously received topical
      imidazole topical steroid creams and eight topical
      preparations of combined steroid and imidazole. No patient
      had serological evidence of syphilis or a positive culture of
      microscopy for gonorrhoea. Five patients had microscopic
      evidence of a urethral discharge. All had florid balanitis at
      the time and none had detectable urethral pus on repeat
      testing two weeks later when the balanitis had settled. No
      patient had a history or signs of arthritis or conjunctivitis
      suggestive of Reiter's syndrome.</p>

      <p>HISTOLOGICAL DIAGNOSES<br />
       The results of histological analysis of biopsy specimens
      from 30 patients are shown in table 1. In specimens from 18
      patients, there was a patchy, principally perivascular
      chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis, often with
      oedema and spongiosis of the epidermis consistent with a
      diagnosis of non-specific dermatitis (NSD).<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Of the specimens from the remaining 12
      patients, four had histological evidence of human
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including hyper-keratosis and
      para-keratosis as well as koilocytosis; additional dyplastic
      changes were observed in two of these (PIN1 and PIN2). A
      variety of other diagnoses based on histological changes,
      were ascribed to the remaining eight patients.</p>

      <p>MICROBIOLOGICAL FINDINGS<br />
       The results of the microbiological investigations are shown
      in table 2. Organisms which are usually not found in the
      normal skin flora were cultured from some of the preputial
      swabs. Thus, various streptococci were isolated from three
      patients with a histological diagnoses of NSD and
      <i>Staphyloccus aureus</i> with herpes simplex virus from the
      fourth NSD patient. <i>Candida albicans</i> was recovered
      from the swab of the patient whose balanitis was ascribed to
      this organism and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and herpes
      simplex virus from the patient with plasma cell balanitis. No
      organisms were cultured from the other patients who were
      biopsied or from the unbiopsied group.</p>

      <p>RELATION BETWEEN HISTOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS AND CLINICAL
      FEATURES<br />
       <i>Patients with NSD.</i> Observations on 18 patients with a
      histological diagnosis of NSD are shown in table 3. Of these,
      12 (67%) had a history of atopy, a significantly greater
      proportion than noted for patients with other histological
      diagnoses (p&lt;0.02, Fisher's exact test). In all but one of
      the former group, there was a history of frequent genital
      washing with soap or shower gel and the mean number of daily
      washings was larger in this group than in the other patients.
      In addition, 11 patients had an eczematous rash elsewhere on
      the body. Six (33%) were circumcised. In 14 of the patients,
      symptoms fluctuated with an onset within 24 hours. None of
      the other patients biopsied gave a history of fluctuating
      symptoms. Five patients ascribed relapses to sexual activity
      but had also increased their genital washing after
      intercourse.</p>

      <p><i>Patients with other histological diagnoses.</i> In the
      remaining 12 patients who were subjected to biopsy, the
      histological examination provided a specific diagnosis (table
      1). Although the lower lifetime incidence of atopy and lower
      frequency of genital washing (table 3) helped to distinguish
      these patients from those with NSD, the clinical appearance
      of the rash was often not pathognomonic and other
      investigations, particularly histological examination of the
      biopsy specimen, were important in making the correct
      diagnosis.</p>

      <p>For example, in the single patient who had a proven
      diagnosis of candidal infection, <i>C. albicans</i> was
      cultured from the sub-preputial swab specimen and fungal
      hyphae were visible in the superficial epidermis of the
      biopsied skin, and in addition, glycosuria and a random blood
      glucose of 15 mM were found; the patient had previously
      unsuspected diabetes mellitus. In some cases, histological
      examination of the biopsy specimen helped to elicit
      previously undisclosed details of the history. Thus, the two
      patients with dermatitis artefacta admitted to debrading the
      glans only after being told that the the result of examining
      the biopsy specimen suggested this.</p>

      <p><b>Management of patients</b><br />
       <i>Management of patients with NSD.</i> <span
      class="yellow">Patients with a histological diagnosis of NSD
      were advised to restrict use of soap</span> and were
      prescribed emollient cream (E45 cream; Crookes products, UK)
      for use twice daily. This completely prevented further
      episodes of balanitis in all but three of the patients who
      responded to topical hydrocortisone cream 1% applied three
      times daily for one week. Two patients needed a repeat course
      of topical steroid during the period of followup.</p>

      <p>In view of the success of this regimen, and the emergence
      of clinical recognition of irritant dermatitis,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> a further 13 patients who attended the
      clinic with a similar history and rash were managed without
      recourse to biopsy. Putative pathogenic organisms were not
      isolated from the preputial sac swabs of any of these
      patients and all of them responded satisfactorily.</p>

      <p><i>Management of patients with other histological
      diagnoses.</i> Management of those patients with histological
      features other than those of NSD was often critically
      dependent upon the histological features of the biopsy
      specimen. The patient with candida balanitis was treated with
      topical imidazole cream (Clotrimazole 1%, "Canesten"; Bayer,
      UK) and was referred for further management of his diabetes.
      The two patients with dermatitis artefacta were cured
      promptly by a one week course of moderate potency steroid
      cream (Clobetasone butyrate 0.05%, "Eumovate", Glaxo, U. K.)
      and instructions to discontinue abrasion. The patient with
      plasma cell balanitis had been treated previously with oral
      anti-viral medication (acyclovir 200 mg. five times a day for
      five days). and topical neomycin ointment in view of the
      isolation of HSV and pseudomonas but showed no improvement.
      Both this patient and the patient with lichen sclerosis were
      referred for circumcision with great improvement. Both the
      patient with lichen planus and the patient with post-scabetic
      dermatitis improved over four weeks with an anti-pruritic
      cream (Crotamiton 10%, `Eurax'; Ciba Consumer, UK).</p>

      <p>The two patients with HPV-related changes and the patient
      with PIN1 on biopsy were treated with E45 cream. Although the
      patients showed no immediate relief, the symptoms and signs
      of inflammation resolved gradually over the period of
      follow-up. The patient with PIN2 had small discrete areas of
      patchy inflammatory change and these were ablated with
      diathermy with resolution of symptoms. No follow-up biopsies
      have been performed on the normal appearing skin.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b><br />
       The 43 patients in this study were a consecutive series and
      are representative of the patients attending this clinic with
      the problem of chronic or recurrent balanitis. Our
      observations indicate that this entity has multiple causes
      including metazoon, fungal and viral infections together with
      premalignancy. However, irritant dermatitis was found to be
      the most common cause. The ability to indentify the cause in
      a particular case aids rational management considerably and
      biopsy of the affected skin proved an important diagnostic
      investigation for our patients. Biopsy was also a well
      tolerated procedure in this as in previous series.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,6</a></sup> Although patients initially were
      often unsure about undergoing biopsy, many felt reassured by
      the histological diagnosis that it provided.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">A history of fluctuating episodes,
      with a rapid onset, as well as that of atopy and of zealous
      washing were predictive of a histological diagnosis of
      NSD.</span> The proportion of NSD patients with a history of
      atopy (67%) was much larger than that in the general
      population.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> It is possible that
      the balanitis was due to hypersensitivity to a specific
      allergen,<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> but <span
      class="yellow">we could ascribe it to nothing other than
      frequent soap washing.</span> Dermatological and generalised
      sensitivity to allergens encountered during sexual activity
      are well described<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> but in this
      series, washing after sexual intercourse could easily have
      explained the association.</p>

      <p>Bacterial pathogens have been implicated as a cause of
      balanitis in previous series<sup><a
      href="#n10">10,11</a></sup> and they could act as allergens,
      but in our patients it is far from clear whether the isolates
      from preputial swabs were involved in the inflammatory
      process or were merely incidental to it. The latter seems
      likely since although bacterial pathogens were isolated from
      four of the 18 patients with a diagnosis of NSD, recovery
      swiftly followed the use of emollient creams only and no
      specific further treatment was required.</p>

      <p>Circinate balanitis is associated with Reiter's sydrome
      but no biopsy specimen had histological features to suggest
      this diagnosis and no patient had arthritis or
      conjunctivitis. Five patients had more than five pus cells
      seen in a high power field of an urethral smear which is
      usually taken as evidence of urethritis. All of these
      patients had florid balanitis which resolved after two weeks
      of treatment with an emollient cream and none had pus cells
      on a further urethral smear taken at this time. Because none
      of these patients was treated with antibiotics, it is
      unlikely that any had an infection such as chlamydial
      urethritis. Instead the pus cells seen in the first smear
      were probably due to contamination from the acute
      balanitis.</p>

      <p>Circumcision, so commonly recommended in children with
      recurrent balanitis, might be of benefit in a patient whose
      balanitis relapses despite these measures,<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> and remains the principal treatment
      for specific conditions such as lichen sclerosus and plasma
      cell balanitis.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> However, in
      our series, six out of the 18 patients with NSD had been
      circumcised so the condition seems not to to confined to
      circumcised men.</p>
