    <p><font size="3"><b>1. BALANITIS</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>1.1. Introduction</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Balanitis is defined as inflammation of the
    glans penis. The condition often involves the prepuce and the
    term balano-posthitis should be used.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>1.2. Aetiology</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3">According to the different aetiology,
    balanitis can be classified into various clinical
    varieties:</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">1.2.1. Infective</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">This is the commonest cause of
    balanitis.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3">1) Candidal balanitis</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">Candidal balanitis most frequently follows
      intercourse with an infected sexual partner. However,
      infection may occur without sexual contact, usually in
      diabetic patients or patients taking oral antibiotics. The
      pathogenicity of the yeast depends on the host factors. There
      is no significant difference between carriage rate in
      circumcised and uncircumcised male although the chance of
      symptomatic infection is higher in the uncircumcised
      men.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">The clinical features include a
      non-purulent surface, a slightly scaling edge and eroded
      satellite pustules. The groins may also be affected.
      Microscopy and culture confirm the diagnosis and should be
      taken from both partners and from the anal as well as the
      genital areas.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">Recurrent candidal balanitis causes
      fissuring of the prepuce, with fibrosis and
      sclerosis.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">2) Trichomonal balanitis</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">This occurs more commonly in those with
      long prepuce. It presents as superficial or erosive
      balanitis. Phimosis may occur. More severe lesions of
      chancriform type or penile abscess are occasionally seen. The
      micro-organism may be seen by taking a specimen from the
      subpreputial sac and preparing a wet mount.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">3) Mycoplasma balanitis</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">Balanitis may accompany mycoplasma
      urethritis, either as a primary infection or secondary to
      gonorrhoea.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">4) Chlamydial balanitis</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">In men the most common manifestation
      chlamydial infection is non-gonococcal urethritis but it may
      also present as non-specific irritant balanitis.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">5) Anaerobic balanitis</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">Anaerobes may be isolated in healthy
      individuals. However, the chance of isolating the organisms
      is much higher in balanitis. Bacteroides species are the
      commonest anaerobes seen. The clinical features include
      superficial erosions, oedema of the prepuce, foul smelling
      discharge and inguinal lymphadenopathy.</font></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><font size="3">1.2.2. Irritant</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Poor hygiene, retained soap, detergent,
    retained smegma or inadequate drying may cause an irritant
    dermatitis. Contact dermatitis affects the shaft rather than
    the glans, except when medicament or contraceptives are
    involved.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">1.2.3. Traumatic</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Frictional trauma and accidental wounds cause
    fissures, erosions or localised area of erythema and oedema.
    Postcoital frenal erosions are not uncommon.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">1.2.4. Premalignant, Malignant or
    Idiopathic</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">In chronic unresolving 'balanitis', the
    following conditions should be excluded:</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3">1) Erythroplasia of Queyrat (Bowen's
      disease)</font><br />
       <font size="3">2) Extramammary Paget's disease</font><br />
       <font size="3">3) Plasma cell balanitis of Zoon</font><br />
       <font size="3">4) Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO, Lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus)</font><br />
       <font size="3">5) Circinate balanitis in Reiter's
      disease</font><br />
       <font size="3">6) Lichen planus</font><br />
       <font size="3">7) Psoriasis</font></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><font size="3"><b>1.3. Treatment</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Mild forms of balanitis respond to repeated
    cool bathing with potassium permanganate (1:8000) and the
    application of antibacterial creams, with or without weak
    corticosteroids.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">The underlying cause should be treated if
    possible. Specific remedies are available for candidal
    balanitis. Both partners should be treated concurrently. There
    is now large variety of effective anticandidal agents of the
    polyene or azole group. Ketoconazole, Itraconazole and
    fluconazole are the oral alternatives for severe cases. Cure
    rate is about 90 percent. Intestinal or urethral reservoir and
    re-infection account for the 10% failure rate of refractory
    cases.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Anaerobic balanitis responds to metronidazole
    rapidly. Trichomonas infection responds to metronidazole or
    tinidazole. Mycoplasma balanitis responds to tetracyclines in
    high dose.</font></p>

    <p>&nbsp;<br />
    <font size="3"><b>2. Bacterial Vaginosis</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>2.1. Definition</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3">It is a polymicrobial clinical syndrome
    distinguished by a disturbance of the normal microbial ecology
    of the vagina with displacement of peroxide-producing
    lactobacillary flora by a proliferation of anaerobes and
    characteristic abnormalities of the vaginal secretions but not
    characterized by an inflammatory response.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>2.2. Clinical Diagnostic
    Criteria</b></font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3">1) pH &gt;4.5</font><br />
       <font size="3">2) homogeneous vaginal discharge</font><br />
       <font size="3">3) clue cells by microscopy</font><br />
       <font size="3">4) fishy amine odour after the addition of
      10% KOH</font></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><font size="3">The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is
    established when 3 of the 4 criteria are present. The Gram
    Stain method of vaginal fluid is useful in diagnosing bacterial
    vaginosis, predicting which woman is at an increased risk of
    acquisition of bacterial vaginosis later in pregnancy, and
    identifying women at an increased risk of sexually transmitted
    disease. A positive culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is not
    diagnostic and it should not be used as a test of cure
    following treatment since many women who are colonised by
    Gardnerella vaginalis lack any objective signs of bacterial
    vaginosis.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>2.3. Clinical Features</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3">It is the commonest type of vaginal infection
    worldwide among women of reproductive age and accounts for at
    least one third of all vulvovaginal infections. Women with
    bacterial vaginosis may be asymptomatic. When they have
    symptoms, they usually complain of excessive vaginal discharge
    (whitish or grayish-white) and a fishy vaginal odour especially
    after sexual intercourse when alkaline seminal fluid causes
    volatilisation of the amines.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Conditions that are epidemiologically linked
    to bacterial vaginosis include urinary tract infection,
    cervical dysplasia, non-puerperal endometritis, pelvic
    inflammatory disease, mucopurunlent cervicitis,
    chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, premature labor and
    low birth weight. Unequivocal sexual transmission of bacterial
    vagnosis remains to be proven.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>2.4. Treatment</b></font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3">1) Oral metronidazole 500 mg bd for 1 week
      or single oral dose of 2 gm Tinidazole.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">2) Clindamycin vaginal cream once daily for
      1 week.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">3) In pregnancy, metronidazole should be
      avoided in the first trimester; an alternative drug is
      ampicillin 500 mg qid for one week orally but it is less
      effective than metronidazole.</font></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>&nbsp;<br />
    <font size="3"><b>3. OTHER GENITAL CONDITIONS</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Patients who are worried about the
    possibility of venereal diseases may inspect the genitalia
    frequently. They may notice for the first time in their life
    certain conditions of no clinical significance and for which
    require only reassurance.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3">1) Penile pearls (syn. pearly penile
      papules, papillae of the coronal sulcus or glans penis,
      hirsuties papillaris penis, coronal papilla)</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">These congenital tiny swellings look like
      early genital warts but are arranged in rows regularly around
      the coronal sulcus or scattered over the glans penis. They
      are merely hypertrophic papillae with normal epidermal
      covering. They have no clinical significance and it is
      important not to misdiagnose them as genital
      warts.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">2) Tysons glands</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">These are secretory glands which are
      symmetrically located on either side of the frenulum. They
      appear as small para-frenal papules which can easily be
      mistaken by anxious patients as genital warts.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">3) Fordyce Spots</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">This condition arises from the presence of
      ectopic sebaceous glands. It may be found under the prepuce
      and on the vulva. The lesion appear as multiple small, white
      or yellow spots in submucosa.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">4) Lymphocele (syn. sclerosing
      lymphangitis, benign transient lymphangiectasis)</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">In this condition the lymphatics in or near
      the coronal sulcus may become temporarily blocked and appear
      as worm-liked translucent masses of cartilage-like hardness.
      Some cases may follow prolonged or frequent intercourse or
      are associated with a genital lesion. However in the largest
      series reported, the majority were unexplained although the
      patients had coitus. The condition resolves within a few
      weeks and no treatment is necessary.</font></p>
