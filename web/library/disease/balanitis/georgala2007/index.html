      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Non-specific balanitis is a common
      inflammatory dermatosis with frequent relapses and
      considerable impact on male sexual life.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      pimecrolimus 1% cream in recurrent non-specific
      balanitis.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Twenty-six patients with recurrent flares
      of non-specific balanitis were randomly assigned to 1 group
      applying pimecrolimus cream 1% and 1 group applying placebo
      on the glans twice daily for 7 days. The patients were
      assessed on day 14. They were instructed to continue applying
      the agent whenever symptoms initialized for the following 90
      days and take account of the cumulative days with symptoms.
      Results: Seven out of the 11 (63.6%) patients in the
      pimecrolimus group and 1 out of 11 (9%) in the control group
      were free of all symptoms and lesions after 14 days, 3
      (27.3%) in both groups reported improvement, while 1 (9.1%)
      in the pimecrolimus and 7 (63.6%) in the control group
      remained unaffected. (&chi;<sup>2</sup> = 9.0, d.f. = 2, p =
      0.011). Days with symptoms during the 90-day follow-up period
      were 7.50 +/- 3.02 for the pimecrolimus and 17.62 +/- 4.40
      for the control group (p = 0.000064).</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Pimecrolimus 1% cream is promising in
      relieving symptoms and signs of non-specific balanitis during
      flares and controlling the disease during long-term
      follow-up. Copyright 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.</p>
