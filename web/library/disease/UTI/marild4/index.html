            <p><i>Aim:</i> To assess the possible protective effect
            of exclusive breastfeeding against first-time febrile
            urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.</p>

            <p><i>Methods:</i> Two children's hospitals and local
            child health centres in the Goteborg area, Sweden,
            participated in a prospective case-control study. In
            total, 200 consecutive cases (89M, 111F), aged 0-6y,
            presenting with first-time febrile UTI were enrolled.
            The mean +/- SD age was 0.98 +/- 1.15 y. As control
            subjects, 336 children (147M, 189F) were recruited from
            the child health centre of the case, matched for age
            and gender and included consecutively for each case
            during the first days after diagnosis. The duration of
            exclusive breastfeeding was obtained from the case and
            controls by a standardized procedure.</p>

            <p><i>Results:</i> <span class="yellow">Ongoing
            exclusive breastfeeding gave a significantly lower risk
            of infection. A longer duration of breastfeeding gave a
            lower risk of infection after weaning, indicating a
            long-term mechanism.</span> The protective role of
            breastfeeding was strongest directly after birth, then
            decreased until 7 mo of age, after which age no effect
            was demonstrated.</p>

            <p><i>Conclusion:</i> A protective role of
            breastfeeding against UTI was demonstrated. <span
            class="yellow">The study provides statistical support
            to the view that breast milk is a part of the natural
            defence against UTI.</span></p>

      <p class="text1">A previous case&ndash;control study
      indicated that cases with urinary tract infection (UTI) had a
      shorter duration of breastfeeding than controls (<a
      href="#n1">1</a>). In a similar study, breastfeeding was
      shown to occur significantly less often at the time when a
      urinary infection was diagnosed compared with age-matched
      control subjects (<a href="#n2">2</a>). It was suggested that
      the antiadhesive properties of breast milk could explain the
      protection offered by human milk (<a href="#n3">3</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">The aim of the present study was to
      investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and the
      risk of firsttime febrile UTI and to assess the relation in
      girls and boys between the duration of breastfeeding and the
      momentary risk of acquiring an infection. The intention was
      also to illustrate the findings by determining the
      probability of acquiring a urinary infection in a population
      with a known incidence rate.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="section">Patients and
      methods</span><br />
       <i>Cases</i><br />
       Eligible were children 0&ndash;6 y of age with a first-time
      symptomatic UTI attending the Paediatric Departments at the
      Hospital of M&ouml;lndal and the Queen Silvia
      Children&rsquo;s Hospital, G&ouml;teborg, Sweden. The
      inclusion criteria were: fever of <u>&gt;</u>38.5&deg;C
      within 24 h of diagnosis together with bacteriuria, defined
      by one of the following: for suprapubic aspirates, growth of
      any number of colony-forming units (cfu) per millilitre, one
      strain; for midstream samples, growth <u>&gt;</u>100000 cfu
      ml<sup>-1</sup>, one strain; for bag urine, two separate
      specimens with growth of <u>&gt;</u>100000 cfu
      ml<sup>-1</sup>, one and the same strain in both specimens.
      The children also had to be living in the uptake area of the
      two hospitals.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Control subjects</i><br />
       Controls were recruited among infants or children registered
      at the Child Health Centre of the case. They had no history
      of previous UTI or of urinary tract anomalies. The selection
      aimed at two control subjects per case, matched for gender
      and age.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Exclusion criteria</i><br />
       The following were excluded: families with language
      difficulties or other obstacles for participation; those who
      had not answered interview questions within the required time
      limit (see below); children with concomitant serious diseases
      or other major health impairment; those who declined to
      participate; and other reasons, e.g. maternal disease or
      missing records.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Background population data</i><br />
       During a 2 y period (1993&ndash;1995) the diagnostic rate of
      first-time symptomatic UTI in children below 2 y of age in
      the area was calculated to be 2.5% for girls and 2.5% for
      boys (<a href="#n4">4</a>). The present study included a
      total of 300 girls, 111 cases and 189 control subjects, and
      236 boys, 89 cases and 147 control subjects. None of the boys
      was circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Exclusive breastfeeding</i> Exclusive
      breastfeeding was defined as proposed by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) and according to the Swedish National
      Board of Health and Welfare Official statistics at the time
      of the start of the study, as complete nutrition with full
      meals of breast milk. Ingestion of small amounts of other
      food, one spoonful a day at most, to familiarize the child
      with the taste was accepted, but not a larger quantity (<a
      href="#n5">5, 6</a>).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Interview procedure</i><br />
       An experienced and specially trained paediatric nurse
      performed all the interviews (KS). Only mothers were
      questioned. Immediately after the identification of a new
      case, the nurse initiated recruitment of the corresponding
      controls. A questionnaire was sent to the case and its
      controls simultaneously before an interview by telephone. The
      answers had to be obtained within 1 mo for infants below 1 y
      of age and within 2 mo for older children. The mean number of
      days until the interview was completed was 20.6 for cases and
      23.6 for controls.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Statistics</i><br />
       Fisher&rsquo;s non-parametric permutation test (<a
      href="#n7">7</a>) was used to compare differences in
      variables characterizing cases and controls. A <i>p</i>-value
      &gt;0.05 was considered significant. The effect of gender,
      age and duration of exclusive breastfeeding on the risk of
      having UTI was studied as a hazard function of UTI by the use
      of Poisson regression models (<a href="#n8">8</a>). The
      hazard functions were assumed to be of the form exp(&beta;0 +
      &beta;1x1 + &beta;2x2 +. . .).</p>

      <p class="text2">The probability of UTI was calculated from
      the hazard function determined by the Poisson regression
      analysis. The general relationship between survival and
      hazard function was applied. Adjustment for the enrichment in
      the study population of children with UTI was performed.</p>

      <p class="text1">A full description of the statistical
      analysis is given in the appendix. Three Poisson models were
      applied to elucidate different aspects of the relation
      between breastfeeding and the risk of UTI. First, the general
      relationship was studied to show whether there was any
      preventive effect of breastfeeding on the risk of UTI (see
      Appendix, Table A1). Then, a second model was used to study
      gender differences with respect to the preventive effect (see
      Appendix, Table A2). Finally, to illustrate the importance of
      the duration of breastfeeding, a third model was used (see
      Appendix, Table A3). This last model was also applied
      repeatedly for various ages to obtain coordinates for the
      figures illustrating the risk patterns.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Ethics</i><br />
       The Research Ethics Committee of G&ouml;teborg University
      approved the study (official record no. 158-91).</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="section">Results</span><br />
       <i>Cases and control subjects</i><br />
       In total, 265 cases and 400 controls met the inclusion
      criteria, whereas 65 cases and 64 controls were excluded. In
      25 cases and 28 controls there were language difficulties, in
      26 and 27 there were missing answers, or answers were
      received too late, in 7 and 3 a serious concomitant disease
      was present, and in 7 and 6 maternal disease made questioning
      impossible. A final number of 200 cases (89M, 111F) and 336
      controls (147M, 189F) was available for evaluation. One of
      the cases had no matching control and 47 of the controls had
      no matching case. Gender was successfully matched between
      cases and controls. The mean &plusmn; SD age of cases was
      0.98 &plusmn; 1.15 y and that of controls was 0.97 &plusmn;
      1.15 y (ns).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Duration of exclusive
      breastfeeding</i><br />
       The mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding in girls at the
      time of the interview was 16 wk in cases and 18 wk in
      controls (Table 1). Corresponding figures for boys were 11
      and 12 wk. Girls had ongoing breastfeeding at the time of the
      infection in 8 (7.5%) cases and 23 (12.5%) control subjects,
      and boys in 36 (40%) and 52 (35%), respectively. The
      gender-dependent difference reflects the higher age of girls
      at the diagnosis of firsttime UTI (Table 1).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Urinary tract infection in relation to
      ongoing breastfeeding</i><br />
       By the first Poisson regression model the impact of
      breastfeeding on the risk of UTI was estimated by a hazard
      ratio, non-breastfeeding versus breastfeeding, equal to 2.30,
      95% confidence interval 1.56&ndash;3.39 (see Appendix, Table
      A1). The ratio was significantly larger than 1 (<i>p</i> &gt;
      0.001). This finding means that there was a significantly
      higher risk of UTI for babies who were not breastfed compared
      with babies of similar age with ongoing breastfeeding.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the second model (see Table A2), the
      interaction between gender and breastfeeding for the risk of
      UTI was studied. There was a general significant effect of
      gender (p = 0.0491). For girls the hazard ratio was 3.78,
      indicating an almost fourfold higher momentary risk, while it
      was 1.63 for boys, or a 63% increase for UTI for not
      breastfeeding.</p>

      <p class="text2">The hazard function of the third model was
      used to calculate the risk of acquiring a UTI in girls during
      the first 2 y of life in relation to age at weaning. In Fig.
      1. this is illustrated for two theoretical examples where
      exclusive breastfeeding is discontinued at 2 and 7 mo of age,
      respectively. If breastfeeding is ended at 2 mo of age, the
      risk of UTI is found to increase rapidly. After this, the
      risk is reduced, but remains at a higher level than in those
      discontinuing at 7 mo of age. In the latter case there is a
      momentary increase in the risk directly after weaning,
      followed by a lower risk of an infection until 2 y of
      age.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Urinary tract infection in relation to
      duration of breastfeeding</i><br />
       Using the hazard function determined by the Poisson
      regression analysis (see Table A3) and data from the
      incidence study (<a href="#n4">4</a>), the probability of
      acquiring UTI during the first 2 y of life could be
      calculated. The third model was used here to elucidate
      temporal aspects of breastfeeding in relation to the risk of
      UTI. The duration of breastfeeding has an impact on the risk
      of UTI at any moment, both while ongoing and after weaning
      until 2 y of age. The functions for girls and boys in the
      model were permutated repeatedly to obtain coordinates for
      Fig. 2. Thus, a longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding in
      girls significantly reduced the probability of UTI. This
      effect was seen for breastfeeding up to 7 mo of age and
      thereafter no additional protection could be shown. For boys,
      there was a trend in the same direction, but less marked, and
      a constant decrease with age throughout infancy.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span
      class="section">Discussion</span><br />
       In 1971 Winberg and Wessner presented a study suggesting a
      protective effect of breastfeeding against septic infection
      in newborns. The evidence was based on a case&ndash;control
      study showing a significantly higher consumption of breast
      milk in healthy controls than in the group of septic patients
      (<a href="#n9">9</a>). In studies from developing countries
      infection-related morbidity and mortality were shown to be
      lower in infants with longer duration of breastfeeding than
      in those with early weaning (<a href="#n10">10, 11</a>).
      Lactating infants have been shown to be protected against
      diarrhoea (<a href="#n12">12, 13</a>), infantile respiratory
      infections (<a href="#n14">14</a>), otitis media (<a
      href="#n15">15</a>) and other bacterial infections (<a
      href="#n16">16</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">To optimize the information about
      breastfeeding, emphasis was placed on the details in the
      interview technique. Thus, only mothers were contacted, a
      single nurse conducted all interviews, the timing was matched
      between cases and controls, and a standard protocol was used.
      In addition, there was social matching between cases and
      controls. Therefore, the authors believe that the
      breastfeeding data are valid.</p>

      <p class="text2">A protective effect of ongoing breastfeeding
      against UTI in infants was demonstrated in this study, in
      accordance with the previous pilot study (<a
      href="#n1">1</a>). In this study, it appeared that
      breastfeeding was more beneficial in girls, although there
      was a similar effect in boys. Furthermore, breastfeeding also
      had a protective effect after weaning, with long-term
      protection until 2 y of age.</p>

      <p class="text2">Population-based studies show the highest
      incidence of UTI in infancy, most often affecting males the
      first 6 mo of life, followed in older children by a female
      predominance (<a href="#n4">4, 17, 18</a>). The difference in
      mean age at diagnosis of UTI between boys and girls in this
      study is in accordance with this knowledge. Since the
      majority of infants with first-time UTI have a normal anatomy
      of the urinary tract, functional immaturity with residual
      urine, combined with insufficient function of the immune
      system, are likely to be important pathogenic factors in both
      genders. For girls, the short distance from the bladder to
      the periurethral flora is an important factor in ascending
      infections. Closeness to the bacterial reservoir may explain
      the more pronounced and longer lasting benefit from
      breastfeeding in girls, through effects on the intestinal
      flora. In infant boys, the preputial flora has been shown to
      play a pathogenic role (<a href="#n19">19</a>). Exclusive
      breastfeeding may provide protection by favouring
      colonization in the prepuce of bacteria with low virulence
      (<a href="#n20">20</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">Several mechanisms have been suggested to
      explain the preventive effect of breastfeeding against
      infections (<a href="#n21">21&ndash;23</a>). In the case of
      UTIs, there are several possibilities. A reduction in the
      risk of an ascending infection in breastfed babies has been
      associated with the presence of antiadhesive oligosaccharides
      in breast milk (<a href="#n3">3</a>), contributing to the
      selection of and intestinal colonization by low-virulence
      bacteria (<a href="#n24">24</a>). If left undisturbed by
      antibiotic treatment, the intestinal flora is quite constant
      and can provide long-term protection, which may explain the
      long-term effects found in this study. In addition,
      lactoferrin, with powerful unspecific antibacterial effects,
      is present in the urine of breastfed infants (<a
      href="#n25">25</a>). Secretory immunoglobulin A antibodies
      are also present in the urine of breastfed babies, offering
      specific protection against the bacterial antigens
      characterizing the intestinal flora shared by the child and
      the mother (<a href="#n26">26</a>).</p>
