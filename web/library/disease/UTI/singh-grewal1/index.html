      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p><b>Objective:</b> Circumcision is the most frequently
      performed surgical procedure in boys. This systematic review
      summarises the existing data about the effect of circumcision
      on the risk of urinary tract infection in boys.</p>

      <p><b>Data Sources:</b> Randomised controlled trials and
      observational studies comparing the frequency of urinary
      tract infection in circumcised and uncircumcised boys were
      identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register,
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of retrieved articles and
      contact with known investigators.</p>

      <p><b>Review methods:</b> Two of the authors independently
      assessed study quality using the guidelines provided by the
      MOOSE Statement for quality of observational studies.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Data from 402,908 children was identified
      from twelve studies (one randomised controlled trial, four
      cohort studies and seven case control studies). A random
      effects model was used to estimate a summary odds ratio (OR)
      with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Circumcision was
      associated with a significantly reduced risk of urinary tract
      infection (OR 0.13; 95%CI, 0.08-0.20; p&lt;0.001) with the
      same odds ratio (0.13) for all three study designs.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Circumcision substantially reduces the
      risk of urinary tract infection. Given a risk of UTI in
      normal boys of about 1%, the number-needed-to treat to
      prevent one urinary tract infection is 111. In boys with
      recurrent urinary tract infection or high-grade
      vesicoureteric reflux , the risk of urinary tract infection
      recurrence is 10% and 30% and the numbers needed-to-treat are
      11 and 4 respectively. <span class="yellow">Haemorrhage and
      infection are the commonest complications of circumcision
      occurring at rate of about 2% and assuming equal utility of
      benefits and harms, net clinical benefit is only likely in
      boys at high risk of urinary tract infection.</span></p>
