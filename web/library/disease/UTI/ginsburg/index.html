      <p class="text2">There have been many published reports on
      urinary tract infections (UTIs) in newborn infants.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-5</a></sup> These have involved infants who were
      either in the nursery<sup><a href="#n1">1-3,5</a></sup> or in
      a neonatal intensive care unit<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>;
      many urinary tract infections were detected by screening
      programs.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3,5</a></sup> Infections were
      more frequent in male infants (2.3 to 5:1).<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> Roentgenographic abnormalities of
      the urinary tract were detected in more male than female
      infants and the case-fatality rate was 10% in two
      studies.<sup><a href="#n1">1-2</a></sup> This experience in
      neonates is markedly different from that in older infants and
      children in whom infection occurs almost exclusively in
      females, sepsis is infrequent, and the clinical illness is
      usually uncomplicated. To our knowledge there is no
      information on when in infancy this occurs.</p>

      <p class="text2">We present data on 100 young infants who
      were hospitalized with their first known UTI. All infants had
      been considered healthy at the time of discharge from the
      nursery and were home for periods ranging from two days to
      eight months before onset of illness. The clinical and
      laboratory features of their illness are presented in order
      to emphasize several points: (1) the male predominance occurs
      only during the first three months of life; (2) positive
      blood cultures were inversely related to age and were
      uncommon after 9 weeks of age; (3) abnormal roentgenogram of
      the urinary system were found in almost half of female
      infants with UTI and rarely in male infants; and (4) all
      infants responded promptly to antibiotic therapy.</p>

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <h4>Patient Characteristics</h4>

      <p class="text2">During a 59-month period from March 1976
      through February 1981, 100 infants with acute urinary tract
      infections were admitted to hospital from the acute care
      clinic of Children&rsquo;s Medical Center or from the
      emergency room of <a
      href="http://www3.utsouthwestern.edu/parkland/realindex.html"
      target="blank">Parkland Memorial Hospital</a>, Dallas. The
      age of the patients ranged from 5 days to 8 months (mean 2.1
      months). There were 62 boys and 38 girls (Figure). Male
      infants accounted for 75% of patients in the first three
      months of life compared with 11% of patients who were 3 to 8
      months of age. Of 41 infants who were 30 days of age or
      younger, 33 (81%) were boys.</p>

      <p class="text2">The duration of illness before hospital
      admission was 48 hours or less in the majority of patients.
      Fever (63% of patients) was the most common symptom that
      prompted the parents to seek medical attention. Of the
      infants 55% were described as irritable and 38% had refused
      one or more feedings. Vomiting and diarrhea were reported in
      36% and 31% of patients respectively.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although many of the infants were described
      as &ldquo;ill-appearing&rdquo; at the time of the initial
      physical examination, there were few objective abnormal
      findings: 67 infants had a temperature of equal to or more
      than 38 C and 38 infants had temperatures of equal to or
      greater than 39 C. Abdominal distension and jaundice were
      uncommon, being present in only 8% and 7 percent of patients
      respectively. Three of 62 male infants (5%) were circumcised
      and two had primary hypospadias.</p>

      <h4>Laboratory Findings</h4>

      <p class="text2">Urine was collected from all patients by
      suprapubic aspiration catheter. Uncentrifuged urine contained
      10 or more WBCs [high power field (HPF)] in 62 (70%) of 89
      speciments examined. Bacteria were visualized in 81 stained
      urine samples including 22 of 27 that contained less than 10
      WBCs/HPF and 17 (81%) of 21 that had less than 5 WBF/HPF.
      Urine cultures from 96 patients grew equal to or
      greater100,000 colony-forming units/ml of a single bacteria
      species. The remaining four patients had urinary colony
      counts of from 40,000 to 80,000/ml; these speciments were
      obtained by suprapubic bladder aspiration. <i>Escherichia
      coli</i> was identified in 88 patients. The pathogens from
      the other 12 infants were <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (five
      infants), nonenterococcal group D <i>Streptococcus</i> (two
      infants), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (one infant),
      <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> (one infant), <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i> (one infant), <i>Entertobacter cloacae</i> (one
      infant), and <i>enterococcus</i> (one infant).</p>

      <p class="text2">Blood cultures were obtained from 91
      patients; 20 cultures (21.9%) contained a pathogen identical
      with that isolated from the urine. Positive blood cultures
      were found in 11 (31%) of 35 infants who were less than 30
      days of age, in five (21%) of 24 infants aged between 1 and 2
      months, in two (14%) of 14 infants age 2 to 3 months, and in
      one (5.5%) of 18 infants age 3 months or older. The age of
      one infant with a positive blood culture was unknown. There
      was a significant linear trend detected, suggesting a
      significant decrease in occurrence of sepsis with increasing
      age. (&chi;<sup>2</sup> = 5.24, <i>P</i> = .022 by
      &chi;<sup>2</sup> trend analysis<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup>). Sepsis occurred in 13 boys and seven
      girls; of the infants age 3 months or less, 12 (63%) were
      boys. This percentage is similar to that found in male
      infants with UTI in this age group. There was no correlation
      between fever, the initial WBC count, or presence of
      roentgenographic abnormalities and a positive blood culture.
      A lumbar puncture was performed in 88 patients and all CSF
      cultures were sterile.</p>

      <h4>Roentgenographic Studies</h4>

      <p class="text2">Roentgenograms were obtained during
      hospitalization in 86 children. In 18 patients 26
      abnormalites were identified, including unilateral reflex
      (grades 2 through 4), six patients; bilateral reflex (grades
      2 though 4), 12 patients; duplication, five patients;
      hydronephrosis, three patients (one with duplication
      ureterocele and two with ureteropelvic obstruction).
      Abnormalities were more common in girls (14/31, 45%) that in
      boys (4/55, 7%). The difference between these two groups is
      statistically significant (<i>P</i> &gt; .01 by
      &chi;<sup>2</sup> analysis). In three children the kidneys
      were not visualized by intravenous pyelography but were
      considered normal by ultrasound technique. Reflux (grades 2
      to 4) was found in 18 infants. Twelve infants had bilateral
      reflux; in nine the reflux was grade 3 or 4.</p>

      <h4>Therapy</h4>

      <p class="text2">Initial antimicrobial therapy consisted of
      ampicillin or amoxicillin and gentamicin in 73 patients,
      gentamicin alone in 25 patients, and ampicilin or amoxicillin
      in one patient each. <span class="yellow">Most patients
      became afebrile in 12 hours of receiving antimicrobial
      therapy, and repeat urine cultures at 24 to 72 hours after
      therapy were sterile in 94 of 97 infants.</span> Culture from
      two infants contained nonpathogens and the third contained
      4,000 colony forming units/ml of E. coli. Infants with
      bacteremia were usually treated with parenteral antibiotics
      for seven to ten days whereas in those with uncomplicated
      infections medication was changed to oral antibiotic therapy
      after clinical improvement and verification of sterile blood
      and CSP cultures. Fifty-eight patients, many of whom were
      discharged by the fifth hospital day, were treated with
      orally administered antibiotics at the time of discharge.
      Ampicillin or amoxicillin were the drugs most frequently used
      (32 patients) 22 infants received a sulfonamide alone or in
      combination with another drug (erthromycin in three infants
      and trimethodprim in 7 infants). Of these latter infants, 12
      (55%) were less than 2 months of age.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mean duration of hospitalization was 7.1
      days (range 3 to 19 days). Two patients who had ureteropelvic
      obstruction underwent surgery to correct the obstruction
      during their hospitalization. There were no deaths.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">In the present study male infants accounted
      for the majority of urinary tract infections in the first
      three months of life, but female infants predominated
      thereafter. This unique age susceptibility pattern cannot be
      explained by the number or type of patients seen in our
      outpatient facilities nor by changes in the method of
      obtaining or processing urine samples. Because only 5% of
      male infants in this study were circumcised, it is tempting
      to speculate that the uncircumcised male has an increased
      susceptibility to UTI. Contamination of the urine specimen
      during collection could not have played a role because all
      specimens were obtained by suprapubic bladder aspiration. To
      our knowledge there is no information on the incidence of UTI
      in circumcised as compared with noncircumcised infants.
      Although there are data in adult females that suggest that
      perineal bacteria invade the bladder by ascending the short
      urethra.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> it is generally
      believed that this does not occur in adult males, presumably
      because of the length of the urethra. Although blatant
      balanitis or phimosis was not described by the physicians who
      treated these infants, <span class="yellow">perineal hygiene
      was inadequate in many patients.</span> It is conceivable
      that the urethra of male infants is unable to prevent
      ascending infection during the first months of life and that
      perineal bacteria are present in large enough numbers at the
      meatus in uncircumcised male infants to allow attachment and
      ascension to the bladder.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP comment: Parkland Hospital is a public
      hospital that serves a large urban population. At the time
      that this study was carried out, Parkland Hospital had a
      policy of refusing to do circumcisions even if requested. The
      hospital's client population of young male infants,
      therefore, would have been almost completely non-circumcised.
      Ginsburg and McCracken's observation that only 5 percent of
      male infants were noncircumcised, therefore, should not be
      surprising and may not indicate that noncircumcised infants
      get more urinary tract infections.]</p>

      <p class="text2">Sepsis was documented in 20 of 91 infants
      from whom blood cultures were obtained. Approximately 85% of
      these positive blood cultures were infants aged more than 2
      months of age and only one of 18 infants aged more than 3
      months had sepsis. Although the proclivity for bloodstream
      infection in the very young is well known, the mechanisms
      accounting for this inverse relationship between sepsis and
      age of infants with urinary tract infection are unknown. It
      is possible that maturation of the immune system and
      development of specific local and systemic antibody to <i>E
      coli</i> antigens require several months before protection
      against blood stream invasion is accomplished. The data do
      emphasize the importance of obtaining urine and blood
      cultures on all young febrile infants with suspected UTI. The
      absence of associated meningitis in these infants, even those
      with bacteremia, suggests that lumbar punctures are
      unnecessary in infants with suspected urinary tract
      infections. However, it must be emphasized that two thirds of
      these infants were suspected of having sepsis at the time of
      admission to hospital. There is no other certain means of
      diagnosing meningitis other than by performing lumbar
      punctures in all febrile and ill-appearing infants,
      regardless of the findings on urinalysis.</p>

      <p class="text2">As in previous reports,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,10</a></sup> absence of significant pyuria did
      not rule out urinary tract infection. Less than 10 and 5
      WBCs/HPF were found in 27% and 21% of urine samples,
      respectively. Bacteria were present on stained smears of most
      of these speciments and this proved the most reliable initial
      indicator of infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Roentgenographic abnormalities were present
      in 18% of patients, 78% of whom were girls. Previous reports
      of infants and children with UTI have demonstrated that boys
      are more likely than girls to have roentgenographic
      abnormalities, particularly obstructive lesions.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a>,<a href="#n11">11-13</a></sup> The
      incidence of radiographic abnormalities in the girls in this
      study was relatively large (45%) and significantly greater
      than that (7%) in boys. One patient with ureteropelvic
      obstruction required immediate surgical intervention and
      three others with grade 4 reflux and hydronephrosis had
      surgical procedures performed on an elective basis. The
      majority of the other female infants had abnormalities that
      placed them at risk of recurrent infections and renal
      scarring.</p>

      <p class="text2">Because this study was retrospective it is
      not possible to compare the efficacy of the two antibiotic
      regimens used most commonly on admission to the hospital.
      Suspected sepsis was the admitting diagnosis in 64 (88%) of
      the 73 patients who received ampicillin and gentamicin. By
      contrast, all 27 patients who received gentamicin alone were
      hospitalized with a diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract
      infection. Regardless of the initial antibiotic regimen, all
      patients had a satisfactory clinical response to therapy.
      Considering the etiologic agents of UTI, either regimen
      should be effective as initial antimicrobial therapy in young
      infants with UTI.</p>
