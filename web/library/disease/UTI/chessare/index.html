        <b>Summary:</b> 

        <p>Recent information regarding the increased risk of
        urinary tract infections in the first year of life for
        uncircumcised boys has created confusion regarding the
        appropriate guidance to be given to parents confronting the
        circumcision issue. A decision model was built that
        addressed the question of whether or not to circumcise a
        newborn male considering the probability of a
        non-circumcised boy having a UTI in the first year of life
        (0.041), the probability of a circumcised boy having a UTI
        in the first year of life (0.002), and the likelihood of
        renal scarring from a UTI (0.075). After considering the
        morbidity associated with the procedure, all possible
        outcomes were ranked from worst to best (circumcised-renal
        pathology to uncircumcised-no infection) and given a value
        on a 0 to 1 scale. <span class="yellow">For the set of
        values assigned to the outcomes, the choice of no
        circumcision yielded the highest expected utility.</span>
        For the set of assigned utilities, sensitivity analysis
        showed that unless the probability of a UTI in the first
        year of life for an uncircumcised male was greater than or
        equal to 0.29, then <span class="yellow">non-circumcision
        was still the preferred choice.</span> The decision was
        most sensitive to the degree of aversion to the morbidity
        associated with the procedure (pain, bleeding,
        inflammation).</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>Circumcision is performed on 60% to 90% of newborn males
      in the United States.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>
      Wallerstein has estimated that 20% of circumcision in this
      country is carried out for religious beliefs. The remainder
      is done for socio-cultural and health reasons. It has also
      been pointed out that 80% of the world's population does not
      practice circumcision, with Japan, Germany, and the
      Scandinavian countries among the medically advanced societies
      opting against this procedure.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>The medical benefits of circumcision have been a topic of
      debate over the past 40 years. In 1975, the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap#1975">American Academy of
      Pediatrics Committee on the Fetus and Newborn</a> stated that
      there were no valid medical indications for circumcision in
      the neonatal period.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>In 1985, Wiswell and colleagues reported on a
      retrospective chart review of infants admitted to the
      hospital with a urinary tract infec-tion in the first year of
      life.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> They identified a
      siginificant association between circumcision status and the
      risk of UTI in boys. A non-circumcised male was 20 times as
      likely to have been admitted for a UTI as a circumcised boy.
      This finding and subsequent work done by Wiswell and Roscelli
      prompted the Academy of Pediatrics to take another look at
      the circumcision issue. In 1989, the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1989">Task Force on
      Circumcision</a> issued a new statement noting that
      circumcision had potential medical benefits and advantages as
      well as disadvantages and risks.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>This new statement implies a need to weigh the benefits
      against the risks prior to choosing circumcision for a male
      infant. However, this task is difficult in the absence of
      quantitative estimates of the likelihood of positive and
      negative outcomes and the parents values regarding these
      outcomes.</p>

      <p>Decision analysis is a tool that allows one to consider
      explicitly the uncertainties involved in a given decision and
      to place values on its eventual outcomes.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> Expected utilities can then be
      calculated for competing choices, with the decision maker
      choosing the strategy of highest anticipated benefit.
      Sensitivity analysis allows one to consider the effect of
      possible error in the assignment of values to uncertain
      parameters, and shows how varying these assigned values might
      change the eventual decision.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p>A decision model was therefore constructed to address the
      following two key questions: 1) For a set of values that a
      reasonable parent might assign to the potential outcomes,
      using the data of Wiswell and others to assign probabilities,
      what is the circumcision choice of highest expected benefit?
      and 2) How does the rate of UTI in the first year of life for
      uncircumcised males affect the decision?</p>

      <h3>Assumptions</h3>

      <p>The model assumes that renal pathology is the single
      significant untoward outcome of primary urinary tract
      infections. Wiswell and Geschke<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      found in a group of 35,929 uncircumcised male infants that
      non-circumcision was associated with death from invasive
      bacterial disease in two male infants with UTI in the first
      month of life. However, their data do not address the issue
      of causality, and neonatal UTI is generally thought to be
      acquired through hematogenous spread.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p>A second assumption of the model is that a higher rate of
      urinary tract infection is the only significant untoward
      outcome of non-circumcision in the newborn period. Penile
      cancer occurs almost exclusively in the uncircumcised male at
      a rate of eight per million.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      The low frequency of this event and the fact that a male
      would have a "second chance" as an adult to choose
      circumcision and avoid this outcome may make it reasonable to
      delete it from the model. Sensitivity analysis will be used
      to assess the effect of this assumption.</p>

      <p>The model does not directly address the issue of sexually
      transmitted diseases and circumcision due to the absence of
      prospective studies that control for confounding influences
      and to the conflicting evidence from retrospective
      data.<sup><a href="#n11">11,12</a></sup> While there are
      retrospective studies suggesting a higher risk of penile
      inflammatory conditions, such as balanitis, in uncircumcised
      males, a recent prospective study from New Zealand was unable
      to find a statistically significant higher risk of penile
      problems in uncircumcised boys in the first eight years of
      life.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Sensitivity analysis
      allows one to see the potential effect of ignoring these
      issues in the model.</p>

      <h3>The Decision Model</h3>

      <p>The model begins at a choice node or point of decision and
      goes through chance nodes where the uncertainties of events
      following the decision are represented. After each final
      branch, there is a box representing a specific outcome.</p>

      <p>The model is displayed in Figure 1. The choice of having
      or not having a circumcision is represented at the origin of
      the model. If the boy is circumcised, either things will go
      smoothly or there will be complications. In a review by
      Kaplan,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> the likelihood of
      minor complications, including bleeding, errors of omission
      and commission in tissue removal, skin bridge, infection, and
      meatitis, have ranged from 0.1% to 35%. Even though penile
      denudation and death from sepsis as a result of circumcision
      have been reported. by all accounts, major complications are
      exceedingly rare and have not been included formally in the
      model.<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> The probability of
      minor complications was set at 21.8%. Through sensitivity
      analysis one can see the effect of this potential
      overestimation on the preferred choice. A boy with a
      complication of circumcision will either have a urinary tract
      infection in the first year of life or he will not. The
      probability of a UTI in the first year of life was taken from
      the data of Wiswell <i>et al</i><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> and set at 0.2%.</p>

      <p>A circumcised male with complications and a UTI may have
      renal scarring or escape this complication. The likelihood of
      renal scaring was taken from the work of Winberg <i>et
      al</i>,<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> and set at 7.5%.</p>

      <p>The outcome box labeled Kidney scar, Complication, Pain
      represents a circumcised boy who has had some complication
      and a urinary tract infection that left him with renal
      scarring. The second outcome, labelled Infection,
      Complication. Pain," represents a circumcised boy who has had
      a complication and a UTI without scarring.</p>

      <p>Moving back to the tree branch representing a circumcised
      male with a complication but no urinary tract infection, the
      outcome represents the pain of the surgery and the
      complication.</p>

      <p>A boy who has had a circumcision without complication may
      or may not have a urinary tract infection in the first year
      of life. Once again, the data of Wiswell <i>et al</i><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> are used for the probability
      assignment.</p>

      <p>The UTI may or may not lead to scarring. These data of
      Winberg <i>et al</i><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> are
      again used for this probability.</p>

      <p>Then the next outcome state, therefore, represents a boy
      who has suffered the procedure without complications and has
      had urinary tract infection leading to renal scarring. The
      outcome box labelled "Infection, Pain" represents the
      circumcised boy without complications who has had a UTI
      without scarring.</p>

      <p>A circumcised boy without any complications may
      alternatively have no urinary tract infection. Therefore. the
      only price paid is that of the pain associated with the
      procedure.</p>

      <p>Returning to the choice node of the model, a boy who is
      not circumcised may or may not have a urinary tract infection
      in the first year of life. The data of Wiswell <i>et
      al</i><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> are used to set the
      probability of urinary tract infection in the first year of
      life at 4.1%.</p>

      <p>A non-circumcised boy having a urinary tract infection may
      or may not have a kidney scar. Once again, the probabilities
      of Winberg <i>et al</i><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> are
      used A non-circumcised boy having a urinary tract infection
      leading to a kidney scar ("kidney scar") will not have
      experienced the pain of the circumcision "Infection"
      represents the non-circumcised male with a UTI but no
      scarring. A non-circumcised male may escape a urinary tract
      infection. This outcome block is labeled "normal."</p>

      <p>The values of the hypothetical "reasonable parent" were
      set on a linear scale from 0 to 1, beginning with the worst
      outcome and ascending to the best possible outcome (Table 1).
      It should be noted that sets of parents will differ in their
      assignment of values to the outcomes. Sensitivity analysis
      will show the effect of manipulating some of these values on
      the preferred choice.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p>The expected benefit of the two choices can be calculated
      for the set of assigned values through the process known as
      "averaging out and folding back the tree."<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> This process starts at the outcome
      points and works back to the root of the tree. The value
      associated with each outcome is multiplied by the probability
      of that outcome. These averaged values of each possible
      outcome of a chance node are then added together. The sum is
      then multiplied by the probability of its occurrence, which
      is taken from the branch of the tree that precedes it. The
      process continues until the decision node is reached. The
      clinician then chooses the strategy of the highest
      anticipated benefit. Table 2 displays the calculated expected
      utilities. <span class="yellow">The choice of no circumcision
      is preferred because it give a higher expected benefit than
      the choice of circumcision.</span></p>

      <p>The model assumes that the only untoward side effect of
      noncircumcision is the risk of urinary tract infections. If
      there were other significant risks of non-circumcision, then
      the value of the "normal" state would be discounted. When the
      value of the normal state drops below 0.9098, the preferred
      choice becomes circumcision. This could occur if it were
      shown that the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and
      their side effects was significantly greater in
      non-circumcised males than in circumcised males. This would
      also apply if the rate of penile cancer was significantly
      higher and it was shown that circumcision later in life did
      nothing to prevent this outcome.</p>

      <p>Sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that parents who
      consider the pain associated with the procedure to be of
      trivial concern will choose circumcision. The decision is
      reached when the pain state is valued at 0.9867 or
      higher.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p><span class="yellow">For the set of values assigned to the
      possible outcomes, the choice of no circumcision yielded the
      highest expected benefit.</span> The preferred choice would
      remain no circumcision given this set of values, unless the
      risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life was
      at least 29% or greater.</p>

      <p>Sensitivity analysis suggests that the decision of whether
      or not to circumcise a boy hinges more on the parents' values
      regarding the pain of the procedure than on the risk of UTI.
      Parents who discount this pain as a short-lived discomfort
      may choose circumcision, while others who are bothered by the
      notion of surgery without anesthesia would opt against the
      procedure.</p>

      <p>Recommending circumcision for all newborn boys to avoid
      penile carcinoma ignores the possibility of alternative
      strategies to lower this risk and the mature male having the
      opportunity later in life to decide to have a circumcision
      with anesthesia. Data showing the failure of other strategies
      to lower the risk of penile carcinoma would lower the
      expected benefit of non-circumcision. Safe and effective
      means of anesthesia for newborn circumcision may also
      significantly affect the decision for many parents. The
      current concern regarding the AIDS epidemic and the
      suggestion that circumcision may reduce the risk of this
      disease<sup><a href="#n18">18-19</a></sup> has prompted
      further calls for circumcision for all boys. While the risk
      of AIDS attributable to non-circumcision is unknown, it is
      unlikely that it would be large enough that circumcision as a
      primary prevention strategy would have much effect.</p>

      <p>Decision analysis should not be viewed as a means of
      escape from difficult choices. Rather, it is a tool that
      forces the decision makers to consider explicitly the
      uncertainties involved, to see the effects of potential
      errors in these estimates, and to assign values to the
      outcomes of their decisions.</p>

      <p>The choice of circumcision, excluding those for religious
      beliefs or cultural reasons, must be made by well-informed
      parents and should not be dictated by the risk of urinary
      tract infection alone.</p>
