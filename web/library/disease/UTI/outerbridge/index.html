      <h2>Decreasing the risk of urinary tract infections</h2>

      <p>Dear Editor:</p>

      <p>At the 1997 meeting of the Canadian Paediatric Society
      (CPS) I listened with interest to a presentation entitled "A
      cohort study on male neonatal circumcision and the subsequent
      risk of urinary tract infection" by Doctors To, Agha, Dick
      and Feldman [1]. The data presented supported the previous
      reports in the literature of a decreased risk of urinary
      tract infection (UTI) among circumcised boys compared with
      circumcised ones, in addition they estimated that 625 boys
      would have to be circumcised to prevent one hospitalization
      for UTI in the first five years of life. This perspective
      indeed lends support to the position of the CPS that
      circumcision of newborns should not be routinely
      performed[3].</p>

      <p>While these authors did not look at the incidence of UTI
      in girls, those investigators who have done so have reported
      the incidence of UTIs in girls to be intermediate between
      that observed in circumcised and uncircumcised boys. Wiswell
      and colleagues[3] when they reviewed the records of 427,698
      infants (219,755) boys born in the United States armed forces
      hospitals between 1975 and 1979 found an incidence of UTI
      that was 10-fold higher for uncircumcised boys (1.03%) than
      for circumcised boys (0.1%). Mentioned for comparison
      purposes only and without other comment was the rate of 0.52%
      among girls. However, if we are concerned about prevention,
      should we also not be concerned about the incidence of UTI in
      girls?</p>

      <p>I am writing to express my concern that in focusing on the
      role of circumcision, we have failed to evaluate other
      potentially important suggestions that have been made
      regarding the prevention of UTIs in infancy, suggestions that
      are not sex specific! It is known that the virulence of
      <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains isolated in cases of UTI
      correlates with the ability of the strain to bind to
      uroepithelial cells [4]. For example in one series, 94% of
      infantile pyelonephritis was reported to be due to
      P-fimbriated E Coli[5]. Based on these observations Winberg
      and colleagues[4] have suggested two alternative measures for
      UTI prevention in infancy. The first is the deliberate
      colonization of infants with nonpathogenic bacteria from
      their mothers; the second is the promotion of rooming-in to
      facilitate colonization by nonpathogenic bacteria from their
      mothers. The first measure is analogous to the deliberate
      colonization of the umbilicus and nasal mucosa, which was
      undertaken to arrest epidemics of Staphyloccus aureus in the
      past[6]. The second is in keeping with current trends in
      maternal and infant care and, if effective, might prove to be
      a preventative program that actually has no added cost!</p>

      <p>Neither of these measures has ever been fully evaluated.
      One case control study [7] has looked at breast-feeding and
      UTI. In that report only 47% of 62 infants presenting with a
      UTI had been breastfed, while 82% of 62 control infants from
      a well baby clinic and 87% of 62 control infants admitted to
      a hospital because of fever had been breastfed. None of the
      control infants had a UTI (P&lt;0.001). Winberg and
      colleagues' suggestions have not otherwise been tested. The
      CPS statement "Neonatal circumcision revisited" has as one of
      its conclusions "Evaluation of alternative measures of
      preventing UTI in infancy is required"[2]. If we are truly
      concerned about prevention this needs to be done.</p>
