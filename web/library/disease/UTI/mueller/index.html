      <h2>THE INCIDENCE OF GENITOURINARY ABNORMALITIES IN
      CIRCUMCISED AND UNCIRCUMCISED BOYS PRESENTING WITH AN INITIAL
      URINARY TRACT INFECTION BY 6 MONTHS OF AGE</h2>

      <p><b>Background:</b> Numerous studies have implicated the
      presence of a foreskin as the major determinant of urinary
      tract infection (UTI) in newborn males. In the largest series
      of studies the contribution of underlying genitourinary (GU)
      structural abnormalities was not investigated. We report the
      results of an eight year prospective study examining the
      incidence of GU abnormalities in circumcised and
      uncircumcised boys who present with their first UTI by six
      months of age.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> All male infants referred to our service
      with evidence of UTI were examined. Only infants less than or
      equal to six months of age with documented positive urine
      cultures were placed into the study. We categorized each
      infant by circumcision status, presenting symptoms, and race.
      The diagnosis of pyelonephritis was established on clinical
      grounds which required the presence of systemic complaints
      such as fever, lethargy, leukocytosis, and vomiting. All
      infants were evaluated with a renal ultrasound and voiding
      cystourethrogram. Genitourinary abnormalities were determined
      by the radiologic staff. Data were analyzed for statistical
      significance with &chi;<sup>2</sup> analysis. P &lt;.05 was
      considered to be significant.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Complete information was obtained on 108
      boys. Fifty-two of the boys were circumcised and had a
      presenting age of 2.4 &plusmn; 1.7 months (mean &plusmn;
      S.D.). Fifty-six of the boys were uncircumcised and presented
      at age 2.2 &plusmn; 1.6 months. The circumcision distribution
      by race were identical. Of the patients reviewed, 78.7% were
      Caucasians, 16.7% African Americans and 4.6% were Asian and
      Hispanic combined. Clinical pyelonephritis as opposed to
      uncomplicated UTI occurred in 67% of the boys, regardless of
      circumcision status. Twenty-six of the 108 boys had normal GU
      anatomy of which 46% were circumcised and 54% were
      uncircumcised. Abnormal anatomy was demonstrated in 76.9% of
      the circumcised boys and 75% of the uncircumcised boys. There
      was no statistical difference between the two groups. A
      breakdown of the anatomical abnormalities are shown in the
      following table.</p>

_____________________________________________________

GU Abnormality               Frequency  (% of total)

Reflux                             70.0%
Obstruction                        21.0%
Triad                               4.0%
Valves                              3.0%
Bladder Diverticulum                2.0%

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Regardless of circumcision status,
      infants who present with their first UTI at 6 months or less
      are likely to have an underlying GU abnormality. <span
      class="yellow">In the remaining patients with normal
      underlying anatomy and UTI we found as many circumcised
      infants as those who retained their foreskin.</span> Male
      infants presenting prior to 6 months of age with UTI should
      be examined for contributing anatomical abnormalities.</p>
