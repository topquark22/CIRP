      <p class="text1"><span class="initialcap">I</span>nformation
      published in the last 5 years suggests a possible association
      between being uncircumcised and increased risk for urinary
      tract infection in the first year of life.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> Largely because of this data, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics convened a task force on
      circumcision, which released its findings in March of 1989.
      This group stated that circumcision "may result in decreased
      incidence of urinary tract infection. However, in the absence
      of well designed prospective studies, conclusions regarding
      the relationship of urinary tract infection to circumcision
      are tentative." They concluded: "When circumcision is being
      considered, the benefits and risks should be explained to
      parents and informed consent obtained."<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Alan Brett<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> has
      recently written an editorial entitled "How Should Practicing
      Physicians Interpret the Published Data for Patients?"
      Although his subject matter is different from that of this
      paper, in addressing the question his title poses, Brett
      offers the reader some observations and approaches that are
      highly useful here: "Intervention based on risk factors
      differs qualitatively from treatment of an already manifest
      disease. It offers specific people therapeutic manipulations
      on the basis of statistical risk, not existing illness. ...
      As long as a recommended type of behavior is at worst
      harmless, it may be ethically imposed without
      <i>unequivocal</i> proof of benefit; the possiblity of
      benefit may suffice." He notes that a strongly
      interventionist perspective may color the published findings
      of large trials, and he suggests three perspectives from
      which to interpret data to patients: (1) the relative
      differences between cases and controls, (2) the absolute
      differences between cases and controls, and (3) those without
      the morbid event and htose who, having had the intervention,
      still experience the morbid event.</p>

      <p class="text2">This general approach is used in the review
      that follows, in which the prepuce (foreskin) as a risk
      factor for urinary tract infection in male children for the
      first year of life is considered.</p>

      <h3>POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LACK OF CIRCUMCISION AND
      SYMPTOMATIC URINARY TRACT INFECTION</h3>

      <p class="text1">The available data are summarized in Table
      1. Ginsberg and McCracken<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> in
      1982 described a case series of infants 5 days to 8 months of
      age hospitalized with urinary tract infections. Sixty-two of
      these subjects were male and only three were circumcised.
      This finding led the authors to conclude that it is "tempting
      to speculate that the uncircumcised male has an increased
      susceptibility to UTI." Subsequently there has been a series
      of three papers published by Wiswell and colleagues<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> from Brooke Army Hospital and
      various other army hospitals using retrospective cohort
      methods for children hospitalized with urinary tract
      infection in the first year of life. Only crude analyses are
      persented for the comparison of urinary tract infections in
      circumcised and vs uncircumcised infants. No attempt was made
      to control for age, race, education, or income in these
      analyses. When this omission was pointed out to the authors,
      they replied that "what we found in our study population was
      that the circumcision frequency rate did not significantly
      vary between socioeconomic groups." No data have been
      produced however, to document this assertion.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <center>
      <img src="table1a.gif" alt="Table 1A" /><br />
       <img src="table1b.gif" alt="Table 1B" />
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">To be convincing, the authors would need to
      present the data with an adjustment for those socioeconomic
      factors of significance, especially in view of the report
      from the National Health Examination Survey of 6768 boys 12
      to 17 years old who were examined during the 1966-1970
      examination cycle. Circumcision rates were 75% overall, but
      there were absolute differences ranging between 30% to 60% by
      income and education and between blacks and whites.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> The role of these factors could be
      important, since other heath-seeking behaviors are quite
      likely to vary with them. For example, uncircumcised children
      from families with lower income and educational levels might
      well be brought for medical care at a later time in the
      progression of their illness, resulting in disproportionate
      hospitalization rates. It is known that not all children with
      urinary tract infections are hospitalized; in Herzog's study
      from Boston Children's Hospital,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> 19% were not. In addition, the work of
      Wiswell and colleagues does not take into account the
      possibility of differences in the health-care-providing
      behavior of physicians (eg, the use and timing of bag or
      suprapubic urine collection for diagnosis), which could
      result in different hospitalization rates between circumcised
      and uncircumcised male infants. Only population-based or
      prospective studies conducted in a manner similar to the
      study of Wettergren and others<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> can address or avoid this potential
      source of bias.</p>

      <p class="text2">The interventionist sentiment mentioned by
      Brett is apparent in the writings of the Wiswell groups. In
      the 1986 paper Wiswell and Roscelli<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> reported that there was an
      "unequivocal increase in the number of male urinary tract
      infections as the circumcision rates decreased." The actual
      rate changed from 0.26% to 0.34% in all male infants,
      comparing the 1974 to 1976 period with the 1981 to 1983
      period. The <i>P</i> value for this change based on
      chi-square is .02. It is well known, however, that if large
      enough numbers are used, statistical significance may be
      achieved when biological significance is lacking. A more
      instructive way to examine the change is achieved by
      calculating the relative risk for urinary tract infection
      over the two periods. The relative risk then becomes 1.28 for
      the increase with a 95% confidence interval of 1.09 to 1.52.
      The lower boundary of this confidence interval suggests that
      the effect, if unbiased, is small. While emphasizing the
      change in total urinary tract infection rates over time, the
      authors failed to mention a much larger apparent change in
      the rate of urinary tract infection from time 1 to time 2 in
      circumcised infants (from 0.16% to 0.07%). The resultant
      relative risk for urinary tract infection in circumcised
      infants in the second period is 0.46 with a 95% confidence
      interval of 0.33 to 0.63. Since urinary tract infection is a
      biological event in either circumcised or uncircumcised boys,
      the rate in either of those subgroups should be relatively
      constant over time. When this finding was brought to the
      author's attention, they suggested that a 0.21% rate for
      uninary tract infections in circumcised boys was aberrant and
      led to the "erroneous impression" of change mentioned
      above.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> In further analyses from
      this group the year 1874 has been dropped (see the 1987
      publication).<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Clearly by
      leaving out the 1974 year, the graphic representation of the
      data looks better. In further correspondence Wiswell<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> desccribes the US army hospitals'
      experience from 1971 to 1986. He reports that the rate of
      urinary tract infection in their series of circumcised boys
      has ranged from 0.07% to 0.13%. The rates are said to be
      "relatively constant."<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The
      rates are not constant. Two- to threefold differences in
      year-to-year rates derived from these large data sets imply
      problems with the data.</p>

      <p class="text2">Herzog,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> from
      Boston's Children's Hospital, in 1989 reports a retrospective
      case-control study in which cases were found by examining the
      results of all suprapubic and catherized urine specimens
      obtained in the emergency department as part of illness
      workup in male children up to 1 year of age. Case patients
      were defined as those with greater than 100,000 organisms per
      milliliter. Control patients were individuals with negative
      urine samples. An attempt was made to control for the effects
      of ace, race, and medical insurance source as a proxy for
      income. For 36 cases, in which none of the infants were
      circumcised, and 76 controls, the differences in the
      circumcision rates between cases and controls were highly
      significant (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). It was reported that "there
      was no significant differences to be found in the two groups
      in age, ethnic group, and type of medical insurance." In 47%
      of the cases, however, the infants were less than 3 months of
      age, while only 39% of the control patients were that young;
      47% of the case patients were Hispanic, 28% were black, and
      19% white, whereas the respective percentages for the control
      patients were 17%, 34%, and 47%; 50% of case patients were on
      Medicaid insurance compared with 33% of the control group.
      The overall numbers of subjects in this study are small, so
      none of the above differences was statistically significant;
      however, the odds ratio for non-white vs white ethnic
      differences between case patients and control patients was
      3.0 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 7.1), which suggests a
      true difference. One would be more confident of the results
      of the statistical analysis had been adjusted for age,
      ethnicity, and type of medical insurance. Another potential
      source of bias in this study was the loss of nearly one
      quarter (23%) of the potential control subjects for whom
      circumcision status could not be determined. Finally, the
      general comments about potential biases attributable to
      health-care-seeking and health-care-providing behaviors
      raised earlier are applicable to this study as well.</p>

      <p class="text2">The final piece of evidence presented in
      Table 1 is reported by Winberg et al<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> from the randomized treal of reflux
      therapy. Of the 600 children entered into the trial so far
      with urinary tract infection, 9,9% of the subjects from the
      United States are male, where most male infants are
      circumcised, and 22.7% from Europe are male, where most
      infants are not circumcised. These results of suggestive of
      the association between lack of circumcision and urinary
      tract infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another line of evidence comes from
      comparison of symptomatic urinary tract infection rates in
      different geographical areas of the world. The incidence of
      symptomatic urinary tract infections in Swedish infant boys
      is 1.2%<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> (nearly all
      uncircumcised), a rate comparable to that reported overall by
      Wiswell<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> of 1.15% for
      uncircumcised boys. Similar rates have been reported from
      Austria and Germany.<sup><a href="#n11">11,13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Work in recent years on the pathogenesis of
      urinary tract infections from a number of national and
      international sources lends plausibility to a possible
      association between lack of circumcision and urinary tract
      infection. The evidence suggests that infection is the result
      of gastrointestininal population from the environment by
      pathogenic organisms (most notably pyelonephritogenic,
      P-fimbriated <i>Escherichia coli</i>) with subsequent
      colonization of the periurethral area followed by ascending
      infection. Pyelonephriticgenic <i>E. coli</i> have been shown
      to colonize the periurethral and fecal flora in nearly 100%
      of cases of acute febrile pyelonephritis as compared with 10%
      in healthy controls.<sup><a href="#n12">12,14-19</a></sup>
      Indeed, if the gut-colonizing bacteria of the newborn are
      P-fimbriated E coli strains, nosoconomial outbreaks of
      pyelonephritis can occur.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The various lines of evidence reviewed above
      have caused Winberg and coworkers<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> to post the question, "Is the
      prepuce a mistake of nature?" They argue that a mistake is
      improbable, and propose as the explanation that one
      unphysiological intervention (circumcision) is
      counterbalancing the effect of another, namely the exposure
      to the microbial environment of the modern maternity unit.
      They base their hypothesesis on four observations. First, in
      biological settings, when the mother gives birth in the
      squatting or kneeling position, she rapidly transfers her
      largely anaerobic and non-<i>E coli</i> gut flora to the
      child during the process of delivery. Second, the child's
      gastrointestinal tract is the probable source of bacteria,
      and the male prepuce becomes heavily colonized with <i>E
      coli</i> during the first few days of life. Third, this
      colonization arises because <i>E coli</i> and P-fimbriated
      strains, in particular, bind avidly to the prepuce. Fourth,
      infantile pyelonephritis is due to a P-fimbriated <i>E
      coli</i> strain in about 90% to 97% of cases. Winberg and
      colleagues suggest two alternative approaches to the problem
      of urinary tract infections in infants aside from possible
      protection through circumcision: (1) an experimental approach
      of attempting to populate the newborn gut with less
      pathogenic bacteria while in the nursery, and (2) a practical
      approach of providing strict rooming-in to increase the
      likelihood of the baby being colonized by material strains as
      suggested by the work of Bettleheim and coworkers.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, then, the various lines of
      evidence, ranging from case series reports to retrospective
      cohort and case-control studies to international geographical
      comparisons and studies of pathogenesis, suggest an
      association between uncircumcised status and increased
      incidence of urinary tract infection. It is clear from the
      above review that these data do not constitute the
      "unequivocal proof" required by Brett before proceeding with
      an intervention that is not harmless (circumcision) directed
      to the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of
      life.</p>

      <h3>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, OR WHAT ABOUT ACQUIRED IMMUNE
      DEFICIENCY SYNDROME?</h3>

      <p class="text1">Simonsen and coworkers,<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> in attempting to explain the
      different pattern for AIDS transmission in Africa as compared
      with that of the United States, performed a case-control
      study on 340 men reporting to a sexually transmitted disease
      clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. These men had very low rates for
      homosexuality and intravenous drug use. In an analysis
      controlling for potential differences in age, marital status,
      years living in Nairobi, travel outside of Kenya, age at
      first intercourse, number of lifetime sexual partners,
      frequency of contact with prostitutes, and lack of
      circumcision, the relative risk for human immunodeficiency
      virus was 2.7 for uncircumcised men.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> According to a research news article
      in <i>Science</i> (August 1989),<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> similar studies tend to confirm
      these findings in Africa. The results in the United States
      are conflicting.</p>

      <h3>COMPLICATIONS OF CIRCUMCISION</h3>

      <p class="text1">The possible benefits of an intervention
      (circumcision) have been considered. Now to address the price
      that some individuals pay if this intervention is undertaken.
      One universal complication of circumcision is pain.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24,25</a></sup> Dixon and others<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> performed blinded Brazelton
      assessments on babies repeatedly before and after
      circumcision and uncircumcision and reported that
      circumcision results in disruptions in the children's
      behavior and recovery reactions for 24 hours or more.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Table 2 the common and more serious early
      and late complications of circumcision are portrayed. The
      complications have been grouped into three categories:
      hemorrhage, infection and surgical trauma. Surgical trauma
      includes removal of too much or too little skin, injury to
      the urethra or glans, would dehiscence, circumcision of a
      child with hypospadias, and the like. The data are based
      mainly on recent reports on circumcisions performed in the
      neonatal period. Gee and Ansell<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> reported the experience at the
      University of Washington nurseries for 5521 newborns
      circumcised at that institution from 1963 to 1972. The total
      rate of complications in this series was 1.9%. Fourteen of
      the complications in this series (0.2%) were gravely serious:
      1 life-threatening hemorrhage, 4 systemic infections, 8
      circumcisions of infants with hypospadias, and one complete
      denudation of the penile shaft. Metcalf et al,<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> at the University of Utah, using
      interviews, questionaires, and chart reviews on an outpatient
      population, got a total rate for hemorrhage, infection and
      trauma of about 4%. Harkavy<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>
      reported on 4000 circumcisions with an incidence of 0.6
      percent for "notifiable complications, mostly bleeding." It
      is not totally clear from his report what "notifiable" means,
      but the impression is that the physician had been notified
      about the particular complication. Wiswell and Geschke<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> reported on over 100,000 newborns
      from all army hospitals for the years 1980 through 1985. they
      sought only complications specifically recorded as such in
      the first month of life. Their total rate for the three
      groups of complications is about 0.19%, probably reflecting
      the stringency of he criteria and recording practices of the
      physicians involved. Late complications tend to divide
      themselves into three groups: the need for surgical revision;
      the presence of adhesions, skin bridges, and the like; and
      the occurence of meatitis. Later surgical revision, usually
      requiring general anesthesia is required approximately 1% of
      the time,<sup><a href="#n28">28,31</a></sup> as was shown in
      two studies, one in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> with a sample size of 230
      outpatients, the other in England, with a random
      population-based sample of 2428 boys.</p>

      <p>The articles cited in Table 2 give a general sense of what
      one may expect in the way of common and moderately severe
      early complications of circumcision. Extensive reviews<sup><a
      href="#n25">25,32,33</a></sup> list many more potential
      complications, but these seem to be quite rare. Death as a
      complication from newborn circumcision has been estimated to
      occur in from 1 in 24,000 to 1 in approximately
      500,000.<sup><a href="#n30">30,33</a></sup> Some
      investigators have actively sought out complications by
      interview and have recorded rates of 55%.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>

      <h3>HOW SHOULD PRACTICING PHYSICIANS INTERPRET THE PUBLISHED
      DATA FOR PATIENTS?</h3>

      <p class="text1">In Table 3 the above question is approached
      by considering a hypothetical cohort of 2000 newborn male
      infants, 1000 of whom are circumcised and 1000 of whom are
      not circumcised. If one accepts the suggestive evidence
      presented by Wiswell and others as reviewed earlier, one can
      estimate that the relative differences for these two
      subcohorts will be a possible 10-fold relative increase in
      urinary tract infections in the uncircumcised male infants in
      the first year of life.<sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> From
      the prospective of absolute differences, there will be 9 more
      urinary tract infections per 1000 newborns not circumcised.
      From the perspective of those without the morbid event (UTI),
      these data mean that 99.9% of circumcised infants will not
      experience the morbid event, while for the uncircumcised the
      figure would be 99.0%. As noted in Table 3, the absolute
      benefit (possibly 9 infants will have urinary tract infection
      prevented) is weighed against the price paid by those
      experiencing the intervention (990 individuals circumcised
      who do not get urinary tract infections plus 1 who was
      circumcised and experiences a urinary tract infection in the
      first year of life) without any benefit to them. The price
      paid by the 991 receiving no benefit depends on the rates of
      complication. Three possible rates for early (0.2% from
      Wiswell and Geschke,<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> 2% from
      Gee and Ansell,<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> 4% from
      Metcalf et al<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup>) and 1% for
      late complications have been examined.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28,31</a></sup> At the lowest rate for early
      complications (0.2) three more individuals on balance will
      have moderately severe to very severe complications from
      circumcision than will benefit from circumcision. At the
      other extreme (4% early complications), the result will be 41
      more individuals moderately or severely adversely affected by
      circumcision than the 9 who may benefit.</p>

      <p class="text2">It can be argued that the gravity of urinary
      tract infections in infancy (<u>&lt;</u>1 year of age), and
      the neonatal period(<u>&lt;</u>30 days) in particular, is so
      significant as to outweigh numerical comparisons such as
      those in Table 3. Two questions seem relevant. How common are
      neonatal urinary tract infections in uncircumcised male
      infants? From the work of Bergstrom and colleagues,<sup><a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> Wiswell and Geschke,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> and Ring and Zobel,<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> the incidence can be estimated at
      from 1.6 to 2.4/1000. This range is comparable to the yearly
      incidence rate of breast cancer or colon cancer in middle
      aged adults and is more common than neonatal hypothyroidism.
      The second question is, how serious is a neonatal urinary
      tract infection? The answer to this question is less clear.
      From the data of Wiswell and Geschke,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> the population-based mortality rate
      for uncircumcised male infants is 5.5 in 100,000 or about 1
      in 18,000. The case fatality rate for their series was 1.9%
      (2/108). Other recent population based data was not found in
      the literature. Case fatality rates for case series are
      available, however. In the pre-antibiotic era Craig<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> reported a case fatality rate of
      15%; Littlewood<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> reported a
      case fatality rate of 7.6% in a series from 1950 to 1968.
      Davies and Gothefors,<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> in
      their review of newborn infections, concluded that the
      immediate prognosis should be uniformly favorable except in
      children with serious malformations or other underlying
      conditions. In summary, neonatal urinary tract infection is
      not a common event; the prognosis in the modern era is
      potentially serious, but not easily quantifiable.</p>

      <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow"><i>Unequivocal
      proof</i> that lack of circumcision is a risk factor for
      increased urinary tract infection is currently
      unavailable.</span> "Intervention based on risk factors
      differs qualitatively from the treatment of already manifest
      disease."<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The standard to be
      met is higher; it has not been met. The behavior change
      suggested (circumcision) is not harmless and therefore cannot
      be recommended without unequivocal proof of benefit. The rate
      of non-event (no urinary tract infection) may be increased
      from 99.0% to 99.9% by circumcision. The price of a potential
      benefit to 9 in 1000 will be numerically overbalanced by the
      moderately severe to severe complications (early and late)
      even if the rate for early complication is as low as 0.2%</p>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The suggestion that the prepuce
      is not a mistake of nature Sir James Spence's pithy
      observation from Newcastle-on-Tyne seems to capture the
      message best: "Nature is a possessive mistress and whatever
      mistakes she makes about the structure of the less essential
      organs such as the brain and the stomach, and in which she is
      not much interested, you can be sure that she knows best
      about the genital organs,"<sup><a
