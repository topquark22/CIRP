      <h2>Options in antimicrobial management of urinary<br />
       tract infections in infants and children</h2>
      <b>GEORGE H. MCCRACKEN, JR, MD</b> 

      <p class="text2">The diagnosis and management of urinary
      tract infections (UTI) in infants and children are usually
      routine and outcome is generally good. Assuming those
      premises to be correct, why is it necessary to prepare a
      review of the subject?</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the bladder and upper urinary tract
      are usually sterile, urine obtained per urethra can easily be
      contaminated especially in infants and young children, by
      bacteria that colonize the urethral meatus, periurethral
      sites (e.g. prepuce of uncircumcised males) and perineum.
      Collection of sterile urine from young patients poses a
      potential problem if a plastic receptacle is used, and
      percutaneous suprapubic bladder aspiration or bladder
      catheterization is usually performed only in very young
      infants who require immediate antimicrobial therapy or in
      those in whom sterile collection of urine by bag technique is
      thought to be unlikely.</p>

      <p class="text2">Management of pediatric patients with UTI is
      confounded by inadequate follow-up to establish the
      structural integrity of the urinary system by radiographic
      techniques, to document recurrence of infection and to
      prevent renal damage. The ultimate goal of managing children
      with UTI occur most commonly in adolescence or young adult
      life, the pediatrician can mistakenly believe that the long
      term outcome of infants and children with UTI is uniformly
      excellent and that rigorous attention to details of diagnosis
      and follow-up is unnecessary.</p>

      <h3>INCIDENCE RATES</h3>

      <p class="text2">The exact rates of UTI are unknown because
      as many as 40% of infections in infants and children are
      asymptomatic (Table 1). It has been estimated that
      approximately 3% of Swedish girls and 1% of Swedish boys have
      symptomatic UTI before the age of 11 years.<sup><a

      <p class="text2">Studies conducted at <a
      href="http://www3.utsouthwestern.edu/parkland/realindex.html">
      Parkland Memorial Hospital</a> in Dallas demonstrated that
      the incidence rate of UTI in infants 6 months of age and
      younger was 1.65 cases/1000 live births in 1972 to 1975 and
      2.04 cases/1000 live births in 1977 to 1980.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> The male:female ratios were 2.7:1 and
      5:1, in the two time periods. We documented that 95% of the
      male infants with UTI were uncircumcised, even during the
      period when greater than 90% of newborn infants were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> Wiswell and
      Roscelli<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> corraborated these
      findings in a review of UTI in infants hospitalized in United
      States Army Hospitals worldwide for a 10-year period. The
      uncircumcised male had the highest rate of UTI (1.12%)
      compared with female infants (0.57%) and circumcised males
      (0.11%). <span class="yellow">Because long term outcome of
      UTI in uncircumcised males is unknown, it is inappropriate at
      this time to recommend circumcision as a routine medically
      indicated procedure.</span><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>

      <p class="text2">The first and most critical step in
      establishing the diagnosis of UTI in infants and young
      children is the method by which urine is collected. In the
      young patient care must be taken to prepare carefully the
      perineum and periurethral area for placement of the sterile
      plastic receptacle for collection of urine. In the infant the
      quickest and surest way to obtain urine for culture
      aseptically is by urethral percutaneous supra-pubic bladder
      aspiration or by catherization. These procedures avoid the
      potential problem of contaminated urine cultures that often
      result from bag specimens. Older children and adolescents can
      be instructed to collect a midstream urine specimen after
      proper cleansing of the urethral area.</p>

      <p class="text2">Demonstration of bacteria microscopically in
      the most reliable and fastest means to establish the
      diagnosis of UTI before results of urine cultures are
      available. The presence of 10<sup>5</sup> organisms or more
      per mil of urine is diagnostic of UTI. As few as 5 X
      10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> organisms/ml have been
      etiomologically associated with the frequency/dysuria
      syndrome in women.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> It is
      unknown whether these observations in adults apply to school
      girls. If 5 X 10(to the third power to 10(to the fifth power)
      colony forming units of a single genus and species per ml are
      recovered from two succesive urine cultures of a child, a
      diagnosis of UTI should be made and the patient managed
      accordingly. Cultures from urine obtained by percutaneous
      bladder aspiration or by catherization may contain fewer than
      10(to the fifth power) organisms/ml because the bacteria have
      not had sufficient time to multiply before removal of urine
      from the bladder.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Escherichia coli</i> is the most frequent
      etiologic agent of acute uncomplicated UTI in infants and
      children, accounting for 85 to 90% of all pathogens recovered
      from urine cultures. Other organisms include Group B
      streptococci, <i>Klebsiella-Enterobacter</i> species and
      occasionally enterococci. <i>Staphylococcus
      saphrophyticus</i> can cause UTI in adolescent girls.</p>

      <p class="text2">Chronic infections of UTI that occur in
      those who are receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis are
      frequently caused by enterococci, <i>Proteus</i> species,
      <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> or <i>Candida</i> species.</p>

      <h3>TREATMENT</h3>

      <p class="text2">As with other infectious diseases in
      pediatric patients, management of UTI in newborn and young
      infants is considerably different from that of older infants
      and children.</p>

      <p class="text2">Newborn and young infants; UTI in infants
      younger than 3 or 4 months are best managed in the hospital.
      In the Dallas experience approximately one-fifth of such
      infants have positive blood cultures, the incidence being
      largest in neonates; as many as one-third have positive blood
      and urine cultures.<sup><a href="#n3">3,7</a></sup> Initial
      therapy is provided with parenterally admininistered
      ampicillin and gentamycin or another of the aminoglycosides
      (Table 2). Parenteral therapy is continued until repeat urine
      cultures at 24 to 48 hours after start of therapy and blood
      cultures are sterile and the infant has improved and is able
      to take medication orally. If the infants has delayed
      improvement, of pyelonephritis is suspected clinically or
      radiographically or if there is obstruction of the urinary
      tract parenteral therapy should be continued for 7 days or
      longer.</p>

       Parenteral therapy is continued until there is

       Augmentin(a,b) 50mg/kg daily in 2 or three doses, po,
       or cephalexin, 50 mg/kg daily in 2 or 3 doses, po, or

a. Tobramycin, 4 to 6 mg/kg daily in 3 doses, or amikacin,
   15 to 22.5 mg/kg daily in 3 doses is a suitable
   alternative.

   younger than 6 weeks or to infants with jaundice.

      <p class="text2">Orally administered aminopenicillins,
      cephalosporins, and in the older infants, sulfonamides can be
      given when the above caveats are heeded and when the child is
      able to tolerate oral medication and compliance by the
      parents is assured. Selection of the most appropriate
      antibiotic is dependent on the susceptibility of the
      pathogen. Ampicillin-resistant strains of E. coli. will
      usually be susceptible to an orally administered
      cephalosporin or to Augmentin (amoxicillin plus clavulanate
      potassium. If a sulfonamide is to be administered
      sulfisoxazole or trisulfapyrimides are preferred.</p>

      <p class="text2">Older infants and children. Positive blood
      cultures occur infrequently in older infants and children
      with UTI unless infection involves the renal parenchyma. The
      principal variable in determining selection of an
      antimicrobial agent, the route of administration and duration
      of therapy is the presence clinically or radiologically of
      pyelonephritis. Most symptomatic children with pyelonephritis
      should be hospitalized and treated initially with
      parenterally administered antibiotics (Table 3). Once there
      is evidence of clinical improvement and urine and blood
      cultures are sterile, therapy can be given orally. The
      preferred drug for oral administration is
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) because of its
      excellent absorption and tissue penetration and because most
      urinary pathogens are highly susceptible to this combination
      of drugs. Exceptions include enterococci and
      <i>Pseudomonas</i> species. Children with upper UTI are best
      treated for a minimum of ten days; shorter courses of therapy
      can result in relapse of infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">When it is likely that the patient has
      cystitis, orally administered sulfonamides, aminopenicillins
      or cephalosporins are satisfactory (Table 3). In general
      those antimicrobial agents do not need to be administered
      more often than two or three times daily. The duration of
      therapy for lower UTI can be as brief as one dose or several
      days or to can be for the conventional period of 7 to 10
      days. In adult women with cystitis localized by bladder
      washout technique, single dose aminoglycoside therapy was
      shown to be effective in eradicating the pathogen.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> By contrast most of those who had
      pyelonephitis had immediate relapse of infection after single
      dose treatment. The efficacy of single dose antibiotic
      therapy for cystitis in women has been documented by
      others.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The evidence is not as
      clear for short term therapy in children. The principle
      problem of a one dose regimen in children is the uncertainty
      regarding localization of infection. There is no simple
      laboratory technique, such as the antibody coated bacteria
      test used successfully in women, that is uniformly effective
      in localizing the site of UTI in children and clinical
      features can be misleading.</p>

Pyelonephritis
       Most children with clinical and/or
          radiologic evidence of pyelonephritis should be
          treated initially with parenterally administered

       Ampicillin,(as above) and cefotaxime, 100-150 mg/kg

      <p class="text2">A methodologic review of the 14 published
      studies of short course antibiotic therapy for UTI in
      children was recently presented (Table 4).<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> There were no significant diferences
      in cure rates of UTI for short course vs. conventional
      regimens of 7 to 10 days of treatment. Because of differences
      in study designs and of insufficient numbers of patients in
      most studies, the authors of that review concluded there was
      not enough evidence to warrant routine use of short course
      antibiotic therapy in children. Subsequently Madrigal et
      al.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> published results of
      short course therapy in 82 children who received treatment
      for 1 dose or 3 days and compared results with those children
      who received a conventional 7-day course of antibiotic
      therapy (Table 5). The conclusion was that therapy for 3 or 7
      days is satisfactory for most children with uncomplicated
      UTI.</p>

      <p class="text2">We recommend that antibiotic therapy for 3
      to 7 days be used in children with uncomplicated UTI. Shorter
      courses of treatment can result in higher rates of recurrent
      infection.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Children who had
      complicated infections, including all those who had
      pyelonephitis, should receive therapy for at least 10 days.
      The critical feature of management of all children with UTI
      is adequate follow-up to identify those patients with
      structural abnormalities of the urinary system and to
      document recurrence of infection, which occurs in
      approximately one-third of patients.</p>

      <h3>RADIOLOGIC STUDIES</h3>

      <p class="text2">Because structural abnormalities of the
      urinary system are present in 20 to 30% of infants and
      children with UTI, roentgentographic evaluation should be
      performed on all males up to the age of 3 to 5 years after
      treatment of the infection. Although the criteria for
      choosing who should be studied and which procedures should be
      use differ among experts, most agree that renal sonography or
      intravenous pyelography (IVP) and a voiding cystourethrogram
      should be performed. A recent study from Haifa, Israel,
      concluded that an IVP is not necessary if ultrasonography is
      normal and the voiding cystourethrogram shows only low grade
      vesicoureteral reflux.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Renal sonography is preferred to IVP because
      the former is noninvasive and avoids the risk of radiation.
      Sonography should be performed only by radiologists who are
      experienced with the procedure in infants and children.</p>

      <h3>LONG TERM MANAGEMENT.</h3>

      <p class="text2">Recurrent UTIs occur in approximately 30% of
      children after an initial acute infection. The risk of
      recurrence increases to as high as 75% in children who have
      had three or more previous UTIs. Vesicouterual reflux has
      been reported in 29 to 50% of children with vesicouteral
      reflux and in approximately 5% of those with recurrent UTI.
      The principal goals of management are to identify in infancy
      or early childhood those patients with recurrent UTI who have
      reflux with or without renal scars and to prevent further
      renal damage and the complications associated with chronic
      renal insufficiency. The optimal means to accomplish these
      goals are controversial. In this review only antimicrobial
      prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTI in such patients
      will be addressed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Antibiotics with proved efficacy and safety
      in preventing UTI in infants and young children include
      sulfonamides (e.g. sulfisoxanole and the
      trisulfapyrimidines), nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid and
      TMP/SMX. Because emergence of resistant strains of
      Enterobacteriaceae occurs commonly during long term
      prophylaxis with the sulfonamides, these agents are not
      routinely recommended for that purpose.</p>

      <p class="text2">For many years nitrofuratoin has been
      successfully and safely used for prevention of recurrent UTI
      in infants and children. The agent is active against many of
      the organisms causing infection but is ineffective against
      <i>Pseudomonas</i> species, enterococci, and some strains of
      <i>Klebsiella-Enterobacter</i> and <i>Proteus</i>. Maximum
      bactericidal activity of nitrofurantoin occurs in acidic
      urine. Large concentrations occur in urine after oral
      administration of 1- to 2- mg/kg doses. It has been suggested
      that use of this drug be limited because of the relative high
      frequency of adverse reactions especially pulmonary, that
      occur in adolescent and adult females.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Corragio et al.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> reviewed recently the serious
      adverse reaction reports submitted to the Food and Drug
      Administration since 1953. There were 26 cases of adverse
      cases of serious reactions to nitrofuratoin in United States
      children and adolescents who were less than 20 years of age.
      Neurologic and hepatic reactions occurred in 7 and 9
      patients, respectively, which equated to 0.8 and 1.0
      cases/million uses, respectively. The total rate of serious
      adverse reactions was 3.0/million users.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> <span class="yellow">On the bases of
      these data and of clinical experience it appears that
      nitrofurantoin is a safe and effective antibiotic for
      prophylaxis in infants and children with recurrent
      UTI.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">The new fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin
      and norfloxacin) are broad spectrum antibiotics that have
      been used effectively in adults with a variety of infectious
      diseases, including UTI. They have not been approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration because of concern about
      possible toxicity to cartilage of weight-bearing joints that
      had been observed in animals with incomplete skeletal
      growth.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Naxidixic acid, the
      first quinolone antibiotic, has been used frequently in
      children with UTI without apparent adverse effect.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> Until there is additional
      information the new fluoroquinolones should not be used
      routinely in children and adolescents.</p>

      <p>TMP/SMX has been used for many years for prophylaxis of
      recurrent UTI. When used in a dosage of 1 to 2 mg of TMP-5 to
      10 mg of SMX per kg daily in one dose the agent has been well
      tolerated, safe and effective.</p>

      <p class="text2">Breakthrough urinary infections occur
      commonly in children who are receiving chemoprophylaxis.
      These infections are usually caused by enterococci, Proteus
      species of P. aeruginosa although Candida species can also
      cause UTI in this setting. Ampicillin or amoxicillin therapy
      is effective for enterococcal UTI and an aminoglycoside given
      intramuscularly once daily is usually curative for Proteus or
      Pseudomonas infection. A fluoroquinolone could be used in the
      latter situation especially in adolescent girls. With Candida
      infection it usually suffices to stop antimicrobial
      prophylaxis until the infection clears.</p>

      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

      <p class="text2">Management of infants and children with
      acute UTI must be undertaken with four major goals in mind:
      (1) the diagnosis should be properly documented to avoid
      unnecessary radiologic studies and follow-up; (2) the
      structural status of the urinary tract must be delineated by
      radiologic techniques in infancy or early childhood as a
      basis for formulating long term management; (3) children with
      structural abnormalities of the urinary system must be
      followed up for many years; (4) antibiotic therapy should be
      given for a minimum of 3 to 7 days in children with
      uncomplicated UTI and for 10 days or longer in those with
      suspected or proved pyelonephritis.</p>
