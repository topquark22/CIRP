There were many papers at ICAAC on antibiotic therapy. [ICAAC:
Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,
Washington DC, Oct. 8-10 1984.] ... Short-term antibiotic therapy
for UTI: Gilbert Madrigal and Carla Odio, a former fellow of ours,
evaluated three different regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(TMP/SMX) in children with acute urinary tract infection. Those
with more than four previous UTI episodes were excluded. Regimens
of one dose, one dose daily for 3 days and one dose daily for 7
days were equally effective in the more than 150 children studied.
Recurrence rates were from 7 to 13% in the 3 month follow-up period.
Of interest was the failure rate of from 15-22% due to TMP/SMX-resistant
coliforms. TMP/SMX is available over the counter and is mixed with
cough medicines and other nostrums in Latin countries. No wonder
there were so many resistant bugs.
