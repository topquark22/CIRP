      <h2>Breastfeeding and urinary tract infection</h2>

      <p>S<span class="sc">IR</span>,&mdash;Your May 12 editorial
      about case-control studies and the creativity of "hundreds of
      small research studies" prompts us to record an example of
      what may be further evidence of the potential of the
      case-control approach. Discussion with medical students,
      engaged in basic epidemiology training, of a <i>Lancet</i> <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/coppa/">paper</a> on breastfeeding
      and bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> led to a case-control study of
      exposure to breastfeeding and urinary tract infection (UTI)
      in infants. It is not known if human milk protects against
      UTI <sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 62 cases were all
      infants aged 0-6 months who were admitted to the university
      department of paediatrics between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31,
      1988, and whose diagnosis was UTI, confirmed by at least one
      urine culture, done in our hospital, that yielded more than
      100000 organisms/ml of a single species. The children had one
      or more of the following: failure to thrive, vomiting,
      diarrhoea, and fever. Two groups of controls -- matched by
      sex, age (within 15 days), father's occupation, geographical
      area of residence, birth order, type of delivery, and month
      of admission -- were chosen by systematic sampling. 62
      controls were seen at our well-baby clinic; they were healthy
      and no urine cultures were done (in healthy infants
      asymptomatic bacteriuria is very unusual<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup>). The other 62 controls had been
      admitted to our hospital with an acute illness and had
      negative urine cultures. None of the males, cases or
      controls, had been circumcised.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data on breastfeeding
      were complete from the clinical records of both cases and
      controls. The proportion of infants who had been put to the
      breast at all was 47% in the cases and 82% and 87% in the
      controls (p &lt; 0.001), and the mean duration of
      breastfeeding was 60, 61 and 61 days. For the purpose of
      analysis we defined an infant as breast-fed if he or she had
      had breast milk up to the day of the admission or outpatient
      visit (or at least 3 days before). The factors for which we
      matched cases and controls are not confounders for UTI
      <sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> so the table gives the results
      for the unmatched analysis; matched and unmatched relative
      risk estimates were almost identical.</p>
