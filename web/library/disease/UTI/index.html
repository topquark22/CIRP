      <h1>Circumcision and urinary tract infection</h1>

      <p>This page indexes abstracts, full text articles, and other
      material about the relationship of circumcision status and
      the risk of contracting urinary tract infection (UTI).</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a complication of
      circumcision. <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n38">38</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> They are bacterial
      infections of the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder
      and urethra). UTIs are usually associated with congenital
      abnormalities of the urinary tract.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a>
      <a href="#n27">27</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup>
      These infections can become serious if undetected, and may
      lead to permanent kidney damage. However, they are generally
      treated effectively with antibiotics.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a>,<a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p>Studies have demonstrated that <i>Escherichia coli (E.
      coli)</i> bacteria, to which the infant has no passive
      immunity, can be colonized from the glans of circumcised
      infants and those infants whose foreskins have been forcibly
      retracted, tearing the protective synechia. Although <i>E.
      coli</i> is one of the most common bacteria on the surface of
      human skin, strains found in hospitals tend to be
      particularly virulent. In infant girls UTIs generally
      originate in the colon, whereas in infant boys they originate
      from the external environment, strongly suggesting that for
      boys such infections are iatrogenic.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Premature retraction and circumcision
      expose boys to hospital strains of <i>E. coli</i> that can
      cause UTI.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p>In order for the <i>E. coli</i> bacteria to bind to the
      glans penis of the infant, it needs an entry such as
      retraction of the adherent foreskin or circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> The intact boy has two physical lines
      of defense that his circumcised counterpart lacks: the
      preputial sphincter, which closes when a boy is not
      urinating; and a protected meatus (urinary opening), which is
      often inflamed and open in circumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> In addition, the sub-preputial
      moisture contains lysosyme, which has an anti-bacterial
      action.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> Oligosaccharides
      excreted in the urine of breastfed babies prevent adhesion of
      pathogens to uroepithelial tissue.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p>In the absence of a valid medical indication for
      circumcision, it would be unethical for physicians to perform
      it.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup></p>

      <p align="center"><b>The UTI Scare</b></p>

      <p>Drs. Charles Ginsburg and George McCracken carried out a
      study of UTI in boys at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. They
      reported that 95 percent of the boys in their study were not
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Parkland Hospital
      is a public hospital for indigent patients. Although it was
      not noticed at the time, the hospital did not perform
      non-therapeutic neonatal circumcisions,<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> so most of its young male client
      population necessarily would have remained intact. The
      observation that 95 percent of the boys were not circumcised,
      therefore, signified nothing except that Parkland Hospital
      did not do unnecessary non-therapeutic circumcisions.</p>

      <p>Thomas E. Wiswell, who was a U.S. Army pediatrician, read
      this study; he was impressed by Ginsburg and McCracken's
      erroneous observations about circumcision and UTI. In a
      determined search to show an association between
      lack-of-circumcision and UTI, Wiswell <i>et al</i>
      retrospectively examined charts of a number of boys born at
      U.S. military hospitals.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a>,<a
      href="#n11">11-13</a>,<a href="#n17">17</a>,<a
      href="#n25">25</a>,<a href="#n39">39</a></sup> Intact boys
      were reported to have a slightly higher rate of bacteriuria
      (bacteria in the urine) than circumcised boys during the
      first year of life.</p>

      <p>Wiswell's sensational statistic, that circumcision
      resulted in a "ten to hundred times decrease in urinary tract
      infections in circumcised boys," has often been quoted;
      however, it is misleading. In fact, UTIs are so rare in any
      case that, using Wiswell's data, 50 to 100 healthy boys would
      have to be circumcised in order to prevent a UTI from
      developing in only one patient. (Using more recent data from
      a better-controlled study, the number of unnecessary
      operations needed to prevent one hospital admission for UTI
      would jump to 195.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup>)</p>

      <p>Wiswell's findings generated a great deal of controversy
      at the time. The prepuce (foreskin) is a protective organ,
      and one would not normally expect the removal of a healthy
      organ to reduce the risk of infections.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Nevertheless, the apparent correlation
      of intact foreskin to bacteriuria (and hence UTI) prompted
      the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to review the
      evidence available in 1989.</p>

      <p>Some points of fact:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a
          href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/littlewood1/">
          Littlewood</a> (1972) found an association of UTI with
          maternal infection, perinatal anoxia, and high or low
          birthweight.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Wiswell failed
          to account for these confounding factors, although they
          should have been known to him.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>As acknowledged in the AAP's 1989 report, "these
          studies in army hospitals are retrospective in design and
          may have methodologic flaws. For example, they do not
          include all boys born in any single cohort or those
          treated as outpatients, so the study population may have
          been influenced by selection bias." Furthermore, the
          babies in the studies were all sick and hospitalized, so
          do not represent infants in the general population.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In Wiswell's retrospective reviews of old hospital
          records, the parents of some of the intact infants may
          have been instructed to retract the foreskin and scrub
          beneath. The act of retraction involves forcible
          separation that destroys a structural defense mechanism.
          This would allow <i>E. coli</i> to invade where it could
          not before. The insertion of parents' fingers into the
          foreskin, or even the handling of the baby's penis, could
          introduce the bacteria into the preputial space of those
          uncircumcised infants.</p>

          <p>The same criticism applies to the later Wiswell
          studies and other American studies of infant UTI [Herzog,
          Roscelli] to date: None have taken care to ensure that
          there was a control group of infants whose foreskins were
          simply left alone.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The Wiswell studies considered bacteriuria as
          diagnostic of UTI. However, a positive urine culture
          alone is not necessarily indicative of symptomatic UTI
          requiring treatment.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup>
          There is a significant false-positive rate in diagnosing
          UTI when urine cultures alone are used.<sup><a
          href="#n32">32,33</a></sup> This criticism was addressed
          to some extent in Wiswell's second review.<sup><a
          href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>No information on rooming-in or breastfeeding history
          for the infants before they were hospitalized was
          recorded. Breastfeeding is preventative of UTI, and
          rooming-in with the mother may be (see below)<sup><a
          href="#n19">19</a></sup>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The hospital chart data used in the retrospective
          studies are unreliable. Hospitals frequently omit to
          record a circumcision on a baby's chart. In Atlanta,
          O'Brien found that circumcision was recorded only 84.3%
          of the time for circumcised boys.<sup><a
          href="#n34">34</a></sup> If the records used in the
          retrospective bacteriuria studies are similarly
          inaccurate, then a statistically significant number of
          the infants with bacteriuria that were claimed to be
          intact were, in fact, circumcised. This would naturally
          overstate the rate of infection in intact boys.<sup><a
          href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>It is very possible that the use of surgical
          antiseptic (to kill pathogenic organisms during the
          circumcision procedure itself) was in part responsible
          for the slight reduction in bacteriuria observed in these
          studies. This possibility was not accounted for in the
          studies.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Breastfeeding was determined in the 1990s to
          substantially reduce incidence of UTI.<sup><a
          href="#n20">20-22</a>,<a href="#n36">36</a></sup>
          Therefore breastfeeding is a major confounding factor in
          any study of the role of circumcision in UTI. The Wiswell
          studies and all other studies in the literature fail to
          control for the effects of breastfeeding. The AAP
          observes that "breastfeeding status has not been
          evaluated sytematically in studies assessing UTI and
          circumcision status."<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>A number of studies about post-circumcision UTIs, and the
      role of the surgery in possibly facilitating UTIs, were not
      able to recommend neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a>,<a href="#n24">24</a>,<a
      href="#n26">26</a>,<a href="#n37">37</a></sup> Significantly,
      a number of recent Israeli studies have reported an
      <i>increase</i> in urinary tract infection rates in the
      period following ritual circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a>,<a href="#n38">38</a>,<a
      href="#n40">40</a> <a href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <p>In a prospective study, <a
      href="/library/normal/kayaba/">Kayaba <i>et al.</i></a> found
      a zero incidence of UTI in 603 intact boys, over a range of
      ages.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> Although this study did
      not focus on UTI, the Japanese researchers concluded:
      "Awareness of these findings will eliminate unnecessary
      circumcision in boys."</p>

      <p>Moreover, studies show fairly conclusively that UTIs can
      be prevented far beyond the extent they are today. While
      hospital-borne strains of <i>E. coli</i> can attach to the
      glans and enter the urethra of circumcised boys and those
      whose foreskins have been retracted, infection can be
      resisted by certain measures to enhance the immunity of the
      infant to such pathogens:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Breastfeeding plays a central role in preventing
          UTIs.<sup><a href="#n19">19-21</a>,<a
          href="#n36">36</a>,<a href="#n58">58,59</a></sup></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Rooming-in permits colonization of the infant's skin
          and mucosa with the mother's own bacteria. The prepuce
          and other skin and mucosa of the infant should be
          specifically brought into contact with the mother's own
          skin to pass along her flora and initiate the child's
          natural immunity.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> <sup><a
          href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Recently, <a href="/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">Fleiss
      <i>et al.</i></a> reviewed the immunological functions of the
      prepuce.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> These functions
      suggest that the intact prepuce may offer protection against
      UTI if undisturbed.</p>

      <p><b>Recurrent UTI.</b> Some doctors recommend circumcision
      in cases of recurrent UTI. However, there is no medical
      evidence to support this recommendation. Recurrent UTIs are
      associated with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary
      tract.<sup><a href="#n5">5,</a><a href="#n15">15</a>,<a
      href="#n28">28</a>,<a href="#n32">32</a>,<a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> McCracken recommends investigation
      with radiographic and/or sonography.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> In addition, a recent study of mice
      indicates that p-fimbriated <i>Escherichia Coli</i>, the
      organism responsible for about 85 percent of UTI, is capable
      of burrowing into the deeper tissue of the bladder<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> or forming pods,<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup> thus hiding from antibiotics.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> Recurrent infections may actually be
      recurrence of the original infection, rather than a new
      infection ascending from the external genitals. If <i>E.
      Coli</i> behaves in a similar manner in humans, then
      circumcision would be of no benefit in preventing recurrence
      of these infections.</p>

      <p><b>Congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract.</b> The
      term <i>vesicoureteral [ureterovesical] reflux</i> refers to
      backflow of urine from the bladder to the ureters or kidneys.
      <i>Ureteropelvic obstruction</i> is a blockage or narrowing
      of part of the urinary tract. These kinds of congenital
      abnormalities are known to be the root cause of most UTI, as
      they may allow pathogens to flow upstream within the urinary
      tract. Obviously circumcision cannot prevent any such
      conditions. See <a target="_blank"
      href="http://hora.cpmc.columbia.edu/texts/guide/hmg10_0003.html">
      Disorders of the Genitourinary Tract</a> at Columbia
      University for more information.</p>

      <p><b>Comparison of UTI incidence in boys and girls.</b> A
      recent Scandinavian study found that girls and boys have
      about the same incidence of UTI in the first year of life.
      Girls have a four times higher incidence of UTI in the first
      six years of life than non-circumcised boys. No special
      concern is manifested regarding this much higher rate of
      infection in girls, yet surgery has not been proposed to
      reduce the incidence of UTI in girls.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup></p>

      <h3>National Institutes of Health Recommendation</h3>

      <p>The National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Clearinghouse
      (NKUDIC), a service of the National Institutes of Health,
      maintains a comprehensive set of pages, listing the known
      causes of urinary tract infections in <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health/urolog/pubs/utiadult/utiadult.htm">
      adults</a> and <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health/urolog/pubs/utichild/utichild.htm">
      children</a>. NKUDIC does <i>not</i> suggest circumcision as
      a prevention or cure of urinary tract infection.</p>

      <h3>American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Changes</h3>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued two
      statements which, when read together, constitute a
      substantial change in AAP policy toward the prevention of UTI
      in infants. First, in 1997, the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9729.html">AAP Workgroup on
      Breastfeeding</a> recommended breastfeeding as highly
      beneficial in preventing a wide range of infections including
      UTI.<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> Second, in 1999, The <a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.sexuallymutilatedchild.org/aap1999.htm#UTI">1999
      AAP Task Force on Circumcision</a> abandoned the previous
      stance of the 1989 Task Force on Circumcision that
      circumcision may provide protection against UTI.<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> The 1999 Task Force found that the
      bulk of the UTI studies were so methodologically
      flawed&mdash;by failing to control for confounding factors
      such as breastfeeding&mdash;that no meaningful conclusions
      could be drawn from them.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> The
      1999 AAP Task Force on Circumcision could not, therefore,
      recommend circumcision to reduce incidence of UTI (or any
      other disease).</p>

      <p>The 1999 AAP Task Force on Circumcision did, however,
      declare that breastfeeding produces a three fold reduction in
      UTI in infants. Two separate panels of the AAP, the <a
      href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b100/6/1035"
       target="_blank">Work Group on Breastfeeding</a> and the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999 Task Force on
      Circumcision</a>, now recommend breastfeeding to reduce
      incidence of UTI.<sup><a href="#n45">45,53</a></sup> As <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/outerbridge/">Outerbridge</a>
      points out, breastfeeding is very effective in reducing
      incidence of UTI in <i>both</i> boys <i>and</i> girls.<sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></p>

      <p>The circumcision proponents now claim that circumcision is
      necessary to prevent UTI because UTI can cause renal
      failure.<sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup> However, new
      evidence has disproved even that claim.<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a>,<a href="#n54">54</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>The notion that circumcision is a useful prophylactic
      against disease has been laid to rest by the 1999 AAP Task
      Force on Circumcision.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup>
      Instead, healthy, natural alternatives such as breastfeeding
      and rooming-in must be given favour. Breastfeeding offers a
      wide range of benefits for both mother and baby. Circumcision
      is surgery, and as such it has <a
      href="/library/complications/">attendant risks</a>.
      Furthermore, circumcision causes a great deal of <a
      href="/library/pain/">pain</a>, entails <a
      href="/library/anatomy/">permanent loss</a> of sexual
      function and sensation, which raises serious ethical
      questions concerning <a href="/library/ethics/">informed
      consent</a>.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> Circumcision is
      not an operation to be performed lightly.</p>
