      <h3>Circumcisions: Again</h3>
      <cite>To the Editor.--</cite> 

      <p>The flurry of recent articles and commentaries addressing
      potential medical benefits of circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-4</a></sup> provide much food for thought. I
      agree with the Academy's Task Force on Circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> that the benefits of circumcision are
      not sufficient to recommend it routinely, that parents should
      be given accurate and unbiased information, and that
      procedural analgesia should be provided. It is unfortunate
      that the coverage in the lay press suggested that the AAP had
      changed its position to one opposing circumcision. A better
      headline would have read "AAP Task Force notes benefits,
      risks of circumcision; urges anesthesia."</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, I agree with Schoen, Wiswell, and
      Moses<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> that the language used by
      the Task Force is partly responsible for this
      misunderstanding. The Task Force statement says: "Existing
      scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits;
      however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine
      neonatal circumcision. In circumstances in which there are
      potential benefits and risks yet the procedure is not
      essential to the child's current well-being, parents should
      determine what is in the best interests of the child."</p>

      <p>Although it is true that the benefits are "potential" in
      that most uncircumcised males will not develop conditions
      circumcision would have prevented, this is not the reason not
      to recommend it. We routinely recommend immunizations, car
      seat use, and safer sex, even though their benefits and risks
      are "potential" in the same way as those of circumcision and
      they also are "not essential to the child's current
      well-being."</p>

      <p>The key difference between circumcision and preventive
      interventions that the AAP does recommend is neither the
      quality of the evidence nor the absolute magnitude of the
      benefits; it is the nature of the intervention. <span
      class="yellow">Circumcision involves surgery to remove a
      natural part of the boy's body and alter its appearance
      forever.</span> It is a procedure with considerable
      nonmedical significance in many cultures. Thus, although
      there are definite medical benefits that seem to outweigh the
      medical risks, I think it is appropriate for the AAP to
      refrain from routinely recommending it, because it is not
      solely a medical decision.</p>

      <p>This being said, it is important not to exaggerate the
      known benefit of preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs).
      The degree to which urinary tract infections in infancy lead
      to hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in
      adulthood is not known, but is almost certainly less than
      suggested by combining the results of the long-term studies
      cited by Wiswell.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Using those
      figures, if 2.2% of uncircumcised boys got UTIs and 44% of
      them developed renal scarring and 10% of those with scarring
      developed ESRD over the next 30 years, the 30-year risk of
      ESRD from infancy would be about 2.2% &times; 44% &times;
      10%, or about 1 in 1000. In fact, according to the US Renal
      Data Service, ESRD in children younger than 20 years old has
      an annual incidence of only about 13 million per year, of
      which only about 2.7% is attributed to chronic pyelonephritis
      or reflux nephropathy.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Over the
      next 25 years the annual incidence rises to 109 million per
      year, but the proportion attributed to chronic pyelonephritis
      or reflux nephropathy declines to 0.7%. <span
      class="yellow">Even if all the cases in males were
      attributable to UTIs in those who were uncircumcised, the
      45-year risk would still be an order or magnitude lower than
      would be projected from the numbers cited by
      Wiswell.</span></p>
