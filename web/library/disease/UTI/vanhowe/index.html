      <p>RE: O'Brien TR, Calle EE, Poole WK: Incidence of neonatal
      circumcision in Atlanta, 1985-1986. <i>South Med J</i> 1995;
      88: 411-5.</p>

      <p>Word Count: 302</p>

      <p>To the Editor:</p>

      <p class="text2">I read with great interest O'Brien <i>et
      al</i>'s article "Incidence of neonatal circumcision in
      Atlanta."<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> It's implications on
      the controversial issue of neonatal circumcision currently
      going on in the United States are manifold.</p>

      <p class="text2">The inaccuracy of reporting circumcisions on
      the hospital medical record face sheet, which hospitals
      depend on for reimbursement, has enormous impact on the
      validity of any study that estimates circumcision rates
      without inspecting individual patients. The data published by
      Wiswell concerning a possible association between urinary
      tract infection and circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> deserves special scrutiny. In
      reviewing the charts of 217,116 boys of military families,
      where correct face sheets are not a factor in reimbursement,
      it is very likely only data from the face sheets was used to
      calculate circumcision rates. Applying O'Brien's 84.3%
      figure, which may be conservative, reveals that 32,651
      (78.11%) of the 41,331 boys classified as having foreskins
      may have been circumcised. Depending on whether the boys with
      urinary tract infections were properly classified, the
      incidence of urinary tract infections in circumcised boys
      ranges from 0.09% to 0.27% while the incidence in intact boys
      ranges from 1.12% to 5.12%. The odds ratio varies more than
      ten-fold (4.18-58.04). This huge potential variation casts a
      large shadow of doubt over Wiswell's conclusion concerning an
      association between the foreskin and urinary tract
      infections.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Wiswell's study there were unexplained
      yearly fluctuations in the incidence of urinary tract
      infections in circumcised boys ranging between 0.07% and
      0.21%,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and he has reported the
      incidence of urinary tract infections in intact boys to be as
      high as 4.12%.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> These wide
      variations are consistent with 72.8% of boys labeled as
      intact being misclassified. O'Brien's finding clearly
      demonstrate that any past or future studies that estimate
      circumcision rates based on chart reviews suffer from a
      serious methodological flaw that renders any findings derived
      from them suspect.</p>
