      <h3 class="abstract">OBJECTIVE</h3>

      <p class="text1">To evaluate whether circumcision during
      antireflux surgery can reduce the incidence of urinary tract
      infection (UTI) after successful ureteric reimplantation in
      patients with primary vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR).</p>

      <h3 class="abstract">PATIENTS AND METHODS</h3>

      <p class="text1">Children who had undergone antireflux
      surgery for primary VUR were divided into group 1 (27,
      circumcised at the time of antireflux surgery at the
      parents&rsquo; request) and group 2 (50, those not
      circumcised). All antireflux operations were by the Cohen
      method. Regular urine samples were cultured to detect UTI,
      which was defined as a single species with &gt;10<sup>5</sup>
      colony-forming units/mL in a midstream voided specimen.
      Numbers of UTI episodes before and after surgery were
      compared between the groups, with
      <sup>99m</sup>Tcdimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans
      also taken in all patients. Each scan was blindly reviewed in
      terms of the size, number and zonal location of cortical
      defects, based on morphology. Interval changes were
      categorised as improved, no change, progressed, and new scar
      formation, and compared between the groups. Prophylactic
      antibiotics were maintained until the followup studies at
      4&ndash;6 months after surgery.</p>

      <h3 class="abstract">RESULTS</h3>

      <p class="text1">There was no significant difference between
      the groups in age at the time of operation (mean 42.4 vs 47.4
      months), the age at the first documented UTI (mean 26.5 vs
      29.3 months), reflux grade, or number of UTI episodes and
      renal parenchymal scarring on DMSA before surgery. There was
      no significant difference between the groups in the number of
      UTI episodes at a mean (range) follow-up of 151.3
      (114&ndash;207) months after antireflux surgery. Also there
      was no significant morphological change on followup renal
      scans and no difference between the groups.</p>

      <h3 class="abstract">CONCLUSION</h3>

      <p class="text1">These findings suggest that circumcision
      during antireflux surgery has no effect on the incidence of
      postoperative UTI.</p>
