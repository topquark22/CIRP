      <h2>Urinary tract infections and circumcision. A case-control
      study</h2>

      <p>It has been shown that uncircumcised infants have a higher
      rate of urinary tract infections in the first few months of
      life. To investigate further the association between
      noncircumcision and urinary tract infections, a case-control
      study was performed of infant boys who had a catheterized or
      suprapubic urine culture done as part of an acute illness
      visit. Cases (n = 36) were those infants who had a positive
      culture (greater than 105 organisms per milliliter); controls
      (n = 76) had a negative culture (less than 103 organisms per
      milliliter). There were no significant differences found in
      the two groups in age, ethnic group, and type of medical
      insurance. All of the cases were uncircumcised, vs 32% of
      controls. The data were analyzed separately by age, ethnic
      group, type of insurance, and method of culture, and in all
      groups the cases were significantly more likely to be
      uncircumcised. Of the 31 cases who underwent roentgenographic
      investigations, 8 had abnormal findings. Noncircumcision
      seems to be a highly significant risk factor for urinary
      tract infection in infants up to 12 months of age, affects
      infants regardless of race and socioeconomic status, and is
      associated with anatomic abnormalities in 26% of cases.</p>
