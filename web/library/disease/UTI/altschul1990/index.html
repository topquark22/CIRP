      <h2>The Circumcision Controversy</h2>

          fact.</b>

      <p class="text">Until 1985, the pendulum of public and
      scientific opinion appeared to be swinging away from routine
      newborn circumcision. In that year, Wiswell and colleagues'
      retrospective study of infant urinary tract infection<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> demonstrated a 10-fold difference in
      incidence between uncircumcised and circumcised males. This
      article sparked a lively controversy about the relationship
      between the foreskin and urinary tract infections in infant
      boys.</p>

      <p class="text">The controversy must now be examined in the
      context of the long- running dispute about the benefits and
      risks of circumcision. This dispute has been characterized by
      significant discrepancies in the statistics to support
      various points of view.</p>

      <p class="text">For example, in the article published in this
      issue, Wiswell<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> indicates that
      10 to 15 percent of uncircumcised boys will require
      circumcision in adulthood. But Wallerstein<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> estimates that in Finland the rate of
      adult circumcision is six per 100,000. Herzog and
      Alverez<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> found that penile
      problems are more common in uncircumcised boys, but others
      have reported opposite findings and have noted that meatitis
      seems to occur exclusively in circumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Wiswell and associates<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,6</a></sup> have reported rates of urinary tract
      infection ranging from 1.1 percent to 4.1 percent in
      uncircumcised male infants. But my data from an unpublished
      retrospective study at Northern California Kaiser Permanente)
      show much lower rates, ranging from 0.09 to 0.16 percent.
      Finally, results of studies linking circumcision to sexual
      transmitted disease have varied widely.</p>

      <p class="text">This welter of confusing statistics is not at
      all surprising. Most of the numbers are taken from
      retrospective studies that suffer from one of three flaws:
      uncontrolled variables, subjectivity, or questionable
      interpretation.</p>

      <p class="text">Uncontrolled variables are a major stumbling
      block in determining infection rates. In my study of urinary
      tract infection, the circumcised population was predominantly
      white, while the uncircumcised population was predominantly
      Asian and Latino. It is hoped (but no means certain) that
      these differences had little effect on the incidence of
      urinary tract infections. If the object of the study had been
      sexually transmitted disease, the cultural differences would
      have completely invalidated the data. Yet, these are exactly
      the kinds of data that are used to link the intact foreskin
      with sexually transmitted disease.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Subjectivity is the next major stumbling
      block, particularly in determining the incidence of "penile
      problems," such as phimosis and meatitis, and the need for
      circumcision after the neonatal period. The typical infantile
      foreskin is a long, narrow and unretractable nozzle of
      tissue. Many physicians in the United States use the
      pathologic term "phimosis" to describe this normal anatomy.
      As a practical matter, the presence of the infantile prepuce
      precludes the diagnosis of meatitis - if you can't see the
      meatus, you can't diagnose meatitis.</p>

      <p class="text">The rate of circumcision after the neonatal
      period depends on whether physicians and patients view the
      foreskin as dispensable. This perspective is subject to
      cultural biases. Having acquired a reputation as a "foreskin
      consultant," I see numerous dissatisfied patients who request
      either circumcision or recircumcision for cosmetic reasons.
      Invariably these patients either come from families who
      lacked insurance coverage at birth or who believe that the
      original surgeon "didn't take enough off." I have never seen
      a child who had a true objective indication for circumcision.
      I have seen only one child who had an objective indication
      for recircumcision (ischemic glans).</p>

      <p class="text">Finally, there is the question of
      interpretation. Many physicians were alarmed by Hertzog's
      report<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> that eight of 31
      uncircumcised males with urinary tract infections had
      genitourinary abnormalities, which implied that abnormalities
      were a consequence of infection. But Rockney and
      Caldamone<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> point out that
      Herzog's eight abnormalities "were almost certainly present
      from birth and are likely to have been factors that
      contributed to the development of urinary tract infection
      rather than the result."</p>

      <p class="text">In my series, only 48 of 96,000 normal male
      infants (excluding 16 patients with congenital genitourinary
      anomalies) had urinary tract infections. Only three of the 48
      had acquired genitourinary problems (reflux), and one child
      who had persistent reflux and infection was circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">From my data, I have estimated that the cost
      of using routine circumcision to prevent infantile urinary
      tract infection is $60,000 per infection prevented. The cost
      of preventing one urethral reimplantation is estimated at $3
      million. Infants with occult congenital obstructive uropathy
      (the "few" who need to be "protected") may actually be harmed
      by routine circumcision. If circumcision does indeed prevent
      urinary tract infection in these patients, then it also
      delays diagnosis and treatment of the underlying lesion.</p>

      <p class="text">We in the United States are culturally
      acclimated to regard the foreskin as non-essential and even
      pathologic. Therefore, forsaking the ancient cautionary
      primum non nocere becomes easy. We must not forget that the
      burden of proof is on the circumcision advocates. Showing
      disease association is not sufficient. They must prove cause
      and effect. Furthermore, they must prove (not conjecture)
      that the advantages of circumcision outweigh the risks.</p>
