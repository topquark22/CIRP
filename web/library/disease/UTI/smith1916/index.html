         OF PYELITIS IN INFANCY</h2>
        RICHARD M. SMITH, M.D.<br />
         <small>BOSTON</small>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The term pyelitis is used to designate an
      acute febrile disease characterized by the presence of pus in
      the urine. Brennemann<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> estimates
      that these cases constitute 1 per cent, of all those coming
      to a physician. The symptoms are usually abrupt in onset, the
      temperature often reaches 103 or 104 F. The fever may be
      relapsing in type<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> extending
      over variable periods of time, sometimes simulating
      malaria.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Rigor may be present
      and is almost pathognomonic of this disease when it occurs in
      infants under 2 years of age.<sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup>
      The nervous symptoms may suggest meningitis.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Sometimes there are definite symptoms
      pointing to the genito-urinary tract, as frequent micturition
      accompanied by more or less pain,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4-5</a></sup> but more frequently there is nothing
      to indicate any disturbance in these parts.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The physical examination is usually
      negative except that pallor is characteristically
      present.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> In some instances the
      kidney is palpable,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> more often
      the right than the left, and often the spleen is palpable at
      the onset of the disease.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> There
      may be tenderness in the lower abdomen.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> or back, which makes the patient
      object to being handled.<sup><a href="#n">1</a></sup>
      Occasionally there is pain and tenderness of the joints with
      signs of local inflammation.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      Herpes may be present.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      Occasionally there is an inflammatory condition of the
      vulva.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Urine : A single specimen of urine may be
      normal. The sediment may contain only bacteria,<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> but usually shows also many
      leukocytes. The urine may be opalescent, due to the presence
      of microorganisms.<sup><a href="#n4">4,8</a></sup> The
      reaction is acid when fresh, but becomes alkaline on
      standing.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The amount of albumin
      is slight.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The presence of
      casts indicates that the parenchyma of the kidney is
      involved, but their absence does not necessarily mean that
      the kidney is normal.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Pus may
      be temporarily absent from the urine when only one kidney is
      diseased, due to a blocking of the ureter.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1-9</a></sup> The organisms responsible for the
      infection are colon bacilli in a very large percentage of the
      cases.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Jeffries<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> reports 121 cases, 67 colon, 37
      staphylocoeci, 10 streptococci, 3 pneumococci and 4
      miscellaneous. The colon bacilli when present are
      extracellular and show a tendency to beading.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,6</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <small>PROGNOSIS</small>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The course of the disease is very variable.
      Usually the acute symptoms are over in a few weeks. A
      considerable number of cases tend to become chronic and may
      last for years with acute exacerbations. Birk<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> reports one child who had five
      recurrences in ten years, the last at the age of 12. Not
      infrequently the acute attacks come in storms with periods of
      comparative health between.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      Some infants have attacks like periodic vomiting and may pass
      into coma.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> The ultimate outlook
      in nearly all cases is favorable, but the rapidity of the
      cure depends largely on one's definition of "cured." The more
      favorable statistics come from those who do not require that
      the urine be culturally free from bacteria before calling the
      patient cured. Thompson<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      believes that chronic interstitial nephritis may result
      because of the slow infection of the kidney by colon
      bacilli.</p>

      <center>
        <small>PATHOLOGY</small>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Pathologically two types of the disease may
      be distinguished.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The first
      shows simply a catarrhal condition of the bladder and the
      pelvis of the kidney. The second, which occurs especially in
      children with low resistance, shows multiple abscesses in the
      cortex of the kidney.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Most of
      the autopsies are in this type. Sometimes these abscesses
      radiate toward the pelvis in fine lines.The bursting of these
      abscesses gives rise to pyuria.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      M&uuml;ller<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> believes that the
      infection from the pelvis of the kidney in these cases
      travels by way of the lymphatics and that the tubercles play
      a secondary r&ocirc;le. Very few autopsies have been made,
      because the condition is so rarely fatal. Apparently no
      permanent damage to the kidney results in cases which are
      cured. Friedenwald<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> reports
      one case in which the patient died of tuberculosis seven
      weeks after a cure of pyelitis and there were no lesions in
      the genito-urinary tract.</p>

      <center>
        <small>DIAGNOSIS</small>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The diagnosis of pyelitis can be made only
      by an examination of the urine. Agglutination reactions and
      opsonic index determinations are of no value.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <small>CHANNEL OF INFECTION</small>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The mode of infection has been the subject
      of much controversy. Birk<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      believes that a coexisting tuberculosis and the so-called
      exudative diathesis are predisposing factors. Brennemann1 has
      called attention to the fact that it occurs more frequently
      in the summer months. Friedenwald<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> showed that fifty-nine out of eighty
      cases had preceding gastrointestinal disturbances. Very
      frequently cases are preceded by acute nasopharyngeal
      infections.</p>

      <p class="text2">The fact that such a very large percentage
      of cases occur in girls has given support to the theory of an
      ascending infection. The disease is most common in the diaper
      age, when there is great possibility of contamination of the
      urethra with fecal matter. Against this mode of infection has
      been cited the fact that rarely is there any cystitis present
      in these cases and that in vulvovaginitis of infants cystitis
      is rare.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Leutscher<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> has shown that bacilli may be
      present in the bladder without a cystitis, so that an
      infection of the kidney might occur. Dudgeon<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> has also reported twenty cases of
      constipation, two of which had colon bacilli and pus in the
      urine, but no cystitis or other constitutional symptoms.
      <span class="yellow">The disease occurs in boys following
      circumcision,</span> which is taken to indicate an ascending
      infection.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> It is possible, as
      Thompson<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> has pointed out, that
      the infection is ascending, but the lumen of the ureter is
      less important than the deep tissues around it and around the
      urethra. Stewart<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> has shown
      experimentally that the vessels of the ureter usually carry
      infection, not the ureter itself.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another theory of the mode of infection is
      that the bacteria are borne to the kidney by the
      blood-stream. Presumably the bacteria enter the blood-stream
      from the intestines or possibly through some break in
      continuity of tissue about the rectum. In order that these
      bacteria shall do harm there must be a lowered resistance of
      the kidney or an injury to the tissues of the kidney, but
      this injury may be caused by the toxins liberated from the
      bacteria in the blood.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      Apparently certain healthy persons take bacilli coli from the
      intestines and excrete them through the kidneys.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The number and virulence of these
      organisms depends on the intestinal condition. Anything which
      interferes with free excretion of the urine tends to produce
      an infection of the kidney. Experimentally it is possible in
      certain instances for the bladder to become infected by this
      means and the kidney itself remain normal.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A third possible mode of infection is the
      direct transmission of bacteria from the intestines to the
      kidney. Probably this does not occur unless there is some
      damage to the lumen of the intestine.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> It has been shown<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> in rabbits that the ascending colon
      and cecum are connected with the right kidney by a chain of
      lymphatics. None are found connecting with the left kidney.
      If only one kidney is affected by infection it is more
      frequently the right.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> With
      even a slight damage to the intestinal wall, bacteria can
      pass by the lymphatics directly into the kidney. There is
      also a free anastomosis between the lymphatics on the side of
      the vertebral column and those of the ureter so that an
      infection might easily occur from some outside source.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The consensus of opinion seems to be in
      favor of the ascending method of infection in the majority of
      the infants under 2 years of age. The condition in these
      cases is rarely anything more than a catarrhal pyelitis. In
      children beyond 2 years of age the other means of infection
      come into play and not infrequently the severer types of
      lesions with multiple abscesses are found.</p>

      <center>
        <small>TREATMENT</small>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Spontaneous cure occurs in many acute
      cases.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Many of the chronic
      cases are resistant to all means of treatment. Box<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> says the value of any treatment is to
      be measured by its action in chronic cases. In the acute
      cases there seems to be the greatest uniformity in the belief
      that the urine should be made alkaline and kept so for a
      considerable period of time, and that free diuresis should be
      established.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> Colon bacilli
      are believed to develop less easily in an alkaline urine and
      phagocytosis of the bacilli by the leukocytes is more active
      in an alkaline medium.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>
      Potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate are the drugs most
      used in this connection. Directly opposed to this view is the
      observation of Betz,<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> that the
      thin, weakly acid urine occurring normally in pyelitis is the
      most favorable culture medium for the colon bacillus, but
      that it is unable to proliferate in very acid concentrated
      urine. He gives phosphoric acid and a meat and no-vegetable
      diet in order to make the urine strongly acid, and limits the
      intake of fluids and gives hot air baths to produce
      concentration.</p>

      <p class="text2">The statements in regard to urinary
      antiseptics would make one feel that on the whole they are
      not of great value in the acute cases and worthless in the
      chronic cases. Ammonium and sodium benzoates,<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> calomel,<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> sandalwood oil,<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> creosote,<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> salol<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> and urotropin are among the drugs
      recommended. Hexamethylenamin, combined with a sodium salt is
      said to be more efficacious than the simple
      hexamethylenamin.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> The colon
      bacillus easily becomes accustomed to any drug given
      internally, so a change of drugs should be made
      frequently.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> Nevertheless,
      hexamethylenamin is the favorite antiseptic drug. In this
      connection it is important to bear in mind that the action of
      hexamethylenamin depends on its being broken up in the body
      and excreted as formaldehyd. Sisson<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> and others have shown that the
      excretion of formaldehyd takes place only in an acid urine.
      It has been customary to give hexamethylenamin in connection
      with alkalies, and this may account for the unsatisfactory
      results from its use. Thompson recommends that it should be
      given always with an equal amount of sodium benzoate.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Box<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> has
      shown that hexamethylenamin has very little influence on the
      colon bacillus, and Dudgeon<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      goes so far as to say that if a patient with pyelitis is
      benefited by hexamethylenamin, the offending organism is not
      a colon organism.</p>

      <p class="text2">Vaccines in the acute and subacute cases do
      not appear to influence the result obtained by other methods
      of treatment.<sup><a href="#n4">4,12,24,30</a></sup> They are
      of no value in chronic cases. Vaccines do not prevent
      exacerbations, nor affect the presence of pus and blood in
      the urine.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> In some cases they
      apparently give relief of symptoms.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32,33,34,35</a></sup> Lyman says<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> that autogenous vaccines are of
      great value, but adds, "many cases do not improve more
      rapidly than others without it." Rolleston reports favorably
      on their use.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> Dick<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> believes that cases which do not
      respond to alkaline diuresis are sometimes benefited by
      vaccines. Serum apparently has no bactericidal action on the
      colon bacillus. Normal human serum and immune horse-serum are
      identical in this respect.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Pardoe<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>
      suggests that in the chronic cases there is possibly some
      underlying condition, as a disturbance of the
      gastro-intestinal tract, which must be relieved before the
      pyelitis will subside. Free evacuation of the bowels is
      advocated,<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> and the giving of
      calomel and cold enemas.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Some
      longstanding chronic eases of bacilluria are entirely cured
      by appendectomy, even though there are no symptoms referable
      to that organ.<sup><a href="#n8">8,30</a></sup> Operation is
      advised in cases in which there is any suggestion of
      abdominal disease or in those very stubborn to
      treatment.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> No local treatment
      is indicated in acute cases. In resistant chronic cases
      bladder washings with various antiseptic drugs may be
      tried.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> Koll<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup> believes that the best results are
      obtained by the use of aluminum acetate.</p>
