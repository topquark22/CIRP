      <blockquote>
        <p class="abs">A case-control study was conducted to study
        the association between breast-feeding and urinary tract
        infection. Case patients were 128 infants aged birth to 6
        months with urinary tract infection. Control infants were
        128 infants admitted to the same ward with an acute
        illness. The results support the hypothesis that
        breast-feeding protects infants against urinary tract
        infection. (J P<span class="sc">EDIATR</span>

      <p>Much evidence from developing countries shows that
      breast-feeding protects infants from infection,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> but evidence from developed countries
      is less convincing.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Recently
      Bauchner et al.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> reviewed a
      selection of 20 studies on this subject written in English
      since 1970; they concluded that most of the studies had major
      methodologic flaws and that breast-feeding had a minimal
      protective effect in industrialized countries. Recent studies
      which close attention was paid to the methodologic criteria
      of Bauchner showed contrasting results.<sup><a

      <p class="special">UTI Urinary tract infection</p>

      <p class="text">No data are available about the effect of
      breast-feeding in protecting against urinary tract infection;
      however, <a href="/library/disease/UTI/coppa/">some
      authors</a> reported the presence of an oligosaccharide in
      the urine of breast-fed infants that caused inhibition of
      <i>Escherichia coli</i> adhesion to uroepithelial
      cells.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Other researchers showed
      an increased concentration of immunologic factors in the
      urine of breastfed infants.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>
      In this report we present the results of a case-control study
      of the relationship between UTI in the first 6 months of life
      and infant feeding.</p>

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <p class="text"><b>Study area.</b> The Medical School of
      Naples Department of Pediatrics admits to the hospital
      approximately 2000 children per year; 15,000 children are
      seen every year as outpatients. More than 95% of these
      children come from Campania, one of the largest and most
      populated regions of southern Italy (13,600 km<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>, with 5.5 million inhabitants).</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Selection of case and control
      patients.</b> Case patients included all 128 hospitalized
      infants aged 6 months and less in whom UTI was diagnosed from
      the beginning of January 1976 to the end of December 1989. We
      ascertained UTI by two urine cultures done at our hospital
      that yielded more than 100,000 colonies/ml of a single
      bacterial species. According to the policy of our department,
      all urine specimens were collected by trained nurses. After
      cleansing the infant's perineal area with castile soap and
      water, a pediatric nurse applied a sterile pediatric urine
      collector. The bag was removed no more than 30 minutes after
      application and was taken to the hospital laboratory.</p>

      <p class="text">Five infants with low birth weight and three
      for whom no detailed information was present in the clinical
      chart were not included in the study. One control patient for
      each case patient was chosen by systematic sampling from
      among infants who had been admitted to our hospital with an
      acute illness between Jan. 1, 1976, and December 31, 1989,
      and who had one urine culture, done with the same technique
      as described for the case patients, with negative results.
      The control patients were matched to the case patients by
      gender, age (within 15 days), and year and month of
      admission; the next infant who met the matching criteria was
      selected. Infants with diagnoses of acute diarrhea and
      respiratory infection were not included as control patients
      because of evidence that breast-feeding confers some
      protection against those diseases. All control patients had a
      birth weight &gt;2500 gm.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Classification of feeding methods.</b> The
      clinical charts used for children admitted to hospital
      contain a sheet with detailed feeding information; almost
      100% of our records give accurate information about feeding
      during infancy.</p>

      <p class="text">The categories of feeding were classified as
      follows: (1) 100% breast-feeding; (2) breast-feeding combined
      with bottle feeding (ration not available from the records);
      and (3) 100% bottle feeding.</p>

      <p class="text">For both case and control patients, type of
      feeding was defined as the type that the infant was receiving
      at the time of hospitalization. In addition, a dichotomous
      classification of infants as either breast-fed at least
      somewhat or never breast-fed was done to minimize reverse
      causality bias. No information about feeding was available
      for two hospitalized control patients; they were removed from
      the study and replaced by the two next babies who met the
      matching criteria and for whom feeding information was
      available.</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Data Collection and analysis.</b> For all
      subjects, data concerning background variables (age, gender,
      birth weight, social class, birth order, maternal smoking
      habits), disease status (outcome), and feeding method.
      (exposure) were ascertained from the hospital charts. After
      the case and control groups had been selected, the sheets
      containing the information about feeding were duplicated and
      analysed by two of us who were unaware of the disease status.
      In addition, 10 randomly selected families in each group were
      contacted at home by a pediatric nurse; information about
      feeding during the first six months was collected from them.
      These data were concordant with those in the clinical charts
      for all children studied.</p>

      <p class="text">Relative risk was estimated by the odds
      ratio; 95% confidence intervals were calculated with a
      test-based method.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Because the
      odds ratios did not differ significantly for the two
      categories of breast-feeding plus bottle feeding), full and
      partial breast-feeding groups were combined into a single
      group for comparison with the bottle-fed group.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="text">The characteristics of the study groups are
      shown in the Table. All male infants were uncircumcised. The
      main causes of admission among the case patients were as
      follows: failure to thrive, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of
      appetite, and fever. The main admission diagnoses among
      control patients were as follows: failure to thrive, anemia,
      cardiac diseases, and congenital malformations.</p>

      <p class="text">In the case group 73% of the urine cultures
      yielded <i>Escherichia coli</i>, 17% grew <i>Proteus</i>
      species, and 10% grew other bacterial species. The numbers of
      infants who had ever been breast fed were 64 of the case
      patients (73%) (p&lt;0.001). Sixteen case patients (12%) and
      56 hospitalized control patients (44%) were being breast fed
      at the time of observation (p&lt;0.001). Compared with
      infants who were bottle fed, breast-fed patients had a
      relative risk of UTI of 0.38 (95% confidence intervals 0.22
      to 0.65) when a dichotomous classification (ever breast fed
      vs never breast fed) was used. The odds ratio relative to
      breast-feeding status of the time of admission was 0.18 (95%
      confidence intervals 0.09 to 0.36).</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text">The results of our study suggest that
      breast-feeding provides substantial protection against UTI
      during the first 6 months of life among children in an
      industrialized country, confirming our <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/pisacane/">preliminary
      report</a>.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Indirect evidence
      of such protection has been offered by others,<sup><a
      href="#n6">6-8</a></sup> but only one clinical study<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> is available and it had many flaws,
      caused by unclear definitions of exposure and disease and its
      small study groups. The roles of bias and confounding in the
      studies on breast-feeding and infections have been widely
      discussed; several cohort and case-control studies have been
      judged inadequate because of detection biases; unclear
      definition of exposure, outcome or both; and lack of
      adjustment for potential confounding variables.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">We attempted to improve methodologically on
      past studies according to the indications of Bauchner et
      al.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Detection bias is not
      likely to have occurred in our study because our policy is to
      hospitalize only severely ill infants, with the decision made
      independently of the feeding regimen. The hospital control
      group has a proportion of breast-fed infants similar to that
      of the population of infants in our well-baby clinic
      (unpublished data). Protopathic (reverse causality) bias may
      stem from the fact that an infant's health can affect the
      choice of a feeding method. The incidence of breast-feeding
      among our case patients was significantly lower than that
      among control patients. This fact, rather than the
      interruption of breast-feeding because of disease, seems to
      be the main reason for the difference in breast-feeding
      prevalence observed at the time of admission to the
      hospital.</p>

      <p class="text">Confounding variables for UTI have not been
      described<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>; our case and
      control groups were similar with regard to the variables
      described as confounding for the association between
      breast-feeding and infections<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>;
      even if unknown confounding variables are postulated for this
      association, it is unlikely that they account for the size of
      the effect observed.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">We are aware that a suprapubic tap is more
      reliable than bag collection for the diagnosis of UTI.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Nevertheless, the specimens from
      case and control patients were collected by the same persons,
      with the same technique and at the same time; all case
      patients had symptoms and required hospitalization. Recent
      data show that the external bacterial contamination rate for
      urine collected by the bag technique from non-toilet trained
      infants is not significant.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">We did not investigate whether the protection
      conferred by breast-feeding persists after breast-feeding has
      been interrupted, although <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/marild/">preliminary data</a> seem
      to suggest this inference.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      <span class="yellow">We conclude that breast-feeding seems to
      protect against UTI during the first 6 months of
      life.</span></p>
