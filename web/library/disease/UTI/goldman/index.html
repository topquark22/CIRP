        <p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> Circumcision seems to reduce the over
        all incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI) although a
        few studies have suggested that ritual circumcision may be
        a predisposing factor for UTI within the first few weeks
        following the procedure. The aim of this study was to
        investigate a possible causal relationship between ritual
        circumcision and UTI. The study comprised 82 infants with
        UTI, 55 females and 27 males under the age of 1 year. All
        males were circumcised on the eight day of life. The median
        age of infection was 0.75 and 7.0 months for males and
        females respectively. Fifty-two percent (14/27) of UTI were
        diagnosed within 2 weeks following circumcision. A
        significantly lower incidence in <i>Escherichia
        coli</i>-induced UTI was observed in males compared with
        females, 67% and 93% respectively. Similarly, the incidence
        of <i>E. coli</i>-induced UTI was significantly lower in
        males presenting within 2 weeks following the procedure
        (92%). Positive blood cultures of an identical
        microorganism were observed in 6/27 males compared to 2/55
        females. The incidence of urinary tract malformations and
        their severity were similar in both sexes. We conclude that
        the high incidence of UTI following a ritual Jewish
        circumcision, as well as the relative high preponderance of
        bacteria other than <i>E. coli</i>, may suggest a causal
        relationship between circumcision and UTI.</p>

      <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) in early infancy is often
      associated with septicemia <sup><a href="#n1">1-4</a></sup>,
      kidney scarring and occasionally renal failure<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup>. During early infancy, male are more
      commonly affected, but later on females predominate <sup><a
      href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>. Circumcision seems to reduce the
      overall incidence of UTI in male infants <sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2,9-11</a></sup>. In Jewish neonates,
      circumcision is performed routinely on the eighth day of life
      by a ritual circumciser who is usually not a physician.
      However, a few studies have suggested that ritual
      circumcision may be a disposing factor for UTI within the
      first 2 weeks following the surgical procedure <sup><a
      href="#n12">12-15</a></sup>. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the possible association of UTI with ritual
      circumcision.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Methods</b></font><br />
       During a 4 year period, from April 1989 through April 1993,
      82 infants under the age of 1 year were admitted with acute
      UTI to the pediatric department at Assaf Harofeh Medical
      Center. We included only Jewish females and circumcised male
      infants; all of the male infants had been circumcised on the
      eighth day of life. All infants had suprapubic aspiration,
      and UTI was defined as 10<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> or
      more colony forming units of a single microorganism.
      Urosepsis was defined when blood and urine cultures were
      positive for an identical microorganism. Only infants who had
      both voiding cysto-urethrography and renal ultra-sound or
      intravenous pyelogram were included in the study.</p>

      <p>Data were analyzed using &Chi;<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> analysis or Student's &tau; test. We
      considered a <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05 to be statistically
      significant.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Results</b></font><br />
       During the study period 82 hospitalized infants (55 females,
      27 males) fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The mean age of
      the male infants was signifantly younger than that of the
      female infants (1.2 vs. 7 months, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001)(Fig.
      1). The median age was 0.75 and 7.0, respectively. In the
      majority of males, UTI occurred during the first month of
      life (Fig. 2). The peak incidence was in the initial 13 days
      following circumcision), and 52% (14/27) of the UTI episodes
      occurred during that period. In females, the UTI episodes
      were distributed evenly throughout the first year of
      life.</p>

      <p>Urine cultures revealed <i>Escherichia coli</i> in 84%,
      <i>Klebsiella</i> in 11%, and other bacteria (<i>Proteus</i>,
      <i>Staphylococcus aureaus</i>, <i>Acienetobacter</i> and
      <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) in 5% (Fig. 3). When we
      compared the relative prevalence of <i>E. coli</i> versus
      other bacteria in males and females we found a significantly
      higher proportion of <i>E. coli</i> in females compared with
      males. (93 vs. 67%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01) (Fig. 4). The incidence
      of UTI induced by microorganisms other than E. coli was
      significantly higher (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) in male infants
      presenting within 2 weeks following circumcision (43%, 6/14)
      than in the remaining males (8%, 1/13) or in all female
      infants (7%, 4,55). Blood cultures were positive (identical
      microorganism as in urine culture) in 6/27 males and 2/55
      females (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). All males with positive blood
      cultures were between 0.5 and 1.75 months old; four of them
      had positive cultures within the 2 weeks following
      circumcision. The two female infants were 4 and 8 months
      old.</p>

      <p>Vesico-urethral reflux was demonstrated in 9/27 males and
      in 24/55 females. Seventeen males and 33 females had an
      intravenous pyelography (IVP). Hydronephosis with or without
      hydro-ureters was observed in 4/17 males and 6/33 females. A
      renal ultrasound (US) was performed in 22 males and 34
      females. Hydronephosis was found in 6/22 males and 5/33
      females. The only structural anomaly observed in our
      population with UTI was vesico-urethral reflux. Its incidence
      and severity (degree of reflux was similar in both sexes.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font><br />
       Urinary tract infection is one of the most common diseases
      in infancy. During the neonatal period, males seem to be more
      commonly affected, whereas later on females predominate
      <sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup>. In our study, 20 of 27
      males, compared to only 2 of 55 females, suffered from UTI
      during the first 4 weeks of life. Four infants of each sex
      contracted UTI during the second month of life. Later on,
      female infants predominated by far. The higher incidence of
      neonatal UTI in males has been attributed by some authors to
      an increased incidence of structural abnormalities <sup><a
      href="#n16">16,17</a></sup>. In our study, the single urinary
      tract malformation observed was vesico-ureteral reflux, whose
      incidence and severity were similar in both sexes.</p>

      <p>Based on epidemeologic studies, it has been suggested that
      neonatal circumcision may reduce the overall incidence of UTI
      early infancy <sup><a href="#n1">1,2 9-11</a></sup>. It has
      been hypothesized that the preputial fold, which is not
      amenable to ordinary cleaning, may harbor vast quantities of
      microorganisms that cause a contamination of the male urethra
      with fecal flora.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is faithfully performed in Jewish infants. It
      is carried out on the eighth day of life unless medically
      contraindicated, and is performed by a ritual circumciser.
      Therefore, evaluating the incidence of UTI and its time of
      occurence in circumcised and uncircumcised populations is
      impossible in our area. However, comparing our data and those
      published by others in Israel <sup><a
      href="#n12">12-14</a></sup> with studies performed in
      uncircumcised infants <sup><a href="#n7">7,18,19</a></sup>,
      it seems that UTI develops at a younger age in ritually
      circumcised infants than in intact ones. Wiswell et al.
      <sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> followed 1,919 circumcised
      male infants in whom 4 (0.21%) had UTI. The mean age of the
      infection was 1.4 and 1.7 months, respectively. In the
      present study, the mean age of UTI was 1.2 months. There was
      no clinical evidence of pre-existing infection prior to
      circumcision in any of the infants who developed UTI shortly
      after the procedure. The clustering of UTIs in the 2 weeks
      following the procedure may reflect a causal relationship
      between UTI and ritual circumcision relative to the
      non-sterile techniques used during the procedure, and may
      also be in part due to a pain-induced urine retention
      occurring immediately following circumcision. The significant
      difference in bacterial pathogens between male infants
      presenting with UTI within 2 weeks following circumcision and
      both the remaining male infants and the female population may
      also suggest a different etiology for the development of the
      disease.</p>

      <p>The combination of UTI and bacteremia is more common in
      the newborn than later on in infancy <sup><a
      href="#n3">3,7,20</a></sup>. The relatively common episodes
      of septicemia in male compared to female infants in our study
      may simply reflect the earlier appearance of the UTI. However
      a surgical procedure, albeit a minor one, performed under not
      strictly sterile conditions, in an area not amenable to
      ordinary cleaning and harboring great quantities of mainly
      fecal microorganisms may also predispose to the development
      of UTI and bacteremia.</p>

      <p><span class="highlighted">In conclusion, it seems to us
      that the high incidence of UTIs following ritual Jewish
      circumcision, as well as the significant difference in
      bacterial etiology, may suggest a causal relationship between
      UTI and circumcision.</span> A stricter sterile technique by
      the ritual circumciser may reduce the risk.</p>
