        <p class="text1"><b>Objective:</b> To determine whether
        circumcision decreases the risk of symptomatic urinary
        tract infection (UTI) in boys less than 5 years of age.</p>

        <p class="text1"><b>Study design:</b> A case-control study
        (1993 to 1995) in the setting of a large ambulatory
        pediatric service. Case subjects and control subjects were
        drawn from the same population. One hundred forty-four boys
        less than 5 years of age (median age, 5.8 months) who had a
        microbiologically proven symptomatic UTI (case subjects),
        were compared with 742 boys (median age, 21.0 months) who
        did not have a UTI (control subjects). The proportion of
        case and control subjects who were circumcised in each
        group was compared with the use of the chi-square test,
        with the strength of association between circumcision and
        UTI expressed in terms of an odds ratio. To determine
        whether age was a confounder or an effect-modifier, we
        stratified the groups by age (&lt;1 year; 1-5 years) and
        analyzed by the method of Mantel-Haenszel.</p>

        <p class="text1"><b>Results:</b> Of the 144 preschool boys
        with UTI, 2(1.4%) were circumcised, compared with 47 (6.3%)
        of the 742 control subjects (chi-square value = 5.6; p =
        0.02; odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence intervals, 0.06 to
        0.76). There was no evidence that age was a confounder or
        modified the protective effect of circumcision on the
        development of UTI (Mantel-Haenszel chi-square value = 6.0;
        p = 0.01; combined odds ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence
        intervals, 0.05 to 0.71; Breslow-Day test of homogeneity
        chi-square value = 0.6; p = 0.4).</p>

        <p class="text1"><b>Conclusions:</b> Circumcision decreases
        the risk of symptomatic UTI in preschool boys. The
        protective effect is independent of age.</p>

      <p class="text2">Approximately 1% to 2% of boys can be
      expected to have a urinary tract infection by 10 years of
      age.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> Since 1982 it has been
      recognized that there is an association between UTI and the
      uncircumcised state.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      Cross-sectional,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      ecologic,<sup><a href="#n">4</a></sup>
      before-and-after,<sup><a href="#n5">5,6</a></sup>
      case-control,<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> and
      retrospective cohort studies<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,9,10</a></sup> have consistently demonstrated
      that an uncircumcised state is associated with a higher
      incidence of UTI.</p>

      <p class="text2">These studies have been criticized on
      methodologic grounds, and there is not universal acceptance
      that circumcision prevents the development of UTI.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> All have been conducted in
      populations with a high prevalence of circumcision, and apart
      from a retrospective case-control study in a sexually
      transmitted disease clinic for adult men,<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> the effect of circumcision on the
      development of UTI has not been examined in subjects more
      than 1 year of age. To determine whether the protective
      effect of circumcision extends to older children, we
      undertook a case-control study of boys less than 5 years of
      age attending a large ambulatory pediatric department in
      Australia, a country with a low prevalence of
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <p class="text1">Case selection. To identify cases of UTI in
      boys less than 5 years of age, we prospectively reviewed all
      urine cultures that were obtained from eligible boys
      attending the ambulatory pediatric department of the Royal
      Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, from March 1, 1993,
      to Dec. 17, 1994. All urine samples were innoculated onto
      blood agar and MacConkey medium with a 1 ul calibrated loop.
      Our case criteria were a colony-forming unit count of more
      than 10<sup>6</sup>/L from urine obtained from a suprapubic
      tap or catheter sample, or more than 10<sup>8</sup>/L from a
      midstream voided urine sample of a single organism, in
      combination with symptoms and/or signs of UTI. Meatal
      cleansing was not performed before the collection of
      midstream urine samples.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Boys
      who had a previously diagnosed UTI, or a known renal tract,
      neurologic, or skeletal predisposing cause, were excluded.
      Investigators were unaware of the circumcision status of case
      patients at the time of diagnosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">As part of a prospective cohort study of 304
      children less than 5 years of age, and to evaluate associated
      renal tract ahnormalities, we obtained a technetium Tc 99m
      dimercaptosuccinic acid scan, a radiologic micturating
      cystourethrogram, and renal tract sonograms within 4 weeks of
      onset. Institutional ethics approval had been obtained for
      the study, and informed consent was obtained from the patents
      of the children who were study subjects.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Selection of control subjects.</b> To
      identify control subjects, we ascertained, from April 5,
      1995, to May 2, 1995 (28 days), the circumcision status and
      diagnosis of all boys less than 5 years of age who attended
      the ambulatory pediatric center of the Children's Hospital.
      It was mandatory for relevant patient details to be recorded
      into a computer database for all children who came for
      medical attention. During the study period, circumcision
      status was included in the required fields for all boys less
      than 5 years of age. The information was elicited by
      questioning of the parents, or when the parents were
      uncertain or did not have the required English-language
      proficiency, by direct inspection of the penis. Boys who
      fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of UTl were
      excluded.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Statistical analysis.</b> Comparison
      between case patients and control subjects was made by means
      of the chi-square test for categorical variables and the
      Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, with the
      strength of association between circumcision and UTI
      expressed in terms of the odd ratio. To determine whether age
      was a confounder, we stratified the groups by age (&lt;1
      year; &gt;=1 year) and analyzed by the Mantel-Haenszel
      method. The confidence limits for the combined odds ratio
      were generated by the test-based method. The Breslow-Day test
      of homogeneity was used to determine whether age was an
      effect modifier in the association between circumcision and
      UTI Data analyses were carried out with the SAS (SAS
      Institute Inc.. Carry, N.C.) and Minitab statistical packages
      (Minitab Inc., State College, Pa.).</p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="text1"><b>Clinical findings.</b> One hundred
      forty-four cases of UTI were identified. The method of urine
      collection and of counting colony-forming units are given in
      Table I. Escherichia coli was the pathogenic organism in 124
      (86.1%), Proteus sp. in Il (7.6%), Klebsiella sp. and
      Escherichia faecalis in four each (2.8%), and Cornebacterium
      minutissimum in a single case (0.7%).[13] The median age was
      5.8 months, with a range of 0.3 to 54.5 months (Table II).
      Fever, the commonest initial symptom, was present in 111 boys
      (77.1%). Seventy-five boys (52.1%) were hospitalized for at
      least one night, and 7 (9.2%), of 76 boys from whom blood
      culture specimens were obtained, had concomitant bacteremia.
      There were no episodes of meningitis and no deaths.</p>

      (96.5%) at a median time of 7 days after diagnosis (range, 1
      to 35 days), and demonstrated parenchymal abnormality in 55
      boys (39.6%). Vesicoureteric reflux was present in 33 (24.1%)
      of the 137 boys who underwent micturating cystourethrography.
      All boys underwent renal ultrasonography; renal tract
      abnormalities, apart from vesicoureteric reflux were detected

      period for the selection of control subjects, 747 boys less

      symptomatic urinary tract infection was the primary
      diagnosis. The median age of control subjects was 21.0 months
      (range, 0.1 to 59.9 months). Respiratory tract-related
      illness (271), gastrointestinal disease (110), accidents

      <p class="text2">Case patients had a lower median age (5.8
      months) than control subjects had (21.0 months) (Table II).
      To determine whether age was a significant covariate in the
      effect of cir-cumcision on UTI, we compared the ages of
      circumcised and uncircumcised control subjects (Table III).
      There was no evidence of an association between age and
      circumcision status, and therefore no evidence that the
      difference in ages between case subjects and control subjects
      biased the association between circumcision and UTI. Age is
      known to be strongly associated with UTI in boys, so
      stratification by age (&lt;1 year; 1 to 5 years) was
      performed so that the effect of circumcision in groups more
      homogeneous for age could be examined (Table IV). The
      combined odds ratio was 0.18 (95% confidence intervals, 0.05
      to 0.70; chi-square value [Mantel-Haenszel method] = 6.0;p =
      0.01); that is, there was evidence of an association between
      circumcision and UTI after allowance for age. There was no
      evidence that the patient's age modified the protective
      effect of circumcision status on the development of UTI
      (chi-square value = 0.6; p = 0.4).</p>

      <h4>DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text1">The association between circumcision and UTI
      was first recognized by Ginsberg and McCracken<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> in 1982 in a cross-sectional study of
      100 hospitalized infants with UTI. Despite differences in
      study populations and design, all subsequent studies have
      consistently demonstrated an association between an
      uncircumcised state and UTI.</p>

      <p class="text2">The strongest evidence of a causal link
      between an intact foreskin and UTI comes from the series of
      retrospective cohort studies from Wiswell and
      colleagues.<sup><a href="#n5">5,9,10</a></sup> When the
      incidence of UTI in the uncircumcised and the circumcised
      groups was compared,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> the
      relative risk was found to be 0.10. The attributable risk
      percentage* can be calculated to be 90.2%, and the number
      required to be circumcised to prevent one UTI is 99. With a
      relative risk of 0.1, it is unlikely that any confounding
      factor would significantly alter the strength of this
      association. Nonblinded classification and the inclusion of
      selected outcomes (hospitalized infants with UTI) are
      significant potential sources of bias in these studies, and
      no attempt was made to determine whether the protective
      effect of circumcision extended beyond 1 year of age.</p>

      <p class="text2">Only one previous study has examined the
      effect of circumcision on UTI beyond infancy. Spach et
      al.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> published a retrospective
      case-control study of adult men from a sexually transmitted
      disease clinic. Both case and control subjects had urinary
      symptoms, but case subjects had microbiologically proven UTI
      was a significant association between circumcision and UTI,
      but the generalizability of this study to an ambulatory
      pediatric population could be questioned. The biologic
      plausibility of an association between an intact foreskin and
      circumcision has been demonstrated. With electron microscopy,
      uropathogens have been shown to bind avidly to the mucosal
      surface of the foreskin,<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> but
      not to the stratified squamous epithelium, and two studies
      have shown a higher rate of colonization with these organisms
      in the periurethral area of uncircumcised boys compared with
      circumcised boys.<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup> Because
      most available evidence points to the ascending route as the
      mechanism by which urinary pathogens gain access to the renal
      tract, it is plausible that removing the foreskin should
      reduce the frequency of UTI.</p>

      <p class="text2">Our data confirm the findings of previous
      studies in North American populations with relatively high
      rates of circumcision, and demonstrate that UTIs also occur
      more commonly in uncircumcised boys than circumcised boys
      beyond the age of 1 year, and in Australia, where only 16% to
      19% of males are now circumcised (data obtained from Medicare
      Estimates and Statistics Section, Australia, February 1994).
      It is biologically implausible for the association between
      circumcision status and UTI to cease at 1 year of age. The
      relatively low frequency of UTI after the first year of age
      in boys, and the methods used to select subjects, account for
      the absence of an observed effect beyond the first year of
      life in previous publications. In our study, 79.2% of the
      risk of UTI in boys less than 5 years of age can be
      attributed to circumcision status.* The age distribution of
      our case subjects, prevalence of associated renal tract
      abnormalities, and causative urinary pathogens were similar
      to those in other studies.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2,17</a></sup>
      Only 52.5% in our series were hospitalized.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are potential limitations with our
      study design. Selection of case and control subjects was
      sequential rather than simultaneous. However, the assumption
      that the population from which case and control subjects were
      drawn did not change significantly in the intervening period
      is reasonable; the intervening period was only 3 months, and
      there was no evidence of significant changes in the
      prevalence of circumcision with patient age or changes in the
      incidence of UTI. Because UTI is more common in infant boys,
      it was not surprising that case subjects were significantly
      younger than control subjects. Because no association between
      age and circumcision status was demonstrated, age was not
      acting as a confounder in these data.</p>

      <p class="text2">Previous studies have been used as an
      argument for<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> and
      against<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> routine neonatal
      circumcision. Proponents emphasize the short- and long-term
      morbidity and mortality rates associated with UTI.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> In our series of 144 consecutive
      cases of UTI in boys less than 5 years of age, the acute
      illness caused significant short-term morbidity, but death
      and meningitis did not occur. On the basis of the
      number-needed-to-treat analysis calculated from the data of
      Wiswell et al.,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> 99 boys would
      need to be circumcised to prevent one UTI. The true
      complication rate of circumcision is not known, but the
      reported rate is 0.19%<sup><a href="#n">10,19</a></sup> to
      5%,<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> To further quantify this
      risk, one can calculate that, in a cohort of 100 boys
      circumcised to prevent one UTI, 0.2 to 5 boys will have
      complications, albeit usually of a minor nature, in addition
      to the cost and discomfort of the procedure. The incidences
      of permanent renal damage, hypertension, and chronic renal
      failure in children who have had a UTI are not known.</p>

      <p class="text2">We conclude that circumcision is associated
      with a lower incidence of symptomatic UTI in a population
      with a low prevalence of circumcision, and beyond the first
      year of life.</p>
