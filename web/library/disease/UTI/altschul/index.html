        <h2>Cultural Bias and the Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
        Circumcision Controversy</h2>
      </center>

      <center>
        By Martin S. Altschul
      </center>

      <p>Recently much discussion in the circumcision controversy
      has centered on the issue of infant urinary tract infections
      (UTI). This is largely a technical question but it has some
      bearing on the larger ethical and social issues of routine
      newborn circumcision.</p>

      <p>In order to discuss infant UTI intelligently, it is first
      necessary to understand the childhood UTI is in general a
      difficult and confusing diagnosis. If a careful physician and
      an adult patient have a telephone conversation that leads to
      the diagnosis of UTI, the diagnosis will usually, though not
      always, be correct. But if the same conversation passes
      between the physician and the parent of a healthy pre-school
      girl, the UTI diagnosis has, in my experience, an 80% chance
      of being wrong. The comparable figures for a pre-school boy
      approaches 95%.</p>

      <p><i>Even if the child is examined and a urine specimen is
      obtained, UTI misdiagnosis rates are still substantial
      because of the difficulty in obtaining "clean" urine
      specimens from small children.</i> The physician who wishes
      to avoid mistakes must be prepared to make the best possible
      initial diagnosis (UTI or not UTI) and then mistrust his
      (her) first impression sufficiently to make the correct
      diagnosis in the end. This caveat applies both to individual
      clinical cases and to research projects.</p>

      <p>This brings us to newborn circumcision, a surgical
      procedure that is now alleged to prevent UTI. Until recently
      the state of medical "common knowledge" regarding infant male
      UTI was as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        In all age groups except early infancy, females have a much
        higher rate of UTI than males. Male infants are more likely
        to be born with abnormalities of the urinary tract.
        Although such abnormalities are rare, they are the
        predominant cause of infant UTI. Infant UTI is therefore a
        serious condition that often requires surgical correction
        of an underlying cause.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Now enter Dr. Thomas Wiswell, Army pediatrician who did a
      prospective study of UTI in infants, targeting the role, if
      any, of circumcision. The result, which drew widespread
      attention both inside and outside the medical community, was
      that the uncircumcised boys appeared to have twenty times as
      many UTIs as the circumcised ones (4% vs. 0.2%).</p>

      <p>Obviously, this result does not fit with our "common
      knowledge". A condition with 4% incidence is no longer rare.
      And perhaps more disturbing, the crucial connection between
      UTI and urinary birth defects is broken. Circumcision could
      conceivably prevent UTI but it cannot prevent birth defects
      without violating Einstein's Law of Relativity. Because of
      these concerns and others of a similar technical nature, a
      controversy erupted over Wiswell's result, and Wiswell
      responded with more data by doing an indirect review of all
      available hospitalized Army cases. This review also showed a
      twenty-to-one ratio between the two groups of boys but with
      different rates (1.0% and 0.05%). I then did a similar review
      in Northwest Permanente Hospitals. <i>I found not a single
      confirmed case of UTI in a normal male infant. All of the
      confirmed cases occurred in infants who had clear-cut urinary
      birth defects.</i></p>

      <p>Not only is my result dramatically different from
      Wiswell's, my result is perfectly consistent with "common
      knowledge". Now "common knowledge" can be wrong---flat earth
      and so on. But we should never jump to the conclusion that it
      is wrong without <b>hard evidence.</b> In the present case,
      we have some unconfirmed evidence of infants with bacteria in
      their urine. The evidence that the infants were actually
      harmed by these bacteria is practically nonexistent. Indeed,
      if Wiswell's 4% figure was correct, there would have been 80
      uncircumcised infant boys with UTI in my study. What happened
      to these patients if they never got diagnosed? They didn't
      die, they didn't turn up with sepsis (blood poisoning) or
      meningitis, they didn't have kidney transplants. It might be
      supposed that the undiagnosed babies turn up as adults with
      urinary problems, but neither scientific evidence nor "common
      knowledge" supports this notion.</p>

      <p>It <b>is</b> "common knowledge" that girls who have
      recurrent UTI in childhood and are "lost to follow-up" in
      adolescence sometimes turn up in adulthood with serious
      kidney problems. The closest we get to this in the medical
      lore of the male is that middle-aged men often suffer urinary
      problems due to teen-age gonorrhea.</p>

      <p>We are a long way from understanding the relationship, if
      any, between infant UTI and circumcision.</p>

      <p>The incidence of UTI seems to vary widely depending on
      whether the investigator passively collects cases or goes
      fishing for them. How then can this confusing and ambiguous
      scientific question be factored into the larger social and
      ethical controversy over the legitimacy of routine newborn
      circumcision. I believe one must start by establishing a
      basis for discussion that is free of cultural bias.</p>

      <p>Although the numbers vary somewhat, the US is about 75%
      circumcised in the post-war period. However, white
      middle-class "baby-boomers" are almost all circumcised. It is
      not so long since the "routine" circumcision was "Routine"
      with a capital "R", done without discussion or parental
      consent. Many parents still expect it to be done this way.
      Also, the (male) physicians in the US who discuss this issue
      are almost all circumcised. It is therefore inevitable that
      these circumcised physicians have an "I'm OK, you're OK"
      attitude about the state of being circumcised. I can vividly
      recall seeing a Hispanic boy with an intact foreskin exactly
      30 years ago. I thought he had a weird abnormal growth. Bible
      stories notwithstanding, it took me a couple of years to
      figure out the truth. In an attempt to escape this bias, I
      have put newborn (male) circumcision on a list of primitive
      cultural practices that can be discussed together.<a
      href="#mut">[1]</a> Starting with the most obnoxious:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Castration</li>

        <li>Foot binding</li>

        <li>Radical female circumcision or infibulation</li>

        <li>Scarification</li>

        <li>Ubangi lip stretching</li>

        <li>Limited female circumcision</li>

        <li>Male circumcision</li>

        <li>Mayan head deformation</li>

        <li>Maori tattooing</li>

        <li>Ear and nose piercing</li>
      </ol>

      <p>It takes a while for the white middle class American
      physician to digest the fact that newborn (male) circumcision
      fits on this list. It also takes a while to digest the fact
      that circumcision was introduced into this country not as a
      physical hygiene measure but as a mental hygiene measure to
      prevent masturbation. In this context, male circumcision was
      promulgated in the same breath with with clitoridectomy
      (removal of the clitoris) and frontal lobotomy.</p>

      <p>When an American physician says that circumcision prevents
      UTI or cancer of the penis, he is sincere. But, it is like a
      medieval Chinese physician saying that foot binding prevents
      flat feet. <i>If someone asks me, "What rate of preventable
      UTI would justify male circumcision?" I respond by asking,
      "What rate of preventable UTI would justify routine female
      circumcision?"</i> The second question is patently absurd
      unless one's cultural bias allows a sympathetic view of
      female circumcision. Therefore, the first question can be
      only slightly less absurd.</p>

      <p>To put it another way, if newborn circumcision were
      introduced as a new procedure, it would have to be proven
      "safe and effective". It is conceivable that circumcision
      could be proven effective, i.e. that the significant UTI
      prevented might exceed the significant complications of the
      procedure. But to <b>prove safety,</b> it is necessary to
      <b>prove</b> that circumcision does not interfere with the
      <b>sexual</b> functioning of the penis. In the "I'm OK,
      you're OK," culturally-biased discussion, this point is
      easily overlooked. For example, one hears the following
      argument:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The foreskin may have been useful to early man who ran
        naked through the brambles but modern man wears clothes and
        has no need of the thing, so he might as well get rid of it
        and cut down the cancer risk.
      </blockquote>
      My response to this argument is a slight change in the
      wording: 

      <blockquote>
        Breasts may have been useful to early woman who had no
        choice but to suckle her babes. But modern woman has many
        infant feeding options and therefore has no absolute need
        of breasts. She might as well get rid of them and cut down
        on the cancer risk.
      </blockquote>
      Incidentally, breast cancer is 5,000 times more common than
      foreskin cancer. Ounce for ounce, the rate might be the same.
      

      <p>Finally, what is the relationship between the cultural
      bias in this country and the religious aspect of
      circumcision? The history of religious circumcision contains
      some positive elements. It appears that circumcision spread
      in the early Hebraic period as part of a campaign of
      religious reform that suppressed pagan religions that
      practiced human sacrifice. <a
      href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">Medieval Jewish writings
      specifically denied any hygienic function for
      circumcision.</a> Jewish physicians were forbidden by law to
      perform "secular" circumcision of gentiles. Therefore the
      promulgation of secular circumcision in this country from
      1880 to 1950 cannot have been a "Jewish" activity.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the modern secular Jew likes to explain
      religious law as a reflection of practical
      considerations:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The eating of pork was forbidden because pigs carry
        Trichinosis.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This statement probably does not contain a grain of
      historical truth, but its tidy logic is appealing. So we may
      just as well say:</p>

      <blockquote>
        (1930 version) 

        <p>Biblical circumcision was performed in order to improve
        penile hygiene and prevent venereal disease.</p>
      </blockquote>
      or: 

      <blockquote>
        (1890 version) 

        <p>Biblical circumcision was performed in order to prevent
        wicked masturbation and the mental illness that it
        causes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Any day now I expect to see the following update in print: 

      <blockquote>
        (1990 version) 

        <p>Biblical circumcision was performed in order to decrease
        the risk of contracting AIDS.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is a mistake for Jews, Christians, or Moslems to buy
      into the notion that these secular arguments are a legitimate
      part of their cultural heritage.</p>
