            <p>Protective factors in human milk act on mucosal
            membranes in the upper and lower respiratory tract and
            in the gastrointestinal tract. The way in which
            breastfeeding may reduce the risk of infections in a
            more remote site such as the urinary tract will be
            elucidated.</p>

            <p><i>Conclusion:</i> The protective effect of
            breastfeeding on the urinary tract illustrates the
            complexity of the immune defence mechanisms responsible
            for such an action.</p>

      <p class="text2">As time has passed more and more
      well-designed studies with adequate statistical techniques
      have demonstrated that breastfeeding seems to protect against
      several forms of infection in the offspring (<a
      href="#n1">1</a>). Usually it can be realized that the main
      protective factors of human milk function by preventing
      infectious agents from attacking the host via mucosal
      membranes. Thus, infections via the mucosae in the upper and
      lower respiratory tracts, e.g. otitis media, pneumonia and
      upper respiratory tract infections, are significantly reduced
      by breastfeeding (<a href="#n2">2&ndash;4</a>); so too are
      infections via the intestinal mucosa, e.g. neonatal
      septicaemia and diarrhoea (<a href="#n5">5&ndash;7</a>). But
      it is somewhat surprising that breastfeeding may also reduce
      the risk of infections at a more remote site such as the
      urinary tract. This seems to have been confirmed in a
      sizeable, prospective case&ndash;control study with elaborate
      statistical work-up, presented by M&aring;rild et al. in this
      issue of Acta P&aelig;diatrica (<a href="#n8">8</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">It can be understood, however, how defence
      factors in the milk can prevent urinary tract infections
      (UTIs). Such infections are usually caused by facultative
      aerobic bacteria, which ascend from below and originate from
      the intestinal microflora. Those bacteria may have been
      coated by secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies from
      the milk in the breastfed child (<a href="#n9">9</a>). This
      can presumably prevent them from reaching the urinary tract.
      These milk antibodies can bind to the bacteria owing to their
      antibody specificity, because they have been formed in the
      mammary glands by lymphocytes, which have migrated there from
      the lymphoid tissues in the mother&rsquo;s gut (<a
      href="#n10">10</a>). This is why the mother&rsquo;s milk
      protects efficiently against her own intestinal flora, with
      which her baby should have been colonized, especially at
      birth, since the baby, like all newborn mammals, has been
      delivered next to the mother&rsquo;s anus. The milk contains
      such antibodies against the mother&rsquo;s intestinal
      microflora, as well as bacteria that she may have carried in
      the gut previously in life (<a href="#n11">11</a>). This is
      presumably due to the fact that memory cells representing
      such earlier encounters are homing to her lactating mammary
      glands. In addition, the milk sIgA antibodies can bind to
      microbes such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> with type 1 pili,
      which attach to the carbohydrate moiety of the sIgA
      antibodies (<a href="#n12">12</a>). Furthermore,
      breastfeeding seems to enhance type 1 piliation of <i>E.
      coli</i> in the gut, supporting the function of this defence
      mechanism (<a href="#n13">13</a>). In agreement with this,
      IgA-deficient individuals less often carry type 1 piliated
      <i>E. coli</i> in the gut (<a href="#n14">14</a>).
      Furthermore, a recent experimental study indicates that sIgA
      antibodies also may help microbes such as <i>i.E. coli</i> to
      form a biofilm on an epithelial layer, suggesting that
      establishment of a normal gut microflora may be promoted (<a
      href="#n15">15</a>). Breastfeeding results in a stable
      enterobacterial flora with lower counts of enterobacteria
      than seen in bottle-fed infants. The <i>E. coli</i> of
      breastfed infants also carry fewer virulence factors, e.g.
      the K1 capsule, or resistance to the bactericidal effect of
      serum (<a href="#n16">16</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">The mother&rsquo;s milk has at least one
      additional component of apparent importance for protection of
      the urinary tract. As mentioned by M&aring;rild et al. (<a
      href="#n8">8</a>), human milk lactoferrin and fragments
      thereof come out in the urine of the breastfed infant (<a
      href="#n17">17</a>). Lactoferrin, which is a major milk
      protein, not only efficiently kills various microbes, but
      does so without inducing inflammation. This takes place
      mainly by its capacity to block the transcription factor
      nuclear factor-&kappa;B in the nucleus, e.g. of cells in the
      innate immune system (<a href="#n18">18</a>). As a
      consequence, the production of proinflammatory cytokines such
      as interleukin-1&beta; (IL-1&beta;), tumour necrosis
      factor-&alpha; (TNF-&alpha;) and IL-6 is prevented. This kind
      of function seems to be a common theme in the antiinfectious
      capacities of human milk, including sIgA antibodies: to
      protect without inducing energy-costly, tissue-damaging and
      symptom-causing inflammation. Human lactoferrin, or certain
      microbicidal fragments thereof given orally, were shown to
      protect against experimental UTI caused by <i>E. coli</i> in
      mice (<a href="#n19">19</a>). Such lactoferrin and fragments
      also significantly dampened the inflammation and course of
      experimental dextran sulfate-induced colitis in mice (<a
      href="#n20">20</a>). Another such antiinfectious and
      non-inflammatory capacity of the milk is provided by its
      substantial fraction of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates,
      functioning as receptor analogues for uropathogens, blocking
      their attachment to mucosal membranes, as mentioned by
      M&aring;rild et al. (<a href="#n8">8</a>). These components,
      as well as others in the maternal milk, affect the gut
      microflora, presumably making potential uropathogens less
      able to climb the urinary tract and establish infections.
      Some of these milk components even appear in the urine.</p>

      <p class="text2">The authors found a significantly higher
      risk of acquisition of UTIs in non-breastfed than in
      breastfed children. This protection was strongly related to
      gender, in that the hazard ratio for girls was 3.78, but for
      boys 1.63. The reason for this is not clear, but could relate
      to the anatomical differences in the lower urinary tract
      between the genders. A similar observation was made recently
      for the protective capacity of breastfeeding against neonatal
      respiratory tract infections (<a href="#n21">21</a>). Despite
      a detailed analysis, no obvious explanation could be given
      for the finding that good protection was seen in girls, but
      not in boys.</p>

      <p class="text2">M&aring;rild et al. note the prolonged
      protective effect against UTIs of breastfeeding after its
      termination (<a href="#n8">8</a>). This is an interesting
      phenomenon, also suggested for several other infections, e.g.
      otitis media, upper and lower respiratory infections,
      diarrhoea, wheezing bronchitis and <i>Haemophilus
      influenzae</i> type b infections (<a href="#n1">1</a>). The
      enhanced protective capacity has often been shown to last for
      some years and is now understood to occur via several
      mechanisms. Anti-idiotypic antibodies in the milk may prime
      the breastfed infant to a more efficient response of the
      idiotype, e.g. against poliovirus (<a href="#n22">22</a>).
      Lymphocytes in the milk can be taken up by the offspring and
      are capable of priming the child&rsquo;s immune system.
      Numerous other factors in the milk, recently summarized (<a
      href="#n11">11</a>), may add to these effects, e.g. the
      cytokine IL-7, which promotes the development of the
      Peyer&rsquo;s patches and the cryptopatches in the gut
      mucosa, enhancing specifically the production of
      T&gamma;&delta; cells (<a href="#n23">23</a>). It is likely
      that the numerous factors in human milk that seem actively to
      enhance various functions in the breastfed offspring may help
      in the understanding of some of the long-term effects of
      breastfeeding (<a href="#n1">1, 11</a>).</p>

      <p class="text2">The study by M&aring;rild et al. is an
      interesting illustration of how the results of a careful
      clinical study can be put in the perspective of ongoing
      research in several fields, helping researchers to realize
      the enormous complexity of the many mechanisms involved.
      Despite this complexity, the basic knowledge is continuously
      expanding and becoming useful at the clinical level.</p>
