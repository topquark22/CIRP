      <h3>Letters to the editor</h3>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

      <p>Sir,</p>

      <p>Routine neonatal circumcision has been a matter of
      controversy in the United States during the last decade,
      reflected by the fact that not even the Task Force on
      Circumcision was able to give definite recommendations but
      concluded that "circumcision has advantages as well as
      disadvantages". Dr. Schoen, being the chairman of the Task
      Force, has recently presented a broad survey in the <i>New
      England Journal of Medicine</i>, advocating general and
      unanaesthetized circumcision of newborns(<a
      href="#n1">1</a>). However in the same issue of <i>NEJM</i>
      another member of the task force, took an opposite view, i.e.
      circumcision is unwarranted (<a href="#n2">2</a>). Asked by
      the editors of <i>Acta Paediatrica</i> we want to make the
      following comments to Dr. Schoen's letter.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We think
      that the discussion of routine neonatal circumcision should
      focus on the prevention of childhood diseases. With regard to
      prevention of diseases in adult men, it is in our opinion
      more fair to postpone a decision till the young man may make
      a choice of his own.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Balanoposthitis is reduced in circumcised small boys, but
      even a proportion of circumcised boys have penile
      problems.(<a href="#n3">3</a>) The pyelonephritis preventing
      effect of neonatal circumcision, explained by the decrease in
      periurethral colonization with potentially uropathogenic
      bacteria seems well documented (<a href="#n4">4,5</a>).
      However, we think that circumcision is an unphysiologic way
      to solve this problem and we have recently discussed these
      aspects (<a href="#n6">6</a>). It is unprecedented in medical
      history that a common and potentially lethal disease can be
      prevented by extirpation of a piece of healthy tissue of
      universal occurrence in males. we suggested that the effects
      of one unphysiological intervention, e.g. circumcision
      counterbalance those of another, e.g. colonization of the
      baby's gastrointestinal tract and genitals in maternity units
      by Escherichia coli strains of non-maternal origin, to which
      the baby has no passive immunity. We suggest that aspects of
      preputial bacterial colonization should be better studied
      before advice is given about the routine circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      situation is different in babies at high risk for infections
      and severe renal damage, e.g. those with urethral valves or
      uterocele where the obstructions should be eliminated
      immediately, or with grade IV-V vesicouteric reflux,
      especially when associated with intrarenal reflux. These
      conditions are now often diagnosed immediately postnatally as
      a consequence of antenatal sound examinations. In this
      selected group of patients preputial colonization might
      constitute a seizable [sic] risk, where extirpation of the
      prepuce breaks an important link in the chain of events
      leading to UTI. We feel that circumcision in these instances
      should be considered as an alternative to long-term
      antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
      also two ethical aspects which should be considered before
      routine circumcision is recommended. Firstly, it it
      justifiable to operate on 100 babies to prevent infection in
      one, or to operate on 1 000 babies to prevent renal scarring
      in one or two (assuming that 1/5 or 1/10 of those infected
      will attract a scar)? Secondly, when mass circumcision in
      applied, caution or even reluctance against anaesthesia is
      advocated - the risks (and costs?) would be too high(<a
      href="#n1">1</a>). In the debate on circumcision in NEJM,
      provoked by the papers by Dr. Schoen and Dr. Poland, it was
      pointed out that an Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals
      would not accept a procedure such as circumcision on
      laboratory animals without adequate anaesthesia. If
      circumcision is used in only a few selected cases, as
      suggested above, appropriate pain relief can be given. Thus
      the human rights not to be subjected to unnecessary pain will
      be recognized and defended also in the newborn, who as a
      matter of a fact reacts more intensely to painful stimuli
      than other age groups do (<a href="#n7">7,8</a>).</p>
