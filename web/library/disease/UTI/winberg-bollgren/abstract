The prepuce: a mistake of nature?

In: Lancet (1989 Mar 18) 1(8638):598-9

Retrospective studies suggest that circumcision of newborn boys will
  reduce the frequency of male early infantile urinary tract infection
  (UTI) by about 90%. If they are correct, this will be the first known
  instance of a common potentially lethal disease being preventable by
  extirpation of a piece of normal tissue. To reconcile the phenomenon
  with existing views of evolution and biology, it is suggested that
  the effects of one unphysiological intervention are counterbalancing
  those of another--ie, colonisation of the baby's gastrointestinal
  tract and genitals in maternity units by Escherichia coli strains of
  non-maternal origin, to which the baby has no passive immunity. As an
  alternative to circumcision to prevent early infantile male UTI, more
  natural colonisation could be promoted by strict rooming-in of mother
  and baby or by active colonisation of the baby with his mother's
  anaerobic gut flora.
