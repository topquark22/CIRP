      <p><b>Background:</b> A frequently cited rationale for
      routine circumcision is the reduced risk of developing
      urinary tract infection (UTI) among circumcised boys. The
      incidence of UTI has been reported to be 10-20 times higher
      in uncircumcised boys.</p>

      <p><b>Method:</b> An Ontario newborn males cohort was
      followed prospectively for up to five years to study
      circumcision and subsequent risk of hospitalization for UTI.
      Using hospital discharge data from the Canadian Institute for
      Health Information, 61,543 boys born from April 1, 1990 to
      March 31, 1991 were followed for hospitalizations till March
      31, 1995.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Among these eligible boys, 39% (23,872)
      were circumcised and 61% were uncircumcised. The five-year
      probabilities of hospitalization for UTI were 3.7 per 1,000
      (87 cases in the circumcised cohort) and 11.3 per 1,000 (424
      cases in the uncircumcised cohort)(p&lt;0.001). The estimated
      relative risk (RR) indicated that uncircumcised children had
      a significantly higher risk for UTI hospitalization for UTI
      (RR-1.1, 95% CI:2.5,3.8). The cumulative risk for UTI
      hospitalization reaches a peak in the 1st year of life. Six
      hundred and twenty-five infant boys would need to be
      circumcised to prevent one UTI hospitalization in the first 5
      years of life.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> In Ontario, 23,000 infant boys are
      circumcised annually. Uncertainty about the medical
      indications and 3-fold risk of hospitalization from UTI
      supports the notion that neonatal circumcision protects
      infant boys from UTI, the relative risk is low compared to
      the relative risks of UTI reported by others. The large
      numbers of circumcisions needed may be difficult to justify
      on the basis of UTI prevention.</p>
