      <p>Standard practice for collecting a midstream urine
      specimen from boys for bacterial culture has included
      cleansing of the urethral meatus to decrease urine specimen
      contamination.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> A recently
      published study<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> demonstrated
      that meatal cleansing did not decrease specimen contamination
      rates and that contamination rates after collection without
      cleansing were acceptably low. However, the study did not
      provide data on the impact of circumcision status, because
      only 4% (4/102) of the subjects were uncircumcised. Our study
      was performed to determine whether meatal cleansing affects
      the rate of bacterial contamination of mid-stream urine
      specimens collected from healthy, uncircumcised male
      children.</p>

      <h4>METHODS</h4>

      <p>Ninety-nine healthy boys, aged 2 to 15 years, were
      studied. Fifty percent were older than 8 years of age. All
      the boys were uncircumcised and toilet trained, had no
      history of renal disease or urinary tract infections, had no
      congenital or acquired meatal abnormality, had received no
      antibiotics during the previous week, and were afebrile
      during the study. The urine specimens were obtained in the
      pediatric clinic of the Hospital Nacional de Ninos. San Jose,
      Costa Rica. This site was chosen because most Costa Rican
      boys are not circumcised. Written informed consent was
      obtained.</p>

      <p>The first urine specimen was obtained at midstream without
      meatal cleansing and was designated a non-clean-catch urine
      specimen. From 24 to 30 hours after the first specimen
      collection. a second midstream specimen was collected after
      meatal cleansing with 2% castile soap and water; it was
      designated a clean-catch urine specimen. Meatal cleansing and
      specimen collection were preceded by a nonforceful attempt to
      retract the foreskin. When the foreskin was not retracted,
      direct cleansing of the meatus could not take place. All
      specimens were collected in sterile wide-mouth containers,
      under the supervision of a nurse, and were processed
      immediately in an on-site microbiology laboratory. The urine
      specimens were cultured according to standard microbiologic
      methods. The culture media used were trypticase soy agar with
      5% sheep blood and MacConkey agar<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. The culture plates were inoculated
      with the use of a 0.01 ml calibrated loop. Routine procedures
      were used for species identification.</p>

      <p>A sterile urine culture was defined as one producing no
      growth. A contaminated culture was defined as one growing a
      single organism with fewer than 10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming
      units per milliliter of urine, or two or more organisms. A
      positive culture was defined as one growing one organism with
      10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml urine.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS</h4>

      <p>Non-CCU specimens and CCU specimens were obtained from 99
      uncircumcised boys. Cultures of 90 (91%) of the non-CCUs and
      of 94(95%) of the CCUs were sterile. Cultures of seven (7%.)
      of the non-CCUs were contaminated and cultures of two (2%)
      were positive. Cultures of three (3%) of the CCUs were
      contaminated, and cultures of two (2%) were positive. One of
      the contaminated non-CCU cultures and one of the contaminated
      CCU cultures were from the same patient. In addition, one of
      the positive non-CCU cultures and one of the positive CCU
      cultures were from the same patient, but the two cultures did
      not grow the same organism.</p>

      <p>Twenty-four isolates were identified during the study; 17
      were gram-negative organisms and seven were staphylococci.
      The 10 contaminated non-CCU and CCU cultures collectively
      yielded <i>Escerichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella
      sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and
      coagulase-negative <i>staphylococci</i>. Of these
      contaminated cultures, two grew one organism, six grew two
      organisms, and two grew three organisms. The organisms that
      accounted for the four positive urine cultures were <i>S.
      aureus, Serratia liquefaciens, Morganella margagnii</i>, and
      <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. All subjects with a positive urine
      culture underwent urine collection for a repeat culture, and
      all of the repeat cultures were sterile.</p>

      <p>The difference in the sum of the contamination rate and
      the positive rate between the uncleansed and the cleansed
      boys (9% vs 5%) was not statistically significant (Fisher
      exact test; p = 0.2). Moreover, given the study size and the
      observed rates of contamination (positivity) in the compared
      groups, it is unlikely that the true difference in these
      rates was as large as 10% (5% vs 15%; p = 0.05).</p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p>An epidemiologic study published more than 25 years ago
      noted bacterial contamination in only 15 (0.9%) of 1647 urine
      specimens collected from school-aged boys (circumcision
      status of the boys was not noted) without specific
      preparation before voiding.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      Despite this evidence, a current recommendation by the author
      of that study<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> and by
      others<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> includes meatal
      cleansing of males before collection of a voided urine
      specimen for culture.</p>

      <p>A recent study<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> of urine
      contamination rates included 102 healthy boys, 98 of whom
      were circumcised. In these circumcised boys, 5% of non-CCU
      cultures were contaminated and 10% of 85 CCU cultures were
      contaminated (9%) or positive (1%) These differences in
      contamination and positive rates were not statistically
      significant. The authors concluded that cleansing of the
      urethral meatus prior to collecting a urine specimen for
      culture from circumcised boys has no demonstrable
      benefit."<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">When the results from this study of
      uncircumcised boys were compared with those from the
      previously studied circumcised boys, there were no apparent
      differences. The contamination rate was 3% to 9%, and the
      positive rate was 0% to 2% regardless of circumcision status
      or prior cleansing.</span> Follow-up study of the subjects
      with positive urine cultures in the previous study and in the
      present study showed sterile urinary cultures without
      intervening treatment, so these patients were probably not
      infected when the original positive culture was obtained.
      Thus the "positive" cultures were probably "contaminated"
      cultures.</p>

      <p>The organisms isolated in our study of uncircumcised boys
      were gram-negative species in most cases. <span
      class="yellow">In contrast, the organisms isolated in the
      previous study<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> of circumcised
      boys were <i>corynebacteria</i>, <i>streptococci</i>, and
      <i>staphylococci</i>.</span> The importance of this
      interesting difference is not clear.</p>

      <p>We conclude that even in uncircumcised males, meatal
      cleansing does not significantly decrease rates of
      contaminated urine cultures or positive urine cultures; that
      rates of contaminated and positive urine cultures after no
      cleansing are acceptably low; and that rates of contaminated
      and positive urine cultures do not appear to differ from
      rates of cultures of urine from circumcised boys.</p>

      advice.</p>
