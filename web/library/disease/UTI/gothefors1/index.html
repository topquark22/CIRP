      <h2>Breast feeding and biological properties of faecal E.
      coli strains.</h2>

      <p><b>Gothefors L, Olling S, Winberg J.</b></p>

      <p>Human milk may contribute to protection against
      gram-negative infection by promoting intraluminal
      agglutination or killing of bacteria or by preventing
      bacterial attachment to epithelial surfaces. This paper
      explores the effect of human milk on the sensitivity of
      faecal E. coli to serum bactericidal activity and
      agglutination specificity, factors which have been regarded
      as related to virulence. Faecal E. coli isolated from
      breast-fed infants differed from those from formula-fed
      infants in two respects: They were more sensitive to the
      bactericidal effect of human serum and more often
      spontaneously agglutinating. E. coli strains isolated from
      sources outside the gastro-intestinal tract, that is the
      prepuce and female peri-urethral region, were in breast-fed
      babies less sensitive than faecal strains. The findings are
      compatible with the hypothesis that a breast-milk factor
      favours the proliferation of mutant strains. <span
      class="yellow">The observed effects of breast-milk might be
      associated with decreased bacterial virulence, and be one of
      the ways in which breast-feeding protects against
      infection.</span></p>
