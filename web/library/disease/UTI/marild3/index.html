      <h2>Incidence rate of first-time symptomatic urinary tract
      infection in children under 6 years of age.</h2>

      <p>A retrospective population-based study was performed to
      describe the incidence rate of first time symptomatic urinary
      tract infection in children under 6 y of age. A total number
      of 299 children was identified during the 20-month study
      period in a population of 20,000 girls and 21,000 boys. The
      cumulative incidence rate during the first 6 y of life was
      6.6% for girls and 1.8% for boys. The annual incidence rate
      in girls of urinary tract infection/1000 at risk was between
      9 and 14 for each of the six 1-y age intervals. In girls, the
      proportion of febrile urinary tract infection was high during
      the infant year, while girls older than 2 y most often had
      non-febrile infection. For infant boys, the incidence rate
      and the proportion of febrile urinary tract infection were
      comparable to that of girls, while after the first year of
      life urinary infection of any kind was rare, with an
      incidence rate of 1-2/1000 at risk.</p>
