<P><I>Is routine circumcision advised in boys with obstructive
uropathy in order to prevent urinary tract infection?</I>

<P>Uncircumcised males run a 10 times higher risk of getting early
infantile symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) than circumcised
ones [1]. these figures have been used to advocate circumcision of
all newborns. However, this is not a biological approach to a
biological problem [2]. There is also an ethical aspect to this
question: is it justifiable to operate on 100 babies to prevent
infection in 1, and is it justifiable to operate on 1000 babies to
prevent renal scarring in 1 or 2 (assuming that 1/5 or 1/10 of
those infected will develop a scar)?

<P>The situation is different in babies at high risk of infection
and severe renal damage, i.e. those with low obstructions such as
urethral valves or ureterocele or with grade IV - V vesico-ureteral
reflux, especially when associated with intrarenal reflux. These
conditions are now diagnosed with increasing frequency as a
consequence of antenatal ultrasound examinations of the babies with
dilatation of the upper urinary tract.

<P>The abundant <I>Escherichia coli</I> colonization of the prepuce,
encouraged by bacterial adhesion to its inside [3], is associated
with increased risk of urethral <I>E.coli</I> colonization [1],
and from there ascent of uropathogenic strains to the urinary tract.
This might in this selected group of patients constitute a sizeable
risk. Since extirpation of the prepuce breaks an important link in
the chain of events leading to UTI, I feel that it would be worth
while to consider circumcision in these instances. If this could
be done as a controlled multi-centre study we might avoid all the
mistakes and ill-supported statements, which have lined our attempts
to prevent UTI and scarring.

<P>There is still another ethical aspect. When mass circumcision
is applied, caution or even reluctance to use anaesthesia has been
advocated -- the risks (and costs?) would be too big [4]. If
circumcision is used in a few selected cases, as suggested above,
appropriate pain relief can be given. Thus the human right not to
be subjected to unnecessary pain will be recognized and defended
also in the newborn, who as a matter of fact reacts more intensively
[sic] to painful stimuli than do other age groups [5,6].</P>
