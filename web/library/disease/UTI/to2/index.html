      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Background</b> A decrease in risk of urinary-tract
        infection is one of the most commonly given reasons for
        circumcision of newborn boys. Previous studies have
        reported rates of UTI to be 10-20 times higher in
        uncircumcised than in circumcised boys. This
        population-based cohort study followed neonates in Ontario,
        Canada, prospectively to study the relation between
        circumcision and subsequent UTI risk.</p>

        <p><b>Methods</b> Eligible boys were born to residents of
        Ontario between April 1, 1993, and March 31, 1994. We used
        hospital discharge data to follow up boys until March 31,
        1996.</p>

        <p><b>Findings</b> Of 69 100 eligible boys, 30 105 (43.6%)
        were circumcised and 38 995 (56.4%) uncircumcised. 888 boys
        circumcised after the first month of life were excluded.
        29217 uncircumcised boys were matched to the remaining
        circumcised boys by date of birth. The 1-year probabilities
        of hospital admission for UTI were 1.88 per 1000
        person-years of observation (83 cases up to end of
        follow-up) in the circumcised cohort and 7.02 per 1000
        person-years (247 cases up to end of follow-up) in the
        uncircumcised cohort (p&lt;&lt;0.0001). The estimated
        relative risk of admission for UTI by first-year follow-up
        indicated a significantly higher risk for uncircumcised
        boys than for circumcised boys (3.7 [2.8-4.9]). 195
        circumcisions would be needed to prevent one hospital
        admission for UTI in the first year of life.</p>

        <p><b>Interpretation</b> Although our findings support the
        notion that circumcision may protect boys from UTI, the
        magnitude of this effect may be less than previously
        estimated.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text">Circumcision for infant boys remains
      controversial, but it is still a common procedure. About one
      in six boys and men in the world has been circumcised, in
      most cases for religious reasons.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The medical reasons most commonly
      given for circumcision of infant boys are: to prevent
      phimosis, paraphimosis, and balanitis; to decrease the risk
      of cancer of the penis; and to decrease the risk of
      urinary-tract infection (UTI) among infants.</p>

      <p class="text">According to the US National Center for
      Health Statistics, 61% of the 1.95 million boys born during
      1987 in the USA were circumcised; thus, circumcision was the
      commonest surgical procedure done in boys in the USA.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> A declining tend has been observed by
      Wiswell, who reported that the proportion of infants
      circumcised in US military hospitals, involving a large,
      widely dispersed population, had substantially decreased,
      from about 85% in 1975 to about 70% 9 years later. During the
      late 1980s, there was an increase in the rate of
      circumcision. The rate of circumcision in 1970 was 48% in
      Canada, 24% in the UK, and 70% in Australia.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Based on in-hospital circumcision of
      infants younger than 28 days old in Ontario during 1985-95,
      the rate in the province remained almost constant at
      35%.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> After a sharp increase in
      the rate of circumcision in 1991 (from 35% to 42%) there was
      a slow decline to 30% by 1995.</p>

      <p class="text">Most previous studies, with case-control
      designs, compared the rate of UTI in the first year of life
      among circumcised and uncircumcised boys. Although these
      studies suggested a protective effect of circumcision on the
      risk of UTI in boys, they did not follow up children
      prospectively to observe the risk of subsequent UTI.
      Questions remain about both short-term and long-term benefits
      of circumcision. We used population-based data to follow up
      circumcised and uncircumcised boys for up to 3 years from
      birth. Their risk of UTI was calculated and compared by
      life-table and cohort analyses.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <h4>Study population</h4>

      <p class="text">Computerised data from the Canadian Institute
      for Health Information on hospital discharges in Ontario were
      used for fiscal years 1993-94 to 1995-96 (April 1 to March 31
      of the following year). Collection of hospital discharge data
      for submission to the Institute is mandatory for all
      hospitals in Canada. Data are collected on all patients
      discharged from public, private, and federal hospitals in
      Ontario, including acute-care and chronic-care hospitals and
      acute psychiatric hospitals. Therefore, all UTIs that
      necessitated hospital admission were included in this study.
      The database includes, for each patient on each hospital
      stay, demographic (birth date, sex, and place of residence)
      and clinical data (admission date, discharge date, length of
      stay, codes from the International Classification of
      Diseases, 9th revision for discharge diagnoses [ICD9; up to
      16 fields], and procedures undertaken). Studies by
      researchers in Canada suggest that the data held by the
      Canadian Institute for Health Information contain complete
      demographic information on patients (eg, age, sex, and
      residence codes) and good quality information on surgical
      procedures<sup><a href="#n5">6,7</a></sup> (and unpublished
      papers by the Institute for Clinical Evaluation Sciences in
      Ontario).</p>

      <p class="text">Reasons for exclusion from the study were
      lack of a valid health-care number, multiple birth, and
      stillbirth. So that the cohort consisted of initially healthy
      infants, those with any major complications at birth were
      also excluded (4% of single male livebirths). Compared with
      singleton liveborn babies, offspring of multiple pregnancies
      have a higher frequency of complications at birth (eg, low
      birthweight, prematurity, death). Since multiple births
      constituted only 2% of the total population of male infants,
      they were excluded from this study. Children who were
      circumcised after the first month of life were also excluded
      (2.9%). None of these children developed subsequent UTI
      during the 2-3 years of observation.</p>

      <p class="text">All boys with a Canadian Institute for Health
      Information entry code of NB (newborn) born to residents of
      Ontario in fiscal year 1993 were included. Two cohorts of
      male infants were identified--circumcised (defined by the
      Canadian Classification Procedure Code during the first month
      of life 76.0) and uncircumcised (no circumcision during the
      2-3 years of observation). From April 1, 1993, the
      health-care number was used to follow up the infants from
      birth to March 31, 1996.</p>

      <h4>Follow-up</h4>

      <p class="text">Personal identifiers were available from
      April 1, 1993, until March 31, 1996, and are essential in
      tracing individuals for their readmissions. Identifiers used
      in linking the initial birth record to the subsequent
      hospital admissions were date of birth and health-care
      number/Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) number. The OHIP
      fee-for-service payments fund diagnostic tests and
      physicians' services in Ontario. Each child was followed up
      from birth to the first occurrence of UTI or to the end of
      March, 1996.</p>

      <p class="text">The main outcome measure was hospital
      admission for UTI. We used the following ICD-9 codes to
      define UTI--infections of the kidneys (590), cystitis (595),
      urethritis (597), and other unspecified UTI (599). Cases of
      UTI necessitating hospital admission generally represent the
      most severe of the broad range of UTIs, and are, thus most
      relevant with respect to the balance of harm and benefit in
      terms of both cost and morbidity.</p>

      <h4>Analyses</h4>

      <p class="text">We used the life-table method to calculate
      the cumulative probability of hospital admission for UTI, the
      log-rank statistic to compare the cumulative probabilities
      between the two cohorts, and Cox proportional-hazards
      regression to model the risks of hospital admission for UTI.
      Cases of UTI not resulting in hospital admission were not
      captured in this study. Hospital admission rates were
      expressed as rates per 1000 Ontario male population, with
      population figures based on the Canada Census 1991 data. All
      data analyses were done with SAS software (version 6.11).</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p class="text">69&nbsp;100 eligible infant boys were
      included in the study. 30&nbsp;105 (43.6%) were circumcised
      and 38&nbsp;995 uncircumcised. Of the circumcised boys,
      almost all (29&nbsp;217 [97.1%]) underwent the procedure
      during the first month of life. The 888 boys who were
      circumcised after the first month of life were excluded. No
      infant had UTI before his circumcision. Of the 38&nbsp;995
      uncircumcised boys, 29&nbsp;217 were matched to boys in the
      circumcised cohort by date of birth. Since the birth cohort
      includes babies who were born between April, 1993, and March,
      1994, the aim of age-matching procedure was to ensure that
      the circumcised and uncircumcised babies had equal length of
      follow-up.</p>

      <p class="text">During the 2-3 years of follow-up, 7960
      (27.2%) circumcised boys and 7270 (24.9%) uncircumcised boys
      were readmitted to hospital. The median number of admissions
      was one for both groups. Thus, the two cohorts did not differ
      significantly in median number of admissions or proportions
      of readmissions. The median lengths of stay in hospital for
      UTI or other disorders were identical in the two study
      cohorts (9.0 days for UTI admissions and 3.0 days for non-UTI
      admissions).</p>

      <p class="text">83 circumcised boys were readmitted to
      hospital for UTI compared with 247 uncircumcised boys (table
      1). Of the 83 circumcised boys with UTI, 79 (95%) had one
      hospital admission for UTI, and four had two admissions.
      Among the 247 uncircumcised boys with UTI, 224 (91%) had one
      admission for UTI, 22 (9%) had two, and one had six.</p>

      <p class="text">The OHIP data (physicians' billings) were
      used to characterise the outpatient health services used by
      the two study cohorts. There was an average in the first year
      of life of 26.3 billings in the circumcised cohort and 25.7
      in the uncircumcised cohort. Most of the billings were for
      well-baby visits and immunisations. The distribution of types
      of billing did not differ between the cohorts.</p>

      <p class="text">At 1-year follow-up there were 624 outpatient
      billings for UTI among the circumcised cohort and 973 among
      the uncircumcised cohort. In addition, at 1-year follow-up,
      there were 55 and 205 hospital admissions for UTI,
      respectively (table 1). Thus, the ratios of outpatient UTI
      billings to inpatient UTIs for the circumcised and
      uncircumcised cohorts were 11.3 (624/55) and 4.7 (973/205),
      respectively. These billings cannot be taken as synonymous
      with incident UTIs, but represent the aggregate services for
      diagnosis/treatment visits and some immediate follow-up or
      referrals.</p>

      <p class="text">There were some differences between cohorts
      in proxy measures of socioeconomic status. A higher
      proportion of families of uncircumcised infants than of
      circumcised infants came from low-income (less than C$35 000)
      postal-code areas (63.0 vs 58.5%, p&lt;&lt;0.001). The
      proportion of individuals with low educational attainment
      (individuals 15 years and older with less than 10 years of
      education) was also higher in the uncircumcised than in the
      circumcised cohort (47.3 vs 52.6%, p&lt;&lt;0.001).</p>

      <p class="text">Of the 25 549 admissions to hospital during
      the 2-3 years of follow-up among the two study cohorts, 330
      (5.6 per 1000 person-years) were for UTI. Both cohorts showed
      low probabilities of hospital admission for UTI (life-table
      method), though the probability was higher in the
      uncircumcised cohort than in the circumcised cohort. The
      1-month probability of admission for UTI was 1.54 per 1000 in
      the uncircumcised cohort and 0.34 per 1000 in the circumcised
      cohort (p&lt;&lt;0.0001, table 1). The corresponding 1-year
      probabilities were 7.02 and 1.88 per 1000
      (p&lt;&lt;0.0001).</p>

      <p class="text">The relative risk of admission for UTI in the
      first month of life for uncircumcised compared with
      circumcised boys was 4.5 times (95% CI 2.4-8.4). The relative
      risk decreased steadily during the follow-up period to 3.7
      (2.8-4.9) at 1 year. Because of the difference in indicators
      of socioeconomic status (low-income postal-code area and low
      educational attainment) between the cohorts, these variables
      were included in the regression model to control for
      potential confounding effects. Circumcision status
      (uncircumcised) remained as the only factor significantly
      associated with UTI admission rates (estimated relative risk
      3.7 [2.8-5.0], p&lt;&lt;0.0001). Cox proportional-hazards
      regression (which accounts for both the matched cohort design
      and time to UTI) also estimated an increased risk of UTI for
      the uncircumcised cohort (relative risk 3.0 [2.4-3.9]).</p>

      <p class="text">The attributable risk (also called risk
      difference) of UTI at 1 year was 5.14 per 1000 (7.02 minus
      1.88 per 1000, table 1). From this risk measure, we estimated
      that 195 circumcisions would be needed to prevent one
      admission for UTI in the first year of life.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text">A substantially lower incidence of UTI among
      circumcised boys has been cited as one of the major benefits
      of circumcision. In 1982, Ginsburg and McCracken<sup><a
      href="#n">8</a></sup> reported an inverse association between
      UTI and circumcision in infant boys based on 109 UTI cases,
      of which 95% were in uncircumcised boys. Subsequent studies
      have confirmed a higher rate of UTI in uncircumcised than in
      circumcised boys (Table 2).</p>

      <p class="text">Since rate of admission for UTI is low, a
      large number of participants is required to show any
      significant effect of circumcision. Our study used a cohort
      based on population data (including almost 60 000 infants) to
      estimate subsequent UTI risk in relation to circumcision. The
      advantages of this population-based cohort design are the
      inclusion of babies from the complete sociodemographic range
      from a universal health-care coverage system. Several
      previous studies<sup><a href="#n9">9,10,12</a></sup> were
      based on subsamples of the general population (infants born
      in US army hospitals). Whether this sample is representative
      of a general population is not clear.</p>

      <p class="text">One of the limitations of our study is that
      we cannot say for certain that no uncircumcised child
      included had a circumcision outside the hospital setting,
      since we had information only on hospital circumcisions. The
      OHIP data (physicians' billings) showed that about 3% of
      circumcisions were done by clinicians outside the hospital
      setting. No existing systematic database captures all
      circumcisions on children. Previous studies shared the same
      limitation, since they were also based on hospital data.</p>

      <p class="text">The lack of accurate information on
      outpatient reports of UTI among children is another
      limitation of the study. We were unable to study directly the
      rate of UTIs that did not necessitate admission to hospital.
      There are no comprehensive population-based data in North
      America that could be used to account accurately for the rate
      of UTI treated without hospital admission. Previous studies
      had no estimates of outpatient rates.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8-10,12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">We could not directly study the incidence of
      outpatient UTIs in Ontario, but we have estimated the rates
      of these infections in our study population from physicians'
      billings. The results suggest that we have not underestimated
      the risk ratio--for every circumcised infant admitted for
      UTI, there were 11 outpatient billings for UTI compared with
      five for the uncircumcised infants. Therefore, there is no
      evidence to suggest that the incidence of outpatient UTIs
      could have been significantly differentially underestimated
      in the circumcised population. In fact, if the billings
      accurately estimate the incidence of outpatient UTIs, the
      relative risk for all UTIs in uncircumcised compared with
      circumcised boys would be decreased to 1.73. These
      observations support our findings that the previously
      reported relative risks of UTI in uncircumcised infants
      overstate the current risks.</p>

      <p class="text">The range of presentations and complications
      from UTIs may differ between circumcised and uncircumcised
      boys. No study has directly addressed this issue. The impact
      of this differential misclassification on the estimated size
      of clinical benefit is likely to be negligible because UTIs
      necessitating admission represent the more severe cases. The
      morbidity associated with outpatient infection may be of more
      questionable clinical and financial significance; thus the
      relative risk for UTIs necessitating admission may reflect
      the most important difference in disease burden between the
      groups.</p>

      <p class="text">In Ontario each year, 23 000 infant boys are
      circumcised. A 10-year trend analysis reflected declining
      circumcision rates in Ontario since 1991-92 but with large
      geographical variations.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The
      uncertainty about the medical indications for and benefits of
      circumcision continues to raise important questions about
      this procedure as a medical intervention. Our
      population-based cohort study estimated that 195
      circumcisions were needed to prevent one hospital admission
      for UTI in the first year of life. Our estimated relative
      risk for admission for UTI of 3.7 was similar to that
      reported by Craig and colleagues<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> (4.8, table 2) but lower than
      estimates reported by others.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9-12</a></sup> Studies published since the early
      1980s showed a consistent protective effect of circumcision
      against UTI.</p>

      <p class="text">We conclude that although our study findings
      support the notion that circumcision may protect infant boys
      from UTI, <span class="yellow">the magnitude of this effect
      is significantly less than previously estimated.</span></p>
