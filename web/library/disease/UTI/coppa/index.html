      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Since protective factors were demonstrated
      in human milk in 1892<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> there
      have been many attempts to prove that breastfeeding has a
      defensive role against various infections.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-4</a></sup> Human milk gives protection against
      intestinal tract infections, helps the host defence of the
      respiratory apparatus, and reduces the incidence of otitis
      media.<sup><a href="#n5">5-6</a></sup> Moreover,
      breastfeeding gives effective protection to the newborn at
      high risk of infection<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> and
      prevents neonatal sepsis.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Here we present preliminary evidence
      suggesting that human milk may help to protect against
      infection of the urinary tract.</p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p class="text1">30 days after delivery, 24 h urine
      collection samples were made from ten nursing mothers and
      their babies; a sample of milk was also taken from each
      mother. All of the mothers were term, were healthy and were
      aged 18-27 years. The babies were all healthy and normal in
      their development during the first month. A pool of 500 ml
      human milk was also obtained by mixing several samples of
      colostrums. All samples were stored at -80&deg;C. The
      oligosaccharides in the milk and urine samples were
      characterised by means of thin-layer chromatography
      (TLC)<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> and high-performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC). Milk samples were prepared for
      HPLC by addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile and
      centrifugation at 3500 g for 5 min. The supernatant was
      filtered through a 0.22 &micro;m membrane (Millipore,
      Bedford, Massachusetts, USA. 20&micro;l of the filtrate was
      injected into the HPLC system. Urine samples were prepared by
      filtration only.</p>

      <p class="text2">HPLC used a Kontron 420 dual-piston pump
      (Basle, Switzerland) and a refractive index detector. The
      column was a 250 x 5 mm &lsquo;Sperisorb S 5NH&rsquo;
      (Kontron). The elution solvent was water/acetonitrile (40/60
      by volume) and the flow rate 1ml/min. An electronic
      integrator was used to measure the peak areas, which were
      expressed as concentration. A mixture of purified milk
      oligosaccharides (BioCarb, Lund, Sweden) was used as
      standard; the total amount of oligosaccharides was calculated
      from the peak areas.</p>

      <p class="text2">Oligosaccharides were isolated from the 500
      ml pool of colostrums<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> and
      fractionated by gel filtration.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Each fraction was analysed for total
      sugar<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> and sialic acid
      content<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> and characterized by
      TLC.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Fractions with similar
      biochemical properties were combined in four pools and
      lyophilized.</p>

      <p class="text2">For the study of bacterial adhesion we used
      as <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain isolated from the urine of
      a female infant with urinary tract infection; it was
      characterizsed as bearing mannose-resistant adhesions
      agglutinating human erythrocytes of group A, Rh+, P1.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> From the date of isolation until
      use, the bacterial cells were kept on deep agar slab
      cultures. Adhesion testing was done essentially according to
      Svanborg Ed&egrave;n et al.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      Uroepithelial cells, obtained from the morning urinary
      sediment of healthy women, were washed and suspended in
      phosphate-buffered saline. To 10<sup>5</sup> such cells we
      added 108 bacteria and phosphate bacteria and
      phosphate-buffered saline to a final volume of 1 ml. After
      incubation at 37&deg;C for 1 h with rotation at 20 rpm,
      unattached bacteria were removed by repeated washing in
      phosphate-buffered saline. Adherence was measured as the mean
      number of bacteria attached to 40 epithelial cells by means
      of light microscopy. The ability of pools of milk
      oligosaccharides to inhibit attachment was tested by
      preincubation of the bacteria and oligosaccharide suspensions
      (6mg/ml) for 30 min at 37&deg;C, before the addition of the
      uroepithelial cells; the washing of the bacteria was omitted.
      Control cells not incubated with bacteria showed no adherent
      bacteria.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="text1">The urine sample from a 24-year-old healthy
      non-lactating woman contained only faint bands indicating
      carbohydrates, whereas substantial amount of sugars were seen
      in the urine from a lactating woman (fig 1). The pattern of
      oligosaccharides in the urine of the lactating mother and
      that of her child was very similar to that see in her milk in
      all ten subjects. In contrast, cow&rsquo;s milk contained
      almost exclusively lactose, with only traces of other
      oligosacharides. The composition of oligosaccharides excreted
      in urine by the infant correlated strongly with that of the
      mother&rsquo;s milk (fig 2).</p>

      <p class="text2">By means of HPLC we calculated the amount of
      oligosaccharides excreted daily in the urine by breastfed
      babies and their mothers. Daily excretion by the babies was
      300-500 mg and by the mothers 500-800 mg.</p>

      <p class="text2">The extent of inhibition of bacterial
      adherence by the pooled milk oligosaccharides seemed to be
      related to the size of the oligosaccharides-pool 4
      (containing trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides) had the
      greatest effect and pool 1 (containing high-molecular-weight
      sialylated oligosaccharides) had no effect (see table).</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Human Milk contains several antiviral and
      antibacterial factors<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> and
      in-vitro antimicrobial activities varies with the
      infant&rsquo;s age according to the different pathogens most
      common in infants of that age.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A fundamental role in the defence against
      infections has been attributed to the IgAs, but human milk
      contains many other non-immunoglobulin protective factors
      (eg, lysozyme, complement fractions, lactoferrin) whose
      biological role is still only partly understood.</p>

      <p class="text2">Bacterial adhesion to epithelial surfaces is
      an important prerequisite for infection.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Adhesion is generally established by
      binding of the bacteria to the specific receptors of the host
      cell surface. Most receptors are oligosaccharide residues of
      glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell membrane.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The protection against <i>E. coli</i> and
      <i>Vibrio Cholarae</i> affored by human milk is due the
      presence of glucidic compounds,<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> and oligosaccharides from human milk
      can inhibit the adhesion of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>
      to human pharyngeal and buccal epithelial cells<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> and bacterial adherence to pig
      intestineal epithelial cells in vitro.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Human milk contains substantial amount of
      oligosaccharides (several g/l), especially in the colostral
      phase.<sup><a href="#n9">9 23 24</a></sup> Little is known
      about the metabolic fate of these substances in the newborn
      infant. Only traces of oligosaccharides are present in the
      urine of normal subjects with the exception of women in the
      last trimester of pregnancy, nursing mothers,<sup><a
      href="#n25">25 26</a></sup> and patients with some metabolic
      diseases.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">We have found substantial amounts of
      oligosaccharides in the urine of breastfed infants during the
      first month of life. These compounds have structural
      similarities to the receptors of host-cell surfaces, and each
      host-cell type has a different spectrum of oligosaccharide
      structure.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> Rosenstein et
      al<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> showed that some
      oligosaccharides of human milk bound to <i>E. coli</i>
      isolated from a patient with urinary tract infection. <span
      class="yellow">This evidence, together with the inhibition of
      bacterial adhesion caused by a particular fraction of human
      milk oligosaccharides suggests that the protective effect
      against infections that human milk affords the baby could be
      extended to the urinary tract of not only the infant but also
      the mother.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Of course, caution is necessary in
      extrapolating these in-vitro findings to human beings.</p>
