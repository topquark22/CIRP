      <h2>Effect of confounding in the association between
      circumcision status and urinary tract infection.</h2>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To estimate the impact of confounding
      in the association between circumcision status and urinary
      tract infection from epidemiological factors, sample
      collection, and health-seeking behaviors in the first year of
      life.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Beginning with the assumption that true
      urinary tract infection occurred equally regardless of
      circumcision status, a Markov model incorporating the
      differences in the rates of prematurity, of urine collection,
      of false positive urine specimens, and of health-seeking
      behaviors in infant boys based on circumcision status was
      developed. Using this model, the rates of false-positive
      urine cultures, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and true urinary
      tract infection detected in the first year of life were
      estimated and contrasted. Error of the model was estimated
      using Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Keeping the incidence of true urinary
      tract infection constant between groups, the factors included
      in the model could account for urinary tract infection being
      diagnosed 4.27 times more frequently in non-circumcised males
      under a year of age.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Previously
      reported differences in the rate of urinary tract infection
      by circumcision status could be entirely due to sampling and
      selection bias. Until clinical studies adequately control for
      sources of bias, circumcision should not be recommended as a
      preventive for urinary tract infection.</span></p>
