        <p>Neonatal circumcision may decrease the incidence of
        urinary tract infection (UTI), and so the literature was
        reviewed to address their methodological limitations of the
        studies, and to analyze the data in individual and grouped
        form. A systematic search of the publications on
        circumcision and UTI was conducted in Index Medicus
        (1975-1991) and Medline (1988-1991). Six papers were
        included in the meta analysis because these presented
        original data obtained from groups of babies. All of the
        selected articles were considered in individual and grouped
        form to calculate odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval
        (Cl) at 95%. The number of patients included in each study
        ranged from 112 to 219,775. Clustering of the articles
        enabled us to obtain a total sample number of 221,799
        infants. In each article there was a higher risk of UTI in
        intact patients (OR from 10.82 to 156.42). The global risk
        obtained from the six studies was of 13.05 with a CI (95%)
        ranging from 10.86 to 15.70. Intact male infants have low
        risk of UTI in the first year and the risk may decrease
        even more with circumcision. This conclusion may not be
        considered as definitive because of the methodological
        limitations of the reviewed studies. Recommendation of
        routine circumcision of all newborns is not justified with
        the data. Urinary tract infection; neonatal circumcision;

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p>In 1975 the Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision stated that
      "There is no absolute medical indication for routine
      circumcision in the newborn period".<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> In 1983 The American Academy of
      Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists in their joint publication Guidelines to
      Perinatal Care supported this viewpoint.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Nevertheless, circumcision continued
      to be done on the large majority of infants in the United
      States of America after the above statements were
      published<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>. It seems though in
      the recent years that the frequency of this procedure has
      somewhat diminished<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>In 1989 The Task Force on Circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> published a different statement in
      which the original recommendation was substantially changed.
      The new position stated that "circumcision of the newborn
      male infant has medical benefits and potential advantages,
      but there were concerns and risks". The benefits and
      advantages alluded to are the prevention of phimosis,
      paraphimosis, and balanoposthitis, a decrease in the
      incidence of penile cancer in circumcised males<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and of cervico-uterine cancer in their
      female partners<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>, a decreased
      risk of acquiring sexually transmitted disease (STD)<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> and the diminished frequency of
      urinary tract infections among infants<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> with possible reduction in the rate
      of chronic terminal renal failure<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,12</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>The attended risks are infections, hemorrhages, meatitis
      with ulcers or stenosis and loss of the glans or the whole
      penis.</p>

      <p>Several reviewers of the available evidence on this issue
      have stated that in the absence of well-designed prospective
      trials, the nexus between circumcision and UTI cannot be
      considered definitive<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,14,15</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>Meta-analysis is a epidemiological tool which combines the
      results of different studies, with the intent of obtaining
      validity about diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy and risk
      factors<sup><a href="#n16">16,17</a></sup>. This method
      initially was only used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and
      was exclusively considered in the domain of clinical
      experiments. Indeed the technique demonstrated great promise
      in observational studies<sup><a href="#n18">18,19</a></sup>.
      The odds ratio is a good estimate of relative risk when the
      disease of interest is rare. The relative risk is the ratio
      between two rates of incidence: the incidence of developing
      disease in those subjects exposed to a attended risk compared
      to the incidence of developing disease in those subjects not
      exposed to attended risk<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>Our evaluation of the literature on circumcision and UTI
      was conducted to demonstrate the methodological limitations
      of the published studies, to the group the results by
      meta-analysis and to assess the cost benefits of
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h4>

      <p>A systematic search was conducted of the relevant articles
      listed in Index Medicus from January 1975 to June 1991, as
      well as data from the years 1988 to 1991 included in the
      Medline computer search system with infant circumcision and
      UTI as index items. In the selection of studies
      methodological characteristics were taken into account. In
      the selection process the authors were blinded to the final
      results and conclusions. Unpublished articles were not sought
      for; neither were abstracts of studies presented at
      conferences, or conclusions of these; since it was considered
      that the incorporation of this sort of information would
      diminish the precision of the data<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup>. Only those studies incorporating a
      comparison group were included. Descriptive studies were
      excluded since these do not allow the calculation of the risk
      factors. Only seven studies with original patient data were
      found<sup><a href="#n3">3,4,10,13</a>, <a
      href="#n22">22-24</a></sup>. Of these only six were eligible;
      one was excluded as it had no comparison group. Two<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,4</a></sup> of the studies were grouped together
      as the patient population was the same. All the studies were
      of an observational type in which the cohorts were assessed
      prospectively as well as retrospectively. As our objective
      was to avoid of the biased choice of published estimates, it
      was decided to calculate the actual estimates of risk in
      confidence intervals using the crude data as the authors
      presented them. <span class="yellow">It is important to
      recognize that none of the studies focused on the risks of
      the circumcision procedure.</span></p>

      <p>The meta-analysis was divided into two phases: in the
      first phase a qualitative analysis was done with the intent
      of evaluating the quality of the eligible studies. In this
      regard the criteria of quality as proposed by Jenicek were
      used. In the second phase a quantitative analysis was
      performed to calculate the risk of UTI in the intact
      state.</p>

      <p>The studies were considered in individual and group form
      for the calculation of odds ratios and 95% confidence
      intervals. The method of Miettinen was used. The statistical
      significance was tested by the method of Mantel and
      Haenszel<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>.</p>

      <h4>RESULTS<sup><a href="#n3">3,4,13,22,23</a></sup></h4>

      <p>Of the studies analyzed, five were retrospective, and one
      had a prospective design . The number of babies enrolled
      ranged from 112 and 219,775. The grouping of the studies
      obtained a sample of 221,799 infant (Fig. 1). In all the
      individual studies, a risk of having UTI was at least ten
      times in the intact babies compared to circumcised group. The
      odds ratio for the individual studies varied from 10.822 to
      156.4223 and was statistically significant in all cases;
      moreover in no instance did the confidence interval exceed
      the value of 1 (Fig. 1). The global odds ratio, obtained by
      grouping the results, was 13.05 with a 95% confidence
      interval ranging from 10.86 to 15.70 (From the methodological
      point of view, the optimal design for supporting the
      hypothesis that circumcision in the newborn male infant
      reduces the frequency of UTI, is a controlled clinical trial.
      This design will consists of a cohort of newborns being
      randomly allocated circumcision or not. The infants must be
      observed for a certain time to register the episodes of UTI.
      The method of observation must be sufficiently good in order
      to guarantee that no UTI episode escapes detection. This
      design, simple in appearance, has two difficult problems in
      its application. If the Wiswell data are accepted<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,4</a></sup>, one may expect a frequency of UTI
      [in US hospitals] in about 1% of intact infants, and that the
      frequency of UTI is reduced to about 0.1% with circumcision.
      The hypothesis is that a surgical intervention will reduce
      the frequency of an event from 1 to 0.1%, wi accepting the
      null hypothesis, although in reality this does not exist
      (type 1 error of 5%), and a probability of rejecting the
      difference, although in reality this does exist (type 2 error
      of 10%), it will require a large number of babies i.e.,
      around 1,400 in each group<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup>.
      This quantity of subjects creates logistical problems (to
      achieve a great number of interventions and to follow-up
      patients over a year's time) and the inherent costs. The
      second factor that affects the feasibility of such a study is
      the problem of getting the parents of the babies to remain in
      either group randomly, particularly if it is contrary to
      their personal preference. These difficult issues of
      feasibility will make it unlikely that in the near future
      such a study will be performed. Therefore, the best evidence
      that can be drawn from the data is that UTI in the young
      infant is an event of low frequency which can be further
      reduced (between 11 and 16 times) with circumcision. if one
      calculates the cost of circumcision in public health
      institutions; and we assume the cost to be $150; the
      operation on a group of 1,000 infants would lead to a cost of
      $150,000. In this cohort, one would expect to avoid nine
      episodes of UTI, at an approximate cost of $17,000 per
      episode. One would expect one case of UTI in the circumcised
      group and two cases of complications resulting from
      circumcision, such as local infection or hemorrhage.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Recently, Chessare<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> applied decision analysis and came
      to the conclusion that in the group of US parents studied,
      the preference would be continue to be not to circumcise
      unless the anticipated frequency of UTI during the first year
      of life was 29%.</span> In this analysis, factors such as
      parental attitudes to the morbidity associated with
      circumcision e.g., pain, inflammation, hemorrhage, etc. were
      taken into account. In the calculation of decision analysis,
      it was considered that there would be a 7.5% probability of
      renal sears resulting after an episode of UTI. In conclusion,
      the decision of whether or not to amputate the newborn
      foreskin will continue to be based on the personal
      preferences of the parents, but we believe the issues raised
      in this article should help them make an informed choice.
      <span class="yellow">Within the bounds of hospitalized care,
      the cost-benefit ratio of circumcision does not justify its
      routine and large scale application for doubtful
      benefits.</span> It is essential that a multicenter
      controlled clinical trial be conducted to scientifically
      clarify the controversy whether circumcision can reduce the
      incidence of UTI.</p>
