      <p>To the Editor.&mdash;</p>

      <p class="text2">Wiswell, Smith, and Bass (Pediatrics
      1985;75:901-903) report an association between circumcision
      and decreased urinary tract infections in infancy. There
      being no plausible physiologic explanation for such a
      finding, before we accept any cause and effect relationship
      and the possible consequence (reversal of the worldwide trend
      away from routine circumcision of the newborn), we should
      seek alternative explanations. Several suggest themselves:
      (1) the two populations, having self-selected themselves (to
      have or not have circumcision) differed in some way,
      socioculturally, in their prenatal habits or in their
      child-rearing behavior and these differences, not the
      circumcision, resulted in the discrepancy in incidence of
      urinary tract infection: (2) the advice given to parents, ie,
      to retract the foreskin lead to trauma and thereby opened a
      portal of entry for pathogenic bacteria; (3) the
      catheterization process introduced bacteria into the specimen
      and perhaps into the bladder.</p>

      <p class="text2">Drawing conclusions about the relative
      incidence of disease in nonrandomized populations is a chancy
      business. Nonetheless, it could be worthwhile to compare
      epidemiologic data on urinary tract infection incidence in
      infancy in countries like Denmark, Sweden and the United
      Kingdom, where less than 1% of male infants are circumcised.
      <span class="yellow">Until better data are available, we
      would be well advised to counsel patients to leave the penis
      alone both at birth and afterward.</span></p>
