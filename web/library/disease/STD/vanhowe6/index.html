       A literature review</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="1">Despite the wide availability of condoms and the
      fear of HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
      continue to be a serious public health concern. In the
      medical literature about preventive measures, circumcision is
      rarely if ever mentioned as an effective preventive measure:
      however, articles promoting the routine practice of
      circumcision invariably mention the surgery's benefit of
      reducing STDs. One author refers to over 100 medical articles
      supporting this thesis [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. In the present
      review, the medical literature is examined to determine what
      influence, if any, circumcision has on STDs.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p class="1">A Medline search was conducted using the keyword
      'circumcision' and titles located were examined to determine
      if they applied to the topic. Other articles were identified
      through cited studies. Studies with identifiable control
      groups were included for analysis. Only 31 studies met this
      criterion [<a href="#n2">2-32</a>]. Where data were
      available, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI were calculated; an
      OR of &gt; 1.0 denotes a positive correlation with the
      presence of a foreskin.</p>

      <p><i>Methodological differences</i></p>

      <p class="1">The reliability of the control group is a
      problematic issue. For example, several studies used men with
      no STD as controls, without controlling for the number of
      sexual partners. It is likely that men in the control group
      had fewer partners and thus less exposure risk, making them
      inappropriate controls. In Hand's 1949 study [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>], Jews made up 17% of the entire study
      population, but only 2.2% of the general publication [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>]. Blacks in Hand's control group were more
      likely to be circumcised than control white Gentiles (OR
      1.41, 95% CI 0.87-2.27), which conflicts with reliable
      published data [<a href="#n31">31</a>]. Some studies combined
      men with no particular STD to form control groups. Some
      studies considered only men with a different STD as the
      control group. Where the data were available, results are
      reported in this review using a control group of men with a
      STD other than the one in question, in an attempt to control
      for exposure risk.</p>

      <p class="2">Most of the studies before 1994 made no attempt
      to control for known confounding factors such as race, age,
      socio-economic status, level of education, number of lifetime
      sexual partners, frequency of sexual contact, or previous
      STD. The importance of these factors cannot be understated.
      For example, Laumann <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n34">34</a>]
      found that as a man increases the number of sexual partners,
      the risk of contracting STD does not increase linearly, but
      nearly exponentially. Without controlling for these factors,
      the results of these studies are of limited value and make it
      impossible to determine whether circumcision status is a
      marker for a significant risk factor or whether circumcision
      status is the risk factor.</p>

      <p><i>Study type</i></p>

      <p class="1">Nearly all of the studies published to date used
      information collected at STD clinics. While an STD clinic
      will concentrate clinical material at one location, study
      populations and controls derived from the clientele of STD
      clinics may not reflect the population as a whole, and may
      introduce a population bias that could unduly influence the
      results generated [<a href="#n34">34</a>]. For example,
      Wilson compared seasoned soldiers who had STDs with new
      recruits [<a href="#n6">6</a>]. To generalize the results of
      studies conducted in STD clinics, it must be assumed that
      circumcised men use these health facilities in the same
      manner. However, this is not the case, as socio-economic and
      cultural factors often differ between these groups. In the
      USA, men of higher socio-economic status are more likely to
      be circumcised and more likely to have an STD treated by a
      physician in private practice rather than at an STD clinic.
      Circumcised men may exhibit different health-seeking
      behaviour than uncircumcised men, being more likely to seek
      care for minor abrasions, thus being placed in the control
      group more often than their uncircumcised cohorts [<a
      href="#n35">35</a>]. This would cause the association between
      the foreskin and various STDs, including HIV infection to be
      overestimated, if not spuriously generated [<a
      href="#n36">36</a>]. In one African study, circumcised men
      had more lifetime partners, were more likely to smoke, drink
      alcohol, or have contact with prostitutes. They were less
      likely to be married [<a href="#n30">30</a>]; none of these
      factors were controlled for in that study.</p>

      <p class="2">The most reliable type of study is a random
      population survey; to date only a couple have been published
      [<a href="#n28">28,31,32</a>]. The drawbacks of these studies
      is that more subjects are needed to make a significant
      difference and circumcision status is determined by history,
      but the lack of population bias may compensate for these
      shortcomings.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Circumcision status</i></p>

      <p class="1">Cook <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n26">26</a>], in
      their retrospective chart review, found that circumcision
      status was documented in 86% of clinic notes. Taylor and
      Rodin recorded circumcision status in 89% of their charts [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]; these percentages are strikingly high.
      The Mayo clinic could not identify circumcision status in 16%
      of their cases of penile cancer [<a href="#n37">37</a>].</p>

      <p class="2">Parker <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n15">15</a>]
      found a high correlation between history and physical
      examination, with a sensitivity (Sen) of 98%, specificity
      (Sp) of 99%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 99%, and a
      negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%, while other studies
      have found no correlation. In a study in 1960 of men in New
      York and Los Angeles, only half of circumcised men correctly
      identified themselves as circumcised (Sen 51%, Sp 96%, PPV
      93%, NPV 35% [<a href="#n39">39</a>], men in Latin America
      (Sen 89%, Sp 84%, PPV 41%, NPV 98%) [<a href="#n40">40</a>],
      and men in Africa (Sen 94%, Sp 72%, PPV 69%, NPV 95%) [<a
      href="#n32">32</a>] yielded similar results.</p>

      <h3>The history of the role of circumcision in STDs</h3>

      <p class="1">Before the development of the germ theory of
      disease and modern epidemiology, it was noted that Jews had a
      lower incidence of syphilis [<a href="#n41">41</a>], but a
      higher incidence of gonorrhoea, than Gentiles [<a
      href="#n2">2</a>]. One rationale that developed to explain
      this finding was that Jews were protected from syphilis by
      circumcision. The influence of religion on sexual practices
      and the ban on Christian prostitutes consorting with Jews [<a
      href="#n42">42</a>] were not considered in deriving this
      theory. Since then, the theory has been perpetuated and
      embellished.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Literature review</i></p>

      <p class="1">Most studies cited as supporting a role of
      circumcision in the prevention of STDs are not
      case-controlled. Several studies make unsubstantiated
      estimates of male circumcision rates in the general
      population to use for comparative purposes. Other studies use
      ethnicity and tribal affiliation as an indicator of
      circumcision status. While these measures are crude and
      unscientific, the available data have been used to assess
      risk and statistical significance. The characteristics of the
      studies using identifiable control groups are listed in Table
      1. Most studies that were not random population surveys were
      conducted at STD clinics.</p>

      </center>

      <p class="1"><i>Normal microbial flora</i></p>

      <p class="1">The studies are summarized in (Table 2).
      Urethral smears of healthy uncircumcised males are less
      likely to have Gram-positive organisms (OR 0.40, 95% CI
      0.18-0.91) [<a href="#n43">43</a>], while <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i> is cultured significantly more often from
      periurethral swabs of circumcised boys 12 months and younger
      [<a href="#n44">44</a>]. Not surprisingly, pyoderma is more
      common after circumcision in male infants than do those not
      circumcised [<a href="#n45">45,46</a>]. Facultative
      Gram-negative rods and <i>Escherichia coli</i> are commonly
      found in the periurethral flora of uncircumcised males (OR
      3.72, 95% CI 0.84-16.54 [<a href="#n43">43</a>]; <i>E.
      coli</i> OR 5.52, 95% CI 2.95-10.33 [<a href="#n44">44</a>]).
      What impact this has on the susceptibility to illness has yet
      to be determined.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Acid-fast bacilli</i></p>

      <p class="1">It was conjectured that <i>Mycobacterium
      smegmaticus</i> could be a cause of urethritis. A study
      looking for acid-fast bacilli in urethral smears of men with
      urethritis failed to detect circumcision status as a
      significant factor (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.15-2.23) [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>].</p>

      <center>
        <img src="table2.gif" alt="Table 2" width="528"
        height="721" />
      </center>

      <p class="1"><i>Mycoplasma</i></p>

      <p class="1">Controversy exists over whether <i>Ureaplasma
      urealyticum</i> and <i>Mycoplasma hominis</i> are normal
      flora or STDs. While some studies have found these organisms
      more commonly in men with urethritis, others have found their
      prevalence to be nearly identical in men with urethritis and
      asymptomatic controls [<a href="#n8">8,11</a>]. A few studies
      have investigated circumcisions impact on the prevalence of
      mycoplasmas. One of the significant variables is the location
      of the organisms. Both <i>U. urealyticum</i> and <i>M.
      Hominis</i> were more likely to be obtained from the coronal
      sulcus in men with foreskins. When only urethral swabs are
      considered, <i>U. urealyticum</i> is more common in
      circumcised men [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. A change in
      sub-preputial flora takes place with the onset of sexual
      activity, making this flora more like that of the adult
      female vagina. It has not been shown whether organisms
      cultured from the coronal sulcus affect urethral flora or
      disease.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Trichomoniasis</i></p>

      <p class="1">Krieger et al. [<a href="#n19">19</a>] found
      that uncircumcised men were more likely to have
      <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> detected on a urethral swab or
      first-void urine cultures (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.03-3.67).
      However, when logistic regression is applied (controlling for
      age, race, age at sexual debut, exposure to <i>T.
      vaginalis</i>, number of sexual partners, and previous
      treatment for <i>T. vaginalis</i>, gonorrhoea, or
      non-specific urethritis), circumcision status was not a
      significant factor. (OR 1.1, 95% CI 05--2.3).</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Yeast</i></p>

      <p class="1">Of studies looking for the presence of yeast,
      Rodin and Kolator [<a href="#n12">12</a>] and Davidson [<a
      href="#n13">13</a>] detected no difference in carriage of
      yeast between those with and without a foreskin. However,
      circumcised carriers were more likely to be asymptomatic,
      making these men a more serious vector for the spread of
      yeast infections to women. [<a href="#n13">13</a>]. It is
      likely that Parker <i>et al.</i> only cultured swabs from
      symptomatic men for yeast [<a href="#n15">15</a>]. This lack
      of random sampling may explain their findings.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Genital ulcer disease vs. urethritis</i></p>

      <p class="1">Instead of comparing individual disease
      entities, several studies have compared genital ulcer disease
      (GUD), which includes syphilis, chancroid, herpes simplex,
      etc., to urethritis, which includes gonorrhoea, chlamydia,
      and urethritis (Table 3). Instead of using a control group,
      these studies included those with either GUD or urethritis
      and compared the two entities. Similarly, the earliest study
      suggesting a protective role for circumcision found that Jews
      in London were more likely to get gonorrhoea and Gentiles
      were more likely to get syphilis (OR 6.59, 95% CI 3.27-13.27)
      [<a href="#n2">2</a>]. Wolbarst likewise found that
      circumcised men were more likely to present with gonorrhoea
      than with syphilis [<a href="#n3">3-5</a>]. It can be
      gathered from these studies that circumcised men presenting
      with an STD are more likely to have urethritis, while
      uncircumcised men are more likely to present with GUD.
      Because there is no true control group, no inference
      regarding disease prevention can be drawn from this
      information.</p>

      <div class="table3">
        <img src="table3.gif" alt="Table 3" width="1027"
        height="1158" />
      </div>

      <p class="1"><i>Urethritis</i></p>

      <p class="1">In the random population survey addressing
      urethritis, uncircumcised men were less likely to have it (OR
      0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87; Table 3). The authors noted that most
      cases of urethritis is that region were from gonorrhoea [<a
      href="#n22">22</a>]. Two STD clinic studies from Africa
      failed to document a difference [<a href="#n25">25,
      30</a>].</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Gonorrhoea</i></p>

      <p class="1">Most of the data for the incidence of gonorrhoea
      have come from STD clinic studies (Table 3); the results have
      been inconsistent. When appropriate control groups are
      applied to the studies from the 1940s [<a
      href="#n6">6,7</a>], circumcised white men are at higher risk
      for gonorrhoea. When the data from Smith <i>et al.</i> were
      categorized by race, no difference in gonorrhoea rates could
      be detected between those men with and without a foreskin [<a
      href="#n16">16</a>]. In a study of 537 sailors examined for
      gonorrhoea before and after sexual exposure during shore
      leave in the Far East, circumcision status did not affect
      susceptibility in blacks, and although uncircumcised whites
      had higher rates of gonorrhoea than circumcised whites, the
      difference was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.10) [<a
      href="#n14">14</a>]. In a random population survey, Laumann
      <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n31">31</a>] discovered that the
      number of lifetime partners dramatically affected the impact
      of circumcision on gonorrhoea. While circumcised men with
      5-20 lifetime partners were at lower risk for gonorrhoea,
      circumcised men with &lt;20 lifetime partners were at
      significantly higher risk of gonorrhoea than uncircumcised
      men with a similar number of lifetime partners. It may be
      that more partners increases the diversity of the
      subpreputial flora, thus offering some protection to the
      uncircumcised male. [<a href="#n47">47</a>].</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Non-gonococcal urethritis</i></p>

      <p class="1">Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is not prevented
      by circumcision and may be more common in circumcised men
      (Table 3). Some of the studies distinguished between
      chlamydia and NGU [<a href="#n15">15,26,31</a>]. A
      significant correlation between the foreskin and NGU has yet
      to be detected and a negative correlation appears likely.
      Chlamydia is most commonly the cause of NGU: the data suggest
      that circumcised men are at greater risk of chlamydial
      infections.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Genital ulcer disease</i></p>

      <p class="1">Several of the HIV studies examining the role of
      circumcision have also provided data on its role in the
      incidence of GUD (Table 4). The findings have been
      inconsistent but suggest that uncircumcised men may be at
      greater risk for GUD.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="table4.gif" alt="Table 4" width="516"
        height="1079" />
      </center>

      <p class="1"><i>Syphilis</i></p>

      <p class="1">One of the difficulties in studying syphilis is
      its low prevalence. Most of the recent studies have been
      unable to detect a statistically significant difference
      because there are too few cases. Even the large population
      survey by Laumann <i>et al.</i> could not detect a difference
      [<a href="#n31">31</a>]. The results by Kreiss and Hopkins
      [<a href="#n21">21</a>] cannot be generalized to the
      population at large because both circumcision and syphilis
      status were obtained by history from a study population that
      only included men engaging in homosexual activity. When the
      African data reported in a study by Urassa <i>et al.</i> [<a
      href="#n32">32</a>] are controlled for background
      characteristics, including HIV status, no difference is
      detectable (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.27).</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Chancroid</i></p>

      <p class="1">Circumcision was once proposed as a treatment
      for chancroid [<a href="#n48">48,49</a>] until antibiotics
      were shown to be effective [<a href="#n50">50</a>]. Although
      it is generally reported that chancroid is more common in
      uncircumcised males [<a href="#n51">51-55</a>], a review of
      the medical literature found no case-controlled study to
      support this assertion, other than the study by Hand [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>]. When the proper control group is applied
      to Hand's data, an interesting finding emerges. Chancroid is
      significantly more common in uncircumcised white males, but
      significantly more common in circumcised black males. In two
      studies from Singapore STD clinics, Malays, who are
      predominantly Islamic, were less likely to have chanchroid,
      but in neither study was the finding statistically
      significant., as there were too few Malays [<a
      href="#n56">56,57</a>]. In one of the studies, Indians were
      more likely to develop chancroid than Chinese (OR 20.77, 95%
      CI 8.11-53.17). When Malays were compared with Chinese,
      Malays had a higher incidence of chancroid (OR 3.12, 95% CI
      0.81-12.08) [<a href="#n56">56</a>]. In both studies,
      calculations were based on assumptions of ethnic prevalence
      in the population and ethnic associations with circumcision
      status. If chancroid is related to circumcision status,
      Malays, who routinely circumcise, would be expected to have a
      lower incidence of chancroid than the Chinese who do not.</p>

      <p class="2">In an outbreak of chancroid in Winnipeg,
      Manitoba, Canada, the community of Native Indians and
      M&eacute;tis (mixed Indian and Caucasian) were the focus of
      the outbreak, rather than Caucasians [<a href="#n52">52</a>].
      The published evidence suggests that race and ethnicity are
      more likely to be a factor in chancroid infection than
      circumcision status. This finding is consistent with the
      recognized tendency of highly contagious STDs to concentrate
      in 'core' populations [<a href="#n34">34</a>]</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Herpes simplex</i></p>

      <p>The results for genital herpes have been inconsistent.
      Hand, without providing data, reported that circumcision had
      no impact on the incidence of genital herpes [<a
      href="#n7">7</a>]. When Taylor and Rodin's data are analysed
      by race, the significance of the foreskin for those
      originally from the UK disappears [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>].</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Human papillomavirus and genital
      warts</i></p>

      <p class="1">Much attention has been paid to human
      papillomavirus (HPV) since it was linked with cervical and
      penile cancers [<a href="#n37">37,58</a>] (Table 5). The
      epidemiology of these cancers mimics that of STDs. Genital
      warts have consistently been a significant risk factor for
      penile cancer [<a href="#n59">59,60</a>]. The role of
      circumcision in the prevention of penile cancer is
      controversia, especially in light of a recent report from
      Seattle in which 42% of men with penile cancer were
      circumcised [<a href="#n60">60</a>]. In recent studies,
      HPV-associated lesions are either equally common [<a
      href="#n15">15,23,27</a>] or more common in circumcised men.
      A larger cohort of circumcised men in the USA is reaching the
      age at which penile cancer occurs. This has resulted in more
      circumcised men with penile cancers than seen previously [<a
      href="#n61">61,62</a>]. How the higher risk of genital warts
      in circumcised men will affect penile cancer has yet to be
      determined. The use of condoms and screening men at risk for
      HPV infection using acetic acid and colposcopy may be the
      best use of resources for preventing penile and cervical
      cancers. [<a href="#n63">63,64</a>].</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Hepatitis</i></p>

      <p class="1">In an Israeli study of the prevalence of
      hepatitis B surface antigen in 9182 school children, the
      investigators speculated as to whether male circumcision
      could be an important mode of infection, explaining both the
      male predominance and the striking seasonal trend among boys
      that their study revealed [<a href="#n65">65</a>]. An
      Ethiopian study suggested that circumcision may play a role
      in HBV transmission [<a href="#n66">66</a>], but a Gambian
      study failed to find an association [<a href="#n67">67</a>].
      Likewise, Donovan et al. [<a href="#n27">27</a>] and Laumann
      <i>et al.</i> found no difference in hepatitis between men
      with and without a foreskin.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>STD prevalence</i></p>

      <p class="1">Until recently, no studies have examined the
      impact of circumcision on overall STD incidence. The data
      indicate that circumcised men may be a higher risk for an STD
      (Table 5). This is consistent with trends seen in the USA. As
      routine neonatal circumcision has been implemented, the rate
      of STDs has increased rather fallen. Among first-world
      nations, the USA has one of the highest rates of STDs. HIV
      infection and male circumcision. In the report by Cook <i>et
      al.</i> [<a href="#n26">26</a>] the average uncircumcised man
      had 2.16 STDs diagnosed, while in the average circumcised man
      it was 2.32; in an Australian study, there was no difference
      (1.48 vs 1.44 STDs diagnosed per patient) [<a
      href="#n27">27</a>].</p>

      <p class="1"><i>HIV</i></p>

      <p class="1">There have been 36 case-controlled studies
      published in peer-reviewed journals addressing the
      relationship between the foreskin and HIV infection; the
      results have been inconsistent. Several studies performed in
      STD clinics have found the foreskin to be a risk factor [<a
      href="#n17">17,18,21,25,29,30,68-72</a>], while several
      random population surveys, which do not have the population
      bias of an STD clinic study, have found circumcised men to be
      at higher risk [<a href="#n32">32,73-75</a>]. Several studies
      have failed to detect a statistically significant difference
      between men with and without a foreskin [<a
      href="#n31">31,76-87</a>]. In several studies, when the
      populations are controlled for GUD, number of sexual partners
      and other factors, the results differ significantly from the
      raw data. The USA has the highest incidence of HIV infection,
      as well as the highest incidence of male circumcision amongst
      developed nations. This speaks against the protective effect
      of circumcision [<a href="#n89">89</a>]. The inconsistency of
      the results and the number of confounding factors make it
      impossible to link the foreskin to HIV infection [<a
      href="#n36">36,90</a>].</p>

      <h3>Hill's criteria</h3>

      <p class="1">It is impossible to assert a causal relationship
      based on retrospective data. Hill developed criteria for
      assessing whether a strong case can be made for causality
      based on retrospective data [<a href="#n91">91</a>].</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Strength:</i> If an association has a high
      OR, it weighs in favour of a causal relationship. Few of the
      associations have had an OR of &gt; 2.0. Moreover, the
      studies that randomly accessed portions of the population
      outside of STD clinics have found circumcised men to be at
      higher risk for an STD [<a href="#n28">28,31,32</a>].<br />
      <i>Consistency:</i> Results among studies have been very
      inconsistent: this speaks against causality.<br />
      <i>Specificity:</i> There are several confounding factors:
      circumcision is not chose randomly [<a href="#n92">92</a>].
      Significant factors such as race, socio-economic status,
      education level and number of partners are often not
      controlled for in the published studies. In most studies
      where these factors have been controlled for, the foreskin is
      not a significant factor. For example, a US Army study of
      soldiers in Japan reported that uncircumcised men were more
      likely to have a penile lesion than were random controls (OR
      22.78, 95% CI 6.00-86.29), but men with penile lesions were
      more likely to be black (OR 15.00, 95% CI 3.12-72-07) or to
      have had a previous STD (OR 4.41, 1.71-11.34) [<a
      href="#n93">93</a>]. No attempt was made to control for these
      significant factors.<br />
      <i>Temporality:</i> Most males are circumcised before
      beginning sexual activity. While some effort has been made to
      promote circumcision as an HIV preventive in Africa [<a
      href="#n94">94</a>], no studies of the effects of later
      circumcision on disease prevention have been published.<br />
      <i>Biological gradient:</i> One study of HIV found that
      circumcised men with more residual foreskin were at higher
      risk of HIV-2 infection [<a href="#n77">77</a>]. It is
      difficult to make any conclusion from this one study.<br />
      <i>Biological plausibility:</i> Moses <i>et al.</i> [<a
      href="#n95">95</a>] suggested: (a) that minor inflammatory
      conditions can occur underneath the foreskin, resulting in
      mucosal discontinuity that may provide a portal of entry for
      viruses and bacteria: (b) that the foreskin may be more
      susceptible to minor trauma during intercourse: (c) that the
      warm, moist environment under the foreskin may provides an
      environment conducive to prolonged survival of pathogens; and
      (d) in the case of HIV, that Langerhans cells, plentiful in
      the foreskin of male macaque monkeys, are highly susceptible
      to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [<a
      href="#n95">95</a>].<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the warm moist environment
      under the prepuce allows for the growth of all bacteria,
      including pathogens, the immunological protection provided
      the subpreputial flora [<a href="#n96">96</a>], secretory
      immunoglobulins, and lytic secretions from the prostate,
      urethra, and seminal vesicles [<a href="#n97">97</a>] have
      not been adequately investigated. Undisturbed preputial flora
      and mucosal immunological defences may protect the
      uncircumcised male for infection [<a
      href="#n47">47</a>].<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role of Langerhans cell in the
      transmission of HIV is unclear. While they are present in the
      mucosal prepuce of monkeys [<a href="#n98">98</a>] and adult
      males [<a href="#n99">99</a>], Weiss <i>et al.</i> were not
      able to detect their presence on the inner surface of
      prepuces taken from newborns [<a href="#n100">100</a>]. These
      cells initiate the immune response to infectious agents. In
      the primate study referred to by Moses et al. [<a
      href="#n95">95</a>] it was Langerhans-like cells in the
      lamina propria, and not in the epithelium, that appeared to
      be infected with SIV [<a href="#n101">101</a>]. It is unclear
      whether this observation can be extrapolated to the
      Langerhans cells in the epithelium of the prepuce in
      humans.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beaug&eacute; suggests that the loss
      of penile skin from circumcision frequently results in
      tightened skin over the erect penis. This increases friction
      during intercourse and increases the likelihood of abrasions
      through which a pathogen can be introduced systemically,
      making the circumcised penis more likely to contract an STD
      [<a href="#n101">101</a>]. The increased likelihood of
      circumcised men engaging in active anal sex [<a
      href="#n31">31</a>] may also increase a circumcised man's
      susceptibility to STDs.<br />
       <i>Coherence:</i> Circumcision as a preventive measure for
      STDs needs to fit into a coherent explanation that takes
      other know risk factors into account. To date, the only
      theory proposed is the 'subpreputial space as a cesspool'
      explanation provided by Weiss [<a href="#n103">103</a>]. If
      the 'cesspool" theory is extended to women, then one would
      expect that women, who have significantly more genital
      mucosa, would have markedly more STD's than men, whether
      circumcised or not; this is not the case [<a
      href="#n34">34</a>]. Nearly all of the associations between
      STDs and the foreskin can be explained on the basis of
      racial, socio-economic, cultural, ethnic, and
      healthcare-seeking behavioural differences. Studies
      controlling for these factors have failed to confirm the
      efficacy of circumcision in preventing STDs.<br />
      <i>Experimental evidence:</i> There is none.<br />
      <i>Analogy:</i> Is there another illness to which the
      foreskin makes a man more susceptible? Can it be equated with
      the acquisition and transmission of STDs? Lower urinary tract
      infections in infancy may be associated with the foreskin,
      but showing analogy to STDs would be a formidable task. Upper
      urinary tract infections in males are most often related to
      anatomical anomalies in the male rather than the foreskin [<a
      href="#n104">104</a>], and unrelated to behaviour patterns.
      The aetiologies of these maladies are so disparate that
      forming an analogy is impossible. Based on the above
      criteria, a causal relationship between the foreskin and STDs
      cannot be inferred.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="1">What began as speculation has resulted a century
      later in 60-75% of American boys being circumcised with no
      clearly confirmed medical benefit. In the interim, no solid
      epidemiological evidence has been found to support the theory
      that circumcision prevents STDs or to justify a policy of
      involuntary mass circumcision as a public health measure.
      While the number of confounding factors and the inability to
      perform a random, double-blind, propective trial make
      assessing the role of circumcision in STD acquisition
      difficult, there is no clear evidence that circumcision
      prevents STDs. The only consistent trend is that
      uncircumcised males may be more susceptible to GUD, while
      circumcised men are more prone to urethritis. Currently, in
      developed nations, urethritis is more common than GUD [<a
      href="#n34">34</a>]. In summary, the medical literature does
      not support the theory that circumcision prevents STDs.</p>
