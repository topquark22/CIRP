       The role of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      infection.</h2>

      of Nairobi</a>,<br />
       Kenya.</p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:</b> Genital ulcer disease
      (GUD) is a major risk factor for human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) transmission. Cross-sectional studies have suggested
      that HIV infection may itself predispose to genital
      ulceration (GU).</p>

      <p><b>GOAL:</b> To prospectively study the effects of HIV
      type 1 (HIV-1) infection and behavioral variables on GU
      incidence.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> A cohort of 302 Kenyan female sex-workers
      was established in April 1991. Women were scheduled for
      assessment every 2 weeks, and bloods were collected every 6
      months for HIV serology, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and CD4
      counts. Logistic regression was used to study risk factors
      for incident genital ulcers.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> 189 women (62.5%) had at least one
      incident ulcer over 24.3 +/- 15.3 months. GU incidence was
      higher in seropositive than initially seronegative women (82%
      vs. 48%; odds ratio [OR]) = 4.33; P &lt; 0.01). Only HIV-1
      seropositivity (OR = 3.42), a CD4 count &lt; 200/ml (OR =
      1.94), and oral contraceptive use (OR = 1.35) were associated
      (P &lt; 0.05) with GU incidence in regression analysis. For
      those ulcers where an etiology was actively sought,
      Hemophilus ducreyi was confirmed in 54 (19%) of cases, and
      syphilis in 30 (29%).</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> GU incidence in Kenyan sex workers is
      independently affected by HIV-1 serostatus, degree of
      immunosuppression, and oral contraceptive use.</p>
