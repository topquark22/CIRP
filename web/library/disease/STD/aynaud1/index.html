      <h2>Developmental factors of urethral human papillomavirus
      lesions: correlation with circumcision.</h2>

      <p><b>Aynaud O, Piron D, Bijaoui G, Casanova JM.</b></p>

      <p>Coll&egrave;ge Europ&eacute;en et Francophone d'Urologie
      Liberale,<br />
       Paris, France.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To assess the relationship between
      circumcision and urethral human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions,
      and the influence of urethritis on the development of
      urethral HPV infections on inducing squamous metaplasia of
      the urethral epithelium.</p>

      <p><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b> The study included 210
      heterosexual, HIV-negative men (median age 29 years) who all
      had female partners with genital HPV infection. The patients
      were divided into three groups according to clinical
      findings, i.e. 97 patients with no clinical HPV lesions on
      peniscopy and urethroscopy, 70 patients with balanopreputial
      lesions but no urethral lesions, and 43 patients with
      urethral HPV lesions, including 17 who had associated penile
      lesions. They all underwent meatopeniscopy for HPV screening,
      urethral biopsy for histological analysis, and bacterial
      cultures were taken. The results in each subgroup were
      compared between circumcised and uncircumcised men.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> There was no significant difference in the
      incidence of HPV infection (58% vs 42%, odds ratio, OR, 1.8;
      95% confidence interval, CI, 0.98-3.62) between uncircumcised
      and circumcised men, but this relationship differed with the
      developmental site of HPV lesions (shaft-foreskin, P&lt;0.02;
      urethra, not significant). There was also a significant
      difference in the prevalence of urethritis between
      uncircumcised and circumcised men (34.5% vs 19%, OR 2.35, 95%
      CI 1. 08-5.11), and between HPV-infected and uninfected men
      (41.5% vs 18%, OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.71-5.83). This positive
      relationship of the prevalence of urethritis for both factors
      (circumcision and HPV) depended on the type of organism
      (sexually transmitted disease, not significant; common
      organism, P&lt;0.02). The frequency of urethritis was related
      to the site of HPV lesions; urethritis was present in 36% of
      the patients with preputial HPV lesions, compared with 51% of
      those with urethral HPV lesions. Chlamydia trachomatis was
      detected in 1% of the patients without and in 7% of those
      with HPV lesions. In 68% of the patients, histological
      analysis of the urethral mucosa showed a squamous metaplasia
      of the urethral epithelium associated with urethritis.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Being
      uncircumcised did not seem to increase the risk of HPV
      urethral infection in young men.</span> Genital bacterial
      infections and urethral HPV lesions appear to be linked.
      Urethritis can induce squamous metaplasia of the urethral
      epithelium, which appears to favour the colonization of the
      anterior urethra by HPVs.</p>
