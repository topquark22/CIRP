      <h2>Private sexual behavior, public opinion, and public
      health policy related to sexually transmitted diseases: a
      US-British comparison.</h2>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> The purpose of this study was to
      characterize sexual behavior and opinions about sex in the
      United States and Britain; implications are discussed for
      effective public health policy regarding sexually transmitted
      diseases (STDs) in the United States.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Large-scale national probability surveys
      conducted in the 2 countries detailed sexual behavior,
      opinions, and the prevalence of STDs.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> In comparison with that of Britain, the US
      population has greater variability in sexual behavior, less
      tolerant opinions about sexual behavior, <span
      class="yellow">and a higher STD prevalence and lower condom
      usage among men.</span></p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The survey data show compelling
      evidence from both countries of a strong association between
      number of sex partners and STD risk. In the United States
      relative to Britain, there is both greater dispersion in
      sexual behavior and a greater incidence of unconditional
      opposition to certain sexual practices. The former implies a
      need for strong public health policy to address the risks of
      STDs, but the latter implies strong opposition to that
      policy. This disjuncture between public health need and
      feasibility may contribute to the high US rate of STDs.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This article is of interest
      because it compares the sexual behavior in America, where
      most men are circumcised, with the sexual behavior in
      Britain, where most men have intact penises. This article
      shows that men in the U.S. are much less likely to use
      condoms.]</p>

      <h3>TEXT EXTRACT:</h3>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of HIV is estimated to have
      peaked in Britain between 1982 and 1984 with an intense
      epidemic in homosexual men and a limited spread to injection
      drug users. Probably as a result of behavior change, a
      declining incidence followed; thus, the prevalence observed
      in Britain has never reached the intensity of high-risk
      populations in the United States. In the United States, no
      such peak occurred early in the epidemic. Regarding the known
      transmission mechanisms of all AIDS cases as of 1996, <span
      class="yellow">50% of US and 59% of British cases involved
      transmission between men who have sex with men, 26% of US and
      10% of British cases involved injection drug users (with
      another 6% in the United States and 2% in Britain involving
      both of the preceding 2 groups), and 9% of US and 20% of
      British cases involved heterosexual contacts.</span>
