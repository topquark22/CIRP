      <h1>Circumcision and Sexually Transmitted Infections</h1>

      <p>This index page provides information about the
      relationship between circumcision and sexually transmitted
      disease (STD). The materials are indexed in chronological
      order of publication.</p>

      <p><small><b>Note:</b> The consideration of STDs and AIDS
      prevention does not apply to neonatal circumcision. Children
      are not sexually active. Kept intact, they can weigh the
      issue for themselves when they are old enough to
      consent.</small></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p><b>History.</b> In the early part of the Twentieth
      Century, many <i>doctors</i> formed the opinion that
      circumcision would reduce the chance of a male contracting
      sexually transmitted disease (STD). This opinion was based on
      popular considerations of sexual hygiene. There were no
      scientific studies or documentary evidence to support this
      opinion. Regardless, countless males were circumcised by
      military services of the U.S. and other nations during World
      Wars I and II in an attempt to reduce the chance that they
      would contract a STD.</p>

      <p>In a self-published pamphlet, <i>Circumcision: A Parent's
      Decision for Life</i>, the late circumcisionist Aaron J. Fink
      made the suggestion that the dried-out, cornified circumcised
      glans and mucosa would be "tougher," and somehow therefore
      less prone to infection, than those of intact men. This claim
      was even published in <i>The New England Journal of
      Medicine</i>, but, in fact, there is no evidence to support
      Fink's theory.<sup><a href="#n5">5,10,13</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Behavior.</b> It is documented that circumcised adult
      males exhibit a greater tendency to engage in risky sexual
      behavior. <a href="/library/disease/STD/hooykaas1/">Hooykaas
      and colleagues</a> reported that circumcised men in the
      Netherlands engage in more risky sexual behavior and have
      markedly higher rates of STDs.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      <a href="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann and
      colleagues</a> reported more risky sexual behavior amongst
      circumcised men in the United States and have higher rates of
      STDs.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> Michael <i>et al.</i>
      reported more variability in sexual behavior, less condom
      usage, and more STD amonst the predominantly circumcised
      population of the United States as compared with the
      predominantly non-circumcised intact males of the United
      Kingdom.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Immunology.</b> <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">Fleiss <i>et al.</i></a>
      have described the many natural immunological protective
      mechanisms provided by the prepuce against infection.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> The prepuce has many immunological
      protections against disease.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      These mechanisms may explain why surgically-altered,
      circumcised men seem to have a greater incidence of many
      different STDs. Dried-out mucous membranes are more prone to
      infection than naturally moist ones (which is the reason
      people tend to get more colds in the wintertime!).</p>

      <p>The foreskin naturally moisturizes the glans penis,
      keeping it in optimum healthy condition to resist infection.
      The subpreputial moisture also contains lysozyme, an enzyme
      that attacks and destroys the cell walls of bacteria.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,10</a></sup></p>

      <p><a href="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann <i>et
      al.</i></a> reviewed data from the National Health and Social
      Life Survey.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> They found no
      evidence of a prophylactic role for circumcision. In fact,
      there was a slight tendency in the opposite direction.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> The absence of the foreskin was
      significantly associated with bacterial STDs among men who
      have had many sexual partners in their lifetimes. A rate of
      25.4/1000 for chlamydia was found in circumcised men compared
      with a rate of <i>zero</i> in intact men; herpes was
      14.9/1000 in circumcised males compared with 8.1/1000 in
      intact males.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7173/1616/b">Tanne</a>
      reported on the epidemic of STD, including herpes, human
      papillomavirus infection, hepatitis B, and HIV infection in
      the United States.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> The
      incidence of STD in the United States is amongst the highest
      in the industrialized world. This should not be surprising,
      considering the high incidence of circumcision in the US:
      According to Laumann <i>et al.</i>, data from the <i>National
      Health and Social Life Survey</i> indicate that, in 1992, of
      1511 men surveyed who were between 18 and 59 years of age, 77
      percent of U.S. born men were circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> This high percentage is unique among
      the industrialized nations.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Natural protection.</b> While the entire body of
      medical literature gives no clear indication one way or the
      other whether circumcision protects against STD, the more
      recent studies have shown that the natural intact penis may
      offer some protection against the contraction of various
      STDs.<sup><a href="#n2">2-7, 12, 13</a></sup> According to <a
      href="/library/general/storms/">Storms</a>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Recent studies have demonstrated that circumcised
          men are at increased risk of contracting gonorrhea,
          syphilis and genital warts. Men are at equal risk for
          developing human papillomavirus lesions and herpesvirus
          infections regardless of circumcision status. At least
          four studies have shown human immunodeficiency virus
          infection to occur more commonly in circumcised
          men.</b><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that circumcised men are
      more at risk of contracting urethritis,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> gonorrhea,<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> syphilis,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> genital warts<sup><a
      href="#n4">4,8</a></sup> and chlamydia.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/cook2/">Cook</a> discovered that,
      when genital warts occur in intact males, they tend to occur
      near the distal (tip) end of the penis<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup>--the region where the foreskin's
      protection would be least effective.</p>

      <p>Van Howe's <a href="/library/disease/STD/vanhowe6/">survey
      of the medical literature</a> is recommended. Van Howe
      concludes that:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>The only consistent trend is that uncircumcised
          males may be more susceptible to GUD, while circumcised
          men are more prone to urethritis. Currently, in developed
          nations, urethritis is more common than GUD [genital
          ulcer disease]. In summary, the medical literature does
          not support the theory that circumcision prevents
          STDs.</b><sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>Longitudinal studies.</b> Dickson <i>et al.</i> in
      Dunedin studied a cohort of New Zealand children born in
      1972. This cohort, who are now adults, have been followed
      since birth. The males in the group included both intact
      (not circumcised) and circumcised males. 201 or 40.3
      percent of the male subjects were circumcised. Dickson
      <i>et al.</i> found no relationship between circumcision
      status and HPV infection.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup>
      In a second study of the same New Zealand cohort through
      age 32, Dickson <i>et al.</i> found more STDs in circumcised
      subjects, although the difference was not statistically
      significant.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> There were
      24.4 STD infections per 1000 person-years among the
      circumcised group and 23.4 STD infections per 1000
      person-years among the non-circumcised group.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Cross-sectional studies.</b> Cross-sectional studies
      have been carried out in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> the United Kingdom,<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> and Australia<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> to determine the effects of
      circumcision upon STDs. All studies have found no significant
      effect of circumcision on the incidence of STD. Laumann <i>et
      al.</i> reported that circumcised men are slightly more
      likely to have both a bacterial and a viral STD in their
      lifetime.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The British National
      Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles reported that
      circumcised males have slightly more STDs but the difference
      was not judged to be statistically significant.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Richters <i>et al.</i> found that
      non-circumcised men are slightly more likely to have penile
      candidiasis (yeast).<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Conclusion.</b> The evidence does not support
      non-therapeutic circumcision to prevent STD infection. On
      balance, non-circumcision is to be preferred because of the
      freedom from complications and other adverse effects.</p>
