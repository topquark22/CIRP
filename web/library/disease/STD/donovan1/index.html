        <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

        <p><b>Objective</b> - To determine whether the circumcision
        status of men affected their likelihood of acquiring
        sexually transmissible diseases (STDs).</p>

        <p><b>Design</b> - A cross-sectional study employing an
        anonymous questionnaire, clinical examination and type
        specific serology for herpes simplex virus type 2
        (HSV-2).</p>

        <p><b>Setting</b> - A public STD clinic in Sydney,
        Australia.</p>

        <p><b>Subjects</b> - 300 consecutive heterosexual male
        patients.</p>

        <p><b>Main outcome measure</b> - Associations between
        circumcision status and past or present diagnoses of STDs
        including HSV-2 serology and clinical pattern of genital
        herpes.</p>

        <p><b>Results</b> - 185 (62%) of the men were circumcised
        and they reported similar ages, education levels and
        lifetime partner numbers as men who were uncircumcised.
        There were no significant associations between the presence
        or absence of the male prepuce and the number diagnosed
        with genital herpes, genital warts and non-gonococcal
        urethritis. Men who were uncircumcised were no more likely
        to be seropositive for HSV-2 and reported symptomatic
        genital herpes outbreaks of the same frequency and severity
        as men who were circumcised. Gonorrhoea, syphilis and acute
        hepatitis B were reported too infrequently to reliably
        exclude any association with circumcision status. Human
        immunodeficiency virus infection (rare among heterosexual
        men in the clinic) was an exclusion criterion.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusions</b> - From the findings of this study,
        circumcision of men has no significant effect on the
        incidence of common STDs in this developed nation setting.
        However, these findings may not necessarily extend to other
        setting where hygiene is poorer and the spectrum of common
        STDs is different.<br />

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>It has been suggested that uncircumcised men are at higher
      risk of certain sexually transmissible diseases (STDs), in
      particular genital herpes,<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>
      gonorrhoea,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> syphilis,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      (HIV-1) infection,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      candidiasis<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> and
      chancroid.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The evidence for
      male circumcision protecting against most STDs is
      tentative<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> but is strong for
      chancroid and candidal balanoposthitis (though not
      necessarily subclinical yeast infection<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup>). In some populations where chancroid
      and syphilis may be the common causes of genital ulcers,
      these ulcers and the uncircumcised state of the men (both
      independently and synergistically) appear to be major risk
      factors for the female to male sexual transmission of
      HIV-1.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The uncircumcised penis
      is hypothetically at increased risk of STDs because of larger
      surface area, thinner epidermal barrier, more opportunity for
      epithelial microtrauma and the warm, moist niche under the
      foreskin favouring the persistence of fastidious
      microorganisms. However, none of these hypotheses has been
      proven. We sought to determine any effect the presence of a
      male foreskin may exert on the acquisition of common STDs by
      heterosexual men attending an STD clinic and also its effect
      on the clinical manifestations of herpes simples virus type 2
      (HSV-2) infection.</p>

      <h3>Subjects and methods</h3>

      <p>A sample site of over 270 was calculated to determine a
      two-fold risk of serological evidence of HSV-2 for
      uncircumcised men with 80% power at the 5% level. However,
      this calculation was based on an expected HSV-2
      seroprevalence of about 30% for heterosexual men detected in
      a 1985 survey at the same clinic (AL Cunningham; unpublished
      data).</p>

      <p>The subjects were 300 consecutive heterosexual male
      patients who saw a particular clinician (IB) and required
      venopuncture for any other purpose at the Sydney Sexual
      Health (previously STD) Centre, Sydney Hospital, between
      December 1990 and May 1991. Over 95% of the men were
      Caucasian with the bulk of the remainder of Asian origin. The
      subjects were representative of the general clinical load of
      exclusively heterosexual men at the Centre: their reasons for
      attendance or diagnosis at the time of consultation are
      outlined in Table 1. HIV-1 infection is rare among
      heterosexual men attending the Centre<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> and, as HIV-l infection may alter the
      natural history of other STDs, it was an exclusion criterion.
      Homosexually active men were also excluded because anal
      infections could have confused the objectives of the study.
      The aims of the study were explained to all subjects and
      signed informed consent obtained. There were no refusals. A
      data collection form with an anonymous identifier code was
      completed by the clinician and an extra five milliliters of
      blood was collected for this study. The data collected
      included age, level of education, circumcision status
      (confirmed by physical examination), past history of genital
      herpes or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes (undiagnosed
      genital ulcer or recurrent genital lesions/itches),
      nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), genital warts, urethral
      gonorrhoea, syphilis and acute hepatitis B, as well as
      reported lifetime number of sexual partners (women with whom
      they had had vaginal intercourse). For the analysis, current
      and past diagnoses of STDs were combined for each subject.
      All STDs had been diagnosed by a physician, mostly at the
      same clinic. The diagnosis of genital herpes was by cell
      culture except for the current visit where the diagnosis was
      on clinical criteria (the delinked anonymous study design
      precluded incorporating current HSV culture results).
      Similarly urethral gonorrhoea was diagnosed by culture except
      for the current visit where the diagnosis was based on
      clinical findings plus characteristic gram negative
      intracellular diplococci on a urethral smear. NGU was
      diagnosed by clinical picture (discharge/dysuria) and
      microscopy of a distal urethral smear (5 or more polymorphs
      per oil immersion field). Genital warts were a clinical
      diagnosis. All syphilis cases required confirmation by
      specific treponemal serology (Treponema pallidum
      haemaglutination assay and fluorescent treponemal antibody
      test). The diagnosis of acute hepatitis B required both an
      acute hepatitis illness and laboratory confirmation.</p>

      <p>Those subjects who had a history of genital herpes were
      asked to grade the severity of their initial episode ("mild",
      "moderate", or "severe"), and estimate the number, and
      similarly grade the severity of any recurrences in the
      previous 12 months.</p>

      <p>The serological analyses for HSV were performed at the
      Virology, Department Centre for Infectious Diseases and
      Microbiology, Westmead Hospital in Sydney on an anonymous and
      blinded basis. As described elsewhere,<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> sera were screened for total HSV
      antibody by a complement fixing antibody (HSV-CFA) test.
      Positive specimens on HSV-CFA were then subject to an
      indirect IgG enzyme immune assay (EIA) specific to the 92 kDa
      HSV-2 glycoprotein G (gG-2).<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      All 15 randomly selected sera that were positive for HSV-2 by
      EIA testing were confirmed by Western blot.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p>One hundred and eighty five (61.7%) of the men were
      circumcised and 115 (38.3%) were not: this was not age
      dependent (table 2). The associations between male
      circumcision status and demographic, behavioural and STD
      variables of the study group are summarized in Table 2. None
      of these variables approached significance at the 5% level.
      Though gonorrhoea, syphilis and acute hepatitis B were
      reported too infrequently to determine any association with
      the subjects circumcision status, histories of genital
      herpes, serological evidence of HSV-2 infection, genital
      warts and NGU were common and no distinct trends emerged.</p>

      <p>Circumcised and uncircumcised men with previously
      diagnosed genital herpes reported a similar duration since
      the initial episode and similar frequency and severity of
      recurrences in the preceding 12 months (Table 3). While there
      was a trend for more uncircumcised men to describe their
      initial genital herpes episode as severe and for circumcised
      men to describe it as moderate the difference was not
      significant.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p><span class="yellow">In this clinic-based prospectively
      collected survey we found no association between male
      circumcision status and STDs that are common in our
      population. Perhaps importantly, our study group was
      relatively racially homogeneous, lack of circumcision was not
      a marker of lower socioeconomic status (using the index of
      education level; Table 2),</span> and we controlled for a
      major parameter of sexual behaviour (lifetime number of
      sexual partners). We did not investigate the relationship
      between the presence of a prepuce and candidal
      balanoposthitis as we regard the causal relationship as
      proven. lack of circumcision is probably also a risk factor
      for chancroid but this condition was rare in our population.
      Similarly syphilis, acute hepatitis B and gonorrhoea were so
      uncommon among heterosexual men attending our clinic that we
      were unable to exclude any potential association. HIV-1
      infection was an exclusion criterion for the study.
      Symptomatic genital herpes and serological evidence of HSV-2
      infection were both common in our population. We previously
      reported on the risk factors for HSV-2 seropositivity in this
      study group.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> On multi-variate
      analysis the risk factors for HSV-2 infection were lifetime
      number of sexual partners, lower level of education and
      (marginally) a history of sexual contact with a women with
      genital herpes.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> In the present
      analysis, circumcision status did not correlate with a
      history of genital herpes, recurrent genital ulcers or itches
      (which might have represented undiagnosed herpes), or
      serological evidence of HSV-2 infection. As an unexpectedly
      high proportion (two thirds) of our study group were HSV-2
      seropositive it would not have been possible to demonstrate a
      two-fold protective effect for circumcision. Nevertheless no
      trend toward protection was apparent (Table 2).</p>

      <p>A previous Australian study which relied on the culture
      diagnosis of genital herpes did find a correlation between
      symptomatic genital herpes and lack of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> However this study did not quantify
      sexual partner numbers or other parameters of risk. Another
      possible explanation for this finding in the previous study
      might have been that men with intact foreskins harbouring
      HSV-2 may be more symptomatic and thus be more likely to
      present to a clinic. However we found that men who were HSV-2
      seropositive were no more symptomatic than circumcised men,
      nor were their lesion recurrences significantly more frequent
      or severe. As only a limited number of our study subjects
      were symptomatic, a larger study would be needed to exclude
      the possibility that uncircumcised men suffer more severe
      initial episodes of genital herpes.</p>

      <p>Previous studies of the effect of circumcision status on
      genital warts have produced conflicting results. In more
      heterogeneous populations lack of circumcision has variously
      been reported as making symptomatic genital warts both
      more<sup><a href="#n1">1,9,10</a></sup> and less<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> common. We found it exerted no
      effect. One retrospective study found that circumcision
      status affected the distribution of warts on the penis.
      Uncircumcised men were more likely to present with distal
      lesions and circumcised men with proximal lesions on the
      penis.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> We did not investigate
      this issue. We are unaware of any study to date that has
      attempted to correlate circumcision status with subclinical
      HPV infection.</p>

      <p>We determined no association between circumcision status
      and a history of NGU or gonorrhoea. In the case of gonorrhoea
      this may have been because this was uncommon in our
      population: the slight trend was for the presence of a
      foreskin to be "protective". A previous large retrospective
      American study found no association between gonococcal
      urethritis and circumcision status.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> In the same American study it was
      found that circumcised men were 1.65 times more likely to
      present with NGU than uncircumcised men (95% CI; 1
      .37-2.00).<sup><a href="#n13">l3</a></sup> The authors
      hypothesized that the physical presence of the foreskin may
      mask the symptoms (typically milder than gonorrhoea) of NGU.
      The difference from our study could be explained, at least in
      part, by the fact that our study group had a much lower
      threshold for seeking medical attention. The majority (Table
      1) were asymptomatic and had presented for STD screening.</p>

      <p>A recent South Australian study found that uncircumcised
      men were independently at increased risk of current diagnoses
      of both chlamydial and gonococcal infection (odds ratios of
      1.3 and 2. 1 respectively) on multi-variate analysis
      factoring in "multiple partners in the previous month.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> However, in a separate report on the
      same sample,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> being
      uncircumcised was also a risk factor for pediculosis pubis
      (OR 1.5)-a notion that lacks plausibility. In the latter
      report,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> being uncircumcised
      was protective for genital warts and had no significant
      effect on the risk of genital herpes.</p>

      <p>Only about 3% of the Australian male population would have
      religious reasons for circumcision. British workers have
      speculated that only another 1-2% would have unequivocal
      medical reasons for circumcision later in childhood, usually
      balanitis xerotica obliterans (leading to true phimosis) and
      possibly recurrent balanoposthitis.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> Much of the public rhetoric in
      Australia ("We don't cut babies' ears off because they need
      to wash behind them") is opposed to neonatal circumcision and
      a health service study had indicated that circumcision had
      become less common in Australia by 1983.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> Thus we were surprised to find that
      62% of our study population was circumcised and that younger
      men were just as likely to be circumcised as older men. A
      comparable overall circumcision (63%) rate has been reported
      from a South Australian STD clinic,<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> though in that clinic younger men
      were slightly less likely (55%) to have been circumcised.
      Some <a href="/library/general/gordon/">British authors</a>
      have deplored circumcision rates in that country of 7% and
      describe the majority of these procedures as
      "unnecessary".<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> As Australia
      enjoys close cultural links with Britain these dramatically
      different male circumcision rates imply that cultural
      determinants of the procedure are amenable to the influence
      of the "medical gatekeepers". Notably, Australia has a
      largely fee-for-service system of payment for health
      services.</p>

      <p>While the universally negative findings of the current
      study should contribute to the current debate on the need for
      male circumcision, they cannot be automatically extended to
      developing societies. In other settings, other STDs may be
      more prevalent and access to medical services or running
      water may significantly alter the relationship between
      circumcision and STDs including HIV infection.'<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> Care should also be taken to ensure
      that circumcision status is not a surrogate marker of
      culturally-determined risk or health-care seeking
      behaviour.</p>
