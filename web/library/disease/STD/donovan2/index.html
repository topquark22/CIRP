      <blockquote>
        <p class="1"><b>Objective:</b> To identify risk factors
        particularly circumcision status, associated with
        serological evidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)
        infection of heterosexual men.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Design:</b> A cross-sectional case-control
        study employing an anonymous delinked
        interviewer-administered questionnaire, clinical
        examination, and a type-specific serological test for
        HSV-2. Participants and setting: Three hundred consecutive
        heterosexual male patients at a public sexually
        transmissible diseases (STD) clinic in Sydney,
        Australia.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Main outcome measures:</b> Associations
        between serological evidence of HSV-2 infection and history
        of genital herpes or contact with genital herpes, history
        of other common STDs, and demographic and behavioural
        factors such as age, education level, number of sexual
        partners and lack of circumcision.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Results:</b> One hundred and ninety-four
        patients (64.7%) had antibodies to HSV-2 but only 24% of
        these gave a history of genital herpes. A history of
        genital herpes or sexual contact with genital herpes,
        reported total lifetime number of sexual partners, failure
        to complete high school and a history of non-gonococcal
        urethritis or genital warts were associated with
        serological evidence of HSV-2 infection at the univariate
        level. Neither increasing age nor lack of circumcision was
        associated with HSV-2 infection. Following multi-variate
        analysis only the lifetime number of partners and failure
        to finish high school were significantly strong predictors
        of HSV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Conclusion:</b> This is the highest
        prevalence of HSV-2 infection ever detected in an
        Australian population and one of the highest recorded
        globally. As younger men were as commonly infected as older
        men, and an earlier (1985) study involving the same clinic
        yielded a lower prevalence, it appears that a high level of
        ongoing HSV-2 transmission is occurring among Sydney
        heterosexuals. Increased awareness of this fact could
        enhance safer sex campaigns.<b>(Med J Aust 1994; 160:
        697-700)</b></p>

      <p class="2">The most common cause of genital ulcers in
      developed nations is herpes simplex virus type 2
      (HSV-2).<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> As well as breaching
      the epithelium HSV lesions are infiltrated with activated
      CD4+ lymphocytes,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> a major
      target cell for HIV-1. Prospective studies have determined
      HSV-2 infection to be a risk factor for HIV-1 infection of
      homosexual men practicing receptive anal intercourse.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,4</a></sup> Heterosexual men with penile HSV-2
      lesions could also be at higher risk of acquiring HIV-l
      infection during unprotected vaginal intercourse, as
      suggested by one cross-sectional study which controlled for
      sexual preference and other risk factors but not for number
      of sexual partners.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Reliable
      type-specific serological tests for HSV infection have
      recently become available which enable the accurate
      determination of the epidemiology of HSV-2 infection.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6,7</a></sup> Thus, we sought to determine the
      risk factors for HSV-2 infection in a population of
      heterosexual men attending a sexually transmissible diseases
      (STD) clinic in Sydney. We were particularly interested in
      investigating any effect that the presence of an intact
      foreskin might exert on acquiring HSV-2 infection, as a
      previous Australian study had found a positive
      association.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Participants and methods</h3>

      <p class="1">Expecting a lower HSV-2 seroprevalence rate than
      a study in the same clinic in 1985,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> we calculated that a sample size of
      over 270 was required to demonstrate a 50% protective effect
      from circumcision with 80% power at the 5% significance
      level. Thus, the study group comprised 300 consecutive
      heterosexual male patients who saw a particular clinician (I
      B) and required venopuncture for any other purpose at the
      Sydney Sexual Health (previously STD) Centre, Sydney
      Hospital, between December 1990 and May 1991. Men who
      reported ever having been homosexually active were excluded
      because HSV-2 infection acquired by receptive anal
      intercourse could have affected our results.</p>

      <p class="2">The aims of the study were explained to all
      subjects and signed informed consent was obtained. There were
      no refusals. The study was approved by the Eastern Sydney
      Area Health Service Research Ethics Committee.</p>

      <p class="2">A data collection form with an anonymous
      identifier code was completed by the clinician, and an extra
      5 ml of blood were collected for the study. The data
      collected included:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Age.<br />
         Level of education.<br />
         Circumcision status (confirmed by physical
        examination).<br />
         Past history of genital herpes or symptoms suggestive
        of<br />
         genital herpes (undiagnosed genital ulcer or
        recurrent<br />
         genital lesions/itches).<br />
         Other STDs.<br />
         Lifetime number of sexual partners (women with whom they
        had had vaginal intercourse).<br />
         Current clinical diagnoses were added to each subject's
        history of STDs on the data collection form.<br />
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">The serological analyses for HSV were performed
      at the Virology Department Centre for Infectious Diseases and
      Microbiology, Institute for Clinical Pathology and Medical
      Research, Westmead Hospital, on an anonymous and blinded
      basis.</p>

      <p class="2">As described elsewhere,<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> sera were screened for total HSV
      antibody by a complement fixing antibody (HSV-CFA) test.
      Positive specimens on HSV-CFA testing were then subject to an
      indirect IgG enzyme immune assay (EIA) specific to the 92 kDa
      HSV-2 glycoprotein G (gG-2).<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      All 15 randomly selected sera that were positive for HSV-2 by
      EIA testing were confirmed by western blot<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> as having antibody to the specific
      gG-2 glycoprotein. Those samples that were positive for total
      HSV antibody by CFA but negative to HSV-2 by EIA were assayed
      by western blot for antibody to the HSV-1-specific 130 kDa
      gG-1 glycoprotein.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test was used for
      categorical variables and Student's &tau; test for continuous
      variables. Variables of significance in univariate analysis
      were entered into multivariate models. All &tau; values were
      two talied and significance was set at the 5% level.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p class="2">The patients were representative of the general
      clinical load of exclusively heterosexual men at the Centre
      (over 95% of the men are white, with most of the rest of
      Asian origin). Their reasons for attendance or diagnosis at
      the time of consultation are outlined in the Box. Only 14
      participants (4.7%) attended because of a current problem
      with genital herpes. HIV-1 infection is rare among
      heterosexual men attending the Centre<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> and none of the subjects had HIV-1
      infection. Two hundred and twenty-one men (73.7%) had
      positive results of total HSV-CFA testing. One hundred and
      ninety-four (64.7%) had HSV-2 antibodies on eia testing,
      although only 46 (23.7%) of these recorded a history of
      genital herpes. Put in another way, of the 254 men never
      diagnosed with genital herpes, 148 (58.3%) were HSV-2
      seropositive. All 15 randomly selected sera that were
      positive for HSV-2 gG-3 by eia were also positive for gG-2 by
      western blot, confirming the specificity of the eia test as
      previously reported.<sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup> All of
      the 27 men who had positive results of total HSV-CFA testing,
      but negative results for HSV-2 by eia testing, had sera that
      reacted with the specific gG-1 (130 kDa) glycoprotein of
      HSV-l and not the HSV-2-specific gG-2 (92 kDa) glycoprotein
      on western blot assay.</p>

      <h3>Univariate analysis</h3>

      <p class="2">All of the 46 men who gave a history of genital
      herpes had serological evidence of HSV-2 infection, again
      confirming the sensitivity of the eia test. On univariate
      analysis a past history of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU),
      genital warts, genital herpes, and known sexual contact with
      a woman with genital herpes, were associated with the
      presence of HSV-2 antibodies (Table 1).</p>

      <p class="2">Lower level of education (failure to complete
      high school) was also associated with HSV-2 infection (Table
      1). Age, lack of circumcision, or history of undiagnosed
      genital ulcer(s) or itches was not associated with HSV-2
      antibodies (Table 1). Men with HSV-2 antibodies reported
      almost twice as many lifetime partners as men without such
      antibodies (?= 0.014 [Table 1]). The positive correlation was
      also proportionate to lifetime number of sexual partners -
      48% of the 35 men with one to five partners rising to 100% of
      17 men with 41-50 partners had HSV-2 antibodies (Figure).
      There was a slightly, but not significantly, lower prevalence
      of HSV-2 antibodies among men reporting more than 50 lifetime
      partners compared with those with 41-50 partners (Figure).
      The men with one to five partners were not more likely to
      have a history of genital herpes or contact with genital
      herpes than the group as a whole (data not shown). Other STDs
      such as gonorrhoea, syphilis and hepatitis B were reported
      too infrequently to determine any association with a positive
      HSV-2 test.</p>

      <h3>Multivariate analysis</h3>

      <p class="2">Mantel-Haenszel estimates of odds ratio were
      calculated (categories as in the Figure) after allowing for
      the effect of lifetime number of sexual partners (Table 2).
      After this transformation, the positive association of HSV-2
      seropositivity with failure to finish high school remained
      significant, while the positive association with a history of
      contact with genital herpes became only marginally
      significant (P=0.067). The associations of HSV-2 antibodies
      with a history of NGU and a history of genital warts lost
      significance (Table 2).</p>

      <p class="2">A multiple logistic regression model confirmed
      that the associations of HSV-2 antibodies with NGU and
      genital warts were not significant. In models that included
      the log of lifetime number of partners, completion of high
      school (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.16-0.92; P=0.031) and history of contact with genital
      herpes (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.04-7.86; P= 0.042) remained
      significant after allowing for each other.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="2">The simple index of lifetime number of sexual
      partners used in this study provided clear evidence of the
      sexual transmissibility of HSV-2 infection. Although starting
      from a high base (48% of men with five or fewer partners were
      seropositive), the correlation between number of sexual
      partners and HSV-2 infection was strong. Previous studies
      using other indices, e.g. years of sexual experience<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> and a number of partners in the
      previous month,<sup><a href="#n11">11,12</a></sup> also
      produced significant trends. However, lifetime number of
      sexual partners is a crude index. Most women with HSV-2
      infection are asymptomatic.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      As HSV-2 is shed from the female genital tract
      intermittently, repeated sexual exposure to a single
      asymptomatic partner with HSV-2 infection over several months
      or years could pose a greater cumulative risk of acquiring
      HSV-2 than isolated encounters with many women.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> This could explain why HSV-2
      infection was common in this study among men with fewer
      partners. Men with fewer partners may also have been less
      likely to use condoms. Similarly, it is possible that men
      with very high numbers of partners may have been more likely
      to practice safer sex, thus yielding the slightly lower
      prevalence of HSV-2 antibodies than men with intermediate
      numbers of partners. As most of these men began sexual
      activity before the safer sex campaigns, and markers of HSV-2
      infection are cumulative over time, data on the use of safer
      sex were not collected in this study.</p>

      <p class="2">Univariate associations between HSV-2 infection
      and NGU or HSV-2 infection and genital warts may be
      attributable to these diseases having the common risk factor
      of number of sexual partners. This finding affirms that
      future studies of the role of genital herpes as a risk factor
      for HIV-1 infection - or for any other STD - should also
      control for numbers of sexual partners.</p>

      <p class="2">The reduced correlation between HSV-2 infection
      and history of sexual contact with genital herpes when the
      number of lifetime sexual partners was taken into account may
      be due to awareness of infection: possibly, with more
      partners there is a greater chance of one of the female
      partners suffering symptoms and reporting it to the man. The
      high prevalence of HSV-2 infection (64.7%) detected in the
      study group is remarkable and has rarely been exceeded even
      in STD clinic studies.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Although
      the study group was probably more sexually active than the
      general population and, by attending an STD clinic, was
      exhibiting concern about STDs, most men with HSV-2 infection
      reported no diagnosis or history of symptoms suggestive of
      genital herpes. While serological screening and closer
      clinical scrutiny would probably increase the diagnostic
      yield, as with women in STD clinics,<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> unrecognized genital herpes is
      clearly extremely common and possibly increasing among
      multi-partnered heterosexual men in Sydney.</p>

      <p class="2">A previous survey of male and female patients
      from the same clinic in 1985 revealed a seroprevalence of
      HSV-2 infection of 45% (unpublished data) compared with an
      average of 40.6% in three STD clinics surveyed in a later
      study using a slightly less sensitive assay.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> The previous survey also included
      female prostitutes and homosexually active men - groups that
      would be expected to have higher prevalence rates of HSV-2
      infection than heterosexual men.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> We were particularly concerned that
      53% of men under the age of 25 years had evidence of HSV-2
      infection despite most of their sexually active lives
      coinciding with an era of public education about HIV-l
      infection. While female prostitutes in Sydney may have been
      able to reduce the incidence of a "core group"-associated STD
      such as gonorrhoea by using condoms,<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> when sex is not related to
      prostitution there appears to be less acceptance of
      condoms.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Although data on
      condom use were not collected in this study, our findings
      suggest that safer sex was not the usual practice of these
      young men. Alternatively, the in-vitro efficacy of
      condoms<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> translated poorly
      into in-vivo protection against HSV-2 infection. Studies are
      needed of the in-vivo efficacy of condoms as protection from
      genital herpes.</p>

      <p class="2">The significance of the association between
      HSV-2 infection and lower level of education is uncertain but
      has been noted previously.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      One possibility is that this reflects factors influencing
      partner selection. Another is that lower education levels
      indicate poor compliance with strategies for safer sex. We
      have no data to evaluate either hypothesis.</p>

      <p class="2">Although not an objective of this study, given
      the apparent greater efficiency of male-to-female
      transmission of genital HSV<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>
      and higher prevalences of markers of HSV-2 infection in
      female populations in the United States,<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> our results suggest even higher
      rates of HSV2 infection in the female partners of these men.
      Further studies including women with multiple partners as
      well as population-based seroprevalence studies are
      indicated.</p>

      <p class="2">In contrast with previous studies,<sup><a
      href="#n8">8,20</a></sup> <b>we found no evidence of the
      presence of an intact foreskin being a risk factor for HSV-2
      infection.</b></p>

      <p class="2">However, these earlier studies relied on the
      presence of clinical lesions for the diagnosis of genital
      herpes and reported no quantitative data on sexual
      behaviour.</p>

      <p>Increased efforts to control the spread of HSV-2 infection
      in the community or to control the frequency of recurrences
      of genital herpes lesions may be justified because of the
      direct morbidity of HSV2 infection for adults<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> and neonates. If genital herpes is
      proven to be a cofactor for HIV-l transmission in the
      heterosexual context, a "spin-off" could be a contribution to
      HIV-1 control.</p>

      <p class="2">A screening program for HSV-2 infection would be
      resource intensive and likely to have only a limited impact
      at a population level, but it might raise the community
      awareness of STDs other than HIV-l infection, and thus
      reinforce the need for safer sex. It should be a salutary
      lesson that, as a consequence of the singular attention given
      to it, a recent survey of British teenagers found that most
      of them thought that HIV-1 infection was the most common
      STD.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Fewer than half of a
      large sample of Australian Year 10-12 students listed genital
      herpes as an STD.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> This study
      records one of the highest prevalences of HSV-2 infection in
      the world, and the highest ever detected in an Australian
      population. A high level of ongoing HSV-2 transmission is
      apparent among Sydney heterosexuals.</p>

      <p class="2">Increased awareness of this situation is
      necessary to enhance safer sex campaigns.</p>
