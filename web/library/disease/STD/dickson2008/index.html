      <p class="dicksonabstract"><b><span
      class="dickson2">Objective</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; To determine
      the impact of early childhood circumcision on sexually
      transmitted infection (STI) acquisition to age 32
      years.<br />
      <span class="dickson2">Study design</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; The
      circumcision status of a cohort of children born in 1972 and
      1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand was sought at age 3 years.
      Information about STIs was obtained at ages 21, 26, and 32
      years. The incidence rates of STI acquisition were
      calculated, taking into account timing of first sex, and
      comparisons were made between the circumcised men and
      uncircumcised men. Adjustments were made for potential
      socioeconomic and sexual behavior confounding factors where
      appropriate.<br />
      <span class="dickson2">Results</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the
      499 men studied, 201 (40.3%) had been circumcised by age 3
      years. The circumcised and uncircumcised groups differed
      little in socioeconomic characteristics and sexual behavior.
      Overall, up to age 32 years, the incidence rates for all STIs
      were not statistically significantly differentM-^W23.4 and
      24.4 per 1000 person-years for the uncircumcised and
      circumcised men, respectively. This was not affected by
      adjusting for any of the socioeconomic or sexual behavior
      characteristics.<br />
      <span class="dickson2">Conclusions</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; These
      findings are consistent with recent population-based
      cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found
      that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce
      the risk of the common STIs in the general population in such
      countries. <i>(J Pediatr 2008;152:383-7)</i></b></p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: This paper reports actually
      reports a finding that the circumcised men in this study had
      slightly more STIs than non-circumcised men, although the
      finding was not "statistically significant".</p>
