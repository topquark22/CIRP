      <h2>The importance of ethnicity as a risk factor<br />
       for STDs and sexual behaviour among heterosexuals<br />
       [see comments]</h2>
      <br />
      <b>Hooykaas C; van der Velde FW; van der Linden MM;<br />
      van Doornum-GJ; Coutinho-RA</b> 

      <p>Municipal Health Service of Amsterdam,<br />
      Department of Public Health,<br />
       The Netherlands.</p>
      <hr />

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To study risk factors for sexually
        transmitted diseases (STDs) and sexual behaviour.
        Especially to assess whether there is a higher risk of
        being infected with STDs among ethnic minorities, and if so
        for what reasons.</p>

        <p><b>SETTING:</b> STD-clinic of the Municipal Health
        Service of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.</p>

        <p><b>SUBJECTS:</b> Cross-sectional study of heterosexuals
        (255 men and 343 women) with multiple sexual partners, who
        participated between October 1987 and January 1990.</p>

        <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Besides STD-related complaints,
        ethnicity was an important independent predictor of one or
        more diagnosed genital STDs. STD-prevalence was higher
        among men born in Turkey (47%, OR = 3.4) and men born in
        Surinam (36%, OR = 2.1), compared with Dutch men (21%).
        While Turkish men had mainly riskful sexual behaviour with
        prostitutes, Surinam men had more often riskful sexual
        contact with private partners. Among women, STD prevalence
        was higher among West-European (38%, OR = 2.3) and
        Latin-American women (30%, OR = 1.6), compared with Dutch
        women (21%). Latin American women had more often riskful
        sexual contact with clients; sexual behaviour of
        West-European women was riskful with both clients and
        private partners.</p>

        <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Prevention activities should be
        directed at specific sexual and ethnic groups, sources of
        information should be carefully selected, and some groups
        should be addressed differently with regard to language but
        to content as well.</p>

        <p><span class="CIRP">[CIRP Note: This study is significant
        because Dutch men are usually non-circumcised intact males,
        but immigrant men from Turkey and Surinam are Muslims, who
        are usually circumcised for religious reasons. This study
        confirms the findings of <a
        href="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann et al</a>. that
        circumcised men tend to engage in more risky sexual
        behavior and have a higher incidence of STD.]</span></p>
