      <h2>Herpes simplex virus type 2 status at age 26 is not
      related to early circumcision in a birth cohort.</h2>

      <p><b>Dickson N, van Roode T, Paul C.</b></p>

      <p>From the <a
      href="http://dnmeds.otago.ac.nz/departments/psm/index.html"
      target="_blank">Department of Preventive and Social
      Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/"
      target="_blank">University of Otago</a> Medical School,
      Dunedin, New Zealand.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> The objective of this study was to
      determine if circumcision in early childhood affects the risk
      of acquiring herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)
      infection.</p>

      <p><b>STUDY:</b> Study members were born in 1972-1973 in
      Dunedin, New Zealand. Circumcision status was sought at age
      3, when the cohort was established. Information about sexual
      behavior was obtained at ages 21 and 26. Serum was tested for
      HSV-2 antibodies at age 26 for 435 men (82.9% of the
      surviving cohort).</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Of eligible men, 40.2% had been
      circumcised. The prevalence of HSV-2 antibodies was 7.3% in
      uncircumcised men and 7.4% in circumcised men. Social and
      sexual factors were very similar between the 2 groups and
      adjustment had no effect on the association (odds ratio, 1.1;
      95% confidence interval, 0.46-2.5). Seroconversion rates
      according to years since first sexual intercourse were 0.85
      and 0.86 per 100 person-years for uncircumcised and
      circumcised men.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> <span class="yellow">The results
      support a lack of association between circumcision status and
      HSV-2 acquisition,</span> although a small effect cannot be
      ruled out.</p>
