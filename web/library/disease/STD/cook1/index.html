        <p class="1"><b>Objectives.</b> New evidence linking lack
        of circumcision with sexually transmitted human
        immunodeficiency virus revives concerns about circumcision
        and other sexually transmitted diseases. This study was
        undertaken to assess the relationship between circumcision
        and syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, genital
        herpes, nongonococcal urethritis, and exophytic genital
        warts.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Methods.</b> A cross-sectional study of
        2776 heterosexual men attending a sexually transmitted
        disease clinic in 1988 was used to investigate the
        relationship between circumcision and sexually transmitted
        diseases. Subjects with sexually transmitted diseases and
        those without such diseases were compared after adjustment
        for age, race, zip code of residence, other sexually
        transmitted diseases, and number of sexual partners.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Results.</b> A positive relationship was
        observed between uncircumcised status and both syphilis and

        noted between uncircumcised status and genital herpes,
        chlamydial infection, or nongonococcal urethritis.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Conclusions.</b> Uncircumcised men were

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="1">The possible role of male circumcision in the
      acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases has taken on new
      significance with recent evidence that human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) infection in men is associated with uncircumcised
      status.<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> Sexually transmitted
      diseases previously linked with uncircumcised status include
      chancroid, syphilis, gonorrhea, and genital herpes
      infection<sup><a href="#n1">1,4-7</a></sup>; however, most of
      the reported associations between these diseases and
      uncircumcised status have not been adequately adjusted for
      potentially confounding factors. The present cross-sectional
      study was undertaken to examine the relationship between
      circumcision status and genital infection by Treponema
      pallidum, Neisseria gonorhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis, in
      addition to clinical evidence of nongonococcal urethritis,
      genital herpes, and exophytic genital warts, with adjustment
      for potentially confounding factors.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p class="1"><i>Study Population</i></p>

      <p class="1">The study population included men attending the
      Seattle-King County Department of Public Health Sexually
      Transmitted Disease Clinic at Harborview Medical Center
      between January and December 1988. The clinic, which provides
      comprehensive services related to sexually transmitted
      diseases such as diagnosis, treatment, education, and risk
      reduction counseling, served 80 to 120 patients per day in
      1988. The exact number of unique men seen in the clinic in
      1988 is unknown; the Department of Public Health tallies new
      problem visits, to which an individual can contribute
      multiple times. Among all male visits to the clinic in 1988,
      8034 new problem visits were recorded. Study subjects were
      identified in l988 through patient medical charts that had
      been archived according to the year of visit. Charts are
      placed into the archives after approximately 1 year if the
      patient has not returned to the clinic in the interim. Charts
      of men who returned to the clinic in 1989 were not included
      in the study. According to statistics compiled by the clinic,
      the study population closely matched that of all men seen for
      a new problem in 1988 in regard to cases of syphilis (0.7% vs
      0.8%), gonorrhea (8.1% vs 10.0%), warts (14.5% vs 14.2%),
      chlamydial infection (6.8% vs 6.9%), nongonococcal urethritis
      (29.0% vs 25.4%), and genital herpes (4.7% vs 5.0%). Thus,
      the study population was considered a good representative
      sample. Of the 4137 subjects identified, 897 did not meet the
      study inclusion criteria (380 who presented for HIV screening
      only and did not have a genital examination, 306 who were
      homosexual or bisexual, and 211 who did not reside in King
      County). Of the 3240 eligible study subjects, 464 did not
      have circumcision status recorded and were excluded from the
      analysis. The resulting study population consisted of 2776
      heterosexual men. All data used in this study were abstracted
      in 1990 from standardized clinic records of men who attended
      the clinic in 1988. These records included information
      concerning demographic characteristics of the patient,
      reason(s) for visit, symptoms, sexual history (new sexual
      partner in the last month, number of sexual partners in the
      last month, and days since last sexual exposure), prior
      sexually transmitted disease history, and results of all
      physical and laboratory examinations. All consenting patients
      seen for a new problem underwent genital exam- ination and
      had urethral swabs taken for a Gram-stained smear and for
      cultures for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Blood for
      serologic testing of syphilis (reagent antibody) was obtained
      from all consenting patients, and darkfield examination was
      performed on suspected syphilitic lesions. Diagnoses of warts
      and genital herpes were presumptively based on the clinical
      appearance of lesions; cultures for herpes simplex virus were
      obtained when considered necessary by the clinician. Current
      syphilis was determined by a positive darkfield test from a
      suspicious lesion or by a positive rapid plasma reagent (RPR)
      or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer (titer
      above 1:2) with confirmatory T. pallidum.</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Hemaglutination assay (TPHA)
      serology.</i></p>

      <p class="2">This definition included primary, secondary, and
      some early latent syphilis cases; however, all cases were
      newly diagnosed. The diagnosis of nongonococcal urethritis
      was based on the presence of at least two of the following
      criteria: subject-reported urethral discharge or dysuria,
      presence of a purulent urethral discharge on exam, or a
      urethral Gram-stained smear that showed at least five
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes per 1000X oil immersion field
      for at least three fields. The combination of the first two
      criteria was used only if the N. gonorrhoeae culture was
      negative. A subset of subjects (n = 278) had elevated
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes on urethral smear; these
      subjects were given a clinical diagnosis of nongonococcal
      urethritis and treated for this condition but were not
      recorded as having an abnormal urethral discharge. Addition
      of these subjects to those in the more stringently defined
      category of nongonococcal urethritis did not alter the study
      results, so they were combined in the final analysis.</p>

      <p class="2">For this study, the principal sexually
      transmitted diseases evaluated were laboratory-confirmed N.
      gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and T. pallidum infection and
      clinical evidence of nongonococcal urethritis, genital warts,
      or genital herpes. The "other sexually transmitted disease"
      category comprised subjects with a variety of diagnoses,
      including pediculosis pubis (n = 81), scabies (n = 33), and
      molluscum contagiosum (n = 69). The reference group was
      composed of subjects who were not diagnosed with any of the
      above sexually transmitted diseases or conditions.</p>

      <p class="2">Circumcision status was recorded by the
      clinician as part of the routine examination. Place of
      residence in King County was categorized by zip code into six
      Seattle areas and one non-Seattle area, as explained in
      detail elsewhere.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="1"><i>Statistical Analysis</i></p>

      <p class="2">The initial 1988 clinic visit of each subject
      was used for analysis. The prevalence of each of the
      principal study diseases was determined on the basis of
      circumcision status. In order to allow direct sexually
      transmitted disease prevalence comparisons between
      circumcised and uncircumcised men, prevalences were
      standardized to the combined age and race distribution of the
      entire study population.</p>

      <p class="2">Characteristics of those with sexually
      transmitted diseases and those in the reference group without
      such diseases were compared. Odds ratios (ORs) were used as
      the measure of association to assess the relationship between
      circumcision status and each disease category. Logistic
      regression<sup><a href="#n9">9,10</a></sup> was used to
      calculate adjusted odds ratios and the associated 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs). Since subjects could have
      multiple sexually transmitted disease diagnoses, all
      variables were placed in a single model to allow for the
      control of multiple diseases. Therefore, adjusted odds ratios
      reflect an association between a particular sexually
      transmitted disease and circumcision status that is not
      influenced by the presence of other sexually transmitted
      diseases. All analyses were conducted with SAS.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p class="2">Prevalences of Sexually Transmitted Diseases
      Under Study Age- and race-standardized prevalence figures
      revealed that, in this clinic population, the prevalence of
      current syphilis was higher in uncircumcised men than in
      circumcised men (2.5% vs 0.6%; P &lt; .001), as was the
      prevalence of gonorrhea (12.7% vs 8.1%; P &lt; .01).
      Conversely, the prevalence of exophytic warts was higher in
      circumcised men (17.6% vs 11.0%; P &lt; .001). No significant
      differences between uncircumcised and circumcised men were
      observed for prevalences of nongonococcal urethritis, (30.2%
      vs 32.7%), genital herpes (8.8% vs 8.7%), or urethral
      infection with C. trachomatis (7.2% vs 6.4%).</p>

      <p class="1"><i>Subject Characteristics Related to Current
      Diagnosis</i></p>

      <p class="2">The study population, composed of 540
      uncircumcised men (19.5%) and 2236 circumcised men (80.5%),
      is described in Table 1 according to sexually transmitted
      disease status. In comparison with the reference group, those
      with gonorrhea, chlamydial infections, and genital warts were
      younger (P &lt; .05); subjects with a diagnosis of current
      syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or nongonococcal
      urethritis were more likely to be African American, whereas
      those with exophytic warts were more likely to be white.
      Subjects with current diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydial
      infection, and nongonococcal urethritis more often reported a
      new sexual partner in the previous month and two or more
      partners in the previous month than those in the reference
      group. Subjects diagnosed with any of the principal study
      sexually transmitted diseases were more likely than those
      with no disease diagnosis to present at the clinic with
      symptoms and less likely to present for screening.</p>

      <h3>Association of Uncircumcised Status with Current
      Disease</h3>

      <p class="1"><i>Diagnosis</i></p>

      <p class="2">Crude and adjusted odds ratios for the
      association of uncircumcised status with the study diseases
      are presented in Table 2. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated
      by fitting a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for
      age, race, number of sexual partners in the previous month,
      place of residence, and the other sexually transmitted
      diseases. No adjustment was made for a new partner in the
      last month, days since last sexual exposure, marital status,
      and reason for visit because of their negligible effects on
      the estimated odds ratios. No adjustment was made for a prior
      history of sexually transmitted diseases because any
      influence of circumcision status was assumed to be the same
      for a prior diagnosis as for the current diagnosis, and
      adjustment would have controlled for the associations the
      present study sought to quantify. In the adjusted analysis,
      an elevated odds ratio was noted for the association of
      uncircumcised status with current syphilis (OR = 4.0, 95% CI
      = 1.9, 8.4) and gonorrhea (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2, 2.2). A
      negative association was noted for warts and uncircumcised
      status (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5, 0.9). Uncircumcised status
      was not associated with nongonococcal urethritis, genital
      herpes, or urethral infection with C. trachomatis.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="2">The results of this study support the hypothesis
      that circumcision status is related to some, but not all,
      sexually transmitted diseases. The positive findings
      associating syphilis and gonococcal infections with
      uncircumcised status in the present study were similar to
      those previously reported by the Public Health Department
      Special Treatment Clinic in Perth, Australia.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Age-adjusted results from the Perth study
      indicated a positive relationship with both syphilis (OR =
      5.4, 95% CI = 1.4, 21.1) and gonorrhea (OR = 2.3 95% CI =
      1.5, 3.7). Contrary to results in the present study, the
      Perth study also found a positive relationship between
      uncircumcised status and herpes and warts. Discrepancies
      between the two studies could be due to the present study's
      finer adjustment for confounding variables and restriction to
      heterosexual men. Other studies have also investigated
      specific relationships between certain sexually transmitted
      diseases and uncircumcised status.</p>

      <p class="2">In a study conducted at the Whitechapel Clinic
      in London, a comparison of men with culture-confirmed herpes
      and controls revealed a higher proportion of men with herpes
      being uncircumcised.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      Interpretation of this finding is limited since the control
      group consisted of men with a number of other sexually
      transmitted disease diagnoses that each could have had a
      specific relationship with circumcision status.</p>

      <p class="2">A study of active duty army men found that
      uncircumcised status was protective for nongonococcal
      urethritis but not related to gonococcal infection.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Although that study adjusted for
      important confounders, direct comparisons with the present
      study are difficult since the former included subjects who
      apparently contributed to the case groups several times. In
      the final analysis, there were approximately five times more
      men in both the gonorrhea and nongonococcal urethritis groups
      than in the control (no sexually transmitted disease) group.
      In addition, the ratio of nongonococcal urethritis cases to
      gonorrhea cases was much lower than that typically observed
      in sexually transmitted disease clinic populations. Finally,
      a study of Canadian army men reported a higher proportion of
      uncircumcised active duty men with warts and syphilis
      compared with the proportion of uncircumcised men among new
      recruits.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Although
      suggestive, the results could easily be biased as a result of
      the comparison of two distinctly different groups of men.</p>

      <p class="2">It was not possible to evaluate chancroid
      because it was not found in this study population. It was
      also not possible to evaluate HIV infection as a result of
      its very low prevalence (estimated to be 0.6% among
      heterosexual men seen in the clinic from June 1988 through
      December 1990).</p>

      <p class="2">Therefore, no comparisons can be made with the
      many studies linking uncircumcised status with chancroid,
      including recent studies from East Africa that have linked
      uncircumcised status with both chancroid and HIV
      seroconversion.<sup><a href="#n1">1,3</a></sup> Mechanisms
      for differential risks of sexually transmitted diseases based
      on circumcision status remain undefined. Possible theories
      include the following:</p>

      <p class="2">(1) trauma of the intact foreskin during sexual
      intercourse produces microscopic lesions that increase
      susceptibility;</p>

      <p class="2">(2) the environment under the foreskin could
      extend the survival of infectious agents and thus prolong
      exposure to viable organisms;</p>

      <p class="2">(3) the thinner, less cornified epithelium on
      the glans and preputial sac of an uncircumcised male may
      provide less of a physical barrier to microbial invasion;
      and</p>

      <p class="2">(4) nonspecific balanitis, not uncommon in
      uncircumcised men, may predispose to certain sexually
      transmitted diseases.</p>

      <p class="2">The finding that circumcision status is
      associated with some but not all sexually transmitted
      diseases may be related to the differing pathogenesis of
      these diseases. For syphilis, entry by T. pallidum is thought
      to occur through microscopic abrasions and not through
      undamaged, keratinated epithelium.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> In uncircumcised men, trauma of the
      foreskin or the thin epidermis of the glans during sexual
      activity can open a passageway of infection for treponemes.
      The thicker, cornified epithelium on the glans of a
      circumcised male may be less susceptible to abrasions and,
      therefore, to entry by T. pallidum. For gonorrhea, the inner
      lining of the foreskin<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> might
      create an environment conducive to the survival or growth of
      N. gonorrhoeae and, perhaps, to entry into the urethra and
      enhanced infectivity.</p>

      <p class="2">A limitation of the present study arises from
      the available information on genital herpes and genital
      warts. For genital herpes, diagnosis was based on the
      presence of clinical lesions, with or without confirmatory
      cultures, and subclinical infections could have been
      undetected. If uncircumcised subjects were more likely to
      have inapparent infections, this study could have
      underestimated the true association of uncircumcised status
      with genital herpes. The finding that genital warts were less
      likely to be diagnosed in uncircumcised men was of interest.
      Further information on the anatomic distribution of penile
      warts is actually the relevant information for assessing the
      influence of circumcision status on wart lesions and will be
      addressed in a subsequent paper.</p>

      <p class="2">A possible concern is that the study subjects
      presumably came to the clinic as a result of a problem
      related to a sexually transmitted disease and that,
      therefore, an elevated prevalence of one disease would
      predict a lower prevalence of some other disease. In this
      cross-sectional population, subjects were not selected on the
      basis of the presence of symptoms related to, or a diagnosis
      of, a sexually transmitted disease. Thirty-five percent of
      the study population did not have a sexually transmitted
      disease diagnosis. Furthermore, a subject could be diagnosed
      with multiple diseases, and, because testing for infection
      with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis and for syphilis was
      routine in all patients, diagnoses were not mutually
      exclusive. Since neither a sexually transmitted disease
      diagnosis nor a single diagnosis were obligatory for
      inclusion in the study, the prevalence of one disease should
      not necessarily have influenced the prevalence of another
      disease. Because the study population was composed of men
      presenting at a public clinic, we were unable to control for
      certain self-selection factors in the analysis. The frequency
      of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, health-seeking
      behavior, and perception of disease could all influence
      whether or not a person presents at a clinic. Therefore, the
      results can be generalized only to men who, given the
      possibility of a sexually transmitted disease, would present
      at a clinic. Men who do not seek care or who seek care from
      clinicians in private practice are likely to be different
      from the men who present at clinics such as the one described
      here.</p>

      <p class="2">In addition, the study population represented a
      sample of all heterosexual male visits to the clinic in 1988.
      It is possible that the proportion of uncircumcised and
      circumcised men in the study population differed from the
      total 1988 clinic population. Of particular concern are the
      men who returned to the clinic in 1989 and thus were not
      included in the study population as a result of their charts
      not being archived. This potential selection bias cannot be
      evaluated directly because the circumcision status of all men
      seen at the clinic in 1988 or 1989 was not tallied in health
      department statistics. However, the health department does
      report the age and race/ethnicity distributions for all male
      heterosexual clinic visits.</p>

      <p class="2">Since these two characteristics were the
      strongest predictors of circumcision status in the study
      population, we compared the age and race/ethnicity
      distribution of the study population, all clinic visits of
      male heterosexuals in 1988, and all clinic visits of male
      heterosexuals in 1989. No significant differences were
      observed between the three groups, indicating a similar
      corn-position in terms of age, race/ethnicity, and,
      presumably, circumcision status. This implied that the source
      of the study population, the archived clinic charts, was a
      reasonable reflection of all heterosexual male clinic visits
      in 1988. Furthermore, the age and race/ethnicity
      distributions did not fluctuate from year to year, and,
      presumably, neither did the circumcision status of
      heterosexual men attending the clinic. Therefore, although
      this potential bias cannot be dismissed, we believe it is
      unlikely that it had a major impact on the study results.</p>

      <p class="2">As with all cross-sectional studies, it is
      difficult to distinguish newly acquired cases from more
      established cases, especially for sexually transmitted
      diseases such as warts and herpes. However, all of the study
      cases were classified as new problem visits at the clinic.
      The reason that some individuals delayed in seeking medical
      care is unknown but could be due to variations in disease
      perception, as well as in behavior with regard to seeking
      health care. As a result of this limitation, we addressed
      only the issue of who was or was not diagnosed with a
      sexually transmitted disease at their initial 1988 clinic
      visit, not acquisition per se.</p>

      <p class="2">A unique feature of circumcision is that it
      occurs almost exclusively in infancy or early childhood in
      the United States. A very small percentage of men require or
      request the procedure as adults. Therefore, we can safely
      assume that in almost all of the men attending the clinic,
      circumcision status was determined prior to the occurrence of
      the disease. Thus, although a cross-sectional design was used
      to investigate the association between circumcision and
      sexually transmitted diseases, the temporal sequence of
      events was not in question.</p>

      <p class="2">The determination of circumcision status is not
      always straightforward be cause of incomplete circumcisions
      and foreskins that naturally retract to some degree.
      Information from a larger database of patients seen in the
      clinic from 1980 to 1989 was used to compare the recorded
      circumcision statuses for any patient with multiple visits.
      Of the 5666 patients in the database, 2266(40%) were seen
      more than once. Only 13 subjects had conflicting circumcision
      statuses recorded. Therefore, we are confident that the
      clinicians consistently identified and recorded circumcision
      status in the vast majority of subjects.</p>

      <p class="2">Benefits and disadvantages of male circumcision
      continue to be controversial, although recent research has
      attempted to address pertinent health issues associated with
      circumcision status.<sup><a href="#n14">14,15</a></sup> The
      results of this study do not show a definitive benefit of
      circumcision; although uncircumcised men were more likely to
      have syphilis and gonorrhea, circumcised men were more likely
      to have genital warts and equally likely to have
      nongonococcal urethritis and genital herpetic lesions.</p>
