        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <p class="1"><b>Introduction</b> - A recent study comparing
        heterosexual men with and without confirmed sexually
        transmitted diseases (STDs) in an urban STD clinic showed
        that uncircumcised men were less likely than circumcised
        men to have genital wart detectable by clinical examination
        (adjusted odds ratio 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.4,
        0.9). Based on these initial findings we hypothesised that
        the appearance and anatomic distribution of genital warts,
        and possibly treatment response, may be different for
        circumcised and uncircumcised men.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Methods</b> - The anatomic location,
        appearance, number of warts, and response to treatment was
        investigated through review of medical records of 459
        heterosexual men with genital warts detected in 1988.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Results</b> - Age- and race-adjusted
        estimates indicated that among men with genital warts,
        warts were detected much more commonly on the distal penis
        - that is, the corona, frenulum, glans or urethrul meatus -
        among uncircumcised men (26%) than among circumcised men
        (3%) (OR 10.0, 95% CI 3.9, 25.7). Where the appearance was
        specified, warts were more often described as condylomatous
        in uncircumcised men and slightiy more often as papular in
        circumcised men. No significant difference between
        circumcised and uncircumcised men was seen in the number of
        return visits to the clinic for persistent warts after
        treatment with liquid nitrogen: 2.2 visits for 19
        uncircumcised men and 2.3 visits for 149 circumcised
        men.</p>

        <p class="1"><b>Conclusion</b> - Circumcised men were more
        likely than uncircumcised men to have genital warts, but
        when present, warts were more often located on the distal
        portion of the penis among uncircumcised men. This paradox
        is not understood, but could reflect either <span
        class="yellow">non-specific resistance to proximal penile
        warts conferred by the foreskin</span>, or heightened
        susceptibility to various HPV types in uncircumcised men,
        some of which may confer subsequent immunity to genital
        warts.</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="1">Previous studies have suggested that genital
      warts occur more commonly among uncircumcised men than among
      circumcised men.<sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup> However, in
      a recent study using the medical records of 2776 heterosexual
      men attending the Seattle-King County Sexually Transmitted
      Disease Clinic at Harborview Medical Center, the prevalence
      of genital warts among cirucumcised men (17.6%) exceeded that
      of uncircumcised men (11.0%, (p &lt; 0.001).<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> The relationship persisted after
      adjusting for age, race, other STDs, place of residence, and
      the number of sexual partners in the previous month Also,
      circumcised men were more likely than uncircumcised men to
      report a history of previous warts (12.9% vs 7%, p &lt;
      0.001). In contrast, uncircumcised men were more likely to
      have syphilis (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.9. 8.4) and gonorrhea (OR
      1.6, 95% CI 1.2, 2.2). Our results may differ from those of
      previous studies because of our restriction to heterosexual
      men and our adjustment for more confounding variables. In
      view of these results, the present analysis was undertaken to
      characterise differences in the anatomic location,
      appearance, number, and apparent treatment response of
      genital warts based on circumcision status in this
      population.</p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p class="2">A review of heterosexual men seen in the
      Seattle-King County STD clinic in Seattle, Washington from
      January 1988 to December 1988 identified 463 men diagnosed
      clinically with genital warts. Details of this study have
      been reported.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Briefly,
      information was available on subject demographic
      characteristics, symptoms, sexual history, prior STDs, and
      clinical and laboratory diagnostic findings. Circumcision
      status was identified and recorded by the clinician.</p>

      <p class="2">For the present study, the medical records of
      459 of the 463 men given a diagnosis of genital warts during
      1988 were reviewed and information was abstracted on the
      location, number, and appearance of the exophytic warts (the
      medical records of four subjects were not available). The
      location of warts was categorised as distal penis (including
      the glans, coronal sulcus, urethral meatus, and frenulum),
      proximal penis (including the shaft and base of the shaft),
      both (distal and proximal), other (including scrotum, thighs,
      perianal area, and inguinal fold), or location not recorded.
      Four uncircumcised subjects had warts on the foreskin and
      were excluded from the analysis. Multiple locations that
      included sites other than the penis were coded on the basis
      of the location of the penile warts, that is, a subject with
      warts on the glans and the inguinal fold was classified as
      distal penis. The appearance of warts was categorised as
      condylomatous papular other (verruca vulgaris), or appearance
      not recorded. The number of warts was categorised in three
      groups: 1, &gt;1, or number not recorded.</p>

      <p class="2">Demographic and sexual characteristics of
      uncircumcised and circumcised men were compared. The number,
      anatomic distribution, and appearance of genital warts was
      also compared based on circumcision status. Among men with
      genital warts, age- and race-adjusted odds ratios relating
      circumcision status with the location, appearance, and number
      of warts were calculated by logistic regression
      analysis.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The response to
      treatment could not formally be compared in circumcised and
      uncircumcised men; clinic patients were generally advised to
      return for repeated treatment as long as warts persisted, but
      complete follow-up of all 459 men until the warts had
      resolved was not attempted by the clinic staff. Therefore, as
      a surrogate for treatment response, we compared the number of
      follow-up clinic visits at which persistent warts were
      detected among the 345 men treated with liquid nitrogen
      applications at the initial clinic visit. All analyses were
      done using SAS.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p class="2">Among heterosexuals with genital warts (Table
      1), circumcised men were more likely than uncircumcised men
      to be 30 years or older, (33.7% vs 21.7%, p =0.05), white,
      (76.3% vs 45.7%, p &lt; 0.007), and to report a history of
      warts (39.5% vs 23.9%, p &lt; 0.01). No major differences
      were noted between cc groups with respect to the number of
      sexual partners in the previous month, and approximately
      two-thirds of both groups reported symptoms of genital
      lesions when specifically queried about lesions prior to
      examination. The figure shows that the penile shaft,
      including the base of the shaft, was the most common location
      for genital warts in both circumcised and uncircumcised men.
      However, circumcised men were more likely to have warts in
      this location (77% vs 61%, p &lt; 0.001), whereas
      uncircumcised men were much more likely to have distal penile
      warts (26% vs 3%, p &lt; 0.0001). Age- and race-adjusted
      results (Table 2) comparing the presence of distal penile
      warts wth proximal penile warts also indicate that distal
      warts are more likely in uncircumcised men (OR 10.0, 95% CI
      3.9, 25.7). The presence of multiple wart lesions was
      unrelated to circumcision status. Condylomas were more likely
      than papules in uncircumcised men (OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.8, 7.6),
      but the appearance of warts was only specified for a small
      subset of subjects.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="2">This review of medical records of heterosexual
      men found to have genital warts at our STD clinic in 1988
      shows that warts were more likely to be distal, and to have a
      condylomatous appearance, among uncircumcised men than among
      circumcised men. However, the response of genital warts to
      liquid nitrogen application appeared comparable in the two
      groups.</p>

      <p class="2">In the present study, the foreskin itself was
      seldom affected, with only four subjects having warts on the
      inner or outer surface of the foreskin. These four subjects
      were excluded from the analysis since circumcised men do not
      have a comparable anatomic site at risk for infection; their
      inclusion would have elevated the positive relationship
      between uncircumcised status and distal penile warts. A
      possible concern is the higher proportion of circumcised men
      (9%), compared with uncircumcised men (2%) who did not have
      the location of wart lesions recorded in their medical
      record. It could be argued that if most, or all, of these
      circumcised men actually had distal warts, the positive
      relationship between the presence of a foreskin and distal
      penile warts would disappear. However, even if we
      conservatively assume that all the circumcised men with
      unspecified wart locations (n = 38) had distal penile warts,
      there would still be a higher proportion of uncircumcised men
      with genital warts on the distal penis (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2,
      5.4).</p>

      <p class="2">The relationship between the appearance of warts
      and circumcision status in this population is consistent with
      a study from St. Thomas' Hospital, which indicated that
      fleshy hyperplastic warts, or classic venereal warts, were
      most common on the glans and the inner lining of the foreskin
      among uncircumcised men.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The
      anatomic distribution of genital warts found in the present
      study, and in studies from St. Thomas' Hospital<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and the Mayo Clinic,<sup><a
      href="#n3">6</a></sup> are compared in Table 4. In contrast
      to both the present study and the Mayo Clinic study, distal
      penile warts were more common than proximal waits in the St
      Thomas' Hospital study. This discrepancy could be due in part
      to the high percentage of men who were uncircumcised in the
      St. Thomas' Hospital study (79%).</p>

      <p class="2">In contrast to our findings, a Canadian Army
      study found that uncircumcised status was more common among
      active duty men with warts than among recruits without
      warts.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> However, differences
      between these two groups of Canadian men in age, sexual
      activity, and other factors could have strongly influenced
      the study results. Age-adjusted analyses from the Public
      Health Department Special Treatment Clinic in Perth,
      Australia, suggested uncircumcised men were more likely than
      circumcised men to have warts (OR 1-5, 95% CI 1-0,
      2-4).<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Discrepancies with our
      results could be due to our restriction to heterosexual men,
      our adjustment for confounding factors, and any systematic
      differences in health seeking behavior between circumcised
      and uncircumcised men residing in the two countries.</p>

      <p class="2">In summary, among heterosexual men at our STD
      clinic, <span class="yellow">uncircumcised men had a lower
      prevalence of genital warts than circumcised men</span>, yet
      when warts occurred in uncircumcised men, they were more
      likely to be distal warts under the foreskin. It is possible
      that the less cornified epithelium of the distal penis within
      the preputial sac has increased susceptibility to HPV,
      including those types causing condylomas. A higher incidence
      of early subclinical, subpreputial HPV infection could
      promote immunity to subsequent penile condylomata. The series
      of men at our STD clinic may include a high proportion who
      have already expericnced such an infection and acquired some
      immunity. <span class="yellow">Alternatively, the presence of
      the foreskin may confer nonspecific protection of the
      proximal penis from acquisition of HPV infection.</span></p>
