      population-based case-control study of sexually transmitted
      urethritis was conducted at a large military base over a
      21-month period. During the study, 9514 patients were seen
      for sexually transmitted disease. The analysis was restricted
      to active duty males and showed that Blacks had 14.8 times
      the incidence rate for gonococcal urethritis (GCU) and 4.7
      times the rate of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) compared to
      Whites. There were slightly fewer cases of NGU than GCU. A
      case-control study of active duty soldiers were 1.65 times as
      likely to have NGU as uncircumcised subjects (95% CI):
      1:37-2.00). However, circumcision was not associated with an
      increased incidence of GCU. (<i>Am J Public Health</i> 1987;

      <p class="heading"><i>Introduction</i></p>

      <p>Gonococcal Urethritis (GCU) is the most commonly occurring
      reportable communicable disease in the US,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> with over a million cases reported
      annually. Non-gonoccocal urethritis (NGU) secondary to
      <i>Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum</i>, and
      other agents is not a reportable disease in many states.
      However, the incidence is estimated to be twice that of
      GCU.<sup><a href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> Population based
      incidence studies,<sup><a href="#n6">6-7</a></sup> cohort
      studies,<sup><a href="#n8">8-10</a></sup> and clinic based
      studies<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> have all shown that
      GCU occurs two to 10 times more frequently in the Black
      population, whereas the NGU rates are about the same or
      slightly higher among Whites. Risk factors shown to be
      associated with the acquisition of GCU and NGU include
      unmarried status, multiple sex partners, low socioeconomic
      status, and a history of previously sexually transmitted
      urethritis (STU). However, when all of these factors are
      controlled for, the rate of GCU remains higher in
      Blacks.<sup><a href="#n3">3-5</a></sup></p>

      <p>The data are sparse regarding the importance of the
      prepuce in the acquisition of STU. Parker <i>et
      al</i>,<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> in their case control
      study of 1,350 men attending a public health clinic in Perth,
      Australia showed that the uncircumcised men were twice as
      likely to have GCU. There was no association with NGU.
      However, confounding by number of sexual partners, marital
      status, and use of condoms was not controlled for in that
      clinic-based study.</p>

      <p>The prepuce may provide a physical or immunological
      barrier against infection or an excellent milieu for
      infectious agents to grow and multiply.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> This prompted us to investigate the
      possibility that the elevated risk of STU found in Blacks was
      due to the influence of the prepuce, since circumcision is
      more prevalent in the White population.</p>

      <p>In order to test the hypotheses that circumcision is
      associated with the risk of acquiring GCU or NGU, a
      retrospective, population-based case-control study was
      conducted at a large US military base.</p>

      <p class="heading"><i>Methods</i><br />
       <b>Study Site</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The study was conducted at a US military post with a history
      of high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD) in active
      duty members, dependents, and the local civilian
      community.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Regulations at the
      post, enforced with good success for a number of years,
      included a strict policy of referring all STD cases to the
      Epidemiological Disease Clinic (EDC). In addition to STDs,
      the EDC is used for all those diseases of epidemiologic
      importance, and all reportable communicable disease; it
      serves a population averaging 48,472 on active duty and
      101,791 eligible dependents.</p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Case and Control Definitions</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Persons seen by a military physician on the post with signs
      or symptoms consistent with any STD and persons eligible for
      care at the military hospital who presented to the local
      county health department with signs or symptoms consistent
      with any STD were referred without treatment to the EDC. Only
      those active duty members who elected to seek care from and
      pay a private physician were missed from the STD
      surveillance.</p>

      <p>Criteria for inclusion in the study population as a case
      included: presentation to the EDC during the period of the
      study January 1, 1983 to September 30, 1984; granting of
      informed consent (there were no refusals); completion of a
      standardized history and physical and laboratory examination;
      active duty male; receiving the diagnosis of GCU or NGU
      according to Centers for Disease Control criteria.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p>Criteria for inclusion in the study population as a
      control were similar except that the patients presented with
      a history of recent sexual contact, and were worried about
      having a STD, yet after examination were found to be without
      signs and symptoms consistent with any STD and their urethral
      smear gram stains and modified Thayer-Martin cultures were
      negative.</p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Procedures</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Every subject entering the EDC during the study period had a
      standardized history by a STD technician including
      sociodemographic information, time since last exposure and
      use of condoms. This was followed by a contact interview and
      a standardized genitourinary physical examination. For this
      study, circumcision was defined as the objective surgical
      absence of a prepuce.</p>

      <p>All subjects had a urethral smear gram stain and a
      modified Thayer-Martin Plate innoculated and incubated in 5
      per cent carbon dioxide incubator. <i>Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae</i> was identified and confirmed by standard
      technique. Those subjects with a urethral smear positive for
      gram negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) and/or modified
      Thayer-Martin culture positive for <i>Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae</i> were diagnosed as GCU.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,15</a></sup> Those subjects with a urethral
      smear negative for GNID and four or more polymorphonuclear
      leukocytes per oil immersion field (PMNs/HPF), and a modified
      Thayer-Martin culture negative for <i>Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae</i> were diagnosed as NGU.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,15</a></sup></p>

      <p>Centers for Disease Control Guidelines<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> were used to treat all cases of GCU.
      Those subjects with GCU who had post-gonococcal urethritis
      (four or more PMNs/HPF in the absence of GNID, with a
      negative modified Thayer-Martin urethral culture
      test-of-cure) after adequate treatment were given the
      additional diagnosis of NGU.</p>

      <p>Over 97 per cent of the infections were treated initially
      with one antibiotic. In this way, mixed GCU/NGU infections
      were more likely to be identified and coded. A subject with
      GCU who was diagnosed after treatment as having
      post-gonococcal urethritis secondary to NGU was coded as one
      incident case of GCU and NGU. If a subject returned to the
      EDC at any time after a successful course of treatment with
      an interval without symptoms, he was treated as a new
      incident case.</p>

      <p class="heading"><i>Results</i></p>

      <p>During the 21 months of the study, there were 9,514 STD
      subjects seen in the EDC. Eighty-four per cent were male, 67
      per cent Black, 27 per cent White, and 6 per cent oter ethnic
      groups. Eighty-six per cent were active duty members and 14
      per cent were military dependents. During the study the
      active duty male population averaged 45,250 resulting in
      950,250 persons/months of observation.</p>

      <p>In Table 1, the race, rank, and educational parameters of
      the control population and two individual case-control
      studies being evaluated are shown. The proportion of Blacks
      in the GCU population was markedly higher than that of the
      control group, and the proportion of GCU cases with "some
      college" was somewhat lower than the control group.</p>

      <p>There were 3,057 cases of GCU of which 2,982 were in
      active duty males with a resultant incidence density of
      3.13/1000 person-months for the active duty population. There
      were 2,653 cases of NGU of which 2,543 were in active duty
      males with a resultant incidence density of 2.68/1000
      persons-months for the active duty population.</p>

      <p>Blacks had 4.7 times the rate of the Whites, for NGU and
      14.8 times the White rate for GCU. The other ethnic groups
      were intermediate between Blacks and Whites for both
      diseases.</p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Circumcision Effects</b><br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Eighty-five per cent of the Whites, 34 per cent of the
      Blacks, and 33 per cent of the other ethnic groups were
      circumcised. Less than 1 per cent of both cases reported
      using condoms. There was no association between GCU and
      circumcision in any of the three racial groups
      (Mantel-Haenzel summary odds ratio 0.90 (95 per cent CI 0.73,
      1,11).</p>

      <p>In order to control for a variety of factors potentially
      confounding such an association, a maximum likelihood
      estimate (MLE) logistic regression analysis was done using
      GCU as the dependent variable in the model. Table 2 shows the
      results of the analysis, odds ratio, and 95 per cent CI for
      each variable, after controlling for the other variables. GCU
      was not associated with circumcision in this analysis.</p>

      <p>In contrast to GCU, circumcision was associated with an
      increased incidence of NGU in both Blacks and Whites. The
      Mantel-Haenzel summary odds ratio was 1.70 (95% CI 1.37,
      2.10) (data available on request to authors).</p>

      <p>In Table 3, the same logistic regression analysis was
      conducted using NGU as the dependent variable and the same
      independent variables. Only circumcision was associated with
      NGU in the model, with an odds ratio of 1.65 (95 per cent CI
      1.37-2.00)&gt;</p>

      <p class="heading"><i>Discussion</i></p>

      <p>Racial differences in STD incidence were higher than those
      previously reported.<sup><a href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> Some of
      this difference could reflect racial differences in seeking
      care from private physicians but this is not felt to be
      important based on information provided by private
      physicians, and the representativeness of the ranks in the
      study population.</p>

      <p>The incidence figures also indicate that NGU is occuring
      less frequently than GCU in this population in contrast to
      previously reported ratios of 2-2.5 NGU cases per GCU case in
      civilian populations.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> It is
      possible that the nature of this young, military population
      may account for the different ratio.</p>

      <p>The control group was representative of members of the
      military post community who are sexually active and worried
      about having been in contact with a partner with STD but who
      have not acquired STU as shown by the closeness of the case
      and control populations in Table 1 with respect to all the
      variables except the presence or absence of diagnosed
      disease.</p>

      <p>It is clear from Tables 2 and 3 that the racial
      differences almost disappear in this case-control analysis ,
      after controlling for the other variables. This suggests that
      for both NGU and GCU there is no biologic mechanism
      accounting for the difference in rates among the races
      identified in the population-based incidence data.</p>

      <p>The data in Table 2 re-emphasize the association of
      marital status, race, education, and number of sexual
      partners in the last month with the risk of acquiring GCU, as
      well as providing evidence for no association between
      circumcision and the risk of acquiring GCU.</p>

      <p>For NGU, the results in Table 3 show that among this
      population of sexually active men, having a prepuce (being
      uncircumcised) was protective for acquiring NGU and there
      were no associations with the other variables and NGU.</p>

      <p>Since the symptoms of NGU are often subtle, it is possible
      that uncircumcised men were more likely than circumcised men
      to overlook the presence of urethral discharge. On the other
      hand, the law proportion of NGU to GCU in this study
      population may reflect the fact that more symptomatic NGU
      cases were seen in this study.</p>

      <p>The findings of this study are intriguing because
      circumcision is much less common in Black and other ethnic
      groups compared with Whites and one <i>a priori</i>
      hypothesis was that the presence of a prepuce may increase
      the risk of acquiring NGU and GCU independent of other
      factors. Wiswell <i>et al</i><sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>
      found a protective effect of circumcision when looking at the
      rate of urinary tract infections in infant males, and Parker,
      <i>et al</i><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> found
      circumcision to be protective for GCU. <span
      class="yellow">However, the findings of this study suggest
      that the prepuce has a protective effect against the
      acquistion of NGU and that there is no association with
      GCU.</span></p>

      <p>Having a prepuce may be protective against NGU by
      effecting the physiologic milieu of the glans penis, by
      association with post-coital hygiene behavior, or by local
      immune defense mechanisms acting against the agent. Further
      basic research is necessary to clarify these relations.</p>
