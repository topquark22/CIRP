<HEAD><BASE HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/geneva/"></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><PRE>GENEVA, Jul 02 (Reuters) -- Healthy epithelial cells that line the body 
cavities and cover structures such as the cervix and prostate resist HIV 
infection, according to a report presented Thursday at the 12th World 
AIDS Conference by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. 

But this protection against infection is lost when the cells have been 
altered by infection with other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 

"This is the first study to demonstrate that normally functioning 
epithelial cells are incapable of transmitting HIV," said CDC researcher 
Dr. Charlene Dezzutti in a press statement. "But STDs and other factors 
which damage these cells can play a major role in the sexual spread of 
this epidemic." 

"The normally functioning cells formed a tight bond between cells that 
would not allow HIV to pass through, while the (diseased) cells failed 
to develop a tight bond and did allow passage of the virus," according 
to the CDC statement.
