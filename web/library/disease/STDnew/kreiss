METHODS:  A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 316 HIV 
seropositive and 186 seronegative homosexual men.
ABSTRACT;To evaluate whether uncircumcised status is 
correlated with acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus 
HIV, 502 homosexualmen were surveyed: 85 per cent were 
circumcised. HIV infection was significantly associated with 
uncircumcised status -odds ratio OR- 2.2: 95 per cent 
confidence interval -CI- 1.2, 3.8, nonwhite race, intravenous 
drug use, sexual contact with an intravenous drug user, 
number of male partners, frequency of unprotected receptive 
anal intercourse, and with history of genital herpes, anal herpes, 
or syphilis.  Uncircumcised status was significantly associated 
with older age, nonwhite race, and history of syphilis: it was 
inversely associated with intravenous drug use.  Using logistic 
regression analysis, the adjusted OR for the association between 
HIV infection and uncircumcised status was 2.0 (95 per cent CI,
1.0 4.0. Uncircumcised homosexual men has 2-fold increased
risk of HIV infection.  The role of circumcision as an intervention 
strategy to reduce sexualtransmission of HIV warrants 
consideration.

[Comment (Ken Derifield):
Other surveys emphasize the need for physical exam to determine 
circumcision status on all or part of the study groups due to a 
significant rate of misclassification in some self-report groups
(questionnaires).  With the small number of men in the survey 
self-reporting, the odds ratio of 2.0 could easily go to 1.0 
with an examination (or less than 1.0 reversing the concern).
Usually any odds ratio of 1.5 to 2.0 in a small study population 
is considered chance.]
