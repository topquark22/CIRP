Abstract
Objective - To determine whether the circumcision status of men affected 
their likelihood of acquiring sexually transmissible diseases (STDs). 
Design - A cross-sectional study employing an anonymous questionnaire, 
clinical examination and type specific serology for herpes simplex virus 
type 2 (HSV-2). Setting - A public STD clinic in Sydney, Australia. 
Subjects-300 consecutive heterosexual male patients. Main outcome measure - 
Associations between circumcision status and past or present diagnoses of 
STDs including HSV-2 serology and clinical pattern of genital herpes. 
Results-185 (62%) of the men were circumcised and they reported similar 
ages, education levels and lifetime partner numbers as men who were 
uncircumcised. There were no significant associations between the presence 
or absence of the male prepuce and the number diagnosed with genital 
herpes, genital warts and non-gonococcal urethritis. Men who were 
uncircumcised were no more likely to be seropositive for HSV-2 and reported 
symptomatic genital herpes outbreaks of the same frequency and severity as 
men who were circumcised. Gonorrhoea, syphilis and acute hepatitis B were 
reported too infrequently to reliably exclude any association with 
circumcision status. Human immunodeficiency virus infection (rare among 
heterosexual men in the clinic) was an exclusion criterion. Conclusions - 
From the findings of this study, circumcision of men has no significant 
effect on the incidence of common STDs in this developed nation setting. 
However, these findings may not necessarily extend to other setting where 
hygiene is poorer and the spectrum of common STDs is different. (Genitourin

Introduction
It has been suggested that uncircumcised men are at higher risk of certain 
sexually transmissible diseases (STDs), in particular genital herpes,[1,2] 
gonorrhoea,[1] syphilis,[1] human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection,[3] candidiasis[1,2] and chancroid.[3] The evidence for male 
circumcision protecting against most STDs is tentative[4] but is strong for 
chancroid and candidal balanoposthitis (though not necessarily subclinical 
yeast infection[5]). In some populations where chancroid and syphilis may 
be the common causes of genital ulcers, these ulcers and the uncircumcised 
state of the men (both independently and synergistically) appear to be 
major risk factors for the female to male sexual transmission of HIV-1.[3]
The uncircumcised penis is hypothetically at increased risk of STDs because 
of larger surface area, thinner epidermal barrier, more opportunity for 
epithelial microtrauma and the warm, moist niche under the foreskin 
favouring the persistence of fastidious microorganisms. However, note of 
these hypotheses has been proven.
We sought to determine any effect the presence of a male foreskin may exert 
on the acquisition of common STDs by heterosexual men attending an STD 
clinic and also its effect on the clinical manifestations of herpes simples 
virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection.
Subjects and methods
A sample site of over 270 was calculated to determine a two-fold risk of 
serological evidence of HSV-2 for uncircumcised men with 80% power at the 
5% level. However, this calculation was based on an expected HSV-2 
seroprevalence of about 30% for heterosexual men detected in a 1985 survey 
at the same clinic (AL Cunningham; unpublished data).
The subjects were 300 consecutive heterosexual male patients who saw a 
particular clinician (IB) and required venopuncture for any other purpose 
at the Sydney Sexual Health (previously STD) Centre, Sydney Hospital, 
between December 1990 and May 1991. Over 95% of the men were Caucasian with 
the bulk of the remainder of Asian origin. The subjects were representative 
of the general clinical load of exclusively heterosexual men at the Centre: 
their reasons for attendance or diagnosis at the time of consultation are 
outlined in Table 1. HIV-1 infection is rare among heterosexual men 
attending the Centre[6] and, as HIV-l infection may alter the natural 
history of other STDs, it was an exclusion criterion. Homosexually active 
men were also excluded because anal infections could have confused the 
objectives of the study. The aims of the study were explained to all 
subjects and signed informed consent obtained. There were no refusals.
A data collection form with an anonymous identifier code was completed by 
the clinician and an extra five milliliters of blood was collected for this 
study. The data collected included age, level of education, circumcision 
status (confirmed by physical examination), past history of genital herpes 
or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes (undiagnosed genital ulcer or 
recurrent genital lesions/itches), nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), genital 
warts, urethral gonorrhoea, syphilis and acute hepatitis B, as well as 
reported lifetime number of sexual partners (women with whom they had had 
vaginal intercourse). For the analysis, current and past diagnoses of STDs 
were combined for each subject. All STDs had been diagnosed by a physician, 
mostly at the same clinic. The diagnosis of genital herpes was by cell 
culture except for the current visit where the diagnosis was on clinical 
criteria (the delinked anonymous study design precluded incorporating 
current HSV culture results). Similarly urethral gonorrhoea was diagnosed 
by culture except for the current visit where the diagnosis was based on 
clinical findings plus characteristic gram negative intracellular 
diplococci on a urethral smear. NGU was diagnosed by clinical picture 
(discharge/dysuria) and microscopy of a distal urethral smear (5 or more 
polymorphs per oil immersion field). Genital warts were a clinical 
diagnosis. All syphilis cases required confirmation by specific treponemal 
serology (Treponema pallidum haemaglutination assay and fluorescent 
treponemal antibody test). The diagnosis of acute hepatitis B required both 
an acute hepatitis illness and laboratory confirmation.
Those subjects who had a history of genital herpes were asked to grade the 
severity of their initial episode ("mild", "moderate", or "severe"), and 
estimate the number, and similarly grade the severity of any recurrences in 
the previous 12 months.
The serological analyses for HSV were per-formed at the Virology, 
Department Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Westmead 
Hospital in Sydney on an anonymous and blinded basis. As described 
elsewhere,[7] sera were screened for total HSV antibody by a complement 
fixing antibody (HSV-CFA) test. Positive specimens on HSV-CFA were then 
subject to an indirect IgG enzyme immune assay (EIA) specific to the 92 kDa 
HSV-2 glycoprotein G (gG-2).[7] All 15 randomly selected sera that were 
positive for HSV-2 by EIA testing were confirmed by Western blot.
Results
One hundred and eighty five (61.7%) of the men were circumcised and 115 
(38.3%) were not: this was not age dependent (table 2). The associations 
between male circumcision status and demographic, behavioural and STD 
variables of the study group are summarized in Table 2. None of these 
variables approached significance at the 5% level. Though gonorrhoea, 
syphilis and acute hepatitis B were reported too infrequently to determine 
any association with the subjects circumcision status, histories of genital 
herpes, serological evidence of HSV-2 infection, genital warts and NGU were 
common and no distinct trends emerged.
Circumcised and uncircumcised men with previously diagnosed genital herpes 
reported a similar duration since the initial episode and similar frequency 
and severity of recurrences in the preceding 12 months (Table 3). While 
there was a trend for more uncircumcised men to describe their initial 
genital herpes episode as severe and for circumcised men to describe it as 
moderate the difference was not significant.
Discussion
In this clinic-based prospectively collected survey we found no association 
between male circumcision status and STDs that are common in our 
population. Perhaps importantly, our study group was relatively racially 
homogeneous, lack of circumcision was not a marker of lower socioeconomic 
status (using the index of education level; Table 2), and we controlled for 
a major parameter of sexual behaviour (lifetime number of sexual partners).
We did not investigate the relationship between the presence of a prepuce 
and candidal balanoposthitis as we regard the causal relationship as 
proven. lack of circumcision is probably also a risk factor for chancroid 
but this condition was rare in our population. Similarly syphilis, acute 
hepatitis B and gonorrhoea were so uncommon among heterosexual men 
attending our clinic that we were unable to exclude any potential 
association. HIV-1 infection was an exclusion criterion for the study.
Symptomatic genital herpes and serological evidence of HSV-2 infection were 
both common in our population. We previously reported on the risk factors 
for HSV-2 seropositivity in this study group.[8] On multi-variate analysis 
the risk factors for HSV-2 infection were lifetime number of sexual 
partners, lower level of education and (marginally) a history of sexual 
contact with a women with genital herpes.[8] In the present analysis, 
circumcision status did not correlate with a history of genital herpes, 
recurrent genital ulcers or itches (which might have represented 
undiagnosed herpes), or serological evidence of HSV-2 infection. As an 
unexpectedly high proportion (two thirds) of our study group were HSV-2 
seropositive it would not have been possible to demonstrate a two-fold 
protective effect for circumcision. Nevertheless no trend toward protection 
was apparent (Table 2).
A previous Australian study which relied on the culture diagnosis of 
genital herpes did find a correlation between symptomatic genital herpes 
and lack of circumcision.[1] However this study did not quantify sexual 
partner numbers or other parameters of risk. Another possible explanation 
for this finding in the previous study might have been that men with intact 
foreskins harbouring HSV-2 may be more symptomatic and thus be more likely 
to present to a clinic. However we found that men who were HSV-2 
seropositive were no more symptomatic than circumcised men, nor were their 
lesion recurrences significantly more frequent or severe. As only a limited 
number of our study subjects were symptomatic, a larger study would be 
needed to exclude the possibility that uncircumcised men suffer more severe 
initial episodes of genital herpes.
Previous studies of the effect of circumcision status on genital warts have 
produced conflicting results. In more heterogeneous populations lack of 
circumcision has variously been reported as making symptomatic genital 
warts both more[1,9,10] and less[11] common. We found it exerted no effect. 
One retrospective study found that circumcision status affected the 
distribution of warts on the penis. Uncircumcised men were more likely to 
present with distal lesions and circumcised men with proximal lesions on 
the penis.[12] We did not investigate this issue. We are unaware of any 
study to date that has attempted to correlate circumcision status with 
subclinical HPV infection.
We determined no association between circumcision status and a history of 
NGU or gonorrhoea. In the case of gonorrhoea this may have been because 
this was uncommon in our population: the slight trend was for the presence 
of a foreskin to be "protective". A previous large retrospective American 
study found no association between gonococcal urethritis and circumcision 
status.[13] In the same American study it was found that circumcised men 
were 1.65 times more likely to present with NGU than uncircumcised men (95% 
CI; 1 .37-2.00).[l3] The authors hypothesized that the physical presence of 
the foreskin may mask the symptoms (typically milder than gonorrhoea) of 
NGU. The difference from our study could be explained, at least in part, by 
the fact that our study group had a much lower threshold for seeking 
medical attention. The majority (Table 1) were asymptomatic and had 
presented for STD screening.
A recent South Australian study found that uncircumcised men were 
independently at increased risk of current diagnoses of both chlamydial and 
gonococcal infection (odds ratios of 1.3 and 2. 1 respectively) on 
multi-variate analysis factoring in "multiple partners in the previous 
month.14 However, in a separate report on the same sample,[1] being 
uncircumcised was also a risk factor for pediculosis pubis (OR 1.5)-a 
notion that lacks plausibility. In the latter report,[?] being 
uncircumcised was protective for genital warts and had no significant 
effect on the risk of genital herpes.
Only about 3% of the Australian male population would have religious 
reasons for circumcision. British workers have speculated that only another 
1-2% would have unequivocal medical reasons for circumcision later in 
childhood, usually balanitis xerotica obliterans (leading to true phimosis) 
and possibly recurrent balanoposthitis.[16] Much of the public rhetoric in 
Australia ("We don't cut babies' ears off because they need to wash behind 
them") is opposed to neonatal circumcision and a health service study had 
indicated that circumcision had become less common in Australia by 
1983.[17] Thus we were surprised to find that 62% of our study population 
was circumcised and that younger men were just as likely to be circumcised 
as older men. A comparable overall circumcision (63%) rate has been 
reported from a South Australian STD clinic,[18] though in that clinic 
younger men were slightly less likely (55%) to have been circumcised. Some 
British authors have deplored circumcision rates in that country of 7% and 
describe the majority of these procedures as "unnecessary".[16] As 
Australia enjoys close cultural links with Britain these dramatically 
different male circumcision rates imply that cultural determinants of the 
procedure are amenable to the influence of the "medical gatekeepers". 
Notably, Australia has a largely fee-for-service system of payment for 
health services.
While the universally negative findings of the current study should 
contribute to the current debate on the need for male circumcision, they 
cannot be automatically extended to developing societies. In other 
settings, other STDs may be more prevalent and access to medical services 
or running water may significantly alter the relationship between 
circumcision and STDs including HIV infection.'[19] Care should also be 
taken to ensure that circumcision status is not a surrogate marker of 
culturally-determined risk or health-care seeking behaviour.
