<H1>Circumcision and Sexually Transmitted Diseases</H1>

<P>(See also <A HREF="../HIV/">Circumcision and HIV</A>)

<P>The body of medical literature gives no clear indication one way or the
other whether circumcision protects against STD. Many studies have reached
contradictory conclusions.

<P>In a self-published pamphlet, <I>Circumcision: A Parent's
Decision for Life</I>, Aaron Fink suggested that the dried-out, cornified
circumcised glans and mucosa were tougher and therefore less prone to
infection than those of intact men. This has been repeated in many places
but has never been proved. In fact, dry mucous membranes are more prone to
infection than naturally moist ones (for the same reason people tend to get
colds in the wintertime).

<P>In any event, the debate over STDs and AIDS does not apply to neonatal
circumcision. Children are not sexually active. If left intact, they can
weigh the issue for themselves when they are old enough to consent.
