The debate over circumcision and HIV in the medical literature
has not been resolved. Furthermore, the discussion does not apply
to neonatal circumcision. Children are not sexually active. They
can weigh the issue for themselves when they are old enough to
consent.

In a review of the literature, de Vincenzi and Mertens 
concluded that "...lack of distinction between susceptibility 
and infectivity, inadequate control for confounding variables, 
potential selection bias and misclassification of exposure, 
inappropriate choice of a comparison group, and publication 
bias, may lead to under- or overestimation of the association 
[between circumcision and HIV status]. It is difficult to 
predict the net effect of these sources of bias. Furthermore, 
the magnitude of the association varies strongly between 
studies and its crude measure is overestimated in some reports."

Surick et al (cited in Vincenzi (1994)) found that 17.7% of 
uncircumcised men and 8.4% of circumcised men misclassified 
themselves, throwing serious doubt on any study relying on 
self-reporting, especially where the number of men in either 
category is small.

One widely cited study, Kreiss et al.(1992), dealt with HIV
in circumcised and intact gay men. However, as Hugh Young
points out, Kreiss "assumes that men choose their sexual partners 
regardless of their circumcision status. The existence of 
magazines and clubs for circumcised men and others for whole men 
indicates that this is not so."

The conclusion was toned down in the second of these two reports
on the same study.

In February 1996, Scientific American printed an article by two
Australian non-epidemiologists, JC Caldwell and P Caldwell,
dealing with an apparent correlation between HIV infection and
uncircumcised populations in Africa. This is a purely geographical
study, and did not actually examine any patients. de Vincenzi
and Mertens (1994), two years earlier, had criticized this
study design. For further analysis of the Caldwell article, see
