<H1>Circumcision and HIV infection</H1>

<P>(See also <A HREF="../STD/">Circumcision and STD</A>)

<P>The debate over circumcision status and HIV in the medical literature
is ongoing and has not been resolved. A number of studies with
contradictory conclusions have appeared in recent years.

<P>In a review of the literature, de Vincenzi and Mertens (1994)
concluded that "...lack of distinction between susceptibility 
and infectivity, inadequate control for confounding variables, 
potential selection bias and misclassification of exposure, 
inappropriate choice of a comparison group, and publication 
bias, may lead to under- or overestimation of the association 
[between circumcision and HIV status]. It is difficult to 
predict the net effect of these sources of bias. Furthermore, 
the magnitude of the association varies strongly between 
studies and its crude measure is overestimated in some reports."

<P>Surick et al (cited in Vincenzi (1994)) found that 17.7% of 
uncircumcised men and 8.4% of circumcised men misclassified 
themselves, throwing serious doubt on any study relying on 
self-reporting, especially where the number of men in either 
category is small.

<P>In February 1996, Scientific American printed an article by two
Australian researchers, JC Caldwell and P Caldwell, dealing with
an apparent correlation between HIV infection and uncircumcised
populations in Africa. This is a purely geographical study, and
did not actually examine any patients. <A HREF="vincenzi/">de Vincenzi
and Mertens (1994)</A>, two years earlier, had criticized the design of
such studies. For further discussion of the Caldwell article, see
<A HREF="fleiss">Fleiss and Hodges (1996)</A> and <A HREF="falk/">Falk (1996)</A>.

<P>In any event, the present discussion does not apply to neonatal
circumcision. Children are not sexually active. If left intact,
they can weigh the "tissue issue" for themselves when they are old
enough to consent.
