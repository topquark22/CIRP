<P>
According to American historian Frederick Hodges, a common thread
in the hundred-year-old tradition of Western "medical" circumcision
advocacy has been a tendency to take whatever maladies may hold
public attention at a particular time, and to hold up circumcision
as a preventative or cure for them.[1] Born at a time when the American
populace was gripped with a morbid fear of children masturbating,
routine neonatal male circumcision has since been encouraged by
fears of penile and cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases,
urinary tract infections, and simply poor hygiene, during the course
of the twentieth century.

<P>
A related phenomenon---which continues to this day---has been a
tendency in the literature to emphasize even the most tentative
results <I>in favour</I> of male neonatal circumcision, while at the same
time fastidiously avoiding any implication that the amputation of
the foreskin could have disadvantages. Popular men's health books
abound with myths about the natural penis.
 American medical journals still publish articles
claiming that it is necessary to circumcise boys---but not girls.
Circumcision has, after all, become accepted by Western medicine,
a system that prides itself on providing the best possible standards
of care.  There is a human need to find good in all things that we
do. "The African AIDS Epidemic", by the Australian demographer John
C.  Caldwell and anthropologist Pat Caldwell, is a remarkable
example.

<P>
The Caldwell argument is based solely on an observed geographical
correlation between male non-circumcision rates and HIV-1 rates in
Africa. The region in which most men are not circumcised correlates
well with the so-called "AIDS belt," the region defined here as
that in which some 10% of rural and 23% of urban inhabitants are
infected with HIV-1. (The AIDS epidemic in Africa is predominantly
a heterosexual problem.) Earlier studies of the correlation had
been criticized for having used older data that may be inaccurate;
Caldwell assures us that the data is new and reliable, although it
is not mentioned whether or not they accounted for certain well-known
confounding factors that make such surveys inherently difficult.[2]
In addition, the maps of Africa that accompany the Caldwell article
rely on artificial boundaries (national boundaries and the 10 degree
North parallel of latitude). This may overstate the actual degree of
correlation.

<P>
In any case, correlation indicates a statistical relationship only,
and does not amount to causation. Caldwell is not sufficiently
clear on this point. There is no hard evidence that non-circumcision
directly and physically increases the risk of contracting and/or
transmitting HIV via heterosexual intercourse.  The majority of
published studies have, in fact, failed to find any significant
increase in risk amongst the noncircumcised.[2]

<P>
The argument used here is essentially a process of elimination, an
attempt to exclude other explanations for the observed distribution
of HIV-1.  However, the correlation could instead be due to other
factors not studied or not well understood.

<P>
The Caldwells immediately discount the hypothesis that the geographical
distribution of AIDS in Africa may be due to the disease having
its origins in one particular region. They write: "...the AIDS belt
is not circular but elongated, clearly not the pattern of expansion
from an epicenter". But this fails to take into account patterns
of human migration, which are influenced by complex social factors,
environmental factors and topography. An earlier study in Tanzania
concluded that "the results are consistent with the spread of HIV-1
infection along the main roads. There is no evidence that lack of
circumcision is a risk factor in this population."[3] Because of
this and similar results, the center-of-origin theory remains, in
the opinion of many researchers, the most plausible one to date.[2]

<P>
A useful approach would be to test the hypothesis of causation in
a random sample of individuals, all factors other than circumcision
status being equal. Of the many studies that have attempted to do
this, some have reported a statistically significant correlation
between non-circumcision and HIV.[2] Unfortunately, though,
circumcision status is highly dependent on cultural background and
other factors that are not well understood; so it is difficult if
not impossible to exclude all sources of bias from such an experiment.

<P>
Furthermore, it has been suggested that female circumcision (or
infibulation) may be a risk factor for the spread of HIV in
sub-Saharan Africa; and male circumcision is invariably present in
all societies that practise female circumcision.[4] Despite great
media coverage of the issue in recent years,  no mention of female
circumcision is to be found in the Caldwell article. Could female
and/or male genital mutilations actually <I>increase</I> the risk of
disease? This frightening question warrants further study.

<P>
The selection and presentation of data is misleading. For example,
the graphs on page 66 paint a rather dramatic picture: HIV rates
of 2.5%-13% for circumcised men, compared with 29%-53% for intact
men! But one must read another part of the text carefully, to
realize that the two samples come from two very different ethnic
groups in Kenya:  The largely circumcised Kikuyu on the one hand,
and the largely intact Luo on the other. Cultural background is a
significant confounding factor in the correlation between
non-circumcision and HIV infection. The most extreme from a range
of statistics have presumably been used, in order to make the
presentation appear convincing.

<P>
In the sidebar text accompanying these graphs, it is written: "For
uncircumcised men, thorough cleaning of the genitals can be
particularly challenging." This may be truer in Africa than in
developed countries; but if poor genital hygiene plays a role in
increasing HIV risk (possibly mediated by other STDs such as
chancroid), improving hygiene standards in Africa is surely the
most sensible way to combat that risk. It is, by the way, just as
easy for a man to keep his intact penis clean as it is for a woman
to keep her intact vulva clean! Men ought to stand up and challenge
any suggestions to the contrary.

<P>
Finally, there is propaganda:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  In rural southwest Tanzania, and surely elsewhere in the AIDS
  belt, uncircumcised man have not waited for agreement among
  researchers about the connection between circumcision and AIDS.
  Based on observations of their community and neighboring ones,
  they have concluded that they are at greater risk for AIDS than
  circumcised men. These men are appearing at hospitals in sharply
  increasing numbers, requesting circumcision for themselves and
  often for their sons. Clinics that offer adult male circumcision
  as a protection against AIDS now advertise in Tanzanian newspapers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Surely an advisable strategy to controlling AIDS in Africa would
be to make contraceptives widely available, while at the same time
controlling widespread panic! The use of condoms is known to be
reliable in reducing HIV risk; to suggest that circumcision could
play this role instead is, in the reviewer's opinion, disingenuous
in the extreme.

<P>
The foreskin has a protective function, as well as sensory and
physiological functions during sexual intercourse.[5,6] All male
mammals have been provided with a foreskin, and any man possessed
of his prepuce ought to be able to list some of the advantages to
having it.

<P>
Circumcision is fundamentally a social surgery, still in search of
a medical need. The answer will not likely be found with HIV and
AIDS.  Rates of circumcision in the United States are declining
precipitously.[7] When circumcision finally disappears, we will
probably find it inconceivable that we ever did such a thing to
our children, and readers of Scientific American in the year 2046
will be either amused or perplexed to see mention of the present
article, in the column, "50, 100, 150 and 200 Years Ago."
