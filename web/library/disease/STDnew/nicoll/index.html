Routine male circumcision and risk of infection with
HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Routine male circumcision as policy excites strong medical opinions
both for and against.  In the USA over 70% of all males have been
circumcised[1] while the UK's national survey of sexual attitudes and
lifestyles found in 1990/1 that 21% of adult males (aged 16-59 years)
reported having been circumcised.[2]  The percentage was 13% among
those aged 16-24 years but 32% for those 45-49 years indicating that
British rates have declined recently,[2] as they may also have done in
the USA.[3]  Circumcision rates are intermediate in Canada[1] but very
low in the nordic countries.[4]  These large intercountry differences
are not explicable on religious grounds.[1,2]  They are best explained
on grounds of medico/social culture and fashion, as is the case for
some other elective surgical procedures of uncertain effective- ness.[1,5]

     The case for routine male circumcision has rested most firmly on
the observation that rates of infant urinary tract infection and adult
penile cancer are lower in circumcised males.[6]  However when weighed
against the irreducible complication rates and costs of the procedure,
these are thought insufficient grounds to recommend routine circum-
cision.[1,3,7]  Recently added is the observation that circumcised
males seem less likely to acquire infection with HIV-1, or other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs.[8])  Four explanations have
been suggested[9]: firstly that the exposed glans penis may develop a
protective layer of keratin (sometimes referred to a `natural
condom'); secondly that the foreskin may be especially vulnerable to
minor balanitis and trauma during intercourse, allowing movement of
HIV-1 through the dermatological barrier; thirdly that the warm
microclimate under the foreskin may permit micro-organism survival
increasing exposure to potential infections; and fourthly that lack of
circumcision may predispose to a coinfection with other STDs that are
known to facilitate heterosexual HIV-transmission.[10]

     Many observational studies provide data relevant to the relation-
ship of HIV-1 infection and circumcision, and these have been the
subject of two reviews and one meta-analysis of multiple studies
within one region of an African country.[9,11,12]  The studies have
been of types described as cross sectional or retrospective (observing
the relative risk of being HIV-1 infected in circumcised and
uncircumcised men, or their female partners), prospective
observational (observing the risk of becoming HIV-1 infected among
circumcised and uncircumcised men), and ecological (comparing the
association between circumcision status and prevalence of HIV-1 in
different populations).  Heterosexual partnership studies  have also
looked at sexual partners of men or women diagnosed HIV-1 infected in
relation to the male's circumcision status.  The reviews note the
data's limitations.[9,11,12]  Most were gathered in African or other
developing countries where incidence and prevalence of HIV-1 was
sufficiently high to investigate possible effects of circumcision.
None of the studies was experimental (no-one has dared `trial' circum-
cision), nor were they primarily designed to investigate the HIV-1 and
circumcision relationship.  Therefore many are subject to confounding
factors and many lack optimal statistical power.  That said most, but
not all, the African studies found the risk of HIV-1 infection was
reduced among circumcised men.[9,11,12]  The reductions were modified
by location, social status, religion, and background HIV-1 prevalence,
but did not disappear when these factors were allowed for.  Hence all
three publications concluded that on balance the data supported a
modestly reduced risk of becoming HIV infected among circumcised
compared with uncircumcised men in areas where HIV infection was
highly prevalent (over 1%) and mostly acquired hetero-
sexually.[9,11,12]  The degree of protection varied but a commonly
stated risk reduction was a halving for circumcised men, with a few
studies finding greater protection.  However a protective effect was
not consistent across all studies.[9,11,12]  Whether circumcision
makes the HIV positive more infectious to women has been investigated
in a single study when circumcised and uncircumcised HIV infected
Brazilian men were found to be equally infectious to their female
partners.[13]

     Both reviews noted the potential risk of young men misunder-
standing their circumcisions as license for risky sexual
behaviour.[9,11]  Continuing unsafe sex by circumcised males would
still result in a steadily rising cumulative risk of individuals
becoming infected and it is noticeable that being heavily circumcised
has not prevented the USA from becoming the industrialised country
most burdened with HIV,[14] while the opposite is true for the
UK.[2,14]

     It will be impossible to deliver safe neonatal male circumcision
on a population basis in developing countries[11] and no society has
yet shown willingness to precipitously introduce male circumcision on
a mass scale.  The relevance of the modest protection found in obser-
vational studies of heterosexuals in Africa for policy elsewhere is
unclear, especially for the USA and Europe where homosexual trans-
mission is relative more important.[15]  There are seemingly few data
on risk of HIV-1 among circumcised as compared with uncircumcised
homosexual men.[9,11]  It is unclear whether circumcision protects
against other STDs as data are conflicting according to which STD and
the population under study.[1,16,17]  The UK national survey found no
difference in rates of STD clinic attendance among circumcised and
uncircumcised men.[2]  This suggests that any protective effect
against HIV-1 in industrialized countries is small and many circum-
cisions would be needed to prevent a single HIV infection in an
American or European setting.

     Cost-benefit analysis for non-HIV and STD benefits have concluded
routine circumcision would be uneconomic.[1,18]  Cadman et al cal-
culated that the cost of circumcising 100 000 male infants would be
&pound;1.74 million at 1983 prices in Canada.[18]  Projecting this to the UK
in 1997 (375 000 male births annually) with 4% annual medical in-
flation[19] and assuming 13% of males will already be circumcised[2]
this would translate to an additional annual cost of &pound;9.83 million at
Canadian prices.  Given that this would require at least 15 years of
investment before any benefit it seems unlikely that prevention of HIV
and other STDs is going to change the economic balance towards a pro-
circumcision policy.
