Objective:

       To identify risk factors particularly circumcision status,
associated with serological evidence of herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) infection of heterosexual men.

Design:

       A cross-sectional case-control study employing an anonymous
delinked interviewer-administered questionnaire, clinical examination,
and a type-specific serological test for HSV-2.  Participants and
setting: Three hundred consecutive heterosexual male patients at a
public sexually transmissible diseases (STD) clinic in Sydney, Australia.

Main outcome measures:

       Associations between serological evidence of HSV-2 infection
and history of genital herpes or contact with genital herpes, history
of other common STDs, and demographic and behavioural factors such as
age, education level, number of sexual partners and lack of circumcision.

Results:

       One hundred and ninety-four patients (64.7%) had antibodies to
HSV-2 but only 24% of these gave a history of genital herpes.  A
history of genital herpes or sexual contact with genital herpes,
reported total lifetime number of sexual partners, failure to complete
high school and a history of non-gonococcal urethritis or genital
warts were associated with serological evidence of HSV-2 infection at
the univariate level.  Neither increasing age nor lack of circumcision
was associated with HSV-2 infection.  Following multi-variate analysis
only the lifetime number of partners and failure to finish high
school were significantly strong predictors of HSV-2 infection.

Conclusion:

       This is the highest prevalence of HSV-2 infection ever detected
in an Australian population and one of the highest recorded globally.
As younger men were as commonly infected as older men, and an earlier
(1985) study involving the same clinic yielded a lower prevalence, it
appears that a high level of ongoing HSV-2 transmission is occurring
among Sydney heterosexuals.  Increased awareness of this fact could
enhance safer sex campaigns.

-------------------------------

       The most common cause of genital ulcers in developed nations is
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).[1]  As well as breaching the
epithelium HSV lesions are infiltrated with activated CD4+
lymphocytes,[2] a major target cell for HIV-1.  Prospective studies
have determined HSV-2 infection to be a risk factor for HIV-1
infection of homosexual men practicing receptive anal
intercourse.[3,4]  Heterosexual men with penile HSV-2 lesions could
also be at higher risk of acquiring HIV-l infection during unprotected
vaginal intercourse, as suggested by one cross-sectional study which
controlled for sexual preference and other risk factors but not for
number of sexual partners.[5]  Reliable type-specific serological
tests for HSV infection have recently become available which enable
the accurate determination of the epidemiology of HSV-2
infection.[6,7]  Thus, we sought to determine the risk factors for
HSV-2 infection in a population of heterosexual men attending a
sexually transmissible diseases (STD) clinic in Sydney.  We were
particularly interested in investigating any effect that the presence
of an intact foreskin might exert on acquiring HSV-2 infection, as a
previous Australian study had found a positive association.[8]
Participants and methods

       Expecting a lower HSV-2 seroprevalence rate than a study in the
same clinic in 1985,[9] we calculated that a sample size of over 270
was required to demonstrate a 50% protective effect from circumcision
with 80% power at the 5% significance level.  Thus, the study group
comprised 300 consecutive heterosexual male patients who saw a
particular clinician (I B) and required venopuncture for any other
purpose at the Sydney Sexual Health (previously STD) Centre, Sydney
Hospital, between December 1990 and May 1991.  Men who reported ever
having been homosexually active were excluded because HSV-2 infection
acquired by receptive anal intercourse could have affected our results.

       The aims of the study were explained to all subjects and
signed informed consent was obtained. There were no refusals. The
study was approved by the Eastern Sydney Area Health Service Research
Ethics Committee.

       A data collection form with an anonymous identifier code was
completed by the clinician, and an extra 5 ml of blood were collected
for the study.  The data collected included:

        Age.
        Level of education.
        Circumcision status (confirmed by physical examination).
        Past history of genital herpes or symptoms suggestive of
    genital herpes (undiagnosed genital ulcer or recurrent
genital lesions/itches).
        Other STDs.
        Lifetime number of sexual partners (women with whom they had
        had vaginal intercourse).
        Current clinical diagnoses were added to each subject's
        history of STDs on the data collection form.

       The serological analyses for HSV were performed at the Virology
Department Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Institute
for Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, on an
anonymous and blinded basis.

       As described elsewhere,[6] sera were screened for total HSV
antibody by a complement fixing antibody (HSV-CFA) test. Positive
specimens on HSV-CFA testing were then subject to an indirect IgG
enzyme immune assay (EIA) specific to the 92 kDa HSV-2 glycoprotein G
(gG-2).[6]  All 15 randomly selected sera that were positive for HSV-2
by EIA testing were confirmed by western blot[7] as having antibody to
the specific gG-2 glycoprotein.  Those samples that were positive for
total HSV antibody by CFA but negative to HSV-2 by EIA were assayed by
western blot for antibody to the HSV-1-specific 130 kDa gG-1 glycoprotein.[7]

       The X2 test was used for categorical variables and Student's
t test for continuous variables.  Variables of significance in
univariate analysis were entered into multivariate models. All t
values were two tailed and significance was set at the 5% level.

Results

       The patients were representative of the general clinical load
of exclusively heterosexual men at the Centre (over 95% of the men are
white, with most of the rest of Asian origin).  Their reasons for
attendance or diagnosis at the time of consultation are outlined in
the Box.  Only 14 participants (4.7%) attended because of a current
problem with genital herpes. HIV-1 infection is rare among
heterosexual men attending the Centre[10] and none of the subjects had
HIV-1 infection.  Two hundred and twenty-one men (73.7%) had positive
results of total HSV-CFA testing.  One hundred and ninety-four (64.7%)
had HSV-2 antibodies on eia testing, although only 46 (23.7%) of these
recorded a history of genital herpes.  Put in another way, of the 254
men never diagnosed with genital herpes, 148 (58.3%) were HSV-2
seropositive.  All 15 randomly selected sera that were positive for
HSV-2 gG-3 by eia were also positive for gG-2 by western blot,
confirming the specificity of the eia test as previously
reported.[6,7]  All of the 27 men who had positive results of total
HSV-CFA testing, but negative results for HSV-2 by eia testing, had
sera that reacted with the specific gG-1 (130 kDa) glycoprotein of
HSV-l and not the HSV-2-specific gG-2 (92 kDa) glycoprotein on western
blot assay.

Univariate analysis

       All of the 46 men who gave a history of genital herpes had
serological evidence of HSV-2 infection, again confirming the
sensitivity of the eia test.  On univariate analysis a past history of
nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), genital warts, genital herpes, and
known sexual contact with a woman with genital herpes, were associated
with the presence of HSV-2 antibodies (Table 1).

       Lower level of education (failure to complete high school) was
also associated with HSV-2 infection (Table 1).  Age, lack of
circumcision, or history of undiagnosed genital ulcer(s) or itches was
not associated with HSV-2 antibodies (Table 1).  Men with HSV-2
antibodies reported almost twice as many lifetime partners as men
without such antibodies (?= 0.014 [Table 1]).  The positive
correlation was also proportionate to lifetime number of sexual
partners - 48% of the 35 men with one to five partners rising to 100%
of 17 men with 41-50 partners had HSV-2 antibodies (Figure).  There
was a slightly, but not significantly, lower prevalence of HSV-2
antibodies among men reporting more than 50 lifetime partners compared
with those with 41-50 partners (Figure). The men with one to five
partners were not more likely to have a history of genital herpes or
contact with genital herpes than the group as a whole (data not
shown).  Other  STDs such as gonorrhoea, syphilis and hepatitis B were
reported too infrequently to determine any association with a positive
HSV-2 test.

Multivariate analysis

       Mantel-Haenszel estimates of odds ratio were calculated
(categories as in the Figure) after allowing for the effect of
lifetime number of sexual partners (Table 2).  After this
transformation, the positive association of HSV-2 seropositivity with
failure to finish high school remained significant, while the positive
association with a history of contact with genital herpes became only
marginally significant (P=0.067).  The associations of HSV-2
antibodies with a history of NGU and a history of genital warts lost
significance (Table 2).

       A multiple logistic regression model confirmed that the
associations of HSV-2 antibodies with NGU and genital warts were not
significant.  In models that included the log of lifetime number of
partners, completion of high school (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.92; P=0.031) and history of contact
with genital herpes (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.04-7.86; P= 0.042) remained
significant after allowing for each other.

Discussion

       The simple index of lifetime number of sexual partners used in
this study provided clear evidence of the sexual transmissibility of
HSV-2 infection.  Although starting from a high base (48% of men with
five or fewer partners were seropositive), the correlation between
number of sexual partners and HSV-2 infection was strong.  Previous
studies using other indices, e.g. years of sexual experience[11] and a
number of partners in the previous month,[11,12] also produced
significant trends.  However, lifetime number of sexual partners is a
crude index.  Most women with HSV-2 infection are asymptomatic.[13]
As HSV-2 is shed from the female genital tract intermittently,
repeated sexual exposure to a single asymptomatic partner with HSV-2
infection over several months or years could pose a greater cumulative
risk of acquiring HSV-2 than isolated encounters with many women.[14]
This could explain why HSV-2 infection was common in this study among
men with fewer partners.  Men with fewer partners may also have been
less likely to use condoms.  Similarly, it is possible that men with
very high numbers of partners may have been more likely to practice
safer sex, thus yielding the slightly lower prevalence of HSV-2
antibodies than men with intermediate numbers of partners.  As most of
these men began sexual activity before the safer sex campaigns, and
markers of HSV-2 infection are cumulative over time, data on the use
of safer sex were not collected in this study.

       Univariate associations between HSV-2 infection and NGU or
HSV-2 infection and genital warts may be attributable to these
diseases having the common risk factor of number of sexual partners.
This finding affirms that future studies of the role of genital herpes
as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection - or for any other STD - should
also control for numbers of sexual partners.

       The reduced correlation between HSV-2 infection and history
of sexual contact with genital herpes when the number of lifetime
sexual partners was taken into account may be due to awareness of
infection: possibly, with more partners there is a greater chance of
one of the female partners suffering symptoms and reporting it to the
man.  The high prevalence of HSV-2 infection (64.7%) detected in
the study group is remarkable and has rarely been exceeded even in STD
clinic studies.[1]  Although the study group was probably more
sexually active than the general population and, by attending an STD
clinic, was exhibiting concern about STDs, most men with HSV-2
infection reported no diagnosis or history of symptoms suggestive of
genital herpes.  While serological screening and closer clinical
scrutiny would probably increase the diagnostic yield, as with women
in STD clinics,[14] unrecognized genital herpes is clearly extremely
common and possibly increasing among multi-partnered heterosexual
men in Sydney.

       A previous survey of male and female patients from the same
clinic in 1985 revealed a seroprevalence of HSV-2 infection of 45%
(unpublished data) compared with an average of 40.6% in three STD
clinics surveyed in a later study using a slightly less sensitive
assay.[9]  The previous survey also included female prostitutes and
homosexually active men - groups that would be expected to have higher
prevalence rates of HSV-2 infection than heterosexual men.[1]
We were particularly concerned that 53% of men under the age of 25
years had evidence of HSV-2 infection despite most of their sexually
active lives coinciding with an era of public education about HIV-l
infection.  While female prostitutes in Sydney may have been able to
reduce the incidence of a "core group"-associated STD such as
gonorrhoea by using condoms,[15] when sex is not related to
prostitution there appears to be less acceptance of condoms.[16]
Although data on condom use were not collected in this study, our
findings suggest that safer sex was not the usual practice of these
young men.  Alternatively, the in-vitro efficacy of condoms[17]
translated poorly into in-vivo protection against HSV-2 infection.
Studies are needed of the in-vivo efficacy of condoms as protection
from genital herpes.

       The significance of the association between HSV-2 infection and
lower level of education is uncertain but has been noted
previously.[11]  One possibility is that this reflects factors
influencing partner selection.  Another is that lower education levels
indicate poor compliance with strategies for safer sex.  We have no
data to evaluate either hypothesis.

       Although not an objective of this study, given the apparent
greater efficiency of male-to-female transmission of genital HSV[18]
and higher prevalences of markers of HSV-2 infection in female
populations in the United States,[19] our results suggest even higher
rates of HSV2 infection in the female partners of these men.  Further
studies including women with multiple partners as well as
population-based seroprevalence studies are indicated.

       In contrast with previous studies,[8,20] we found no evidence
of the presence of an intact foreskin being a risk factor for HSV-2 infection.

       However, these earlier studies relied on the presence of
clinical lesions for the diagnosis of genital herpes and reported no
quantitative data on sexual behaviour.

       Increased efforts to control the spread of HSV-2 infection in
the community or to control the frequency of recurrences of genital
herpes lesions may be justified because of the direct morbidity of
HSV2 infection for adults[11] and neonates.  If genital herpes is
proven to be a cofactor for HIV-l transmission in the heterosexual
context, a "spin-off" could be a contribution to HIV-1 control.

       A screening program for HSV-2 infection would be resource
intensive and likely to have only a limited impact at a population
level, but it might raise the community awareness of STDs other than
HIV-l infection, and thus reinforce the need for safer sex.  It should
be a salutary lesson that, as a consequence of the singular attention
given to it, a recent survey of British teenagers found that most of
them thought that HIV-1 infection was the most common STD.[21]  Fewer
than half of a large sample of Australian Year 10-12 students listed
genital herpes as an STD.[22]  This study records one of the highest
prevalences of HSV-2 infection in the world, and the highest ever
detected in an Australian population.  A high level of ongoing HSV-2
transmission is apparent among Sydney heterosexuals.

       Increased awareness of this situation is necessary to
enhance safer sex campaigns.
