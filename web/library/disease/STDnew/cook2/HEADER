Abstract

Introduction - A recent study comparing heterosexual men with and without
confirmed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in an urban STD clinic
showed that uncircumcised men were less likely than circumcised men to have
genital wart detectable by clinical examination (adjusted odds ratio 0.7,
95% confidence interval 0.4, 0.9).  Based on these initial findings we
hypothesised that the appearance and anatomic distribution of genital
warts, and possibly treatment response, may be different for circumcised
and uncircumcised men.

Methods-The anatomic location, appearance, number of warts, and response to
treatment was investigated through review of medical records of 459
heterosexual men with genital warts detected in 1988.

Results-Age- and race-adjusted estimates indicated that among men with
genital warts, warts were detected much more commonly on the distal penis -
that is, the corona, frenulum, glans or urethrul meatus - among
uncircumcised men (26%) than among circumcised men (3%) (OR 10.0, 95% CI
3.9, 25.7).  Where the appearance was specified, warts were more often
described as condylomatous in uncircumcised men and slightiy more often as
papular in circumcised men.  No significant difference between circumcised
and uncircumcised men was seen in the number of return visits to the clinic
for persistent warts after treatment with liquid nitrogen: 2.2 visits for
19 uncircumcised men and 2.3 visits for 149 circumcised men.

Conclusion-Circumcised men were more likely than uncircumcised men to have
genital warts, but when present, warts were more often located on the
distal portion of the penis among uncircumcised men.  This paradox is not
understood, but could reflect either non-specific resistance to proximal
penile warts conferred by the foreskin, or heightened susceptibility to
various HPV types in uncircumcised men, some of which may confer subsequent
immunity to genital warts.

Introduction

Previous studies have suggested that genital warts occur more commonly
among uncircumcised men than among circumcised men.[1-3]  However, in a
recent study using the medical records of 2776 heterosexual men attending
the Seattle-King County Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic at Harborview
Medical Center, the prevalence of genital warts among cirucumcised men
(17.6%) exceeded that of uncircumcised men (11.0%, (p < 0.001).[4]  The
relationship persisted after adjusting for age, race, other STDs, place of
residence, and the number of sexual partners in the previous month Also,
circumcised men were more likely than uncircumcised men to report a history
of previous warts (12.9% vs 7%, p < 0.001). In contrast, uncircumcised men
were more likely to have syphilis (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.9. 8.4) and gonorrhea
(OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2, 2.2). Our results may differ from those of previous
studies because of our restriction to heterosexual men and our adjustment
for more confounding variables. In view of these results, the present
analysis was undertaken to characterise differences in the anatomic
location, appearance, number, and apparent treatment response of genital
warts based on circumcision status in this population.

Methods

       A review of heterosexual men seen in the Seattle-King County STD
clinic in Seattle, Washington from January 1988 to December 1988 identified
463 men diagnosed clinically with genital warts.  Details of this study
have been reported.[4]  Briefly, information was available on subject
demographic characteristics, symptoms, sexual history, prior STDs, and
clinical and laboratory diagnostic findings.  Circumcision status was
identified and recorded by the clinician.

       For the present study, the medical records of 459 of the 463 men
given a diagnosis of genital warts during 1988 were reviewed and
information was abstracted on the location, number, and appearance of the
exophytic warts (the medical records of four subjects were not available).
The location of warts was categorised as distal penis (including the glans,
coronal sulcus, urethral meatus, and frenulum), proximal penis (including
the shaft and base of the shaft), both (distal and proximal), other
(including scrotum, thighs, perianal area, and inguinal fold), or location
not recorded.  Four uncircumcised subjects had warts on the foreskin and
were excluded from the analysis.  Multiple locations that included sites
other than the penis were coded on the basis of the location of the penile
warts, that is, a subject with warts on the glans and the inguinal fold was
classified as distal penis.  The appearance of warts was categorised as
condylomatous papular other (verruca vulgaris), or appearance not recorded.
The number of warts was categorised in three groups: 1, >1, or number not recorded.

       Demographic and sexual characteristics of uncircumcised and
circumcised men were compared.  The number, anatomic distribution, and
appearance of genital warts was also compared based on circumcision status.
Among men with genital warts, age- and race-adjusted odds ratios relating
circumctsion status with the location, appearance, and number of warts were
calculated by logistic regression analysis.[5]  The response to treatment
could not formally be compared in circumcised and uncircumcised men; clinic
patients were generally advised to return for repeated treatment as long as
warts persisted, but complete follow-up of all 459 men until the warts had
resolved was not attempted by the clinic staff.  Therefore, as a surrogate
for treatment response, we compared the number of follow-up clinic visits
at which persistent warts were detected among the 345 men treated with
liquid nitrogen applications at the initial clinic visit.  All analyses
were done using SAS.

Results

       Among heterosexuals with genital warts (Table 1), circumcised men
were more likely than uncircumcised men to be 30 years or older, (33.7% vs
21.7%, p =0.05), white, (76.3% vs 45.7%, p < 0.007), and to report a
history of warts (39.5% vs 23.9%, p < 0.01). No major differences were
noted between cc groups with respect to the number of sexual partners in
the previous month, and approximately two-thirds of both groups reported
symptoms of genital lesions when specifically queried about lesions prior
to examination.  The figure shows that the penile shaft, including the base
of the shaft, was the most common location for genital warts in both
circumcised and uncircumcised men. However, circumcised men were more
likely to have warts in this location (77% vs 61%, p < 0.001), whereas
uncircumcised men were much more likely to have distal penile warts (26% vs
3%, p < 0.0001).  Age- and race-adjusted results (Table 2) comparing the
presence of distal penile warts wth proximal penile warts also indicate
that distal warts are more likely in uncircumcised men (OR 10.0, 95% CI
3.9, 25.7).  The presence of multiple wart lesions was unrelated to
circumcision status.  Condylomas were more likely than papules in
uncircumcised men (OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.8, 7.6), but the appearance of warts
was only specified for a small subset of subjects.

       Approximately 50% of uncircumcised and circumcised subjects
initially treated with liquid nitrogen for their genital warts did not
return to the clinic for follow-up visits (Table 3). Of those who returned,
the mean number of visits with warts detected was virtually identical
between circumcision groups: 2i2 visits for uncircumcised men and 2.3
visits for circumcised men.

Discussion

       This review of medical records of heterosexual men found to have
genital warts at our STD clinic in 1988 shows that warts were more likely
to be distal, and to have a condylomatous appearance, among uncircumcised
men than among circumcised men. However, the response of genital warts to
liquid nitrogen application appeared comparable in the two groups.

       In the present study, the foreskin itself was seldom affected, with
only four subjects having warts on the inner or outer surface of the
foreskin.  These four subjects were excluded from the analysis since
circumcised men do not have a comparable anatomic site at risk for
infection; their inclusion would have elevated the positive relationship
between uncircumcised status and distal penile warts.  A possible concern
is the higher proportion of circumcised men (9%), compared with
uncircumcised men (2%) who did not have the location of wart lesions
recorded in their medical record.  It could be argued that if most, or all,
of these circumcised men actually had distal warts, the positive
relationship between the presence of a foreskin and distal penile warts
would disappear.  However, even if we conservatively assume that all the
circumcised men with unspecified wart locations (n = 38) had distal penile
warts, there would still be a higher proportion of uncircumcised men with
genital warts on the distal penis (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2, 5.4).

       The relationship between the appearance of warts and circumcision
status in this population is consistent with a study from St. Thomas'
Hospital, which indicated that fleshy hyperplastic warts, or classic
venereal warts, were most common on the glans and the inner lining of the
foreskin among uncircumcised men.[3]  The anatomic distribution of genital
warts found in the present study, and in studies from St. Thomas'
Hospital[3] and the Mayo Clinic,[6] are compared in Table 4.  In contrast
to both the present study and the Mayo Clinic study, distal penile warts
were more common than proximal waits in the St Thomas' Hospital study. This
discrepancy could be due in part to the high percentage of men who were
uncircumcised in the St. Thomas' Hospital study (79%).

       In contrast to our findings, a Canadian Army study found that
uncircumcised status was more common among active duty men with warts than
among recruits without warts.[1]  However, differences between these two
groups of Canadian men in age, sexual activity, and other factors could
have strongly influenced the study results.  Age-adjusted analyses from the
Public Health Department Special Treatment Clinic in Perth, Australia,
suggested uncircumcised men were more likely than circumcised men to have
warts (OR 1-5, 95% CI 1-0, 2-4).[2] Discrepancies with our results could be
due to our restriction to heterosexual men, our adjustment for confounding
factors, and any systematic differences in health seeking behavior between
circumcised and uncircumcised men residing in the two countries.

       In summary, among heterosexual men at our STD clinic, uncircumcised
men had a lower prevalence of genital warts than circumcised men, yet when
warts occurred in uncircumcised men, they were more likely to be distal
warts under the foreskin.  It is possible that the less cornified
epithelium of the distal penis within the preputial sac has increased
susceptibility to HPV, including those types causing condylomas.  A higher
incidence of early subclinical, subpreputial HPV infection could promote
immunity to subsequent penile condylomata.  The series of men at our STD
clinic may include a high proportion who have already expericnced such an
infection and acquired some immunity.  Alternatively, the presence of the
foreskin may confer nonspecific protection of the proximal penis from
acquisition of HPV infection.

Center for their assistance.
