<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>
Recent publications have reported an association between the lack
of male circumcision and sexual transmission of HIV [1-7].  If
confirmed, such an association may prompt interest in a possible
intervention through male circumcision.
<P>
It has been suggested that following circumcision, the surface
epithelium of the glans develops a protective keratin layer, a form
of natural condom [8]. Thus, circumcision could reduce the HIV
incidence by directly decreasing the susceptibility of uninfected
men to HIV. Circumcision could also reduce the incidence of HIV by
directly decreasing the infectivity of men with HIV, as suggested
by the studies of tissue samples collected from macaques infected
with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which showed infected
mononuclear cells in the dermis and epidermis of the penile foreskin
[9].
<P>
Furthermore, some or all sexually transmitted diseases (STD) may
increase men's susceptibility to HIV [10,11]. If circumcision
reduces the transmission of genital infections, either by improving
local hygiene [12] or by accelerating the healing of otherwise
subpreputial lesions [13-15], circumcision may also delay HIV
transmission. Therefore, potential associations between the lack
of circumcision and STD other than HIV are also of interest.
<P>
In the past, circumcision has been advocated for many reasons: for
religious purposes among the Jews and Muslims; for cultural reasons
among several African ethnic groups; for reasons of hygiene in the
United States, Canada, and Australia and for therapeutic purposes---as
the cure for phimosis. consequently, circumcision is almost universal
in some parts of the world (United States and Muslim countries)
and rare in others (Europe and  South America). In all situations,
cultural differences between circumcised and uncircumcised men may
affect their sexual and hygienic behaviour, including their exposure
to various STD and HIV. 

<P>
In this article we review the evidence in support of the association
between the lack of circumcision and STD, including HIV infection,
and the possible biological explanations.  we discuss implications
for public-health interventions and suggest areas and methods for
further research.

<h3>Epidemiological evidence</h3>

<h4>Studies linking lack of circumcision to HIV infection</h4>

<P> Twenty-three published study reports linking circumcision status
to HIV infection were identified. The literature review included
articles using circumcision as a key word, articles analysing risk
factors for HIV infection and AIDS conference proceedings.
Unfortunately, one-third of these studies were reported in abstracts
with little detail. Four different study designs were used in these
studies as described below.

<h4>Retrospective studies including partner studies</h4>

<P> A number of reports of the association between HIV serostatus
and the lack of circumcision were initially provided by retrospective
studies. Most of these studies were not specifically designed to
test a hypothesis about circumcision.

<P> Six partner studies [3, 16-20] recruited heterosexual partners
of HIV-infected patients to look for an association between the
serostatus and circumcision status of the male partner. A significant
association was observed in three of the studies [3,16,17]
<A HREF="#table1">(Table 1)</A>.
 However, the results were reported in abstracts with few
methodological details.

<P> Differentiation between infectivity and susceptibility was
possible in only one study [18], which examined 109 female partners
of HIV-infected men in Brazil. No association was observed between
the lack of circumcision and male infectivity
<A HREF="#table1>(Table 1)</A>.

<P> Twelve retrospective studies [4-6, 21-29] recruited male
populations to look for risk factors for HIV infection
<A HREF="#table2">(Table 2)</A>.
Four[4,6,21,22] reported significant associations between the lack
of circumcision and an increased susceptibility to HIV infection
in men <A HREF="#table2">(Table 2)</A>. Of these,
only one was reported in a full paper
[4], which analysed data from 338 STD patients (11.2% infected with
HIV) believed to have acquired their STD [genital ulcer disease
(GUD) or urethritis] from a group of prostitutes known to have a
high prevalence of STD. After adjustments for regular contacts with
prostitutes and travels to neighbouring countries, uncircumcised
men were at a higher risk of HIV infection only if they did <I>not</I>
report a history of previous genital ulceration. Among those with
a history of genital ulceration, no effect of circumcision on HIV
status was observed.

<P> In another study where a marginal association was observed in
univariate analysis [23], only 20 men out of 610 were circumcised,
which may have led to the test's poor ability to derive a statistical
association (i.e. lack of statistical power)
<A HREF="#table2">(Table 2)</A>. Similarly,
Greenblatt <I>et al.</I> [24] studied the risk of HIV infection
among 115 men with GUD, an odds ratio (OR) of 3.3 was observed for
uncircumcised men in univariate analysis 
<A HREF="#table2">(Table 2)</A>. After adjustment
for age, number of partners, contacts with prostitutes, ethnic
origin and birth place, the authors reported a loss of statistical
significance without further details. However, it is not possible
to know if this was due to an appropriate adjustment on true
confounding factors or to a lack of statistical power because many
variables were included in the model.

<P> Five out of the above six studies [4,6,22-24] suggesting a
protective role of circumcision were conducted in African countries
and one in the United States [21]. An additional six studies by
three different teams working in Rwanda [25,26], Uganda [27] and
the United States [28,29] found no relationship between male
circumcision and HIV status.

<h4> Cross-sectional serosurveys</h4>
<P>
The Muslim religion was used as a surrogate marker for male
circumcision in two surveys performed in Uganda and C&#244;te d'Ivoire
[30,31]. In the first survey 4.5% (6 out of 133) of the Muslim men
were HIV-infected compared with 9.2% (153 out of 1663) from other
religious groups; while the difference was less important among
women (10.6% versus 12.6%). In the second survey `no relation
between the HIV-seroprevalence rates of Moslems who practised
circumcision and non-Moslems who are not circumcised were observed'.
None of these studies obtained individual foreskin status, nor
attempted to adjust for known risk factors for HIV.

<h4>Longitudinal study</h4>
Cameron <I>et al.</I> [5] examined the risk for seroconversion in
370 HIV-seronegative men who reported recent contacts with prostitutes
known to have high HIV infection rates. After a mean follow-up of
14 weeks for 293 men, the authors estimated that uncircumcised men
had 8.2 times [confidence interval (CI), 3.0-23.0] the risk of
acquiring HIV infection than circumcised men. There are several
methodological limitations in this analysis.
<P>
First, the proportion of circumcised men was higher among the 77
men lost to follow-up than among the 293 included in the analysis,
and selection bias may have occurred in this study [32]. Furthermore,
2 weeks of follow-up after the sexual exposure was considered an
adequate follow-up. Since the median seroconversion time is usually
assumed to be approximately 2 months, it is possible that a
substantial proportion of seroconversions was missed. If the
proportion of missed seroconversion was different among circumcised
and uncircumcised men, further bias may have been introduced.
<P>
Second, all documented seroconversions were attributed to an exposure
to the same group of prostitutes, including those occurring more
than 6 months after sexual contact with the prostitute. However,
seroconversions are very rare (<5%) after 6 months [33]. At the
3-month follow-up, only those uncircumcised men who had a reported
concomitant GUD were at increased risk of acquiring HIV. The
interaction between circumcision status and reported presence or
absence of genital ulcer disease was not taken into account in the
multivariate analysis (estimating an adjusted OR when the OR in
two different strata of a third variable are significantly different
may be invalid).
<P>
Third, only 25% of the men reported a single contact with a prostitute
during the study, among whom only six seroconversions occurred.
The statistical significance of the test (comparison of the
seroconversion rates between circumcised and uncircumcised men)
would disappear with the addition of a single seroconversion among
circumcised men.
<P>
These limitations, plus the fact that, to date, no other longitudinal
study has replicated similar results, call for serious caution in
the generalization of the results.


<h4>Ecological correlation</h4>
<P>
Two authors [1,2] reported a correlation between  estimated
geographical frequencies in the lack of circumcision  and estimated
HIV prevalence in Africa. In discussing the  limitations of such
correlations, the authors emphasized that  the high prevalence of
HIV infection in a given area may be due  to the early introduction
of the virus into the area, and not  necessarily to the relative
rarity of male circumcision. Ecological  correlations do not allow
other factors, such as sexual behaviour,  presence of other STD
and other risks for HIV, to be taken into  account. Moreover,
indices of HIV prevalence are very crude, as  well as data on
circumcision which were based on anthropological  studies written
between 1930 and 1950.
<P>
<h4>Studies linking lack of circumcision to STD other than HIV
infection</h4>
<P>
Only five studies [34-38] were specifically designed to assess the
association between selected STD and the lack of circumcision among
men attending STD clinics <A HREF="#table3">(Table 3)</A>.
 Only one [35] provided
age-adjusted OR, while four reported crude measurements of risk.
Three other authors reported results from studies not specifically
designed to quantify the association between the lack of circumcision
and men's susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections
[21,39,40]. Fortunately, available data on the circumcision status
of men and infections/inflammatory penile lesions were analysed.
As illustrated in <A HREF="#table3">Table 3</A>,
 the magnitude of the association between
different STD and lack of circumcision, when present, is highly
variable.
<P>
GUD, mainly chancroid, were associated with the lack of circumcision
in three studies of patients from an STD clinic on Nairobi, Kenya
[4,5,41]. In two studies data involving patients reporting for
other STD as a control group allow the calculation of relative
risks of 1.8 [confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.6] for past history
of GUD [4], and 1.6 (CI, 1.30-2.0) for present diagnosis of GUD
[5]. Other authors reported that they found less circumcised men
among patients with GUD than expected, given the frequency of
circumcision in the local population [42,43].

<h3>Interpreting the data: faith or evidence?</h3>

Several considerations apply for the interpretation of the current
evidence relating STD and HIV to the lack of circumcision.

<h4>Susceptibility versus infectivity</h4>

<P>
Interpreting the evidence requires a distinction between susceptibility
and infectivity. Only one partner study [18] allowed the analysis
of a potential association between the infectivity of HIV-infected
men and the lack of circumcision <A HREF="#table1">(Table 1)</A>.
In the other partner
studies, the distinction between infective and susceptible men was
not performed. If the lack of circumcision increased male susceptibility
or infectivity but not both, mixing data on male-to-female and
female-to-male transmission would lead to dilution bias because of
the lack of specificity in the recorded cases of transmission
(whatever the direction), whereas only cases of female-to-male
transmission (for the study of male susceptibility) or only cases
of male-to-female transmission (for the study of male infectivity)
are of interest.
<P>
Studies of STD other than HIV were performed on men only. In these
studies, positive associations have always been related to an
increased susceptibility to STD for uncircumcised men. However,
for some STD such as herpes, infection might have occurred a long
time before data collection. The study of men's susceptibility
ideally requires the inclusion of new infections only.
<P>
On the other hand, the portal of entry for pathogens and the type
of clinical presentation vary according to the STD under study.
The former may influence the mechanisms of sexual transmission and
the potential role of circumcision. It is unclear what the portal
of entry is for HIV, but for pathogens responsible for GUD and
balanitis the portal of entry and the location of symptoms is the
external epithelium of the penis (shaft, glans and foreskin). An
attempt should be made to distinguish two different potential
mechanisms of association between GUD and/or balanitis and the lack
of circumcision: differential recovery from genital symptoms or
differential susceptibility to infection.

<h4>Assessment of behaviours and adjustment for confounding</h4>

<P> The main limitation to interpreting most results is the poor
assessment of sexual behaviour and other potential confounders,
such as hygienic practices between circumcised and uncircumcised
men. Circumcision in Africa, where the majority of the studies on
risk factors for HIV infection have been conducted, is highly
related to religious and ethnic characteristics. It is possible
that ethnic groups performing ritual circumcision have different
sexual behaviours from those who do not, and therefore, different
risks of being infected with HIV, due to factors other than
circumcision status. An attempt to adjust for potential confounding
factors related to sexual behaviour was made in only four studies
searching for risk factors for HIV infection [4,5,17,24]. In such
circumstances, alternative explanations for observed associations
between circumcision status and HIV infection can hardly be excluded.

<h4>Selection bias</h4>

<P>
The comparison groups (men without STD under study) should be
exposed to STD agents in a similar manner as the group with STD to
infer any causal association. This was attempted only in the Kenyan
studies [4,5], where cases and non-cases were exposed to the same
group of prostitutes with high HIV infection rate.

<P>
Most of the studies, conducted among STD clinic attenders, assumed
that circumcised and uncircumcised men used these health facilities
in the same way, but socioeconomic and cultural factors may differ
between the two groups. It is possible that circumcised men seek
care in circumstances different from uncircumcised men; for example,
in cases of severe genital symptoms such as GUD, for any minor
symptom, or for an `at risk' sexual contact even without symptoms.
Of circumcised men are overrepresented among patients with minor
symptoms (who often serve as controls), the association between
the lack of circumcision and STD would be overestimated if not
spuriously generated.

<h4>Misclassification of exposure</h4>

<P>
In many studies, men's circumcision status was assessed by physical
examination. In a few studies, assessment of circumcision status
was not specified or relied on self-report. Only two authors studied
the reliability of self-reports. Among 1304 Australian men [35],
98.% gave an accurate report of their circumcision status, whereas
in the United States [28], 17.7% of uncircumcised men and 8.4% of
circumcised men misclassified themselves. The potential effects of
differential and non-differential misclassification on epidemiological
associations have been illustrated elsewhere [44].

<h4>Measure of association</h4>

OR and their CI were usually reported to measure the association
between the lack of circumcision and HIV infection. However, relative
risks (RR) always provide lower estimates of association. From one
Kenyan cross-sectional study [6] the adjusted OR is equal to 5.2
(CI, 1.6-18.8) but the RR is 3.5 (CI, 2.6-4.8). Since the magnitude
of the measure of association enforces the presumption for causality,
the use of OR, when it overestimates the RR, may be misleading
toward causality.

<h4>Publication bias</h4>

<P>
Researchers whose studies show `no effect' either do not submit
their results, or find it difficult to get published [45]. Such a
bias is not confined to an examination of circumcision and HIV
status, but cannot be excluded since the present article relies on
published reports.

<P>
In summary, lack of distinction between susceptibility and infectivity,
inadequate control for confounding variables, potential selection
bias and misclassification of exposure, inappropriate choice of a
comparison group, and publication bias may lead to under- or
overestimation of the association. It is difficult to predict the
net effect of these sources of bias. Furthermore, the magnitude of
the association, when present, varies strongly between studies and
its crude measure is overestimated in some reports by the use of
OR instead of RR. The results of observational studies conducted
to date, therefore, require cautions interpretation, and one has
to find the middle ground between faith and evidence.

<HR>
<h3>Implications for public-health interventions</h3>

<P>
Assuming that there is an association between circumcision and HIV
transmission, the magnitude of the benefit should be balanced with
the expected medical complications, the acceptability and the cost
of the medical intervention before any public-health decision can
be reached. A wide range of decisions are possible ranging from
maintaining the practice wherever it already exists to advocating
wide-spread mass circumcision.

<P>
Male circumcision is not without medical side-effects; with regard
to newborn circumcision, septic complications may occur in poor
hygienic settings, although to our knowledge no systematic data
has been collected. Complications are likely to be even more
problematic in adolescent and adult circumcision, possibly causing
pain, haemorrhage, and healing problems. Thus, adult and, in some
settings, newborn circumcision may generate more harm than benefit.
The onus is therefore to produce adequate evidence of safety before
a supposedly protective intervention is implemented [46].

<P> For the reasons discussed above, the quantification of a
potential benefit, if any, that could be expected from male
circumcision vis &#224; vis HIV transmission, is highly problematic.
The lack of consistency between results, the limitations of studies
reported to date, the critical time lag between large-scale
implementation of circumcision and any measurable effect, and more
decisively, the lack of a coherent model for the facilitation of
HIV transmission in uncircumcised men make attempts to calculate
attributable risks in different populations rather inaccurate.

<P> Besides potential benefits to be obtained and the safety of a
public-health intervention, it is important not only to examine
its acceptability and feasibility, but also to compare these
characteristics with those of alternative interventions. The
acceptability of a new surgical intervention on the male reproductive
tract is likely to be problematic in settings where the religious
and sociocultural context usually outweighs public-health
considerations. Behavioural changes, at least as important as those
required for the adoption of condoms, and a general shift in social
norms will clearly be required to introduce male circumcision as
a new general practice. Furthermore, operational requirements needed
to introduce neonatal, adolescent or adult circumcision are likely
to be considerable. In many cases, such undertaking will require
mass communication programmes for public education, training of
overburdened health-care personnel, and supplies necessary for the
surgical procedure.

<P>Given limited public-health resources, the ratio of benefits
and costs and the range of culturally acceptable alternative
interventions, such as condom promotion for the control of HIV and
STD, have to be considered in each setting.

<h3>Proposal for future research</h3>

<P>
In addition to differentiating susceptibility from infectivity,
and assessing a potential indirect mechanism through which lack of
circumcision could enhance HIV transmission via increased rates or
duration of STD, it is necessary to consider potential confounding
factors. Clearly, an association between circumcision status and
HIV infection may result, in whole or in part, from their mutual
dependence on patterns of sexual activity or, for instance, on
hygienic behaviours. To our knowledge no systematic data have been
collected on the latter in order to establish possible differences
between circumcised and uncircumcised men. However, anecdotal
evidence suggest that such differences may exist in some cultural
contexts, as indicated in a recent study of urban men in Rwanda
[47].

<P>
<IMG SRC="vincenzi-fig1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Figure 1">
Figure 1 illustrates some of the possible mechanisms through which
the lack of circumcision could operate for the facilitation of HIV
transmission. Based on our present knowledge, research priorities
might focus on a better understanding of the biological mechanisms
through which the lack of circumcision could enhance STD and HIV
transmission. Animal and primate research could assist in this
endeavour. Studies of the association between circumcision status
and sexual and hygienic behaviours in different populations, using
both quantitative and qualitative methods, should highlight the
strength of potential confounding effects.

<P>
Among the sexually acquired diseases that need further study of
their potential association with circumcision, priority should be
given to GUD for several rasons. First, previous studies provide
more arguments for an association between the lack of circumcision
and GUD than between the lack of circumcision and urethritis.
Second, a potential association between the lack of circumcision
and duration of genital symptoms might be stronger for GUD than
for urethritis. Third, one of the mechanisms through which a
potential association between the lack of circumcision and HIV
infection could operate is a suspected association between GUD and
HIV infection. The assessment of an indirect effect requires the
assessment of the two underlying direct effects (lack of circumcision
--&gt; GUD, and GUD --&gt; HIV). Simultaneously obtaining both
assessments within the same study would probably be difficult.
Fourth, GUD are more common than HIV infection in some parts of
the world. recruitment of cases may therefore be easier to determine
for GUD than for HIV infection.

<P>
Most of the published reports of epidemiological  studies rely on
data retrospectively recorded from STD clinic attenders. Seeking
medical care may be related to sociocultural variables and severity
of symptoms, both of which may be related to circumcision. In
particular, the sociocultural and behavioural background of men
without STD in these settings might be different from those with
a STD. Other male population groups, such as employees in a factory,
would be interesting to study. As STD prevalence in these populations
may be low, large study samples may be needed to allow the
identification of risk factors for STD acquisition.

<P>
Case-control studies allow a more careful choice of controls than
cross-sectional studies. Controls should be chosen as individuals
without STD but who are exposed to STD as are the cases. Cases and
controls should have similar sexual behaviours during the investigated
period, including the number and type of partners, condom use and
frequency of sexual contacts. The recruitment of male partners of
women diagnosed with the STD under study may help to control that
men with and without the STD were exposed to the pathogen.

<P>
Longitudinal studies imply the prospective followup of circumcised
and uncircumcised men who were equally exposed to STD/HIV, and a
complete recording of each STD/HIV occurrence. Results of such
studies are reliable only if the follow-up is achievable for almost
all individuals included.

<P>
Intervention studies would imply mass circumcision in well-defined
male populations, and the evaluation of the potential benefits for
these populations (and their partners) in terms of avoided infections.
Following newborn circumcision, the important time-lag between
implementation and its measurable impact (if any) will complicate
the conduct of such studies. If a causal link exists, adolescent
and adult circumcisions may delay the spread of HIV infection more
immediately than newborn circumcision. However, for the reasons
discussed above, it is suggested that such studies be discouraged.

<HR>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<P>
The potential public-health benefits of male circumcision have been
greatly discussed in the past 50 years, often in a passionate and
emotional manner. However, relatively few studies have been carried
out and those that have, present conflicting results. The major
criticism of most of the studies preformed to date is the lack of
attention given to potential confounding factors, which could be
related to both circumcision status and risk of sexually transmitted
infections, such as sexual behaviour or differences in hygienic
practices, or differential use of specific health facilities. As
Poland [48] noted, "We must remember that circumcision is not
performed randomly."
<P>
Therefore, further efforts are still required to quantify the
relative risk associated with the lack of male circumcision. Some
of this can be achieved by using observational designs which better
address the limitations discussed above. Laboratory and primate
research might also continue to provide useful information. 
<P>
As the safety, expected benefits, feasibility and acceptability of
mass circumcision are all questionable, neither public-health
interventions nor intervention studies appear to be defensible
options before there is stronger evidence from observational studies
in different settings that show lack of male circumcision may be
a genuinely independent risk factor for the transmission of HIV.
