      <p>Abstract:</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To determine baseline HIV prevalence in
      a trial of improved sexually transmitted disease (STD)
      treatment, and to investigate risk factors for HIV. To assess
      comparability of intervention and comparison communities with
      respect to HIV/STD prevalence and risk factors. To assess
      adequacy of sample size.</p>

      <p><b>SETTING:</b> Twelve communities in Mwanza Region,
      Tanzania: one matched pair of roadside communities, four
      pairs of rural communities, and one pair of island
      communities. One community from each pair was randomly
      allocated to receive the STD intervention following the
      baseline survey.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Approximately 1000 adults aged 15-54 years
      were randomly sampled from each community. Subjects were
      interviewed, and HIV and syphilis serology performed. Men
      with a positive leucocyte esterase dipstick test on urine, or
      reporting a current STD, were tested for urethral
      infections.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> A total of 12,534 adults were enrolled.
      Baseline HIV prevalences were 7.7% (roadside), 3.8% (rural)
      and 1.8% (islands). Associations were observed with marital
      status, injections, education, travel, history of STD and
      syphilis serology. Prevalence was higher in circumcised men,
      but not significantly after adjusting for confounders.
      Intervention and comparison communities were similar in the
      prevalence of HIV (3.8 versus 4.4%), active syphilis (8.7
      versus 8.2%), and most recorded risk factors. Within-pair
      variability in HIV prevalence was close to the value assumed
      for sample size calculations.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The trial cohort was successfully
      established. Comparability of intervention and comparison
      communities at baseline was confirmed for most factors.
      Matching appears to have achieved a trial of adequate sample
      size. <span class="yellow">The apparent lack of a protective
      effect of male circumcision contrasts with other studies in
      Africa.</span></p>
