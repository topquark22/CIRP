      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To establish the prevalence of "dry
      sex" practice in a South African periurban population. To
      investigate the reasons for and factors influencing the
      practice of dry sex and to evaluate dry sex practice as a
      risk factor for sexually transmitted disease (STD).</p>

      <p><b>DESIGN:</b> Cross sectional sample survey.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> A random community sample of men and women
      aged between 16 and 35 in Gauteng Province, South Africa,
      were interviewed regarding the practice of dry sex using a
      structured interviewer administered questionnaire.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> <span class="yellow">Dry sex practices
      were reported by 60% of men and 46% of women.</span> Among
      younger individuals dry sex practice is far more common among
      the less educated, but there was no significant difference
      between education groups in the older respondents. A higher
      proportion of men practising dry sex than not practising dry
      sex reported having a past history of STD infection (56%
      versus 41%) although this difference was only marginally
      significant (p = 0.05). There was no difference in reported
      history of STD between women who practised dry sex and those
      who did not.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> This study shows that dry sex practice
      is common in this community. The younger less educated group
      were the most likely to practise dry sex. <span
      class="yellow">Dry sex practice was associated with an
      increased prevalence of self reported STDs in men</span> but
      not in women.</p>
