      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To review the scientific data on the
      role of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in sexual
      transmission of HIV infection and discuss the implications of
      these findings for HIV and STD prevention policy and
      practice.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Articles were selected from a review of
      Medline, accessed with the OVID search engine. The search
      covered articles from January 1987 to September 1998 and
      yielded 2101 articles. Methods used to uncover articles which
      might have been missed included searching for related
      articles by author, and combing literature reviews. In
      addition, all abstracts under the category "sexually
      transmitted diseases" from the XI and XII International
      Conferences on AIDS (Vancouver 1996 and Geneva 1998) and
      other relevant scientific meetings were reviewed. Efforts
      were made to locate journal articles which resulted from the
      research reported in the identified abstracts. All original
      journal articles and abstracts which met one of the following
      criteria were included:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>studies of the biological plausibility or mechanism of
        facilitation of HIV infectiousness or susceptibility by
        STDs;</li>

        <li>prospective cohort studies (longitudinal or nested
        case-control) which estimate the risk of HIV infection
        associated with specific STDs or STD syndromes, or</li>

        <li>intervention studies which quantitate the effect which
        STD treatment can have on HIV incidence.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Strong evidence indicates that both
      ulcerative and non-ulcerative STDs promote HIV transmission
      by augmenting HIV infectiousness and HIV susceptibility via a
      variety of biological mechanisms. These effects are reflected
      in the risk estimates found in numerous prospective studies
      from four continents which range from 2.0 to 23.5, with most
      clustering between 2 and 5. The relative importance of
      ulcerative and non-ulcerative STDs appears to be complex.
      Owing to the greater frequency of non-ulcerative STDs in many
      populations, these infections may be responsible for more HIV
      transmission than genital ulcers. However, the limited
      reciprocal impact of HIV infection on non-ulcerative STDs and
      the evidence that non-ulcerative STDs may increase risk
      primarily for the receptive partner (rather than
      bidirectionally) may modulate the impact of these diseases.
      The results of two community level randomised, controlled
      intervention trials conducted in Africa suggest that timely
      provision of STD services can substantially reduce HIV
      incidence, but raise additional questions about the optimal
      way to target and implement these services to achieve the
      greatest effect on HIV transmission.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Available data
      leave little doubt that other STDs facilitate HIV
      transmission through direct, biological mechanisms and that
      early STD treatment should be part of a high quality,
      comprehensive HIV prevention strategy.</span> Policy makers,
      HIV prevention programme managers, and providers should focus
      initial implementation efforts on three key areas:</p>

      <ol class="roman">
        <li>improving access to and quality of STD clinical
        services;</li>

        <li>promoting early and effective STD related healthcare
        behaviours; and</li>

        <li>establishing surveillance systems to monitor STD and
        HIV trends and their interrelations.</li>
      </ol>
