      <h2>Circumcision for HIV Prevention: Failure to Fully Account
      for Behavioral Risk Compensation</h2>

      <p class="plosauthor"><b>Seth Kalichman, Lisa Eaton, Steven
      Pinkerton</b></p>

      <p class="plos">Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of
      male circumcision (MC) have been halted when interim analyses
      showed signi. cant reductions in HIV infection among men who
      received this intervention [<a href="#n1">1&ndash;3</a>].
      Modeling suggests that increased MC coverage in southern
      Africa could prevent as many as 2 million HIV infections over
      ten years [<a href="#n4">4</a>]. Moreover, the
      cost-effectiveness analysis by Kahn et al. recently published
      in PLoS Medicine indicates that MC could be cost-saving [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>]. However, the protection of MC may be
      partially offset by increased HIV risk behavior, or
      &ldquo;risk compensation,&rdquo; especially reduction in
      condom use or increases in numbers of sex partners. Risk
      compensation occurs when individuals adjust their behavior in
      response to perceived changes in their vulnerability to a
      disease [<a href="#n6">6</a>]. Risk compensation may be
      especially important for MC because avoiding the sexual
      dissatisfactions of condom use and the desire to have more
      sex partners are likely to be significant motivations for men
      to seek circumcision [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. In South Africa,
      73% of men between the ages of 15 and 24 report using condoms
      during the last time they had sex [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. It
      is dif. cult to imagine a convincing public health message
      that effectively in. uences men to undergo circumcision and
      continue to consistently use condoms.</p>

      <p class="plos">Circumcised men in the ANRS 1265 trial
      reported 18% more sexual contacts at follow-up than did
      uncircumcised men, but no other sexual behavior differences
      were obtained [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. However, for ethical
      reasons all men in MC RCTs receive ongoing risk-reduction
      counseling and free condoms, which reduces the utility of
      these trials for estimating the potential behavioral impact
      of MC when implemented in a natural setting. One model of the
      potential impact of MC did not take into account risk
      compensation [<a href="#n4">4</a>], but noted that
      &ldquo;increases in risk-taking behaviour among circumcised
      men could reduce the bene. t of MC.&rdquo; Based on the 18%
      difference in sexual contacts for circumcised and
      uncircumcised men in the ANRS 1265 trial and the assumption
      that &ldquo;risk compensation might be higher in a
      nonresearch program scale-up,&rdquo; Kahn et al. [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>] adjusted the 60% effectiveness estimate
      obtained in this RCT downward to 50% to re. ect a 25%
      increase in sexual risk behaviors among circumcised men.
      Although Kahn et al.&rsquo;s model explicitly incorporated
      the increased risk of HIV acquisition associated with risk
      compensation, it did not consider the impact of risk
      compensation on the HIV transmission risk of HIV-infected
      circumcised men, or on circumcised men&rsquo;s risk for
      non-HIV sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</p>

      <p class="plos">There is no evidence that circumcision
      increases or decreases the risk of HIV transmission by
      HIV-infected men. However, risk compensation by HIV-infected
      circumcised men will substantially increase the risk of
      transmission to their sex partners. This suggests that, in
      the short term at least, circumcision would reduce the
      incidence of HIV among men, but increase the incidence among
      women, translating to increased prevalence among women, which
      in turn translates to greater risk to men. Epidemiological
      models of MC should take this dynamic into account.</p>

      <p class="plos">Countless studies have shown that ulcerative
      and nonulcerative STIs account for at least some of the rapid
      increases in HIV transmission in southern Africa [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>]. Non-HIV STIs are associated with a 2- to
      5-fold increase in HIV transmission risk in countries with
      low and high rates of MC [<a href="#n9">9</a>]. In areas with
      prevalent STIs, the relative increase in men&rsquo;s
      STI-associated HIV risk can be as high as 60% to 340% [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]. Circumcision likely reduces the risk of
      acquiring a non-HIV STI and may be partially responsible for
      the decreased HIV risk observed in circumcision RCTs [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. Nevertheless, the failure of models to
      account for increased STI risk due to risk compensation
      likely inflates estimates of averted HIV infections.
      Estimates of HIV risks resulting from increased exposure to
      STIs that coincide with reductions in condom use have been
      included in previous models of the cost-effectiveness of HIV
      prevention interventions [<a href="#n11">11</a>] and should
      be included in MC models.</p>
