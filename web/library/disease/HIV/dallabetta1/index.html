      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To assess the prevalence of traditional
      vaginal agent use in Malawian women and its association with
      HIV infection.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Consenting, consecutive antenatal women
      were administered a questionnaire and screened for sexually
      transmitted diseases (STD) including HIV.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Of the 6603 consenting women, 886 (13%)
      reported using intravaginal agents for tightening and 2222
      (34%) for self-treatment of vaginal discharge and itching. A
      higher proportion of HIV-infected than uninfected women (17%
      versus 14%) reported use of intravaginal agents for treatment
      (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.57), but
      no difference in HIV status was found when these agents were
      used for tightening. In multivariate analysis, vaginal agent
      use for treatment was independently associated with HIV
      seropositivity.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">The association
      of HIV infection with vaginal agents for self-treatment, but
      not for tightening, suggests that STD may play a role or that
      vaginal agents are used differently for the two purposes. In
      addition to a small increased risk of HIV infection
      associated with vaginal agent use, these agents may interfere
      with condom effectiveness or acceptability of vaginal
      microbicides.</span></p>
